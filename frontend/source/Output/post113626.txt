Capturing text with a bookmarklet in IOS7 <body> Is it possible to capture text from Safari using a bookmarklet on an iPod Touch/iPhone when running iOS7?   In iOS6 I could select text, and then open a bookmarklet (like this one for example) which grabbed the text using codewindow.getSelection()/code.  However, it seems in iOS7, any action to invoke a bookmarklet deselects the text. Am I just missing something, or is this broken?   <answer113641> AFAIK it's no longer possible.  Tried looking at the contents of codewindow.getSelection()/code by remote debugging my iPhone through Safari. Text is indeed deselected. But even visually, I'm able to see that text is deselected when you tap a link or open the bookmarks menu.  In regards to describing this as em"broken"/em, I suppose it's a matter of how you look at it. It could be argued that deselecting is the emcorrect/em behavior and therefore I doubt it's something that'll get "fixed".   <comment133338> I thought so. Perhaps later in the month when I have a little more time I'll file a radar... not today alas. <comment133341> Nice work both of you - it's a pretty ugly regression so if someone files a radar, pls post it here and I'll gladly dupe it. <comment133417> @bmike Submitted as radar 15656765 -- https://gist.github.com/mgaudet/7947377 <comment133422> @MatthewG. Perfect. Dupe is at http://www.openradar.me/15656950 and also check out http://www.quickradar.com if you're so inclined. <comment133450> @bmike looks cool: Bookmarked. If I ever get off my butt and start doing development on apple platforms, it'll come in handy. <comment133451> @bmike Yeah, nifty utility!
