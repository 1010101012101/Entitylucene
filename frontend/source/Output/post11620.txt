What does the "Stationery Pad" option do? <body> Under the codeGeneral/code section of a file's File Info, there is a checkbox for codeStationery Pad/code and codeLocked/code. The codeLocked/code option is pretty straightforward, but what does codeStationery Pad/code do?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/EHXbE.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer11621> Basically, it tells an app opening the file to open a copy.  You do this on files that you want to use like templates. Since the app is given a copy, you'll never accidentally change the original. brBasically, it automatically copies the file into its original location (as 'emname/em copy') and lets you work on the copy.  <comment12162> I have absolutely no idea what I should tag this, so if anybody has a better suggestion, feel free to change it. <comment12207> Funnily enough, if I translate the text used by that option in the Finnish OS X to English, it's roughly "Work template". I think even just "template" would describe the option better than "stationery pad" <comment53498> This is a really nice OS feature. Just discovered its use. No need for complex /template folders and duplicate files everywhere. Just a master for each type and copies made as needed. Surprised not to hear of this more. <comment205250> Just for a reference, this question is answered at http://superuser.com/questions/96245/what-is-the-stationery-pad-setting-in-os-x-finder
