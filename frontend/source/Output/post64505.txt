How can I keep my Mountain Lion MacBook Pro display at maximum brightness? <body> I have periodically noticed that my display has been a bit dim, and have brought it up to maximum brightness... only later to find that my display was about halfway on brightness. I can't rule out a stray keystroke, but it seems to be several notches down a lot more often than I would accidentally hit F1. As far as I can tell this happens when the computer remains on and I remain logged on.  Especially when operating on battery power, does Mountain Lion dim the display automatically? Is there a way to turn off or circumvent this?  <answer64512> When you go from mains power to battery, OS X decreases display brightness. (It should go back to normal brightness when you reconnect to mains power.)  To turn this off, go to System Preferences  Energy Saver, choose the Battery tab, and un-check "Slightly dim the display when using this power source".  The display can also change brightness because it senses a change in ambient brightness. To turn this off, go to System Preferences  Displays, find the window on the display you want to change this setting on, go to the Displays tab, and un-check "Automatically adjust brightness".  <comment75764> I actually find the opposite frustrating: I typically use my computers at near-minimum brightness and it's very annoying when I reconnect to power or go into a bright room and the display is suddenly blaring with light.
