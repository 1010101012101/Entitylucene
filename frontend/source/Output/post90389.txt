Mac Osx 10.8.3 Shares Big problems <body> I'm tryng to share folders from an 10.8.3 imac to users in my LAN (using bot mac and windows) I'm having this problem:  1) Mac users can access the share using afp:// but   when they create new folders the permission are: drwxr-xr-x so no other can write those folders  2) PC users can access the share using smb:// but  when they create new folders the permission are: drwx------ so no other can read/write/execute  all user belong to the same group and the shared folders are owned by that group  hr  I have create a file /etc/launchd.conf with umask 002 reboot but nothing has changed  I THOUGHT THAT MAKING SHARES IN MAC SHOULD BE EASY BUT IT SEEMS SOO HARD :-)  <comment106085> 1) is the expected way for OSX - how are Windows users mapped to OSX users on the server and how are the shares made and setup? <comment106088> HI, I have created all the single users and a group from control panel (for users I have selected "only for sharing" type. Then created the folders and used osx control panel "file sharing" feature. Also I have changed the owner of the folder to the group. <comment106103> You need to use an access control list for this -- see [this previous question](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/31438/how-do-i-use-chmod-on-a-mac-to-make-new-files-inherit-parent-directory-permissio)
