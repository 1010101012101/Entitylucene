Moving a folder with "sudo mv", how to preserve ACLs? <body> I'm moving a whole folder from one volume to another (both HFS+), using codesudo mv/code, and thought ACLs would be preserved. However at the end of transfer I see that they haven't been kept, and since mv deleted the files in the original volume I can't restore them.  Why did this happen, and how to do it right next time?  <answer72923> codemv/code uses codecp/code when moving files between different volumes, and it looks like the code-p/code option isn't used, so ACL aren't preserved.  However if moved in the same volume ACLs are of course preserved.  <answer72924> It would be better to use the codeditto/code command since it is aware of resource forks, HFS attributes as well as ACL. You can alias it or just rewitpre your brain to use ditto as best fits your workflow.   <answer72932> I'm quite suprised to read that ACLs weren't preserved. Do you have strongGNU codemv/code/strong installed and set to take precedence over code/bin/mv/code?  According to the man page for codemv/code (on both 10.5.8 and 10.8.2) codecp -p/code is used when moving files across a filesystem boundary:     As the rename(2) call does not work across file systems, mv uses cp(1)   and rm(1) to accomplish the move.  The effect is equivalent to:      coderm -f destination_path &amp;&amp; cp/codestrong-pRP/strongcodesource_file destination &amp;&amp; rm -rf source_file/code   codecp -p/code preserves ACLs:     -p    Cause cp to preserve the following attributes of each source   file       in the copy: modification time, access time, file flags, file              mode, user ID, and group ID, as allowed by permissions.  strongAccess Control Lists (ACLs) and Extended Attributes (EAs), including              resource forks, will also be preserved./strong   I moved a file to a flash drive and back with codemv/code and ACLs were preserved (tested on my old PowerBook running Mac OS X 10.5.8 "Leopard" and with OS X 10.8.2 "Mountain Lion").  If both filesystems were HFS+ formatted, as you state, and there is no GNU codemv/code around, I have to conclude that you are using some (very) old Mac OS X version. In that case either use the Finder, codecp/code/coderm/code or, as explained in bmike's answer above, codeditto/code.  <comment84763> I'll try to find the time to reproduce; I'm no Lion server 10.7.5, and I don't think it's GNU mv but will check soon
