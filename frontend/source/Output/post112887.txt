Unix command to recursively copy JPG files in a complex directory tree <body> I have a large directory tree structure that contains multiple JPG files in each directory root and their subsequent subdirectories. I need to recursively extract a single JPG file from each directory root and copy them all to another location whilst maintaining the same tree structure and ignoring the other files. The JPG filenames that I need to extract all are tagged with "RNav.jpg". I experimented with the cp command and wild card but I could not get it to work. I'm running Mavericks and I'm a novice when it comes to UNIX command-lines.  The existing structure is as follows: (up to 500 directories)  ul liVNAME/PNAME1/PNAME1_RNav.jpg/li liVNAME/PNAME2/PNAME2_RNav.jpg/li liVNAME/PNAME3/PNAME3_RNav.jpg/li liVNAME/PNAME4/PNAME4_RNav.jpg/li /ul  <answer112888> You can easily use rsync to accomplish this:  precodersync --include "*/" --include "*RNav.jpg" --exclude "*" -am source destination /code/pre  Based off this page. This includes folders and *RNav.jpg files and then excludes everything else. I've used -a instead of -r to preserve more information (my personal preference) and added -m to prevent rsync from creating any parts of the directory tree that wouldn't contain any files.  <answer112941> You can also use codersync -R/code (code--relative/code) or code--parents/code in GNU cp:  precodersync -R */*/*.RNav.jpg /path/to/target gcp --parents */*/*RNav.jpg /path/to/target find . -name \*RNav.jpg -exec rsync -R {} /path/to/target \; find . -name \*RNav.jpg -exec gcp --parents {} /path/to/target \; /code/pre  <comment132614> Gracias! Worked perfectly! <comment132634> After further testing, I realized that it's including the other JPG files that aren't tagged with RNav.jpg. I tried varying the wildcard as follows to no avail: --exclude "*.jpg" <comment132638> Thanks. I'll experiment with this <comment132639> Huh, are you sure? I don't get that result here. Maybe the other files already exist in the destination directory? rsync won't remove them unless you add --delete-excluded (to be really clear, that would delete all files from the destination folder, except the ones ending in RNav.jpg). <comment132664> The destination directory is completely empty before running the command line so I'm not sure why it's extracting and copying those other JPG files. <comment132729> This one works!!!
