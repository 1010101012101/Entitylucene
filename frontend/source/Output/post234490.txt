finder spinning wheel el capitan <body> Finder not showing my folders and just spinning  look at bottom right  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/CbRpV.png" alt="Finder spinning"  <comment286678> Does it do this for every folder or just this one in particular?  I am noticing that it is a Google Drive folder.  Is this part of the Google Drive sync utility?  Maybe you Google Drive Sync is not working properly.  Otherwise I have seen this behavior on network shares that are slow or faulty hard drives. <comment286682> Every folder even documents but I notice more slowness on google drive <comment286683> I would do a hardware diagnostics check.  Reboot your computer and hold down the `D` key.  The [Apple diagnostics](https://support.apple.com/en-au/HT202731) should boot up.  See if you find any problems. <comment286932> just ran the hardware check found no issues, issue only happened on first boot now not happening. it's like it's caching or something <comment286950> That's good news about the hardware check.  Maybe next time it happens, open up Activity Monitor and see if there is another program that is using more resources than it should. <comment286953> Try relaunching Finder or rebooting the computer. <comment287366> Confirmed further it's happening on basically all folders even after coming out of standby. It happens only once it's like caching then after that it opens very quickly, i suspect maybe it's just by design . It can be annoying when certain folders has large number of sub folders
