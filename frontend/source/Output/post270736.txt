Change the functionality of the function and control keys on macOS Sierra <body> I want switch the functionality of the function and control keys on the keyboard of the MacBook Pro.  There is a similar question to this, but unfortunately the software mentioned, now called Karabiner, doesn't seem to work with macOS Sierra.  Is there a method to make this achievable in macOS Sierra?  <answer270771> Karabiner is being rewritten from scratch to support Sierra in the form of Karabiner-Elements. You should still be able to accomplish it with this "light" version.  <comment340363> [FunctionFlip](http://kevingessner.com/software/functionflip/) can change or disable the function keys. <comment340419> @rubik'ssphere I believe they are only talking about the `ctrl` and `fn` keys in the bottom left of the keyboard, not the row along the top. <comment340472> Do I need to compile it or can I just download it from the "latest version" link in the readme? <comment340473> @SkeletonBow The latest release is precompiled and can just be downloaded.
