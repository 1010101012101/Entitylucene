I cant sign up to the Apple Beta Software Program from the sign in to join page <body> I can't sign up to the Apple Beta Software Program from the sign in to join page, my apple ID otherwise works. No error messages are shown. This is the page I am trying to log in from.  <answer197289> It kept doing the same to me, until I realised I was using my data and not wifi, so as soon as I turned that on it worked. Make sure you're connected to wifi and try again?  <comment317845> Try this page: https://beta.apple.com/sp/betaprogram/legal?lo=y
