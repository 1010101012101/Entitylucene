Automatic move all mails to folder <body> I have a School email (Microsoft Exchange) which is limited to 350MB of storage. Therefore every month or two I need to move all my emails to the Mac drive instead of the Exchange server.  One thing I noticed is that the Exchange automatically sends a reminder that my storage is nearly full, and I think this reminder could be used to trigger an event that moves all of my Exchange email to a backup folder on my Mac.  Reminder  Select ALL Exchange email (not All Mail)  Move to Exchange Backup (Local folder)  Is there any chance this could be done?  (Bonus: when the emails are moved, is it possible that all the emails on the Exchange server are permanently deleted?)  <comment262592> Just to verify: Is that MegaBytes (MB) or MegaBits (Mb)? <comment262650> Sorry meant MB. edited question.
