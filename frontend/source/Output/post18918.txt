Magic Mouse battery level broken in Lion? <body> After upgrading to Lion my Magic Mouse's level indicator seems to be broken.  For the whole week it was reporting solid 100% on a pair of used batteries that were about 65% before upgrading. I swapped the batteries naively hoping it'll change anything and it actually did. It's now solid 95%!  Screens from both system preferences and Bluetooth icon in the menu bar:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZHdjE.png" alt="mouse battery level in prefs" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2NACs.png" alt="mouse battery level in Bluetooth"  What's interesting, iStat Pro dashboard widget seems to be reporting a correct level:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2hveJ.png" alt="mouse battery level in iStat Pro"  Has anyone noticed such a problem? Or maybe even found a solution to it?  <answer18933> You are not the only one. Mine says the same - 100%. This is a bug. The terminal command for querying the battery percentage (probably what iStat Pro uses) reports: "BatteryPercent" = 82  For bluetooth mouse:  precodeioreg -n "BNBMouseDevice" | grep -i "batterypercent" /code/pre  For Apple bluetooth keyboard:  precodeioreg -n "AppleBluetoothHIDKeyboard" | grep -i "batterypercent" /code/pre  I've posted this in the Apple Bug reporter. Hopefully it will be fixed in an future Lion update.  Here is another thread discussing the same issue. https://discussions.apple.com/thread/3211868  <comment20729> That explains it then. Let's hope for a prompt hotfix to Lion. <comment20735> I can confirm this too. The Bluetooth Menu and System Preferences report 66%, but it's actually 46%. <comment34465> Here on Lion 10.7.2 the bluetooth menulet reports 7% and `ioreg` 20% â€” so I guess it got *fixed too much.* :-D <comment35774> Yep. Still there in 10.7.2. I haven't had any response back from Apple about the ticket either. I'm interested in where this other number is coming from. Where are they getting it?
