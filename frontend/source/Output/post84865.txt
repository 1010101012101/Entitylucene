How to tell a macmini to stop booting to Windows from a macbook pro? <body> I need to be able to control a mac mini without a screen and I think using screensharing would be enough. I've enabled screensharing, setup a manual IP address and I have an ethernet cable.   The problem is I don't have display to use on the mac mini and I currently borrowed a keyboard and a firewire cable to setup screensharing:   ol libooted mac mini in target mode (wish there was a way to do it without the keyboard)/li libooted the macbook holding the codealt/code key and choosing the firewire drive/li /ol  The problem is the mac mini has a bootcamp partition setup to which it boots by default. I googled a bit and tried the codeSystem Preferences &gt; Startup Disk/code option then the /etc/fstab route but no joy: the mac mini still boots to Windows.  How can I get the macmini to simply boot to it's osx all the time (given that I have to change the settings on a macbook with a firewire cable) ?  <answer84868> The system stores the boot choice in NVRAM, so you might reset it by powering off and then holding command-option-p-r while you hear the start chimes repeat 2 or 3 times.  At that point, it should choose the first bootable system on the internal drive. IF that doesn't work, you could post the filesystem layout - but a corrupt NVRAM settings file would explain why your choice of Startup Disk wasn't respected.  <comment97738> that worked, I could see the macmini in the network list, but still can't connect to it and not sure why. any hints on what I can check tomorrow ? <comment97739> Not really, but the site should be here tomorrow for a follow up question. Just list the details and we'll have a look collectively. <comment97740> cool, thanks again for your answer :)
