Reformat a Partitioned Mac OS Extended External Disk? <body> One of my backup disks is full. How can I Erase &amp; Reformat the drive? I use Yosemite OS.  The External Hard Drive was formatted as Partitioned Mac OS Extended (case sensitive, Journaled, Encrypted volume) Disk.  I tried under "Disk Utilities", but got this Error Message:     Disk Encryption failed with the error:  Unable to delete the Core   Storage logical volume group.   <answer186264> This is an example of a procedure to erase an external disk containing a single encrypted partition.  ol liOpen the Disk Utility application and highlight the "Logical Volume Group" representing your external disk. An example is shown below. (Hint: click on image for a better view.)  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xPbLd.png" alt=""/li liNext, click the Info icon to get the pop up window. Note, in the example shown below, the "Physical Backing" is disk1s2. This means the physical disk number is 1. The "s2" suffix can be ignored. Your numbers may be different.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WtDpZ.png" alt=""/li liNext, highlight the "Encrypted Logical Partition" as shown in the example below.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/sMFR8.png" alt=""/li liAgain, click the Info icon to get a pop up window. Note the "Disk Identifier". In the example shown below, the value is disk2. Your value may be different.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xy74f.png" alt=""/li liClose the Disk Utility and open the Terminal application. Enter the following commands. If your numbers differed from mine, make the appropriate substitutions. If prompted, enter your login password.  precodediskutil  unmountDisk  /dev/disk2 sudo  gpt  destroy  /dev/disk1 sudo  gpt  create  -f  /dev/disk1 /code/pre  When I entered these commands, I saw the following in the Terminal window.  precodeSteelhead:~ davidanderson$ diskutil  unmountDisk  /dev/disk2 Unmount of all volumes on disk2 was successful Steelhead:~ davidanderson$ sudo  gpt  destroy  /dev/disk1 Password: Steelhead:~ davidanderson$ sudo  gpt  create  -f  /dev/disk1 Steelhead:~ davidanderson$  /code/pre  The codedistutil/code command  must successfully unmount the disk in order for the gpt commands to work. If the disk will not unmount, then some window needs to be closed. Do not proceed with the gpt commands, if you can not unmount the disk./li liIf successful, you should see a result similar to what is shown below. The result shown is a 4GB flash drive with no partitions. You can either add a partition or repartition the entire drive.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/iRHLs.png" alt=""/li /ol  <comment219799> As first step you should turn off the encryption. Did you do that ? <comment219826> No.Do you mean Turn Off the Mac Encryption in Fire Vault? <comment219827> No.Do you mean Turn Off the Mac Encryption in Fire Vault?Or, Backup Disk Encryption via Time Machine? <comment219829> You could enter the gpt command in a Terminal window to erase all partitions from the external disk. This would require you to be comfortable using Terminal. <comment219833> DaR, if you what Buscarì›ƒ to be notified that you posted a comment, you need include @Buscar somewhere in your comment. <comment219838> @DavidAnderson Actually since Buscar's comment was the only one, the notification gets fired automatically. The ping is only needed when there are already multiple comments from multiple users. <comment219892> @onik David is right, I did not get notes from DaR.
