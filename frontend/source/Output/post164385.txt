Does Time Capsule automatically backup to the cloud? <body> When I purchased my Time Capsule, I was told that it provides two terabytes of storage on the actual capsule and two on "the cloud". Does this happen automatically or do I have to set up something different?  Also, how do I access this?  <answer164387> AirPort Time Capsules do not come with any cloud-based storage. They are an entirely network-local backup and storage device. Whomever told you it it had storage "on the cloud" was not being truthful. You can see the full specs for the AirPort Time Capsule on Apple's web page. As you will see: there is no mention of any cloud-based storage at all on that page.  <comment192724> Go back to the store and have them show you how?
