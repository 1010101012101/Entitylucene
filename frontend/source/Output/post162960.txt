Typing 'paral' into Spotlight suggests 'Pages' instead of 'Parallels Desktop' - how to fix? <body> If I type any of these in Spotlight (Yosemite): par para parall parallel etc  Parallels Desktop is suggested as the program to launch - which is what I want.  However - if I type 'paral' - what you would think was a good short bet to load the app - it suggests 'Pages.  I endup typing 'paral' a lot as it used to work.  I found nothing on Google.  This makes no sense. How can I fix this?  <answer162961> Rebuilding your index should fix this. You can do it typing this command at the terminal:  precodesudo mdutil -i on /Volumes/Macintosh_HD /code/pre  Replace codeMacintosh_HD/code with your hard drive name.  <answer163440> If Parallels is in the suggestions below, scroll down and select it. Do it a couple of times and it will become the top result eventually. App launching is adaptive.  <comment190943> sudo mdutil -i on '/Volumes/Macintosh HD'  says 'Indexing enabled. Zero effect (it was also super fast don't think it did anything. <comment190944> I have not updated the name of my hard disk - so the path above should be right? <comment190945> Also tried this - same as above: sudo mdutil -E /Volumes/Macintosh\ HD/ <comment190972> Do you have enough space on that disk? What is the output of `sudo mdutil -s /Volumes/Macintosh\ HD`? <comment191189> 30Gb free. Output as it says above 'Indexing enabled' <comment191406> Only needed to do it once thanks! I guess I must have somehow typed 'paral' then clicked Pages in the past one time to cause this.
