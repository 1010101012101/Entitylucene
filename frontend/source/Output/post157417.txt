How to submit an application update to only a select few users for A/B Testing? <body> I was wondering what is the best process for launching an update (or multiple updates) you want to show users, but you don't want it to be released for everyone just yet. In other words, is there a way to release an update or different updates for certain countries/specific number of users for A/B testing purposes? This way people don't automatically update to that version (unless maybe they are one of the users in the test).  Is the best way to simply make another application?   <comment185066> Consider using TestFlight from Apple for this: https://developer.apple.com/app-store/testflight/ <comment185069> @AlanShutko Ooh I see. Not sure how I missed that. I noticed that's only for iOS 8. Is there a process for doing this for applications in previous versions? <comment185070> Unfortunately not from Apple. You could get an enterprise account and do ad-hoc distribution, or use your 100 device slots to send beta builds to people. <comment185124> Ah thank you. If you are willing to post that as an answer, I'd be willing to accept it.
