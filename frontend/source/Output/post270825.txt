can't download full resolution of 75 photos from icloud to iPhone <body> Like the title says, my phone downloaded the majority of my photos on icloud, but when I try to turn off iCloud photo library it says that the full resolution of 75 photos can't be downloaded and will therfore be deleted. So how can I get to download these?  <comment340446> It takes some time to download full-resolution photos.  How long did you wait for the downloads to complete? <comment340471> I waited about 2-3 days. <comment340563> On your iPhone go to `Settings - iCloud - Photos` and make sure `Download and Keep Originals` is checked.  It will still take a few days to download the full-res images.  You can check the status of the download on that same iCloud page.  Let us know if that works. <comment340622> I already had that on. It somehow downloaded it. THanks for the replies.
