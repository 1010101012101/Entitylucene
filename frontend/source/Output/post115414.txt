What is $RECYCLE.BIN in MAC? <body> I had a directory called $RECYCLE.BIN which I did not created. I deleted it accidentally and as result all other directories beside it deleted it.  I could not find anything about this directory. Here is :  precodeben@thebeast ~/Downloads]$ ls $RECYCLE.BIN Note.txt Objective-C Essential Training [ben@thebeast ~/Downloads]$ rm -r $RECYCLE.BIN [ben@thebeast ~/Downloads]$ ls [ben@thebeast ~/Downloads]$ /code/pre  In fact by deleting directory "$RECYCLE.BIN" file Note.txt and directory "Objective-C Essential Training" deleted as well. Does anybody had the same experience or know what is this $RECYCLE.BIN?  <answer115415> code$RECYCLE.BIN/code is a hidden folder on Windows systems. It's the Recycle Bin, as you may have guessed. Did you by chance use this disk in a Windows machine at some time? That would explain how it arrived on the disk. Since it's in your Downloads folder, it's more likely that it was accidentally included with a code.zip/code file that you extracted.  <answer115443> Since it is in your Downloads folder I would bet it was in a poorly compressed file.  It could have been compressed with the codeNote.txt/code file.  I get the Thumbs.db files all the time, it is created by Windows when it makes the thumbnails and is not removed during compression like hidden files should be.  <answer115456> The shell running in Terminal uses code$/code to identify variables. So if you want to remove or edit (or reference in general) a file whose name contains a code$/code you need to protect/escape it  precoderm -r \$RECYCLE.BIN vi SYS\$OUT.txt /code/pre  hr  As the variable code$RECYCLE/code most probably didn't exist, the variable got replaced by "nothing" in your case resulting in  precoderm -r .BIN /code/pre  being run. This still doesn't fully explain what happened though because all you should have gotten is a coderm: .BIN: No such file or directory/code error.  <answer235528> Were you running Parallels Desktop with a Windows Virtual Machine?  These folders are created if you are using the Shared Folders feature in Parallels Desktop. You can disable it in Virtual Machine - Configure - Shared Folders.  These folders can be safely deleted if you don't care about their contents.  <comment135097> I do not have a Windows installed at my MacBookPro. I never had. But I downloaded many files and it is possible that it came from internet. But how come that deleting that directory cause other directories to be also deleted? Is something wrong with my hard disk? <comment135202> I checked history now and I realised that I put a * symbol after $RECYCLE. As you said "echo $RECYCLE*" returned all directories in the current folder which result in deleting everything. Thanks for the great explanation.
