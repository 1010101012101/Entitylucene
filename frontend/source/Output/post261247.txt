How does file search (with indexing) work over network? <body> No-one so far has been able to answer my question on my problem in previous post (External drive indexing keep disabling (mac)). Because this is a crucial issue for me that I need to resolve asap, I will try to ask different question:   I have a small network of about 10 iMacs connected together via Ethernet. One iMac has OWC ThunderBay4 connected via Thunderbolt directly and all other computers are accessing files on this drive via ethernet. Even though the searching (using Finder) works fine on the computer attached directly, I am having issues searching on the remaining computers. Sometimes it works fine, but then suddenly the search stops working until I manually unload and load the index file.   Today it happened again but with a difference that I am still able to search on two computers - one that is connected directly via Thunderbolt and on another one iMac over the Ethernet, but I can't search on the remaining 8 iMacs.  Could please anyone explain me how the indexing over the network works, so I understand what is the exact process when trying to search for files over network? That might help me to resolve the issue I am having.   Thank you heaps
