I used WireShark to sniff the checkout command, no packets to the subversion server were leaving my machine.   I checked Console.app and displayed were these messages each attempt to checkout:  precodeacwebsecagent[pid]: Connection : Auth key is not provided or is invalid, applying connection failure policy. CMode : 0 TMode : 0 acwebsecagent[pid]: Connection : Auth key is not provided or is invalid, applying connection failure policy. CMode : 2 TMode : 1 /code/pre  acwebsecagent is the AnyConnect WebSecurity module. My company is not using this module anyway, so I decided to uninstall the module using the command  precodesudo /opt/cisco/anyconnect/bin/websecurity_uninstall.sh /code/pre  The connection to subversion was restored instantly.  <comment133475> not effect .it report same error
