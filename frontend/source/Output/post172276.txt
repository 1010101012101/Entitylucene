How to reload app preferences and documents on iPhone? <body> So I updated my iphone to new iOS and then my backup became corrupted.  I was then able to get ALL the information out of the backup unto my computer.  I now have for each app its corresponding codeLibrary/code and codeDocuments/code. These  contain additional folders that the apps use and the codePreferences/code folder, which contains the code.plist/code files.  I would like to put all this information back on my iPhone. But how?  Is there a program for this? Can this be done through iTunes?  I am quite desperate, as I would love to know how to get this done.  <answer173277> Once you've installed the relevant apps back on the device, open iExplorer or similar app and copy the files back on to the device in the app's data container.  <comment203808> Genius! Thanks a lot! <comment203815> And how do I make the iPhone refresh its data after copying the relevant files back? <comment203816> @HowToPutBackupBack Make sure the app isn't running in the background when you copy the files, then once you have, reboot the device.
