How do you set file permissions in Lion? <body> I just loaded Lion on my Mac and now cannot access certain files. How can I change the permissions of a certain file?   I've tried to find the HD in Finder but it doesn't show up.   <answer55798> The easiest way of setting permission to a file is:  ol liSelect the file you want to change permissions to./li liHit KbdCommand/kbdkbdi/kbd./li liIn the last part of the eminformation panel/em, just authenticate and change the permissions as you want them./li /ol  This can be achieved, too, through terminal with the strongchmod/strong command.   Lion does not show the HD by default. In the strongGeneral/strong tab of the Finder's preferences just check strongShow this items on Desktop: Hard Drive/strong, and it will be shown. You can also type kbdShift/kbdKbdCommand/kbdkbdC/kbd to open a Finder window for the whole drive directly.
