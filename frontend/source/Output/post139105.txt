Error: "The operation can’t be completed because one or more required items can’t be found. (Error code -43)" <body> I accidentally pulled an NTFS hard drive out of my Mac OS X Mavericks machine several times and realized that I accidentally created multiple entries of many different names in my code/Volumes//code folder. Now I have codestorage_1/code, codestorage_2/code, codestorage_3/code, codepassport/code, etc. in my code/Volumes//code folder.   I tried a few solutions to unmount the drives (they didn't show up as unmountable however since they technically don't exist as real drive volumes). I tried a few quick coderm filename -r/code and codermdir filename/code commands to no avail.   The error I get when I try to delete ANYTHING in Finder, however, is      The operation can’t be completed because one or more required items can’t be found.      (Error code -43).    Obviously I Google'd the answer to this problem and was able to fix it initially by fixing my hard drive permissions. However, this fix didn't work for the code/Volumes//code folder, just every other folder. Now, nothing works.   Any suggestions?  <answer139106> A simple shut down, then start, of OS X should automatically remove debris from   code/Volumes/code  If you like: disconnect/eject any removable media before the start.   Or simply leave the media in place, and restart.   hr  There may be other approaches to dealing with volume debris whilst the OS is running but in my experience, it's often better to restart.   h2Also recommended/h2  Error -43 may truly indicate a file system inconsistency, so use Recovery OS Disk Utility to verify affected file systems.   <answer232076> You can search Force Quit &amp; submit it.

So I searched the Internet and found this article: How to Fix Error 43 Mac.  To fix, what you need to do is basically two steps  ol liReset the PRAM.

However, upon later inspection, I realized I was using the command `rm drive_name -r`, instead of `rm -r drive_name`. Problem solved. Such simple stupid mistakes on my part. <comment283491> I'm not sure how this will help. <comment286895> Why not? Did you not try it? (By "force quit and submit it", we just mean quit and restart the finder; at least on my system Command-Q works for the Finder, too. No need to "force quit" and after relaunching, things were normal. (Although I have occasionally encountered strange Finder issues that required a reboot for the situation to resolve.)  At least when I encountered this bizarre behavior (on my start-up drive, with documents in my Downloads directory, quitting and re-launching the Finder app did, indeed, resolve the situation. <comment301230> Relaunching Finder solved the issue for me. <comment314391> This helped me fixing the issue without rebooting my system. But the answer could be improved to just right-click Finder and hit "relaunch". <comment317954> Thanks for this! This fixed an issue on macOS Sierra where one of the user accounts couldn't delete files. I opened Activity Monitor, selected Finder in the list, and chose "Force Quit". When I clicked Finder again in the Dock to start it anew, I could delete files.
