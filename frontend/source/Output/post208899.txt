Using a wireless mouse with an iPad <body> I need to use my iPad mini as a computer for a while. I am planning to use an Apple TV to AirPlay mirror my iPad's display to an existing HD monitor through HDMI, but I need a good input method. I am A LOT more productive and faster using a mouse, and I only really need a web browser.  I have found that Puffin Browser might have something similar to what I need, namely, it has a "virtual trackpad," where it puts a cursor on the screen and you can swipe around in a small rectangle to move and click the cursor on the page. This is all well and good, but I would need some way of using a physical, Bluetooth mouse somehow like this. Any ideas?  <answer208901> You have to hurdles to overcome:   ol liApple's operating system does not pair with Bluetooth mice. You need to overcome that to use a mouse. /li liApple's operating system is designed for multitouch as opposed to a single pointer, each application that you use will need to handle the mouse input and juggle it with other multitouch inputs. /li /ol  You can review other people's failure to use a mouse with iOS on these questions:  ul liUsing mouse from OSX host on iOS device/li liHow do I hover on the iPad?/li /ul  Basically keyboards and stylus are supported. Mice and trackpads are not currently.   <comment251912> EDIT: I am using a Bluetooth keyboard as well, which I already have gotten to work.
