Forgot old iCloud account password <body> I have changed my Apple ID (email and password) on my computer.  However, my iPhone 5 still shows the old email address which is grey so I can't change it. I don't remember the password for that email address so can't log on and can't delete it. How do I recover the password ?  <answer140360> If your phone has activation lock, you will have to get control of the old Apple ID to remove the account.
