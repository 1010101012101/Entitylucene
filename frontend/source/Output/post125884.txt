Why is 'xattr' not working? <body> When I attempt to execute codexattr/code in Terminal, I get  precodeTraceback (most recent call last):   File "/usr/bin/xattr-2.7", line 33, in &lt;module&gt;     import xattr ImportError: No module named xattr /code/pre  What's going on here? I thought xattr was part of Darwin. Is codexattr/code written in Python? Does it require a Python package to be installed on my system?  <answer125927> The file that is executed when you run the command xattr is code/usr/bin/xattr/code which is a python script that works out what version of python you have and then executes /usr/bin/xattr-2.7 for python 2.7. This script is also python and includes a codeimport xattr/code to import the python module xattr from the Apple installed python libraries   <comment147345> xattr is part of OSX and does use python but all the correct bits should be there - have you installed or deleted any python - also which OS verso are you on? <comment147346> Does `ls /System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/Extras/lib/python/xattr` find anything? That's where the xattr module should be (at least in Mavericks). It should contain _xattr.so and several .py and .pyc files. <comment147384> @Mark: That will do as an answer. The core of the question is whether it's a Python package, which I gather it is. (Simply installing it fixes the issue.) <comment147398> @raxacoricofallapatorius How did you install it - it should not be needed - I would reinstall the OS <comment147399> @Mark: Don't worry about it. I has to do with my Python installation, which is fine. The question is simply whether it has a Python dependency.
