How do I "say . . . using" in Javascript for Automation? <body> In Applescript, I can specify the voice the system uses to speak text as follows:  precodesay "Hello" using "Alex" /code/pre  In Javascript, I can do something similar:  precodevar ScriptEditor = Application("Script Editor"); ScriptEditor.includeStandardAdditions = true;  ScriptEditor.say("Hello!") /code/pre  But I don't know how to specify the specific voice; I always have to use the system. Is there a way to specify the codeusing/code parameter, or another version of codesay/code that allows the code to specify the voice?  <answer185921> Apple's documentation describes how to call commands which have both direct parameters (the text) and named parameters (the using). In this case, you would do this:  precodevar ScriptEditor = Application("Script Editor"); ScriptEditor.includeStandardAdditions = true;  ScriptEditor.say("Hello", {using: "Alex"}) /code/pre  <comment219321> Don't use Javascript it's really not made to make automated workflows. It very basic and not at all better in any aspect. <comment219322> I'm more familiar with JavaScript. I'd like to know if it's possible in JavaScript before I fall back to AppleScript. <comment219424> Thanks Alan! I'd tried to use ScriptEditor.say({text: "Hello", using: "Alex"}), but clearly I'd misread the directions.
