Dictionary lookup wider and taller (pop-up dictionary lookup styling) in OS X <body> It's possible to change the font and the font-size for 3-finger lookup popup. You just need to edit css file for dictionaries you use, e.g.:  precodesudo vim /Library/Dictionaries/New\ Oxford\ American\ Dictionary.dictionary/Contents/Resources/DefaultStyle.css  /code/pre  find codehtml.apple_client-panel body {/code and edit properties   Now I actually want to go further and make the entire popup area bigger - little wider and little taller. How can I do that?  <answer234209> First of all, strongfind out dictionary path you want to modify/strong, for example depending on the dictionary and system you are running, possible paths to codeDefaultStyle.css/code may be next:  precode/Library/Dictionaries/Oxford Dictionary of English.dictionary/Contents/DefaultStyle.css /Library/Dictionaries/Oxford American Writer's Thesaurus.dictionary/Contents/Resources/DefaultStyle.css /code/pre  Then open this file in any text/code editor you'd like, it could be even codevim/code, like in the original question, and open it for modification, search for codefont-size/code parameter for codebody/code element, it could be defined in codept/code, codepx/code, codeem/code. If you want to deep into CSS details, you may read up tutorials or manual on the codefont-size/code. strongIt appears to be regular CSS file/strong, for definition of styles, so it's easy to work with it.  You may change the font-size, to make it bigger/smaller, it could achieved by modification of parameters in codeCSS/code:  precodebody {   ...   font-size: 15pt; /* &lt;== look for this parameter, and scale it up to your taste */   ... } /code/pre  Or like this:   precodehtml.apple_client-panel body {     ...     font-size: 15px;     ... } /code/pre  You may find some screenshots and additional explanation on apple.disscussions.  One also can play with codeline-height/code, if codefont-size/code haven't brought enough readability. If you want to change the window itself or spacing around text, then you may want to modify codemargin/code (codemargin-top/code, codemargin-bottom/code, etc) or codepadding/code (codepadding-left/code, codepadding-right/code, etc).   Tried to explain this to the guys, who are not web-developers themselves, hope this helps. Ask if you gotten additional questions to me, or search them on StackOverflow (it's for developers questions), but I think it will be straight-forward for you now.
