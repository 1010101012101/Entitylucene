osascript is not allowed assistive access. (-1728) <body> Script:  precode#!/usr/bin/osascript tell application "System Preferences"     activate     set current pane to pane "com.apple.preferences.users"     delay 2     tell application "System Events"         click radio button "Login Items" of tab group 1 of window "Users &amp; Groups" of application process "System Preferences"     end tell end tell /code/pre  How do I provide assistive access to this script? When running this through 'Script Editor', all it it needs is 'Script Editor' to be enabled under 'Accessibility' in 'Security &amp; Privacy'.  But I need to run this (and some other similar script files) to be executed without user's intervention. I've tried saving the file in .sh, .app, .scpt, .applescript formats and run via terminal as sudo without any luck.  I've gone through other questions like this and other without any help.  EDIT: Thanks for the response guys. We've already tried these methods and they work without any doubt and that's where problem lies. We've way too many mac machines to go around and enable on them manually. We were hoping for some command that will add Terminal to the list with user's permission (kind of like UAC in Windows) or if possible silently.  <answer291594> If you run strongAppleScript/strong emcode/em via codeosascript/code in strongTerminal/strong, then you need to add strongTerminal/strong to strongSystem Preferences/strong  strongSecurity &amp; Privacy/strong  strongPrivacy/strong  strongAccessibility/strong, to allow it assistive access.  hr  I took your emcode/em, saved it to a emfile/em named codetestcode/code and made it executable using codechmod/code. I then ran it in strongTerminal/strong and received the following error:  precode./testcode:157:286: execution error: System Events got an error: osascript is not allowed assistive access. (-1728) /code/pre  I then added strongTerminal/strong to strongSystem Preferences/strong  strongSecurity &amp; Privacy/strong  strongPrivacy/strong  strongAccessibility/strong and ran it again. It then processed the emscript/em properly and returned:  precoderadio button Login Items of tab group 1 of window Users &amp; Groups of application process System Preferences /code/pre  It of course opened the strongSystem Preferences/strong to that emtarget/em.  <answer291614> The key point in the linked answer is:     When you first load or run the LaunchAgents you will get a prompt to set the Assistive Access in System Preferences. If you already have System preferences open you will not but the Script text file will be added to the list.      You now just have to check its check box to allow it.   Step 1 is to open the security tab and allow your script app or the individual scripts permission to automate the interface.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MLZrT.png" alt="enter image description here"  Step 2 - profit and avoid error -1728  <comment369962> Unfortunately this doesn't actually work for me with a LaunchAgent, my logs show `execution error: System Events got an error: osascript is not allowed assistive access. (-1719)` and I don't get prompted by System Preferences to allow assistive access. macOS 10.12.6
