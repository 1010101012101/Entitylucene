My iPhone 5s is cracked and the screen is black, how do I get pictures from the phone? <body> I dropped my iPhone 5s in water and then cracked it... Vegas what can I say?  It was working that day but, the next it just went black and didn't work anymore. When I connected to the computer, it is  recognized  but it says is locked and obviously, I can't unlock it from the phone, is there a way to unlock it from my Mac?  How do I retrieve my pictures from an iPhone I can't unlock?  <answer248270> You can try using an iPhone data recovery software such as iPhone Recovery. Good Luck!  <comment307568> Did you have them backed up to iCloud, Google Photos, Dropbox, your computer, etc.? Was your phone backed up to iCloud or iTunes?
