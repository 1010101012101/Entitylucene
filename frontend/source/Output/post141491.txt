"Show all" by default in Finder? <body> My question is directly related to this question in LION version.   I use Icon view in Finder and I want to get rid of "Show all" behaviour, i.e. I want all files to be shown by default.  Now, I am on Mavs, but still have no way to expand all the items by default in icon view.  Can we view all files by default in icon view in OS X?   <answer141676> Go to the folder and press âŒ˜J, then set Arrange&nbsp;By to None. This will still sort using whatever you have chosen for Sort&nbsp;By. Click Use as Defaults to use this option as default and remove the .DS_Store from any folder that you wish to inherit these defaults.  <comment166953> I am sorry, but I try to not mess all the icons... :(
