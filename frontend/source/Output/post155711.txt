Macbook's "Internal Memory Card Reader" uses 896ma/900ma doing nothing, is this normal? <body> One a new mid-2014 macbook pro:  precodeInternal Memory Card Reader:    Product ID:   0x8406   Vendor ID:    0x05ac  (Apple Inc.)   Version:  8.20   Serial Number:    000000000820   Speed:    Up to 5 Gb/sec   Manufacturer: Apple   Location ID:  0x15400000 / 21   Current Available (mA):   900   Current Required (mA):    896   Built-In: Yes /code/pre  This is what System Report reports, there is no card in the reader, is this normal?  <answer155791> Current Required lists what is necessary to operate the device (the internal memory card reader) emnot/em what is being used.  This Apple Support article is about USB ports, but the information under strongConfirming power usage in System Profiler/strong is directly applicable to your question. In this case the "port" over which power requirements are noted is where the internal card reader is connected to the motherboard, not the card reader itself.  <comment183200> are you sure it is using that? Available and Required don't strike me as the same as currently using... <comment183214> of course I'm not sure, that's why I'm asking :) <comment183215> but I get the point, is it more of an allocation / estimation metric then? <comment183226> That is my guess, but maybe someone who knows for sure will answer
