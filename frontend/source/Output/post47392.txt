Change Image Format of a Screenshot <body> Lets say I want to save my screenshots as a .jpg instead of .png. How would I do this? Is there a bash command I can enter or a setting I can toggle?  <answer47393> You can use the following Terminal command to change the default screenshot format (I'm reading that GIF and PDF and some other formats are also supported):  precodedefaults write com.apple.screencapture type jpg /code/pre  (You can also set the codelocation/code key to a path to a directory in which you'd like the screenshots to be saved, as opposed to your Desktop.)  Also, the screencapture command can be used to save a screenshot to a specific filename, and configure more options (such as window shadows, timed capture, etc.).  <answer47394> You can use the following Terminal command to change the default location that they are stored in, and then use a folder action to perform conversion and other actions if required.  precodedefaults write com.apple.screencapture location ~/Pictures/ /code/pre  <answer47430> You can also use the free application TinkerTool to do that as well. It's under the General pane:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YTqzV.png" alt="General pane of Tinkertool" del(Note that you'll have to log out and log back in for the changes to take effect.)/del  (as noted by this comment, you emdon't/em have to log out and back in again, just use the Terminal command codekillall SystemUIServer/code)  <comment54432> Be aware that lossy formats like JPEG will introduce compression artifacts that make your screenshots look worse. <comment130993> if (like i was), you are also wanting to change the string format of how the file is named, see here: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/4139/how-do-i-change-the-location-of-screen-captures-on-10-5#111320
