How to deactivate Wifi 801.11 N on Mac? <body> I would like to deactivate the Wifi 801.11N on a Macbook Air 2013.   I have some problems of stability and connection losses when connecting to a professional network. It appears these issues are related to intel Wireless card and Wifi N.  I would probably have better stability and performance if I connect by using the older Wifi G capability.  How can I deactivate Wifi N in order to use Wifi G on mac?  <comment264588> Not sure if this helps, but you could try to upgrade to OS X 10.11.2 if you are already running os x 10.11 because it has improved wifi reliability. <comment264686> I think that disabling 802.11n would have to be done for your router, not your MacBook Air. <comment264778> @RedEagle2000 On Gnu/Linux, you could simply deactivate 801.11n by one command. I'm surprised by the lack of options of OS X in this issue.
