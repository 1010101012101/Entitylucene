How do I easily convert an audiobook (.m4b) to a standard audio file? <body> I have several audio dramas that are in the audiobook (.m4b) format in iTunes. My problem is that when I sync my 5th gen iPod to iTunes, they don't show up in MusicPlaylists, they show up under MusicAudiobooks. This is really driving me crazy, because I want the audiobooks in MusicPlaylists, but the only workaround is to convert them to a different format. How do I easily convert the audiobooks to a standard audio file format that emwill/em show up in MusicPlaylists on my iPod?  <answer40294> I dug around for quite a long time to find this answer and emfinally/em found out that under the info box, there is a drop-down menu in the Info box under InfoOptions:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3d5C2.png" alt="iTunes&gt;Info&gt;Options"  And the drop-down menu allows you to choose where it will show up:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/P5m4R.png" alt="Options&gt;Media Kind"  All that converting was done for nothing...
