How to rm /Volumes/Free when it is really free? <body> h2Short problem background/h2  OS X version 10.10.5, running on an iMac with no problem (uptime = 101 days). I had an USB key, named "Free" mounted on code/Volumes/Free/code. I wrote successfully a file on it, and verified it successfully with codeDisk Utility/code. Then I tried to eject it from the Finder. This operation fired the beach balloon but no message was written on code/var/log/system.log/code. After a while the Finder displayed me an error message telling me my volume couldn't be ejected because in use.  Since I needed the USB slot to restart the copy operation on another USB key, I ejected my USB key "Free". And the Finder displayed me the usual error message because the volume was unmounted incorrectly.  h2Problem seen actually/h2  I have now a directory code/Volumes/Free/code which stayed in place and which I can't easily remove.  precode••On_my_Mac••% ls -@del /Volumes/Free d--x--x--x+ 2 root  admin  102 Jul 11 14:01 /Volumes/Free  0: group:everyone inherited deny add_file,add_subdirectory,directory_inherit ••On_my_Mac••%  /code/pre  Neither codeSpotlight/code nor any other daemon stayed with this directory opened:  precode••On_my_Mac••% /usr/bin/sudo lsof /Volumes/Free ••On_my_Mac••% /code/pre  Nonetheless I get the following error upon trying to remove it:  precode••On_my_Mac••% /usr/bin/sudo rm -rf /Volumes/Free rm: /Volumes/Free/.autodiskmounted: Permission denied rm: /Volumes/Free: Permission denied ••On_my_Mac••% /code/pre  If I further try to analyze this filesystem problem, I get:  precode••On_my_Mac••% /usr/bin/sudo chmod u+rw /Volumes/Free ••On_my_Mac••% /usr/bin/sudo ls -@ael /Volumes/Free ls: fts_read: Permission denied ••On_my_Mac••% /usr/bin/sudo ls -@del /Volumes/Free/.autodiskmounted -rw-r--r--  1 root  admin  0 Jul 11 14:01 /Volumes/Free/.autodiskmounted ••On_my_Mac••% /code/pre  I didn't try a reboot because this is not a short term an option on the server involved.  hr  Which daemon is responsible of this situation?  How may I further analyze this problem?  <answer246778> You tried the command given below.  /usr/bin/sudo rm -rf /Volumes/Free  Try entering the following.  precodesudo sh /System/Library/Extensions/TMSafetyNet.kext/Contents/Helpers/bypass rm -rf /Volumes/Free exit /code/pre  <comment304581> This command is giving the same error:••return•• rm: /Volumes/Free/.autodiskmounted: Permission denied••return•• rm: /Volumes/Free: Permission denied <comment304707> What's the output of: `ls -@el /Volumes/Free/.autodiskmounted` <comment304710> Good question :). → update.
