How to transfer from iPhone album to Mac <body> My iPhone contains pictures from camera roll and pictures I synced from my previous Mac to the iPhone album. The hard drive broke on my Mac and I couldn't recover the images stored on the iPhone albumns. On iTunes or iPhoto I can only recover pictures from Camera roll but not the albums.  <answer61583> With 3rd party software like PhoneView.
