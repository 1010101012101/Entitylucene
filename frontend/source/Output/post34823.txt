Where and how are the extra columns available for list view in Finder defined? <body> In an answer to an earlier question I found out that the available columns for Finder's list view are relative to the folder path. This means that one could choose to add a codeDimensions/code column when browsing under code~/Pictures/code or codeArtist/code under code~/Music/code or codeCodec/code under code~/Movies/code.  emWhere/em and emhow/em these are defined?  Is there a centralised file that links a path code~/Pictures/code, column codeDimensions/code and action "codeget file's dimensions/code" together?  Or is the column and the action defined in a centralised location and then a folder's property (like "codethis is a folder for pictures/code") enables the columns?  Or are these all defined relatively under the folder path? Or something else?  I think I'm indirectly asking whether or not it is possible to customise the columns (add own) and enable them for different locations.  <answer40780> Try renaming the folder to "Pictures" or moving it into a folder named "Pictures" -- that did the trick for me.  <comment82071> This does not answer the question, where the association between the folder name and the columns is specified.
