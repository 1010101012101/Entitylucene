I can't log into my iChat <body> After iChat is open, I click the menu named 'iChat', inside it says "log into pancake44@me.com" (which is my Apple ID). I've clicked on that item but nothing else prompts me for a password afterwards.  The buddy list still says 'Disconnected'. I am using Leopard (10.5.8). I have changed my password before, but I'm never prompted to actually log in and update it.  <answer34719> I might not be understanding your problem correctly, but in the iChat menu, try selecting strongPreferences/strong. From there, click on the strongAccounts/strong tab. If you click on your account, there is a place to enter (and store) your password. Try entering your correct password there.  <answer46366> Also, you mentioned it just says "Disconnected", can you emclick/em that and perhaps change your status to something else? That would trigger it to try and connect.
