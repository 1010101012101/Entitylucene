Should I install iOS 8 on my iPhone 4s? <body> What are the drawbacks of updating my iPhone 4s to the latest iOS? What are the advantages? With my phone plan, I cannot get the newest iPhone yet.  <answer174018> Advantages:   ul limore security/li limore features: quick reply, continuity (if you have Mac &amp; Yosemite )  Disadvantages:/li liit will run slowly/li liyou won't get a lot of the features that 5S and above have/li licould decrease battery life/li /ul  If you have experience with ssh and jailbreaking, I would say go ahead but make sure you can downgrade using ssh just in case you don't like it.  However, if you don't even know what that is, I wouldn't recommend upgrading because there is no way to downgrade if you don't think you'll like it because apple already stopped signing ios7 and below.  <comment204839> FWIW, I run iOS 8 on my 4S, and don't really see any drawbacks at all. Okay, it is perhaps not quite as responsive sometimes, taking some noticable fraction of a second to react to taps and swipes. It doesn't bother me, but others may feel differently. <comment204890> Does Continuity work on a 4S? <comment204891> @bassplayer7 here are the requirements for continuity.. Some features work while some don't.. http://support.apple.com/en-us/HT6555 <comment204916> Nice. I hadn't looked it up. Thanks.
