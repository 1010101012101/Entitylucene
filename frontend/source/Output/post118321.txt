move a file, replacing existing (if any), ideally by putting existing in the trash <body> I am trying to find a way to automatically (without user intervention) move a file from A to B, replacing B if it exists, ideally by putting the existing copy of B into the appropriate Trash folder.  This will be done in a shell script. Eventually A and B will beed to be code$VARIABLES/code like this:  precode/usr/bin/osascript &lt;&lt;EOT tell application "Finder"     move POSIX file "$SOURCE" to POSIX file “$DEST" with replacing end tell EOT /code/pre  strongembut/em/strong I can’t even get this to work without variables, such as this:  precode/usr/bin/osascript &lt;&lt;EOT tell application "Finder"     move POSIX file "/Users/luomat/Desktop/1.txt" to POSIX file "/Users/luomat/Desktop/2.txt" with replacing end tell EOT /code/pre  I took that syntax pretty much directly from Stackoverflow 14058061 but I get this result:  precode24:132: execution error: Finder got an error: AppleEvent handler failed. (-10000) /code/pre  I also came across a MacTech article which suggested using codereplacing true/code so I tried:  precode/usr/bin/osascript &lt;&lt;EOT tell application "Finder"     move POSIX file "/Users/luomat/Desktop/1.txt" to POSIX file "/Users/luomat/Desktop/2.txt" replacing true end tell EOT /code/pre  but it still says:  precode24:132: execution error: Finder got an error: AppleEvent handler failed. (-10000) /code/pre  Please note that stackoverflow #12708195 I am not trying to prompt the user to do this, but ideally would like it to happen ‘automagically’ as the kids say.  strongSo… what am I doing wrong and/or missing?/strong  Trying to Google for information on error code (-10000) pretty much tells me that it means “AppleScript failed” which isn’t all that helpful.  <answer173824> I need to do some more research to get this right.  I feel like its close, but applescript still doesn't like it.  Maybe it will give you some ideas until I get back here to give it another shot.  Btw this is going to be so much easier when you are using the choose file dialog.  heres my non-working (yet) attempt.  If you don't be me to it ill try to finish the solution tomorrow.   precode# 1. get desktop folder set desktopFolder to (((path to desktop from user domain) as string)) as alias   # 2.set source file tell application "Finder" to ¬ set theFile to ((path to file "1.text" of folder (desktopFolder)) as string) as   alias   # 3.set destination file tell application "Finder" to ¬ set theDestination to ((path to file "2.text" of folder (desktopFolder)) as string) as alias    # 4.make it happen tell application "Finder" to move theFile to theDestination with replacing /code/pre  <comment138087> Technically it's more like an AppleScript, and it's not the easiest thing to do when combining it sometimes; Any reason you're not doing it entirely as a shell script? <comment138131> It's going to be part of a much larger shell script, this is only a small piece of it.
