How to remove locally synced contacts after iOS 7 and Mavericks upgrade <body> Is there a way to remove contacts from an iPhone running iOS 7 that has locally synced contacts and Calendars (On My Mac) now that the Mac has been updated to Mavericks?  <answer118131> Syncing through Sync Services is not possible anymore for contacts as Sync services was removed from Mavericks.
