Decimal comma in Spanish keyboard layout <body> I have a Spanish layout keyboard (in Snow Leopard). Whenever I use the dot, or comma, in the numeric keyboad (right of the 0) it always shows a comma, but I'd prefer if it entered a dot, just like PCs do. Otherways, entering IP addresses, or decimal numbers when coding is a PITA. How can I do that?  I have tried altering my regional settings so that the decimal separator is a point and the thousands separator is a comma, but that doesn't seem to affect text entry.  I'd prefer changing some regional setting rather than remapping the keyboard, but I'll accept any answer that works - short of changing the regional layout of the keyboard, I really need my diacritics there.  <answer2768> You need to change the layout of your keyboard. Not to another one, but to a new one that has been modified by an utility like Ukelele (there might be others).  Download the tool, drag the App to your Application folder. Notice that in the Disk Image, there’s a folder called System Keyboards/Roman/, copy that to you desktop (it’s temporal).   Launch Ukelele and from the File menu select: “New based on…”  Open the file Spanish-ISO.keylayout (found in the Roman folder that you saved to your desktop).  You’ll see a big blue keyboard representing your current Spanish-ISO map (if you brought your computer in Spain, that’s they keyboard you should use).   Double click on the “,” that you want to modify (or any other key) and you’ll see this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/l75Go.png" alt="Edit in Ukelele"  Replace the “,” with the “.” (dot). And go to Keyboard Menu - Set Keyboard Name. Rename the Spanish - ISO to something like: Spanish - ISO2.  Now save it, the name will be Untitled, but you should put Spanish - ISO2.  strongWhere do you save it?/strong  According to Ukelele’s User Manual, you have different choices (and I suggest your read section 3.3 of the manual). Short answer is within the Keyboard Layouts sub-folder of the Library folder in your home folder. This can be created if it doesn’t already exist. If you do that, only your user will see (and be able to use) this Layout.   After installing the keyboard layout and logging out and logging in again, open the International pane of System Preferences (Language &amp; Text on Mac OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard) and later). On the Input Menu (Input Sources in 10.6 or later) tab, your new keyboard layout should be listed there. Enjoy your faster IP Address typing.  <answer2772> KeyRemap4MacBook solves this problem as well, without having to set up a completely different keyboard layout in Ukelele. Simply enable the "Swap Dot and Shift+Dot" option in the "Change Keypad Key" section.   <answer18686> Just discovered an alternative solution, and at least for me a much better one, which does NOT require keyboard remapping and works on other people's macs too:  press strongshift/strong when you press the comma on the numeric keypad, it will be entered as a point (at least in snow leopard (osx 10.6))  em(As I have a Belgian keyboard layout, I've used the keyboard remapping solution [using Ukulele] for some time, but it didn't play well with all applications, e.g. Eclipse)/em  <answer67234> David's answer was extremely helpful! Give a try to KeyRemap4MacBook  The app is clumsy &amp; little buggy but does the job.  On my Spanish - ISO keyboard layout had to enable/change:  ul liKeyPad-Dot(.) to Command+X (Cut) with Italian (What?)/li liKeyPad Comma(,) to Dot(.) on "Italian Pro Input Source"/li /ul  <answer79151> You can also use a tool like Keyboard Maestro. I’ve set it up like this:  ol listrongTriggered by:/strong The Hot Key Key Pad . is pressed/li listrongAction/strong: Insert Text ‘,’ by Pasting/li /ol  It works surprisingly fast without having to create a new keyboard layout or remap keys.  <answer82220> Ctrl+, (just for the comma in numeric keyboard) yields to a . (dot) when in spanish layout.  Oddly enough this works in terminal and in some text editors (like textwrangler). MacVim, for instance, just renders a . when using , in numeric keyboard. And TextMate just ignores this modifier and prints a ,  ... You know, the good thing about apple stuff is that it "just works".  <answer144454> I use the app Better Touch Tool that allows you to do so all sorts of customizations with gestures and the keyboard.  I just added a keyboard assignment that essentially mapped shortcut "pad ," to "." and it works perfectly.  <answer284925> In macOS Sierra, you have to kbdCtrl/kbd+kbdShift/kbd+kbd,/kbd in numeric pad to obtain a regular dot.  Found this trying to do the same as everyone else and discovered it was different now.  Hope this helps.  <comment2726> Thanks. In the end, I just used the keyboard layout provided in the disk image and edited it by hand. I wonder why these layouts are not provided with the system (or are they?) <comment2727> Hmm They are, only not in an "easy to use disk image” ;) <comment2732> Yeah I suppose they are somewhere, but not in any Keyboard Layouts directory. <comment25793> I prefer to keep the title as I originally intended. I don't want to disable it, just configure it differently, and possibly use a modifier key to use one or the other. <comment71908> I very much would prefer this solution. But for some reason it doesn't work on the Spanish layouts, but it does on the Belgian. I'll fill a Radar and see what happens. <comment79251> Keyboard layouts saved in ~/Library/ aren't selected by default in password dialogs, but ones saved in /Library/ are. The character picker popovers only work with keyboard layouts saved as bundles. <comment170151> Welcome to Ask Different! Could you expand on *how* you used the aforementioned app to achieve this? <comment359804> thanks! this is the response I was looking for! Marking it as the accepted answer
