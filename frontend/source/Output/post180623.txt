How to turn off iTunes match on a device if subscription is expired <body> Can anyone tell me how to disable itunes match from my iPhone 5 if my subscription has expired?   I have all of my music saved to my computer in iTunes but when I link my phone to sync music I am unable to as it says that iTunes match is on.br There is no option on my phone in settings to turn it off either as it only says subscription expired! So I now have half my music on my phone while the rest is on my computer but am unable to sync it like before.   iTunes match is turned off in my computer settings.   I just want to sync my music manually like before.      <comment214569> Can it be turned off in neither Settings - Music AND/OR Settings - iTunes & App Store?
