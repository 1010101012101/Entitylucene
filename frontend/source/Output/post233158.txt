Why does Apple TV not stop my Mac from sleeping? <body> When using Home Sharing on Apple TV 3rd gen, the Mac will fall asleep even though it is needed to stream content. So in the middle of a movie the connection will be lost because the Mac goes to sleep.  Why does it not stay awake? It seems like a big oversight on Apple's part.  <answer233180> You might want to try going to   ol liSystem Preferences/li liEnergy Saver/li liThen set Display Sleep to never/li /ol  If you find the need to put the display to sleep because you want to have the computer on and running for whatever reason then I would suggest going to the Screen Saver options and enabling Hot Corners. In that screen you can make the display go to sleep or trigger a screen saver by moving the mouse cursor to a corner on your screen.  Source: That is my current setup. No Display Sleep on unless I'm running a lengthy Time Machine Backup overnight.  <answer233239> There is a free app called Caffeine that adds a little coffee cup to your title bar. Click on it and the Mac will never sleep. Click again and your Mac goes back to its normal sleep pattern.  <comment285065> I don't care if the display sleeps, I need the machine to stay awake. Having the machine never sleep is not an ideal workaround. <comment285067> Thanks, but I'm more interested in why the prevention of sleep isn't triggered by default.
