Dock Bar Sticks When Shutting Down - El Capitain 10.11.6 <body> I have a rather new Macbook Pro that I've only had for a few months. For a while now my dock bar has been only half minimizing when I shut down, and sometimes it doesn't display the spinning icon when shutting down.   I was curious if anyone else has experienced this issue, and if anyone knows how to fix the issue?   Here is a picture of what I'm talking about: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WmmxV.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <comment321732> It must have been some sort of software issue. After upgrading to macOS Sierra, the issue is gone.
