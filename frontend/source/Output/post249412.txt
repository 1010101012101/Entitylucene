Why did my Time Capsule disappear, while continuing to work as wireless router? <body> My Time Capsule cannot be mounted for backups, and the Time Capsule does not appear at all in AirPort Utility. However I can see and connect to its WiFi just fine. The truly odd thing is that I can connect to it using "Configure other..." in AirPort Utility, and see all of its configuration and backup drive.  Some screenshots follow. First, this is what I see in Airport Utility:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/TtrjF.png" alt="no time capsule"  If I hit forget, I get this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/tz4PN.png" alt="nothing"  Note that the globe and the nice little green dot and "Internet" is my WiFi connection through the Time Capsule that is not there!  Clicking on "Other Wi-Fi Devices" shows no devices discovered.  If I click on the globe, I see the local IP address for the router, 10.0.1.1:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/aZPF7.png" alt="10.0.1.1"  Now I do "Configure Other..." from the File menu, enter the router address 10.0.1.1, and the Time Capsule password. I get the full configuration of my otherwise invisible Time Capsule!  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/c4LZw.png" alt="config"  All of the tabs show the correct configuration. But I still can't connect to the very Time Capsule that I am connected to the internet through!  I have tried power cycling the Time Capsule and computer, and doing a soft and hard reset of the Time Capsule, reloading the configuration from a saved file (using Import and Export Configuration File). I end up right back in the same place.  Does this ring any bells for anyone here?  <answer249565> The same thing happened to me yesterday; I don't know if this will work for you.  What fixed it is as you said go to "emConfigure Other/em", then disable Back to my Mac by clicking on the - sign on your email adress. It will reset and then I could see the HDD.  That fixed it for me. Hope it helps!  <answer250031> Yes, this happened to me and the fix worked, strongbut I immediately re-enetered account for BTMM/strong and all has been going well, for now.    <answer264702> Nah~~~  Upon re-entering iCloud account or BTMM account to activate BTMM, Time Capsule starts to disappear again.   I fell into an infinite loop of the bug!  Apple must fix this bug once and for all!  <comment309354> Which of the above steps brings the device back into the airport utility app? <comment309355> The hard reset temporarily shows the Time Capsule unconfigured. Once I load the "Time Capsule Alpha" configuration (which has worked unchanged for a long time, including months since the last Time Capsule software update), the Time Capsule disappears again, though the configured wireless networks (5 GHz, 2.4 Ghz, and guest) all work fine. <comment309749> That totally worked! Thanks. In fact turning Back to My Mac back on made the Time Capsule disappear again. And then turning it off a second time again brought the Time Capsule back from the Phantom Zone. I have reported the bug to Apple. I don't know if this is unique to Mac OS X 10.11.6 and Time Capsule software 7.7.7. <comment309814> Works for me too! Thanks! <comment309845> Glad it worked. Though I have no idea as to why it does. Maybe some iCloud issues. Also thanks for reporting the bug to Apple (I didn't think about it).
