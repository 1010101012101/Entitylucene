iPhoto hangs on import <body> OS X 10.9.5, iPhoto 9.5.1.  My son has a locked-down account on my wife's computer. My wife plugged in her iPhone when her son was logged in. This brought up iPhoto, but the import screen hung on "Loading..." We closed iPhoto, logged out of the limited account, logged into my wife's account, and restarted iPhoto. Same result. Rebooted both computer and phone -- same result.   This smells like a permissions issue, so I checked that my wife was the owner of all files in the iPhoto library, which she is. There's nothing in the Auto Import folder, which other sites have suggested clearing out.  I'm totally comfortable with the terminal, but my knowledge of OSX/*nix tools is very limited (despite using Ubuntu at work every day for the past 6 months :-P). If this were Windows I'd be firing up procmon now to see if an important file were locked. Really hoping I can get this working without a rebuild (we have photos going back to 2007) or having to upgrade to a newer OS X / Photos app as my wife likes things as they are.  Any ideas how to fix?
