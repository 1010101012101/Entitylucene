How to completely wipe 3rd generation iPod Nano <body> I was using Floola to transfer songs to my 3rd generation iPod Nano and it suddenly stopped working. Now I installed iTunes and I can't seem to be able to delete any of the old songs and I cannot delete them manually. Even my iPod can't see them anymore and classifies them as “other”. How can I wipe the hard drive and start again fresh?  <answer207797> iTunes should be able to "Restore iPod"  <comment250706> Tried it, doesn't work. <comment250707> @The.Lonely.Idiot does it display an error? <comment250708> Nope, it updated just fine, but it still shows that there is only 1.1 GB available.
