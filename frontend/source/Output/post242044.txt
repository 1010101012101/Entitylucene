Cannot read keyboard shortcut text <body> Some of the shortcut titles take up too much space and are truncated. System Preferences cannot be resized, so I cannot see the full name.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/V3gln.png" alt="System Preferences shortcut truncation"  Is there any other way?  <answer242050> There are tooltips. Keep the mouse hovering over any of the abbreviated strings and a tooltip will show you the full text. This works in most of the OS.       img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ytcx3.png" width="604"
