Mac mini won't wake with USB mouse after macOS Sierra upgrade <body> Prior to the macOS Sierra, the Mac mini would wake by moving the USB mouse. After the upgrade, the Mac will still wake when hitting the spacebar on a USB keyboard, but moving or clicking the mouse has no effect. Can you suggest a way to troubleshoot or re-enable the ability to wake on USB mouse movement?  <comment320327> As far as I can recall, shaking or clicking the mouse to wake went away with Mavericks or Yosemite. It's been space-bar only for me for quite some time.
