How can I make an application open at startup, without automatically opening a window? <body> Many of the applications that I use, such as Spotify, don't require a window to be open to function. I want these applications to be available at startup, but if I chose the corresponding options, the window also opens, and I end up with a clutter of windows on my desktop which I end up manually closing.  Is there a hack or a simply option to just open the Application without creating a new window?  <answer230825> Try System Preferences  Users and Groups  Login Items and press the little code+/code sign to add your application.  To hide an application on startup, IIRC you can unselect the "Show on Startup" checkbox.
