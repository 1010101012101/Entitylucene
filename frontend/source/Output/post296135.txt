How to combine different sizes images using GIMP? <body> I could combine images if images have the same high using GIMP:  How to edit or adjust images on Mac  If images have different high, I could make the smaller image up to the bigger one by changing size of canvas - but it would not look presentable: I need some sort of borders near this small or both images.   How to combine the images if they have different high using GIMP?   thanks.
