Why doesn't macOS Sierra see a connected USB device? <body> I have the 2015 MacBook Air running macOS Sierra with the Novation Nio 2|4 sound card. This card works perfectly on Mac OS X 10.6.8 (I also have the old white MacBook) and on Windows, but my MacBook Air doesn't see this card when I'm trying to plug it in. I have never used this card with this laptop.  ul liMy cable is fine./li liUSB interface works fine too (with USB sticks, for example)./li liUSB card is fine and works on other devices./li liI successfully disabled SIP./li liI installed the latest version of the driver from the official Novation site./li liI tried to using System Information to check the list of connected USB devices, and I didn't see the card there./li liOnce I was able to turn my card on (accidentally), a couple minutes later it disappeared and didn't come back./li /ul  What could the problem be?
