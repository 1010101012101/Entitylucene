Desktop icons rearrange after restart <body> The icons on my desktop (El Capitan) keep rearranging after every restart. In the same order as well, when I try to rearrange my icons it will let me do so but after a restart the icons revert to the arrangement. Any ideas on why and how to fix it?  <comment277486> Possibly the Finder Menu's View/"sort by" option has been set to something other than "none". <comment277504> @WayfaringStranger No it is set to none. There isn't any order eg. Kind, Alphabetical, Date Modified, or anything. it just froze my desktop to where I can't permanently move icons on the desktop. <comment277555> Try deleting ~/Library/Saved Application State/com.apple.finder.savedState then relaunch the finder. As it's hard to keep the Finder down, it might need a couple of tries, it's not something I've attempted.
