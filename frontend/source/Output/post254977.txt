Strange graphical icon issue with Launchpad <body> I really don't know what is happening with strongLaunchpad/strong.  Every time that I launch it, my icons disappear in some specific strange way.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ljbqt.png" alt="Like that:"  It never happened before.  Would it be related to have organized everything in folders?  <comment317538> You said, "_It never happened before._", before what? Also which version of the OS are you running? <comment317668> Oh, sorry for my bad English, maybe I'm a little bit confusing at trying to express myself... I'm using Sierra, and this is happening, all my icons disappear frequently from launch... Maybe some kind of memory fault... Thats what I'm thinking
