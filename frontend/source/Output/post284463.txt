WiFi Performance via Terminal <body> strongIs it possible to test the performance of a WiFi via the terminal?/strong  Basically, I want to check how good WiFi is in some spaces of my home to figure out where to place a access points.  emCan the terminal help me with that in any way?/em  <answer284474> You can use the built in codeairport/code utility to measure SNR (Signal to Noise Ratio).  It's found in   code/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/Versions/A/Resources/airport/code  What I do is make a symlink to a directory in my path so I can call it without having to remember that long path:  precodeln -s /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/Versions/A/Resources/airport /usr/local/bin/airport /code/pre  Assuming that you are connected to a WiFi network, issue the command:  codeairport -I/code  to print out information of your current connection.  precode$ airport -I      agrCtlRSSI: -65      agrExtRSSI: 0     agrCtlNoise: -90     agrExtNoise: 0           state: running         op mode: station      lastTxRate: 243         maxRate: 300 lastAssocStatus: 0     802.11 auth: open       link auth: wpa2-psk           BSSID: 82:2a:a9:45:f3:25            SSID: StackExchange WiFi Demo             MCS: 14         channel: 157,1 /code/pre  To calculate SNR, you take the RSSI value and subtract the Noise value.  In this case, I have an RSSI of -65dB and a Noise value of -90dB.  Calculated, that gives me 25dB.   Which is a very good signal (just barely but I am behind a reinforced concrete wall away from my AP; not bad actually considering.  strongSNR Guidelines/strong  ul li40dB+ SNR = Excellent signal/li li25dB to 40dB SNR = Very good signal/li li15dB to 25dB SNR = Low signal/li li10dB to 15dB SNR = Very low signal/li li5dB to 10dB SNR = No signal/li /ul  That said..it's not all down to what your SNR is in a given location, you should also consider things like:  ul liWiFi Saturation - excessive number of WiFi signals in the same area/li liClient Load - number of clients attached to a given AP/li liBandwidth utilization - how much bandwidth is consumed by the clients./li /ul  If you have too many WiFi networks competing for the same bandwidth or a combination of too many users or too many bandwidth hogs (everyone watching Netflix 4K on their tablets), this will greatly affect performance beyond what your SNR can tell you.  What I prefer to do is to deploy multiple APs around the house and turn down the transmit power so they don't go very far outside the room I am trying to cover.  I personally use these PoE Access Points from Ubiquiti to cover several areas of my home with great success.  <comment358740> iperf3 _is_ a way to test performance via the Terminal. It seems like you have some terms confused, and what you really want to know is something entirely different. Please describe what it is you're looking for - might it be that you're looking for signal strength, or the approximated bandwidth figure that the WiFi icon in the status bar can show? <comment358751> @Allan Okay. Great allegory! Thanks for explaining WiFi to a noob. ;). Let me rephrase my whole question. I'm trying to tidy up the comments here, in case you were wondering where all the conversation went... <comment358755> Great! Thanks a lot. Is there an option to directly take the output of airport -l and calculate the SNR from the two values. That would be handy for people that can't calculate in their head... <comment358757> I'm sure a script could be written in bash...for instance, you can issue the command `airport -I | grep agrCtlRSSI | cut -d ':' -f 2` to get the RSSI value.  do the same for the Noise value then subtract.  The script isn't too hard, and I encourage you to give it a go...there's nothing like having a small challenge to help you learn to use the Terminal.  :-)
