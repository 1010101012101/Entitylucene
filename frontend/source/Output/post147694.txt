Removing iCloud on an old phone <body> I have iCloud on more than one phone—my old iPhone 5c broke and the screen doesn't work. I now have a new phone with iCloud backed up and it works fine. I want to sell my old phone but they state that iCloud must be removed. How do I do this on icloud.com without wiping my other phone?  <answer147696>    ol   liConnect your iPhone 5c with your PC/Mac and open iTunes/li   liRestore the 5c to factory settings (http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1414)/li   liGo to your Apple Support Profile and de-register it./li   /ol   That should be it.  In addition, you can delete old iPhone Backups from the iCloud:     ol   liGo to Settings  iCloud  Storage &amp; Backup  Manage Storage./li   liTap the name of an iOS device whose backup you don’t need, then tap Delete Backup./li   /ol
