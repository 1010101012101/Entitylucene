2006 iMac will not respond to standard command to restore or anything <body> I have a 2006 iMac and a backup and would like to restore the to the original install. However, it can't be upgraded, its too old, so finding software is impossible.  Tried the Mac OS X Tiger system disk, which is the oldest I have, but its too new!  Tried setting NVRAM, no response.  emCommand+R/em, no response.  Does anyone know how to do it?  <comment321554> You say the Tiger disc is "too new". What happens when you try to use the disc? Do you get nothing on screen? Do you get an error? <comment321621> Please note that Tiger is NOT too new for that computer. The newest OS that that computer can handle is Snow Leopard (10.6.8). Tiger is 10.4. <comment321623> Try inserting the Tiger disc. When you start the computer, hold down the "C" key until you see an image on the screen
