terminal ask for ssh passphrase every time <body> I'm relatively new in the Mac world, and right now I'm having a problem with Terminal. Every time I open Terminal (new tab or new window) I have to insert the SSH pass phrase.  strongWhy? How can I deactivate this?/strong  For example: Terminal asking for passphrase  <comment84024> Did you try to add your SSH key to the agent by adding the command to .bash_profile? <comment84025> sorry but, how i do this? <comment84027> Nevermind, I was trying to guess why it was being triggered, but it looks like it automatically tries to load an SSH key if it finds one in ~/.ssh/id_rsa. Did you generate an SSH key for something? <comment84029> yes, i use it mostly for git <comment84131> Could you open Terminal and post the output of these commands: `cat ~/.bashrc` and `grep -i ssh ~/.?* | grep -v bash_history`? The first outputs a file `bash` reads and executes when Terminal starts. The second one lists all occurrences of word "ssh" in any hidden file in your home directory. <comment85670> 1.
