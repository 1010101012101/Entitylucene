True Full Screen in Firefox? <body> In OSX, how do I have a true full screen? When I go to full screen mode, the tab and navigation bar are still showing. Those toolbars are annoying when I try to watch a movie, etc.  This is the shot of the top of the screen:img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/UZVur.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  EDIT: I realized this may apply to other browsers such as Safari  <answer174128> By default there's no way to do this in native Firefox, but there is an extension called Toolbar Autohide that should do exactly that! It allows you to use your mouse to make it appear again by hovering at the top of the screen where the toolbar would normally be.   Simply install the extension at that link and restart Firefox when it prompts you to do so. After Firefox restarts, right-click the toolbar and select codeMaximized Autohide/code; you should then be ready to go!  I would recommend changing an option for the add-on in the add-on manager (codecommand + shift + a/code), though: under codeGeneral/code, change codeTransition Type/code to codeSlide-in/code to make it a little prettier.  Lastly, keep in mind that hovering your mouse at the top of the screen can make the OS X bar appear as well, which can be mildly annoying (which would happen for almost any extension that does this type of thing). To get around this, make good use of key commands!  ul licodecommand + l/code brings up the address bar so you can immediately start typing in a new URL/li licodecommand + k/code brings up the Firefox menu so you can select your print options, preferences, etc./li licodecommand + t/code creates a new tab and focuses on it/li licodecontrol + tab/code and codecontrol + shift + tab/code allows you to cycle through tabs just like codecommand + tab/code and codecommand + shift + tab/code allows you to cycle through windows in OS X/li /ul  Hope this helps!  <answer174135> One way to do this is by using JavaScript. For Firefox, execute this code:  precodedocument.getElementsByTagName('html')[0].mozRequestFullscreen /code/pre  On Safari, put this in a button codehref/code attribute:  precodejavascript:if(!document.webkitFullscreenElement){document.getElementsByTagName('html')[0].webkitRequestFullscreen();} else{document.webkitExitFullscreen()} /code/pre  Obviously, this isn't very graceful unless in an extension or bookmarklet.  <answer238118> On the about:config page search for the following key and set it to false  strongfull-screen-api.allow-trusted-requests-only/strong  Then you can create a bookmark 'emlink/em' with the following 'emlocation/em':  codejavascript:document.getElementsByTagName('html')[0].mozRequestFullScreen();void(0)/code  <comment204913> Chrome has a presentation mode. <comment204930> Most website movie players have a full-screen button (usually two arrows pointing to opposite corners of the screen) that enlarges the movie to fill the screen completely. Use that instead of the green Zoom button in the upper-left corner of the window. <comment224196> Note that the recommended extension is not verified for use in Firefox Developer Edition, but works nonetheless. <comment252232> Unfortunately, it seems the author has removed the extension from the link you've provided. <comment271121> `TypeError: document.getElementByTagName is not a function`  needs to be Elements (note the s), in Firefox 43 on OS X anyway <comment340797> Replacement which works as of Jan 2017: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/fullscreen-plus/ <comment343724> @zwol unfortunately that addon completely removes all toolbars when in full screen mode. This is not recommended, because all tools now are not available. Also, security may be compromised, because the address bar (which shows some security info, e.g. https and certificates) is permanently hidden unless full screen is exited. I'm still looking for an addon that does what it should in true full screen.
