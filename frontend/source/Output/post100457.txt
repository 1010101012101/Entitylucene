Do any of these Steam software titles run without internet connection? <body> I'm having difficulties playing games without a live connection to the internet (actually to the steam servers).  Is this a configuration issue or a limitation in the following game titles:  ul liTomb Raider 2013/li liPAYDAY 2/li liDead Island/li /ul  I'm hoping to host multiplayer games with my friends without needing Wi-Fi or LAN that connects to the Internet or an external / central game server.   <answer100519> On the Steam website (through the links you listed) the only one listing "broadband internet connection" as a requirement is TR 2013. The other two have no requirements for internet connection indicated.  That said, I have not played any of those games so I cannot certify that the specifications are correct. But I would think they are pretty careful with those, given all the debate going on regarding internet connection requirements for gaming.  On the other hand, I am quite sure that if you want to host multiplayer games with your friends you DO need some kind of LAN connection (wi-fi or wired).
