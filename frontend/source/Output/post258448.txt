AppleScript: Cannot click Menulet (Menu Bar 2) for Third Party App <body> I am trying to create an Applescript to automate an interaction with an application that has a third-party menulet (menu bar item, top right corner). The application in question is called Pomodoro One. It does not have built-in Applescript support, so I want to create a script that clicks on its menu bar and presses "Start Pomodoro".  After hours of research on the Internet and experimentation with emScript Editor/em, plus the creation of a visual automation with Automator, I have come up with this script that emSHOULD/em work:  precodetell application "Pomodoro One"     activate end tell tell application "System Events"     tell UI element "Pomodoro One"         tell menu bar item 1 of menu bar 2             click menu item 1 of menu 1         end tell     end tell end tell /code/pre  However, it does not work. Surprising, especially since the the automation in Automator works and this script is basically a paraphrasing of the Applescript that Automator converts its visual automation into. This is the error that I get, both from ScriptEditor as well as running the Applescript in Automator:  precodeSystem Events got an error: Canâ€™t get menu 1 of menu bar item 1 of menu bar 2 of UI element "Pomodoro One". Invalid index. /code/pre  What I think is happening is that when Applescript attempts to click on codemenu bar 2/code (which represents the menulet), the menu that is supposed to appear does not. As if the click is totally not happening. However, I am indeed able to click on codemenu bar 1/code (which represents Pomodoro One's main menu bar). This is stumping why clicking on codemenu bar 2/code yields nothing, especially since UI debugging apps like UI Browser indeed report that the menulet is represented by codemenu bar 2/code when I do visual profiling of the UI.  I am hours into this and I feel very stuck. I am wondering if there is any way that I can get Applescript to play nice with the menulet of any third party applicaton.  strongEDIT/strong  Based on this post (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20595708/applescript-to-click-on-a-specific-icon-in-the-mac-menu-bar), I modified my script to be the following:  precodeignoring application responses     tell application "System Events" to tell process "Pomodoro One"         click menu bar item 1 of menu bar 2     end tell end ignoring do shell script "killall System\\ Events" delay 0.1 tell application "System Events" to tell process "Pomodoro One"     tell menu bar item 1 of menu bar 2         click menu item "Start Pomodoro" of menu 1     end tell end tell /code/pre  This time, it results in the script infinitely spinning and eventually timing out with error -1712: codeSystem Events got an error: AppleEvent timed out./code I can assure you that I have accessibility enabled, via System Preferences -- Security and Privacy -- Accessibility for both Pomodoro One and Script Editor.  <answer258586> Go to:  "Preferences/Keyboard/Shortcuts/App Shortcuts" and see if you can add an app keyboard shortcut then use the keyboard shortcut in your script.
