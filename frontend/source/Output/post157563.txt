Yosemite Messages: Support for a separate speaker for notifications? <body> I'm using a jabber account with Messages for voice and video calling, as well as chat. I also use a headset most of the time, and have it set as my primary audio device, but want to hear if someone tries to call or send me a message.   Does Messages support the ability to set different speakers for conversations and notifications a la Skype?   I have poked around in the preferences and done a bit of Googling, with no luck.  <answer157616> Looks like this is not possible after all.  <comment185284> There is no way to do this, as far as I am aware.
