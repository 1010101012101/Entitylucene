Registered Apple Developer Agreement when under 18 <body> When I registered to be an Apple Developer, I inadvertently did so without realizing the requirement to be 18 years of age (I was 17 and 6 months away from being 18 at the time). I did not take out any sort of paid membership at the time, however.  I am now 20, will this cause me any problems now or is it nothing I need to worry about?  <answer84794> You of legal age now, and meet the current age requirement of the agreement with Apple, so there's nothing to worry about.  <comment97642> I'm no lawyer, but you're of legal age now, and that's what matters. I think Apple's legal department has much bigger things to worry about! <comment97644> I thought so, thanks.
