I get errors when trying to install GTK+3 on my Mac OSX 10.9 system <body> I'm trying to install GTK+3 on my Mac OSX 10.9 system to run a pyGObject project I've been developing in Ubuntu. It runs perfectly on Ubuntu, so I wanted to test cross-platform compatibility. I'm following the directions on wiki.gnome.org.  I finished the part where I run the codesh gtk-osx-build-setup.sh/code command. It loads everything perfectly (as far as I can tell). However, if I do a codewhich jhbuild/code or try a command, I get an error:  precodeEnvironmentError: MacOSX10.9.sdk not found jhbuild: could not load config file  /code/pre  Any suggestions on how to fix this and finish installing codejhbuild/code? It seems like the instructions from their webpage are a little incomplete or perhaps I'm not adding to path correctly?  Questions:  ol liWhich file do I put the path? Is it code.bashrc/code or code.bash_profile/code (neither have worked so far). Perhaps some other file is my bash profile script?/li liWhat is the path to the jhbuild? In the example, it says codealias jhbuild="PATH=gtk-prefix/bin:$PATH jhbuild"/code, but I'm not actually sure what I should substitute in for codegtk-prefix/code (not sure where the actual path is, since codewhich jhbuild/code doesn't work)./li /ol  <answer139837> Forgive me if this is a silly question but do you have Xcode installed?  The OSX SDK should be installed on your system within the Xcode application bundle. You should be able to find it at code/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.9.sdk//code.  If Xcode isn't installed you can install it for free from here.  <comment164789> It is ~/.bash_profile to edit the PATH for use in terminal see http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/119714/237 - we need to see what is in this file. The easiest way to install complex C programs is to use a package manager e.g. Macports, Homebrew <comment164793> I would second Mark's suggestion though. Using [Homebrew](http://brew.sh) is a LOT less painful. <comment164936> Xcode says it's installed and up to date. <comment164937> I'm having the same problem with a CentOS 6.4 install and even though it's in the PATH in the .bashrc, it doesn't allow me to `import gi` in Python. A real pain, so far. It is resulting in lost time, so I'm using PyGtk with GTK+2 and it's working fine so far as a temporary solution. <comment164938> And I agree, Homebrew is the way to go.
