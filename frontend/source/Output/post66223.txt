Windows gives me a message offering to scan and fix <body> Every time I plug in my 80GB iPod Classic windows offers to scan and fix it for me. Should I allow this?  I do have a problem in that a lot of album artwork won't show even though I have tried clearing artwork and reloading it. The artwork is there in iTunes it just doesn't synch onto my iPod, even though iTunes correctly identifies the changes. I recently suffered a PC HDD crash that required me to purchase a new computer, my iTunes backup discs failed to restore iTunes so I used a third party program to rip my iPod to save me having to reload about 50GB of music! This seemed to highlight a problem with my Classic as a few of the albums caused the program to freeze.   Could it be bad sectors on the Classic HDD that is causing this? Would a restart or restore help? Does restore format the HDD and possibly allow it to operate as it used to do?
