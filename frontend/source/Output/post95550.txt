Applescript, quit app if other app is quit <body> I have a (very basic) apple script that I use as a trigger to start and hijack Plex, using Audio Hijack Pro.   precodetell application "Audio Hijack Pro" start hijacking session named "Plex" end tell tell application "Plex"     activate end tell /code/pre  Where the last three lines just ensure Plex is in the foreground.   Here is where my question comes in. If possible, I would like to extend my script a little; it should keep running while Hijack Audio Pro is hijacking Plex, and quit Hijack Audio Pro if Plex is quit. Does anyone know how to achieve this?  <answer95553> I've only dabbled in Applescript, but would you be able to create a second script that is basically reversed? In English it would look like:  precodetell Plex to quit then tell Audio Hijack Pro to quit /code/pre
