8GB model iPhone 4S is only showing 5.4GB capacity (4.2GB available) <body> It used to say 8GB capacity in the General  About Settings menu. Now it only says 5.4. I've done a "restore as new" but it's still showing the same.  Help?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FPwAk.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer189368> The operating system (OS: iOS 8.x) is using up space as well and you're not able to use this space. The phone comes with 8GB, yes, but minus the space used for the OS. I think Apple got into problems when they advertised with 8GB/16GB etc. while people could only effectively use that space MINUS the space used by the OS.  <comment224537> On my 64 GB it displays a capacity of 56.6 GB so I assume this is the iOS using that space and the file system itself ( but 7.4 GB is a lot). <comment224554> well it's true that the OS is taking up the space, but I don't think Apple is special about that or even got in trouble, it's standard in the industry to state capacity with OS, also they still sell 8 GB of storage . <comment224557> Oh, it's definitely an industry standard, but it is odd imo. It's like advertising a 12oz can of soda, neglecting to mention that 2oz are reserved for future use. Just seems a bit odd. <comment224609> A pair of Florida men sued Apple for it. Not sure about the outcome though.
