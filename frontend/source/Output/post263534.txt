iPhone 6 gmail sent mail not showing sent to <body> Gmail is showing the sent mail as sent BY (me) but not the sent TO. We've gone to settings but aren't finding many options. We removed the account, deleted the app, restarted phone, reinstalled the app, re-added the account. Any suggestions? Thanks in advance.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fvDWZ.png" alt="enter image description here"
