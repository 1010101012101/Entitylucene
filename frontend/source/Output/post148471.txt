How to have iTunes 11 (11.4) not download old podcasts? <body> I tried upgrading from iTunes 10.7 to 11.4 (on a Snow Leopard 10.6.8 system).  I have lots of "saved" episodes from feeds that have years-old back content.  I started by moving the Music/iTunes directory out of my user directory, then upgraded iTunes, launched it, set it to not sync to iCloud and not to delete any podcast episodes, then quit iTunes, moved the directory back into place, then relaunched iTunes.  All my episodes seemed to stay with me, so that was good.  However, now iTunes is trying to download old episodes marked with a cloud icon down to my Mac.  This would add up to hundreds of gigs, so there's no way I can let this occur. I changed the "Download Episodes" Default Settings (from the "My Podcast" pane) to "off"; this stopped the downloading of back content, but did not download any new content.  When I set the per-feed setting back to Download:On, back content was downloaded.  IIRC, iTunes 11.3 had a "Download Recent" setting (can't remember if it was a default setting or a per-feed setting only). Is that still available in 11.4?  I've downgraded back to iTunes 10.7 (which works sufficiently well), but obviously need to solve this before I can upgrade to an iPhone 6 (currently 4S running iOS 5, so no Podcasts app).  Any suggestions would be appreciated.
