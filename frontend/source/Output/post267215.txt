Apple guidelines for back button <body> Are there any guidelines for the position of the back button?  I always see the back button at the top-left part of the screen, but I don't know the exact position I should place it.  <answer267218> It is specified in the iOS Human Interface Guidelines that there is a default back button positioned in the top left. In full, it reads:     A navigation bar appears at the top of an app screen, below the status bar, and enables navigation through a series of hierarchical app screens. When a new screen is displayed, a back button, often labeled with the title of the previous screen, appears on the left side of the bar. Sometimes, the right side of a navigation bar contains a control, such as an Edit or a Done buttonâ€¦   More information can be found in the API documentation on the UINavigationBar.   <comment335221> I more question... when I build the app in the iPhone, the button is automatic spawned or I must implement it? <comment335239> @daniel Coding questions should be asked on Stack Overflow <comment335283> this is not a coding question, I'm just asking if I need to implement it or not, it's an apple guideline issue <comment335284> @caorongjin im not using navigation bar. This guideline is for navigation bar <comment335354> @Daniel you'll need to be more specific in the OP  then, because the navigation bar is the standard place for the back button and the guidelines are explained as such. <comment335362> And I agree with @patrix, that this is beginning to look more like a coding question. <comment335365> @daniel Comments should not be used for follow-up questions, we usually ask people to create a new question in such situations. Looking at the direction your question is heading I wouldn't be surprised if other users would recommend closure (or migration to StackOverflow). Even if not, you'll get better answers on coding-related matters on SO than here (because AD mainly focuses on end-user stuff).
