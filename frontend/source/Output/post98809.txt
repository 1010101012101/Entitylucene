VirtualBox Ubuntu shared folder is empty <body> I have a Ubuntu virtual machine (Virtual Box) hosted on my MBP w/ Mountain Lion.  OSX 10.8.6, VirtualBox 4.2.16, Ubuntu 12.4 LTS (32 bit)  PROBLEM The shared folder(s) as seen in Ubuntu is/are empty.  hr  h3Diary of searching for an answer on interwebs (No joy so far)/h3  Share folder in VirtualBox Host=Mac OS, Guest=Debian  - No joy. The answer is for manual mounting. Auto mounting explicitly puts/mounts the shared folder in code/media/code directory. Besides I tried it and got "no such file or directory" - but then I may not be understanding exactly where I'm creating this; no terminal guru, I.  Next ...  Set the shared folder via codeVirtualBox | Devices | shared folders/code menu. The dialog box indicates "full" access and "auto-mount". Then launched the VM. The shared folder is created, but empty. BTW, the folders are created in code/media/code directory per the VB documentation.   After launching the VM, in Ubuntu, using codeVB | Devices/code menu, created a new shared folder. Restart Ubuntu, folder is created but empty.  Next ...  Tried the above, creating "machine folder" and/or "transient folder" - same result as above.  Next ...  Tried the above referencing folders on both drives on my MBP. Same result.  Next ...  Tried adding my logged-in user to the codevboxsf/code group in Ubuntu. codeuseradd -g vboxsf someUser/code Ubuntu responded:  codeuseradd: user 'someUser' already exists/code  <answer98823> strongFound my answer/strong  Assumption: "VirtualShare" is the shared folder name set up via codeDevices | shared folders .../code menu  precodesudo mkdir /mnt/MyShare sudo mount -t vboxsf VirtualShare /mnt/MyShare /code/pre  AH! Now I can see the files in code/mnt/MyShare/VirtualShare//code  ul lithe mounting :( does not survive a restart/reboot/li /ul  This answer is bewildering because the VirtualBox documentation explicitly states that auto mounting is done in code/media/code directory. And indeed, the shared folder is created - but its empty.  Further, I did/do not understand the significance of code/mnt/code directory. That looked arbitrary to me, but apparently not. code../MyShare/code piece of it is; use any name you wish.  Now if I could only delete all those folders I created during experimentation. And to think I used to be an absolute wiz on the codeCP/M/code command line! (that sure dates me!!)  <answer195233> In my case, I have found a temporary way to bypass this. by using   codels -la/code   I found out that the folder belongs to root instead of the user that was created when I provisioned the VM. Since trying to change the owner of the folder or its content did not work, I copied the folder to my home directory  codesudo cp -r foldername ~/foldername/code  then I was able to change the owner of the target folder and its content.  codechown -R myusername:myusername ~/foldername/code  <answer206797> Suppose Virtual_Share is the name given to the shared folder as shown below.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LS9Iq.png" alt="enter image description here"  Create a directory in a desired place, e.g., /media/VirtualShare  Open this file  code$ sudo gedit /etc/profile/code  Add the following line in the file then save and close.  codemount -t vboxsf Virtual_Share /media/VirtualShare/code  Source the code/etc/profile/code file in Terminal...  code$ sudo source /etc/profile/code  ... or just reboot.  This solved it for me.  <answer237323> I had the same/similar problem with empty folders for shared folders (e.g. in code/media/sf_my_folder_name/code)  It turned out that although I thought I has installed the guest additions, in fact the installation had failed. (check this by running codelsmod | grep -i vbox/code - if the install worked you should get output referring to vboxsf, vboxguest &amp; vboxvideo)  To install manually, I first ran 'insert guest additions CD image..' from the codeDevices/code menu to mount it, then from a terminal window ran   precodesudo sh /media/build/VBOXADDITIONS_5.0.8_103449//VBoxLinuxAdditions.run /code/pre  then, check that your folder is mounted ( Settings/ Shared folders/ add ..) before rebooting.  The mounted, non-empty folder should then be in  code/media/sf_your_folder_name/code  <comment145013> Having the exact same problem on a Windows 7 host and Ubuntu 12.0.4 guest. The auto-mounted folder that appears on /media/sf... is empty (and lacks permission unless I chmod them). Using mount -t vboxsf works great, but it doesn't persist after rebooting.. Did anyone find a proper solution to this problem? <comment207705> Any update on this? That mount command you posted doesn't work for me, I have to actually reinstall the VirtualBox Guest Additions every time and then when I restart the mount folder is empty and I have to reinstall the Guest Additions again. Very frustrating. <comment207746> Ah, I figured out what the problem was. I had a startup script that was interfering with the VirtualBox Guest Additions, so all I had to do was instead of starting the script via init.d, I used Ubuntu's "Startup Applications" application and made sure that my script was started AFTER the "vboxclient" (apps here start in alphabetical order). <comment249276> I would like to add an insight to this question. This problem occurs mainly when the shared folder name is changed. <comment298815> "VirtualShare", which one is trying to mount, is like a tag to the actual windows folder. This tag is generated, when the windows-folder is added in the virtual-box shared-folder "machine/transient". Ensure, this has been done already. And then the above command will work with no issues.
