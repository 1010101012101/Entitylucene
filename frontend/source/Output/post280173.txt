How to make bootable CDROM or USB from floppy? <body> I have a bootable floppy that boots just fine on old PCs. I want to boot it however on my 2015 Macbook Pro, which does not have the BIOS (whereas my 2013 MBP did). So I cannot on the 2015 model even boot a Linux CD.  I have an ISO header that will let me create a readable CDROM, but not a bootable CDROM. (Command is: cat isoheader.img floppy.img  cdrom.iso)  The Apple bless command gives an error when I add the --legacy switch.  What to do?  PS: I cannot use bootcamp as I do not have enough free drive space.  <answer280197> ol liIf you don't have the ISO use disk utility to take an image of your floppy. /li liUse the app from etcher.io to "burn" this ISO to a USB drive. /li /ol  Now if the image itself is not bootable, that might be a better answered on a different stack-exchange.   <comment352364> This question looks like an [x-y-problem](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/66377/what-is-the-xy-problem)! Which Linux distribution do you want to boot on your MBP 2015? <comment352365> I want to boot MenuetOS. <comment352375> Even if I could boot my Mac with it, I wouldn't! Just run it in  a virtual machine. <comment352379> No I don't want to use a vm. I want a real solution. <comment352397> I'd rather just generate it from the command-line. How do I know this Etcher doesn't have malware in it? <comment352400> https://github.com/resin-io/etcher it's open source <comment352549> Etcher doesn't build. It says: make: jq: Command not found <comment352550> Etcher appear to be written in JS... bizarre.
