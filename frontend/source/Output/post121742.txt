What is the VPN icon in the menu bar? <body> I have long wondered what the significance of the VPN icon in the menu bar is:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/IPtlw.png" alt="vpn icon"  Anyone know?  Edit:  I think people are misunderstanding my question.  It is the icon for the built-in OSX VPN.  I use it regularly.  My question is what the icon itself represents.  A padlock?  A tunnel? A spaceship?  <answer121751> It is what it says it is - a VPN (virtual private network) indicator. I use it every day to connect to the office. The VPN gives me a secure, encrypted tunnel through a potentially insecure public network (like a cafe or airport).  That indicator changes when you're connected, and optionally you see how long you've been connected alongside it.  This is only for Apple's built-in VPN; there are others like Cisco AnyConnect, that use different encryption protocols; those don't use that icon. You must have a VPN set up on your computer for that to appear (SystemPreferences-Network, in the left hand column)  <answer121761> There's a few people think it's an RSA SecurID tag:  http://osx.tribe.net/thread/1ba4a52c-807c-4c6f-bf73-5561bcc208ed  http://www.mactalk.com.au/11/58913-what-does-vpn-menubar-icon-mean.html  Don't know if I buy it though.  <answer121789> If you have zoom turned on and zoom in real tight on that icon, it does -in a vague sort of way-, look like one of those RSA SecureID tokens that some companies pass out  <comment141942> Not sure. Click around. Is it from a program you installed or an OS X built-in feature?

I have always wondered the same thing! I don't think it represents anything but am not sure. <comment142009> Still not a 100% answer, but this does seem most likely.  Thanks! <comment142015> As you can see, people get confused about questions that can be summarized as "That thing I just explained - Why did Apple do that?" Have a peek at [help] and feel free to edit this to make a practical case as to why you need to know the answer or how it affects you getting something done that's on-topic and we can reopen this. <comment142016> @bmike you're right, I have no practical need to know this - just a long standing curiosity. <comment142044> By the way, the file is at `/System/Library/CoreServices/Menu Extras/VPN.menu/Contents/Resources/VPN0.pdf`.
