terminal folder access <body> having a trouble to access few folders in my root user. For example: cannot access - codeIdeas Infinitas/code, codeTreehouse workshops/code folders. At the same time I can access codetest_app/code and some other folders.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zundH.png" alt="logged in as a root user"  My root user is the user I'm logged in with, find image below.  How do I have an access to these folders?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ppo4j.png" alt="directory utility"  <answer178838> The folder name contains a space which means that the shell interprets it as two separate arguments. Either escape the space with a code\/code or enclose the string in code"/code.  precodecd "folder name" cd folder\ name /code/pre  <comment211898> Many thanks grgarside. It was that simple :) <comment211899> Being logged in as **root** using a Terminal while not knowing how to use it is a dangerous combination! <comment211901> so you were born knowing all the answers to the life's questions, so it seems :) congrats <comment211902> No, nor did I say anything of the sort and what I previous said was only meant  to be cautionary in nature.  The **root** account in OS X is disabled by default for very good reasons. <comment211939> Well, apologies to you sir/madame. It was out of order from my saide to assert the situation the way I did.
