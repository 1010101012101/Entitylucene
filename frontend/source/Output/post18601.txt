iWork Problem Under Lion <body> After installing Lion the iWork applications no longer have a "Save As" command in the file menu.  It is common that I want to use an existing document, save it as a different file name, and then modify it.  I'm sure I can make a copy but that's more work than it's worth. The help file continues to insist that there is a "Save As" feature in the File menu.  <answer18603> In the File menu below codeSave.../code or codeSave a Version/code you have an option called codeDuplicate/code. This opens a new window with the current state of the file you're editing and you can now use codeFile &gt; Save.../code to save it with different file name.  <answer18604> The "Save As" feature has been replaced by Lion's new Versions feature.   You have to perform more steps now though, because first you need to codeDuplicate/code the document   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZaD9O.png" alt="Duplicate Menu entry in Keynote"  a new version will "jump" out of the current document.  You'll notice that codeSave/code in the File menu is now changed to codeSave.../code  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/XjWO7.png" alt="Save... Menu entry in Keynote"  I'm pretty sure that "Save as" will return shortly as this doesn't exactly make the process any easier...
