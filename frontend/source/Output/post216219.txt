Which devices and iOS versions do support iAP2? <body> Is there any information available about; which devices and which versions of iOS do support iAP2? (iPod Accessory Protocol 2 - 7th Chapter)  Is this information available on the phone? Can you somehow look it up, if the phone supports iAP2?  I would like to test some of the features of this new version.  Thank you very much for any help.  <answer219500> The technical specification for iAP2 is only available to the members of the MFi licensing program  This information can't be found on the phone. Most of the devices with up-to-date iOS version should support the protocol, but the actual list and technical details are only available for the members of the MFi licensing program.
