How do I easily reset the iPod database on my iPhone 3GS iOS 5.0.1? <body> Some of my podcasts (the parent entries) are showing up twice, and others not at all, but I just watched it sync them this morning so apparently the tracks are on the phone.  Preferably I would be able to do this from the phone without resyncing, since I'm at the office, but I can obviously wait till I get home. (I can even switch over to spotify and just jam out instead of doing podcasts)  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HjraV.png" alt="A picture from my phone showing duplicate entries that are out of alphabetical order"  As you can see from the image above, there is a duplicate on emHerding Code/em and they're out of alphabetical order.  <comment36251> Have you checked that there isn't a space in the title of one of the duplicates? This would make it think it is a different show. <comment36252> Well, the same shows are listed under each, iTunes only has it once, and I've been listening to that podcast for ~15 months?
