General System Preferences won't save on Max OSX Mavericks <body> Under System Preferences  General, there seems to be one setting, on my computer, that won't save. Regardless of what I set it to, it always reverts to "Always":  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/oyjVp.png" alt="picture of max osx mavericks scrolling settings under system preferences &gt; general"  I have tried the following:  ol liGoing to my home folder, selecting "Get Info," and applying R+W to all enclosed folders. This solution was detailed on the Apple support forums. I have also tried it programatically with codechmod 755/code./li liDeleting the codecom.apple.systempreferences.plist/code file under code/Library/Preferences/code, logging out, and logging back in./li /ol  I decided to make a new user account and see whether the problem would be replicated. However, under this new account, I was able to change this setting to "When scrolling" or "Automatically based on mouse or trackpad." It applied the new setting.  What could be going wrong and how can I go about fixing this? I really don't want my scrollbars to show all the time, especially if I'm not using a mouse.  <comment169441> Could it be a app that is overwriting your settings. To test start in safe mode, very it works, then add app one by one. <comment169442> @Buscar웃 But then why would I be able to change settings on another user account? <comment169443> Because that user account might not have that application. <comment169444> @Buscar웃 Is there a way to easily check whether a user account has access to certain apps? <comment169445> @Buscar웃 I just tried the safe booting thing. The setting still won't save. <comment169447> In case you have a problem with preferences settings not saving, that indicates your user ACL need repair. Follow instructions here: http://macs.about.com/od/Troubleshooting/qt/Mac-Troubleshooting-Reset-User-Account-Permissions.htm <comment169448> @Buscar웃 I just followed that guide to a T—didn't work. I haven't a clue as to what could be causing this. I guess it'd be better to make a new admin account and transfer all my data (except this would probably cause the problem to be transferred over along with my files). <comment169449> Then you definitely have a app doing it. <comment169450> @Buscar웃 Is the a way to find out which app is affecting which settings? <comment169451> Maybe, but I would just use the Activity monitor and close them from there one by one.
