Where is my Java console on OS X? <body> I can't find the Java console in Preferences nor in Utilities.  Can I open the Java console from a Terminal command?  Running OS X 10.7.5 and Java version 1.6.0_65  <answer152730> It is somewhat maddening, but the Java console won't display unless a Java application is actually running. The easiest way to get it started is to visit https://www.java.com/verify/ from the Firefox browser.  <answer252425> If you're opening a Runnable Jar (one which you click in finder to open), just try running it in terminal (from Spotlight search) using codejava -jar /path/to/file.jar/code.  If it's a Java Web Applet, you need to go into codeSystem Preferences/code - codeJava/code - codeAdvanced/code - codeShow Console/code - codeApply/code. From here, you'll need to actually run the program before the console displays, as @danorton said.
