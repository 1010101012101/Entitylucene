(Page 15 half way on that specific page)  Bare in mind I am not using a server and everything will be done locally.  <answer200705> One approach is to use Acrobat to add the links. When manually adding links, you specify the view to which the link points. With that, you can set the exact place where the linked to document opens.  If you have suitable software to create your "second" document, you can use Named Destinations, which can be used as target for the link.  <comment241880> Isn't this possible using an anchor in the second pdf?
