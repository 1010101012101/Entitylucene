Permanently Disable/Ignore Secondary Disk? <body> I have a 256G SSD and a 1T HDD in my 27" iMac.  The 1T HDD is dying due to hardware failure.  Is there a file in OS X similar to code/etc/fstab/code in Linux where I can prevent this 1T HDD from mounting?  I'd like to effectively disable/ignore this disk without needing to take it into an Apple store to be removed.  <answer145686> Yes!  First get the UUID of the partition you want to prevent from mounting...  You can get this in Disk Utility "Get Info".  Now open your /etc/fstab file for editing:  precodesudo pico /etc/fstab /code/pre  In this file add the following line (use your own UUID naturally):  precodeUUID=[your UUID] none hfs rw,noauto 0 0 /code/pre  And save the file.  Restart for the change to take affect.  You can always mount it manually in Disk Utility.  <answer145690> Similar to Linux.  The preferred disk identifier a Volume UUID.  You can use disk utility to find the Volume UUID or use diskutil:     diskutil list   get the disk indentifier, e.g. disk0s4     diskutil information disk0s4   In the row labeled Volume UUID:       Volume UUID:              XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX   Edit /etc/fstab as root (it may not exist), creating an entry of the form:  UUID=XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX none hfs rw,noauto  Also refer to      man -S5 fstab   <comment171724> Related: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/86257/how-can-i-tell-osx-not-to-mount-some-of-the-drives-in-my-computer/111024#111024 <comment171739> Thank you. This works in terms of preventing the disk from mounting, but I can still hear what sounds like the needle scanning on the platters repeatedly. Can anything more be done to kill power to the drive altogether - short of opening up the iMac? <comment171740> Thank you.

Preferences  Energy Saver - Put hard disk to sleep when possible,  does it persist through a power down/boot up? <comment171804> I went through a full power cycle, instead of restarting. The computer was off for about 8 hours. That seemed to fix it *(for now)*. <comment171816> That puppy sounds seriously sick.
