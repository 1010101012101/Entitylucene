Fastest way to split a video file into two? <body> Does anyone know of software for OS X that can quickly split a 2 hour H.264 video file into two 1 hour files? iMovie estimates 2 hours just to import the file. I was hoping for something that could do it quicker.  <answer5117> The easiest tool would probably be Quicktime 7 Pro.  I believe it is available on Apple's store for $30.  If you prefer a CLI method, take a look at mp4box.  It has a -split option that does what you're describing.  <answer5120> Some other options are:  ul liSplitfuse ($12, free to try)/li liSimple Video Splicer which looks free, but I havn't tried it. You'll see the link on the right of the dev's page. /li /ul  <answer5124> You might also be able to do this using Quicktime X. Open the movie, then choose Edit - Trim... Trim away the second part of the movie file and do a save as to get the first part in a separate file. Re-open the original file and trim away the first part, save as to get the second part in a separate file.   I've only been able to try it with a 5 minute long movie, which was quick enough, but I'm unsure of how quickly it'll work with a 2 hour movie.  <answer5149> http://www.hjsplit.org/  Completely free, completely awesome.  <answer146634> h1Movie Splitter/h1     Split MPEG-4 movies with ease and speed.   Movie Splitter can split your H.264 (.mp4) movie into two halves. A multi-gigabyte split typically takes a minute or two. The bulk of the time is spent reading and writing the file.  If an application takes longer than a few minutes, it is likely re-encoding your movie. You do not want this because it risks reducing the quality of your split movie files.  Please note I wrote Movie Splitter and am likely bias.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/BqOoj.jpg" alt="Miln Movie Splitter for Mac OS X"  <comment5240> Not really an answer for the question you asked, but I've found it's quicker to add clips to iMovie by opening the iMovie project bundle and dragging the clip into the `Media` folder. When next opened, the clip is in the library and can be used, no waiting. <comment5257> Beautiful solution, Lizzan. Fast, free, readily available. Thanks. <comment5275> @jlpp: Glad I could help! =) <comment238837> This is working fine. And for 2 hour movie it takes only 3 minute. <comment249941> Why don't you note that your Movie Splitter works ONLY with Canon Hybrid format video? <comment250023> Movie Splitter works with `mp4` format, as recognised by [AVFoundation Framework](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/AudioVideo/Conceptual/AVFoundationPG/Articles/00_Introduction.html)/QuickTime on OS X. A well formed MPEG4 movie with chapter markers should work.

The OP needs to split a video file into two video files. <comment323747> Even in at the end of 2016, in Sierra, this is still the best solution. Thanks!
