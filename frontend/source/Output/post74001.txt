Fails to upload song and starts back at Step 1 <body> I just added two songs to iTunes. They are long songs (60 minutes long) and are about 150 MB each. (The iTunes Match limit per song is 200 MB.) I added them to iTunes, and when Match tried to upload them (because it couldn't find a match) it uploaded the first one for about 10 seconds, then failed and started back at Step 1.  I assume the problem is the song's size; I also heard that iTunes Match, when uploading, tends to "choke" on its own upload and subsequently fail.  Is there anything I can do to fix this, so that I can add these two songs to my iTunes library?
