Text insertion cursor very hard to see over black background <body> The text insertion cursor is very hard to see over black background. Are there any tweaks to make it easier to see?   <answer227341> I use MouseCape. You can find premade "Capes" for your cursor online, or draw your own and save them as png images. It does take some tinkering around if you're a perfectionist, but I made a really beautiful one in InkScape and use it all the time now. Albeit it took me like half an hour to get the size right in MouseCape so...have patience. ;)  Here is the design I currently use:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GJplZ.png" alt="Vlad&#39;s favorite vertical I-Bar cursor"  This is a copy that I modified to work better on black backgrounds:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kE1zP.png" alt="enter image description here"  Here is an example of it on black:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/axMGP.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Let me know if you'd like me to make you a custom one, like an all white version or white with a thin black outline.
