Problems upgrading my iphone from iOS6 to iOS7 <body> I have problems when I attempt to upgrade my iPhone from iOS6 to iOS7. I went so many time to general and software update but it will run checking for hours and nothing and I need to have iOS 7 or up.   <answer148408> Apple has stopped signing iOS 7 for all except legacy products [essentially iPhone 4]br If your device is capable, your only choice now is to go to iOS 8, unless you wanted to risk jailbreaking it.  [Source IPSW Downloads]  That link is also good for downloading the specific ipsw file for that device, allowing you to manually initiate the update from iTunes - covered by How can I restore my device with simply ipsw file and iTunes?  <answer151013> You can check apple signing status and download the correct firmware and software from ipsw rocks if you need any help then contact me via this site.  <comment174801> Which iPhone did you try to upgrade?
