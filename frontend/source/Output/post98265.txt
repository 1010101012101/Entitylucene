What does "Other" represent when looking at iTunes representation of free space on an iDevice? <body> In the graphical space representation of my iPhone, the codeOther/code category takes a pretty big chunk.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LA4i5.png" alt="enter image description here"  How can I find out what is in the codeOther/code category?  If it's text messages from the last 4 years that I've owned iPhones, how can I browse them?  <answer98267> h2What is the Other space/h2  On an iPhone, the codeOther/code storage can be classified as one of the following:  precode    Browser cache     Mail cache     Mail messages     Mail attachments     Safari's Reading List     iTunes Backups     Effects of jailbreaking your iDevice     Game data     Saved data files     Call history     Notes     Media     Voice memos /code/pre  h2How to Remove It/h2  Just follow these steps (Check the articles listed below for more information):  ol liDelete the browser cache (and Reading Lists in Safari)./li liDelete and re-add your mail account./li liRemove unimportant text messages./li /ol  This will allow you to remove the majority of the extra "stuff" that clogs your space.

This means operating system settings and data, Safari cache, Siri cache, downloaded maps, reminders, notes, stocks, weather data, email, texts, imessages, and data for all of the apps on your phone. 1 GB is normal for Other. It can be much larger if you have a lot of apps or have apps that use a lot of data, such as Facebook.   If you want to have a small Other don't install any apps, don't use email, don't save texts, don't use maps...but then why would you have an iPhone in the first place? Other is not a problem; it is what the phone is for.   You can use 3rd party apps like CleanMyPhone, PhoneClean to remove the data from your device  Resources: https://discussions.apple.com/message/23825850#23825850
