Save HTML as PDF without metadata (e.g. date/time, URL) <body> In Safari or Firefox, saving a web page as PDF (âŒ˜P  PDF  Save as PDF...) includes the page's title, URL, page number, and date/time in the resulting PDF.  Is there a way to generate a PDF without this metadata?  <answer140474> Yes. Before you save the PDF select "Show Details" and select Safari (or whatever) from the drop down, then uncheck "Print headers and footers".  Then save as PDF.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/cFGZI.png" alt="print dialog"
