Add Directory Service to macOS image <body> I'm trying to add an Active Directory service to macOS image. I know how to bind AD on a Mac but I was looking for an automated way to do it for a large deployment 50â€“100 Macs, strongi.e add it in an image profile./strong What's the best practice for this?  <answer294133> Depends on how you created the image.  If you're using the installer as your source then there's a pane for adding directory servers.  If you're using an installed system as the source then you may have to use something like the dsconfigad command in a script to bind.
