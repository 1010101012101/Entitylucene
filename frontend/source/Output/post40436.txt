How to know the name of UI elements using Accessibility inspector (or any other tool) <body> I'm trying to interact with a print dialog via Applescript.  What I want to emulate is the user setting a value on a specific dropdown.  Say I have:  precodetell application "System Events"   tell process "Preview"     set value of pop up button XXX to YYY   end tell end tell /code/pre  How should I know the name XXX? For example, how would I distinguish between the "printer" and "presets" dropdowns?  I've opened the Accessibility Inspector, but from the information displayed there, I cannot spot a reference to the name or some other unique identifier for the specified dropdown.  I've seen many people using numbers to refer to the different dropdown, but I'm not sure this is good practice. What happens if Apple decide to swap the order of two dropdowns at some point?  Any help would be appreciated.  emUPDATE/em:  Using 10.6.8 and inspector as suggested below, I get the following:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/UsqNF.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer40445> Use one of the scripts linked in this Mac OS X hint to find the appropriate form of address: Finding Control and Menu Items for use in AppleScript User Interface Scripting  IIRC, you'll need to click (cmd is in in System Events) the popup menu button before you can select a menu item from its menu.  <answer40464> UPDATE. this will work in 10.7.x but 10.6 has les element info.  The Buttons (drop downs ) in the Print Sheet have Description to describe the function.  In strongAccessibility inspector/strong; you see this when hovering the mouse over the element (button). you can lock the  strongAccessibility inspector/strong's view with cmd+F7.  The Description will be listed as emAXDescription/em  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/524Nv.png" alt="enter image description here"  In the cases for the Printers its is emPrinters/em for Presets it is emPresets/em  If you know the emAXDescription/em you can avoid the numbers using something like this. But this is not the only way. Just one example.  precodeactivate application "Preview" tell application "System Events"     tell process "Preview"         click ((pop up buttons of sheet 1 of window 1) whose description is "Printers")     end tell end tell /code/pre  For the above to work in this example the Print Sheet must be visible along with 'Show Details'  The button/drop down  has a menu. So you can select or click it by referring to the strongmenu items/strong of the strongmenu/strong of the button.  Either by number or using its title/AXTitle.  precodeactivate application "Preview"     tell application "System Events"         tell process "Preview"             click ((pop up buttons of sheet 1 of window 1) whose description is "Presets")  click menu item "Last Used Settings" of menu of ((pop up buttons of sheet 1 of window 1) whose description is "Presets")         end tell     end tell /code/pre  You can shorten repetitive code by using a variable for the button and calling that. When doing it like my example below;   precode   activate application "Preview" tell application "System Events"     tell process "Preview"         set Presets_button to item 1 of ((pop up buttons of sheet 1 of window 1) whose description is "Presets")          click Presets_button         click menu item "Last Used Settings" of menu of Presets_button     end tell end tell /code/pre  <answer87412> I recently write up my workflow for UI Scripting in AppleScript.   In short, the key component that made things much, much easier for me was learning that the codeUI Elements/code command in AppleScript returns a list of emthe terms that AppleScript Editor wants to see/em to call the UI Elements. Interface this with the terms seen from Accessibility Inspector (which are often slightly different) to build a working script.  <answer102001> For those who wonder, it seems that one location where to find the Accessibility Inspector in 10.7 is:  /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Applications  <comment45761> @Roberto-Aloi . Just updated the answer <comment45987> Any this of help to you ? <comment46417> @markhunte see update <comment46496> I see. I am on 10.7.x I will check this out at work tomorrow where I have 10.6 <comment46901> Hi, I tested on 1 10.6.8 Mac. There is much less info in the Apple ids Than in 10.7. I tried two programs to see what they would pull up and they both give the same results. So it looks like you are out of luck while in 10.6 in getting some sort of name instead of using the element number. <comment119534> I found the `UI elements` command from here helpful as well: http://n8henrie.com/2013/03/a-strategy-for-ui-scripting-in-applescript/
