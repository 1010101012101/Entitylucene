can not connect iPhone to my machine ( osx ) <body> Wishing you Happy New Year.  I am getting problem while connecting my iPhone to mac osx.  I am getting following message every time when I connect my iPhone.  emstrongcodeThe host is no longer paired with the device./code/em/strong  my iPhone doesn't even get charged. Please help me.  <answer5783> I really, really, really hate to say this; but, in my experience, it works for this kind of thing: Restart your iPhone (home+sleep for a few seconds) and try again.  <answer38687> May be it's because you use software such as Parallels Desktop, that hook USB devices, when you plug in...  <comment6038> Is that the exact error message? It doesn't sound like a standard error message. <comment6049> Sometimes, restarting the OSX as well will be needed. <comment6057> Yep ! Boss (@g.)- It's the exact message that I got. The message was from XCode. <comment6058> G. - I couldn't believe, It worked. Great. :) <comment43793> Yehh ! But I didn't even install such softwares. I think that iPhone Cable got some problem. I tried with different cable & it worked fine.
