Is it possible to customize invitation email? <body> I'm a newbie with OS X Server and specially with Profile Manager.  I have already managed to make enrollment work, but I'm wondering if it is possible to strongchange the template/strong of the invitation email since it is pretty awful and leaves no space for branding or anything else.  <answer191171> Go to your HD  Applications  Server.app  Right Click  Show Package Contents  Go to Contents  ServerRoot  usr  share  devicemgr  backend  app  views  emailer  Open the email_profile-multipart.erb file in your IDE of choice, and make your style edits to the HTML email.
