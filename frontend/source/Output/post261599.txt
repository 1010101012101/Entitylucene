Recently added songs do not finish playing on my iPhone 6 Plus <body> I just recently added several songs to my iPhone 6 Plus. Here is what I did:  ol liAdd songs to my playlist in iTunes in my MacBook Air./li liSync music to my iPhone 6 Plus/li /ol  Problem:  When my phone is playing the recently added song, it does not finish. If the new song is 3 mins long, when it is somewhere on the middle, it will play the next track, but the display on my phone is still the same (the recently added song).  <answer261629> I had that kind of problem too. When I asked about that from Apple Support their first solution was delete newly added songs and resync them to iPhone. If they are perfectly playing on iTunes, then obviously there was a syncing problem when adding songs to iPhone. Try what I suggested. Good luck.
