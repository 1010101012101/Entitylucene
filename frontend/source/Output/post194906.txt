Is there a way to access the "Recent Items" list from the terminal? <body> The Apple menu "Recent Items" entry is handy, but at times I would like to be able to access it via command line, e.g. to change to a directory I was just working in with a GUI app. Is there a way to get access to at least the last open file or folder from Desktop to terminal?   Failing that, is there a way to access a smart folder from the command line (for example, if I have one that consists of files modified in the past 2 days).  <answer194910> You can read the recent items plist file.  precode    defaults read $HOME/Library/Preferences/com.apple.recentitems /code/pre  There's a lot of "noise" in the output. You can filter the "noise" with codegrep/code and list the last entry with codetail/code which should be the last file opened (but not always the case).  precode    defaults read $HOME/Library/Preferences/com.apple.recentitems | grep "Name" | tail -n 1 /code/pre  <comment232617> I think you need $HOME/Library/Preferences...  Sure a lot of junk in there. <comment232618> Thanks I just updated my response. <comment326015> I tried this in El Capitan and it didn't work.
