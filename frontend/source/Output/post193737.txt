Photos Shared Album sort order <body> I want to use a shared album to combine photos taken on different cameras and by different people.  I would like the photos to be sorted by the date/time they were shot.  Instead, Apple is sorting by upload date, which is almost useless.  (That would be a photo-stream and is a very different use case.)  Is there any way to have photos in a shared album sort by the photo date instead of the upload date?  Is this really not an option in Apple's photo sharing scheme?  The only way I can think of to achieve what I want is either to switch to some other technology, like Picasa, or to download all the photos to Photos on a laptop and then upload the sorted photos to the shared album.  That seems ridiculous in 2015.  As a follow-up, what is the best way to deliver feedback to Apple?  The "Provide Feedback..." option that used to be there in iPhoto is missing.  <answer193794> There is not really a way to sort a shared album by date taken. I don't think that will be a feature because Apple is trying to make it like Instagram where the posts pop up in the order they were shared and not the date they were taken.  <answer248043> You cannot reorder in iCloud. You can copy all the pictures to a new album and sort by date. You can then create a new shared album from that album and it will be sorted bt date since it is one upload. Awkward but it works.  <comment231371> Disappointing answer, but thanks for the input.  I would have called that a shared photo stream rather than a shared album. <comment244530> Don't forget to mention "upload them one  by one", since the upload order is pretty random if you have lots of pictures. My hope is that disappointing system will be upgraded in a "revolutionary" and "amazing" Keynote sometime in the future to make the feature somehow useful. <comment367853> Super silly (like Photos is in many aspects anyway) but it works.
