Linking between tables in Numbers <body> I have a table in numbers, and I want a cell to equal the value of a cell in a different table. Following the advice of this Apple discussion, I tried  precode=Units Sold::B2 /code/pre  , with Units Sold being the table with the value I wanted, and B2 being the value I wanted in the table "Units Sold".  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FXSSP.png" alt="enter image description here"  To clarify, I want D2 of "Juice and Beverages" to equal the value of B2 of "Units Sold".  What am I doing wrong? Numbers for iCloud gives the error      The formula contains an invalid reference.   Thanks!  <answer170055> Cross-table referencing is not currently possible in Numbers in iCloud.com.  In OS X, if typing doesn't work, simply press = then click the cell that you want to reference.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jvam7.gif" width="300" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gB3gG.gif" width="300"  <answer170101> It does work in iCloud Numbers:  Select the cell you want the result in: i.e  strongD2 of "Juice and Beverages"/strong  And then in the text field at the top of the page enter:  precode=SUM('Units Sold' :: B2) /code/pre  Take note of difference in how I have written it and how you did. Which was you main problem.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/sRJcz.png" alt="enter image description here"  hr  When done, click the green tick button on the right. And you will see this as the end result.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0TDI9.png" alt="enter image description here"  hr  You can see some documentation on some of the included Functions by clicking into a cell and then into the:  1, text filed above:  2, you can search for a formula.  3,insert a Function template into the text field.  4, see a description of the Function and scrolling down further in the description you will see examples.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/S9tVc.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment199859> Not working - the cursor just appears in the cell I am trying to select. <comment199860> The syntax is correctly formatted, maybe you have formatted the cell to something. Once you start typing the table title it should auto populate after `=` <comment199863> @soulshined OK. If that is the case, how can I make it work? <comment199864> @rocket101 You need to be in formula edit mode to click-select cell references. Make sure the formula edit bar is active. Alternatively, type the reference (see the left animation). <comment199865> Format your cell to 'Automatic' then proceed like normal. Type `=` then start typing `Units Sold::B2` it should work. Or do what grgarside has displayed <comment199870> @soulshined Both cells are formatted to automatic, and it still doesn't work. <comment199872> It doesn't work in formula edit mode, the same thing happens. Bug? <comment199875> @rocket101 This sounds like a bug then. Try it with a new spreadsheet to see if it's the spreadsheet. Do you have the latest version of Numbers? <comment199879> @I am using numbers in iCloud <comment199881> Try ⌘+Q and reopen Numbers and try again, there's nothing wrong with the syntax <comment199882> @rocket101 Ah! That's not possible yet—I've edited my answer. <comment199947> @grgarside it does work. See my answer <comment201063> @markhunte That's a nice workaround! Not exactly linking a cell though (it won't work for text for example).
