How Many Different Ways Are There To Force Quit An Application? <body> Although it is not a common occurrance, sometimes my cursor has a continuing spinning beach ball, which I believe to indicate that an app has frozen (correct me if i'm wrong). When this happens I usually perform an action called strongForce Quit/strong as shown in the screenshot below:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xqGxd.png" alt="enter image description here"  This then displays the Force Quit application window, allowing an app to be selected.  What other ways exist that allow for an application to be Force Quit, especially in the case that the mouse or trackpad may also becomes frozen in the event as well ?  <answer90046> I see three other solutions :   ol liRight click on the icon on the dock with codeoption/code key pressed. (Works only with UI Application) /li liActivity monitor and right click /li licodekillall/code/codekill/code command in the terminal/li /ol  The first two require the mouse/trackpad, but the third can be done with the keyboard only (spotlight to open the terminal).   <answer90048> There are many ways to force quit an OS X application:  ul liPress and hold kbdCommand/kbd-kbdOption/kbd-kbdShift/kbd-kbdEscape/kbd for a few seconds.

S      0:22.89 TextEdit/code  code[...]/code  In process list find an application you want to kill. And type:  codekill -9 PID/code  Where emPID/em (process ID) is the number on the left. E.g. to kill above TextEdit process you would type:  codekill -9 6656/code  Remember that you are dealing with processes and every application can run one or more process, so sometimes more than one process should be killed to completely remove running application from the system.   Also be careful, because there is no additional warning message - be sure you are killing the right application.  <comment105938> An important variant on the last bullet is [using SSH from a second computer](http://support.apple.com/kb/PH10618?viewlocale=en_US&locale=en_US) to kill a process. Very handy when your Mac is still operating but nothing's showing on the screen, e.g. when Dock crashes on wake up. <comment106032> `killall` is case sensitive. It should be `killall Safari` or `killall -v Safari` to see which processes get killed.
