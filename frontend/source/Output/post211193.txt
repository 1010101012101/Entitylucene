Hard drive always visible on desktop <body> I have one HD named codeMacintosh HD/code. I can’t tell when it happened, but since a few days my HD shows up on my desktop. I tried to disable it in the Finder settings, but it already is. If I enable it I get a second icon for the same HD.  Does anyone have an idea how to fix this?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MP34E.gif" alt="enter image description here"  <answer211229> Ok, I solved it. A simple restart didn’t do the trick, but this is what worked for me:  ol liDisconnect every external hard drive from my mac/li liShut down the mac/li liWait 10 seconds and start the mac/li /ol  <comment254936> Both icons open Macintosh HD? <comment254937> Oh, I forget to mention that. If I try to open the HD that is shown permanently, I get a message that I don’t have the needed privileges to access the hd. <comment254938> And I just discovered that I can hide it if I disable external HDs.
