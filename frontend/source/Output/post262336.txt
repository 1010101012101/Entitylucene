Adding networked printers from terminal not working <body> I'm trying to build a script that lets people install the printers they need with minimal input. The file I'm using has worked before (~2 years ago) but I opened it up this week for the first time since making it and its not working...   Is there something happening with IPP/LPD, where IPP is used by default, because when I install it manually as IPP is fails the same way as when I run the command.  I was wondering if anyone had run into this? Current code looks like this, but its been chopped up a fair bit while trying to get it working:  precodelpadmin -E -p $PRINTER -v lpd://10.1.0.7 -P /Library/Printers/PPDs/Contents/Resources/FX\ DocuPrint\ P455\ PS.gz -D "$PRINTER" /code/pre  I'm not the best at this, so it could be something blindingly obvious... We're running 10.11.1 - 10.12, printer server is Windows 2012 and printers are Fuji Xerox.  Thanks for any advice,  Drew
