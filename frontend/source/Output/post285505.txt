Is there a log to determine whether an application was launched? <body> "Someone" downloaded a Word document from a Russian site.  I used VirusTotal to verify that it contained a Word macro virus.  If they just downloaded it and didn't open it then I don't need to reinstall the machine.   This is the link to the VirusTotal analysis.   Is there a way to verify that the document was or wasn't opened (e.g. was Word or LibreOffice launched on a particular day)?  Would it be in a log somewhere?  This is for Sierra.  <comment360054> I might be in the recents list on either app - though tbh, the chances of some random 'foolware' file being targeted at Mac is pretty small. <comment360055> Knowing exactly what VirusTotal flagged it as might be useful too. <comment360057> It was a Word macro virus.  I would assume these could be cross-platform.  I am not at home so I can't give you the complete signature. <comment360059> Not sure on those; would be fun to pull it apart to see. Chances are first thing it tries to do starts with C:\ which will make it pretty useless on a Mac;-) <comment360065> If you're seriously interested I can send it to you.  I want to update this question with a more accurate name of the virus anyways. <comment360067> just idle curiosity really - I'm not sure it would be wise to post, even temporarily, a link to a known infected file. <comment360072> I could post a hex dump.  That should be safe. <comment360141> What version of macOS are you running? <comment360157> Sierra. I had the tag but I didn't put it in the body of the question. <comment360383> @Tetsujin, I've added a link to the VirusTotal analysis.  It says the code is obfuscated so I don't know if you can tell anything from it.  I can post a hexdump of the file if you're interested.
