Dashboard contact widgets can't find any results? <body> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5Rxw5.png" alt="enter image description here"  I have 7000+ contacts synched to my Apple iCloud account. I can see them with the contact app when I search for some of them via spotlight, as shown in the next image:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9IduL.png" alt="enter image description here"  But in Dashboard Contact widget, it cannot find any matches with my name or number that I searched for.   What could be the reason the problem?  <answer222073> strongBefore doing this save your current work./strong  Open codeSystem Preferences/code,Â then go to codeSecurity &amp; Privacy/code section. In codePrivacy/code tab select codeContacts/code from the list left side. In the right panel check codeDashboard/code in the list. By selecting the codeQuit Now/code button your Dashboard will quit and it might cause logging out and closing your applications. Login again and in Dashboard remove and add the Contact widget again.  <comment339497> it doesnt work for me :/ <comment339504> Are you sure about doing this workflow right? I can reproduce your problem with unchecking Dashboard in Privacy and then fix it with this solution.
