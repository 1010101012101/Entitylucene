Disable dismissing reminders from lock screen <body> Can I prevent Reminders from being dismissed on the lock screen? I do want Reminder to pop up while the phone is locked. I do emnot/em want any random person to mark them as completed while the phone is locked.  iOS 6 would display the reminder, but required the passcode to dismiss it. Can I do the same in iOS 7?  <answer102487> Try Settings  Notification Center  Reminders (second entry - with apps)  Show in Notification Center and Show on Lock Screen. Also choose whether you want "banner" or "alert" style notifications.  There is a third Reminders setting on the main settings page, but that only relates to how long you keep old reminders around, and which list of reminders you want to use. HTH
