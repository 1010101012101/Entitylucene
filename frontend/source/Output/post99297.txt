Backup camcorder using Final Cut Pro or iMovie <body> I have a Canon Vixia HF11 HD camcorder, Synology DS213 NAS, MacBook Air, iMovie '11 and Final Cut Pro 10.0.9.  I just backed up my camcorder using Final Cut Pro and ran into a couple problems:  ul liThe backup came out to 50gb total (the CANON.fcarch was only 25gb)/li liThe backup included render files and original media (i.e. .mov files of each clip)/li liThe backup can only be saved to my MBA's hard drive (i.e. can't save to my NAS)/li /ul  My questions are, using Final Cut Pro or iMovie, is there a way to:  ol liOnly backup the camcorder's compressed AVCHD video (i.e. just the .fcarch file) without transcoding/rendering everything out to .mov files?/li liBackup the camcorder directly to a network drive (i.e. my NAS) instead of my MBA's SSD?/li /ol  <comment116844> Does the video camera show up in finder as an external drive at all?
