How to locate Open Directory servers on subnet <body> I am looking for at way to list which machines are running Open Directory (OD) on a given subnet. I considered using nmap, but I could not find a port exclusively used by OD. Apple has a list of ports used by their software, and I failed with these:  ul li88 kerberos (also used by screen sharing auth)/li li636 ldaps (also used by 3rd party server on some machines)/li /ul  Just for reference, I used nmap like this: codenmap -oG - -p 636 -A x.x.x.x/yy | grep open/code  So, can anyone come up with a way to list all running OD servers on a subnet, with no false positives?
