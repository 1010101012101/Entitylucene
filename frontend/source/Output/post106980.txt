iPhone 5s: texts and calls show numbers instead of names <body> I have an iPhone 5s. All contact phone numbers show up in the list as names. How do I get names, not numbers to display for received texts and calls?  <answer106995> Put people in your iPhone contacts, when you put people in the Contacts application it is best to put in the full telephone number strongand/strong the country of the person then the iPhone will use the telephone number formatting of that country.  I live in the Netherlands and I have setup my iPhone as such, when I create a new contact by default (unless I change the country) they are listed as being in the Netherlands. The country code for the Netherlands is +31, the "+" is the convention for country code.  If I type in a mobile phone number (the prefix code for mobiles is '6') say  +31 6 12345678 then the iPhone will format it that way. If I type in a fixed land line number, say +31 40 1234567 then it will put in the spaces to correctly identify the region code '40'. If I put in other people from other countries with other formats for phone numbers, say +1 123 12345678 for something in the US, the iPhone will automatically put in the correct spacing.  And you will see the person's name, not number, for incoming and outgoing calls.  <comment160903> Indeed, you must make sure that the contact entries have the + and not the "00" in front of the country code. This is how the numbers appear in your Messages app (with a +).
