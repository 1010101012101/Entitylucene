How to restart sshd in OSX Lion? <body> I have configured ssh keys for github. I have multiple ssh keys configured already. I need to add new ssh keys for bitbucket. But it does not seem to be working.  How do i restart sshd in OSX Lion?  <answer44494>    How do i restart sshd in OSX Lion?   You probably know this already, but I'll say to be complete: if you kill codesshd/code processes you'll terminate active SSH sessions to the machine. The codesshd/code daemon provides ssh access emto/em your machine. It handles incoming ssh connections. Not outbound connections.  If codesshd/code is really what you mean then...  Before you restart it, try sending it a SIGHUP signal so it re-reads all of its configuration. You can do that with  precodeps -ef | grep sshd | awk {'print $2'} | sudo xargs kill -HUP /code/pre  If you really want to kill all the codesshd/code process on the machine:  precodeps -ef | grep sshd | awk {'print $2'} | sudo xargs kill -KILL /code/pre  h1But try this stuff below first!/h1  All that being said: if you're looking for keys for emoutbound/em sessions from the machine to be refreshed, killing codesshd/code processes won't help you. What you really want to do is to add the new keys to the ssh-agent process with ssh-add -- that is usually sufficient to get new keys to be known to the agent.  The codessh-agent/code process handles all keyfile-based authentication for you. It's started automatically by Lion for each logged in user and it even integrates with Keychain.  If your new keyfile is code~/.ssh/bitbucket/code you would add it like so:  precodessh-add ~/.ssh/bitbucket /code/pre  Now the key would be available to new ssh sessions initiated from the terminal. No need to kill or restart anything.
