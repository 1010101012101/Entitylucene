Current power consumption <body> Is there a way to know the current (or average power consumption) on OS X (a Mac Mini without battery). Preferred would be a command line tool but anything is OK.  <answer215911> I use a Kill a Watt to check track power consumption of household items.  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00009MDBU?keywords=kill%20a%20watt&amp;qid=1447667271&amp;ref_=sr_1_1&amp;sr=8-1  By going with this you can also check other items in your household to see how much power they consume and reduce your energy use.  <answer215917> You can monitoring your energy consumption with :  strongiStat Menus :/strong  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KVdJe.jpg" alt="enter image description here" http://bjango.com/mac/istatmenus/  emYou also have some free alternative on the web/em  strongThe Activity Monitor/strong  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/JvveK.png" alt="enter image description here" http://www.tekrevue.com/tip/use-activity-monitor-energy-tab-os-x-mavericks/  And if you want to know the kW energy consumption, ArchonOSX is right.  <comment260882> [Intel Power Gadget](https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-power-gadget-20).
