How do I attach more than one photo to a single email sent on my iPhone? <body> There doesn't seem to be a way to attach photos to an email in the Mail app on the iPhone.  I can send photos from the Camera Roll in the Photos app, but I can only attach one photo per email?  Is there a trick I'm missing?  Or is there an app for that?  <answer45203> OS 3.0 and above allows you to email out up to 5 photos.  ul liGo to your Camera roll. Select the roll you want./li liTap Share icon (bottom left)/li liTap each photo you want to send via e-mail ( you should get a red check mark in each photo  Share count will increase to the number of photos selected)./li liTap "Share Icon" again/li liA pop up "e-mail" message will appear/li liAll the photos you selected will appear in your e-mail message to send./li /ul  <answer65874> The simplest way for attaching more than one photo is:  ul liTap the edit button in photo app/li liTap the photos you want to attach/li liTap copy button on your screen or in sharing options/li liThen go to e-mail app, hold your finger on the screen and choose paste command/li /ul  <answer267473> When you have the photo app open after you click attach file from email, Click the "share and command"buttons  at the same time! Then you will have the option to attac more that one picture. I just did it a second ago! It worked!!!!!  <comment51450> Just as an aside, you can also copy-and-paste photos - thus allowing you to circumvent the 5 photos limit. Have fun! <comment51451> Does that also have the advantage of the photos being sent at full size?  (I believe when they're emailed from the Camera Roll they are reduced.) <comment51452> Yes. ;) Copy-and-paste will let you email full size photos too hehe.
