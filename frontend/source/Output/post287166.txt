How can users identify which of their iPhone/iPad apps are still only 32-bit (and therefore won't work in future)? <body> Many iPhone/iPad users still use apps on their devices which are only 32-bit. These apps will not work in future if users upgrade to iOS 11, unless of course the apps themselves are updated to run natively in 64-bit.
