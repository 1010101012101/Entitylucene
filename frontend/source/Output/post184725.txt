Using Turtle Beach XO Four Stealth Headset with Macbook Pro Retina 15", Mid-2012 <body> I've read a few older posts about headsets and the TRRS headphone/mic input here, here, here, here and the consensus seems to be that the Macbook is expecting "line-level" input (either that or you have the mysterious occasional answer of "mine works!").  My question is more clearly related to this answer: which is, emif these Macbook Pros only accept a powered/line-level input, then how do they recognize the iPhone earbuds/microphone?/em I have not seen this addressed anywhere else.  My Turtle Beach XO Four Stealth is not powered, its only hookup is a TRRS jack. When I plug it in the Input doesn't switch from internal to external as it does for my Apple earbuds/mic.  Any explanations for the difference in behavior? I assume this may just be dependent on the hardware of the headset, but what would this difference be.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/XCqx5.jpg" alt="Turtle Beach TRRS vs. Apple iPhone Earbud TRRS"  <answer192620> Apple use the CTIA standard TRRS while most other companies use the OMTP standard.  These 2 pictures should short it out. Notice the Ground and microphones are switched.  ul liOMTP/li liCTIA/li /ul  Hope this answers your question.  <comment229311> This makes much more sense... thanks! <comment328957> Sort. Sort it out. Short means something else and would be a bad thing in this context.
