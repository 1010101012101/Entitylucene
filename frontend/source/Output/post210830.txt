"Wi-Fi" process in OSX El Capitan uses a lot of CPU <body> "Wi-Fi" process takes a lot of CPU almost all the time. Why is it happening, and how to fix it?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xd2yU.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer212148> Reinstallation of OSX El Capitan helped. Don't know why it was happening.  <comment257214> I'm adding a +1 since you came back and answered. There's always time to edit or get more answers/change the checkmark if more details arrive. Thanks and don't worry about one internet negative vote. :-) <comment257215> I reinstall it and no change, 80-90% CPU used by Wi-Fi and also a lot of faults. Did you anything else?
