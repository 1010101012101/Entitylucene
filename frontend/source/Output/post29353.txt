Is there any way to change the snooze time for alarms on the iPhone? <body> It seems that the default snooze time for alarms is 9 minutes. Is there any way I can change this setting?  <answer29358> There's no obvious way to change the snooze interval for the built-in iOS alarm. However, there are a few free apps available from iTunes App Store that offer this functionality:  ol liTheme Clock Alarm: codeSnooze timer configuration (up to 60 minutes)/code/li liAlarmed: offer multiple snooze timings - codeDrop-down panel for easy access to key features, including Nag-Me, snoozing options.../code/li /ol  <answer29367> A primitive work around would be to set two alarms, both with no snooze. Alarm 2 can be set X minutes after Alarm 1.  <answer42197> An alternative to the alarm app are CalAlarm and Snooze Me. Both apps provide a snooze function. CalAlarm is an calendar app, while Snooze Me is a calendar app add on. Both apps let you choose a Snooze interval and Snooze your events.  App store link Snooze Me: http://itunes.apple.com/app/snooze-me/id474192688  App store link CalAlarm: http://itunes.apple.com/app/calendar-alarm/id367803799  <comment195224> More robust method is to enable snooze for the second alarm. <comment251351> Just a note - as of Oct 2015 neither is available in the UK Store.
