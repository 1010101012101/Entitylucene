I can't remove app installed via testflight <body> When expired beta opera mini, I tried to delete it. After reboot, it appears again on my iPhone. Anybody knows, how to delete this beta app? P.S. I'm sorry for my English.  <comment344078> I have the same exact problem with an app called Pikazo. When I tried to run it, it said BETA EXPIRED. I tried to update it with app store. Gives an Error. When I delete it, it comes back when I reboot phone. Nobody can seem to help me.
