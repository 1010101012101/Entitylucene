How do I full-screen QuickTime Player on an external monitor in Lion? <body> I am trying to play a QuickTime video in Lion on an external monitor. How do I get it to play full screen on the strongexternal/strong monitor, not on the laptop screen?  <answer32339> strikeMove the non-fullscreen QuickTime window to the external monitor, then click the fullscreen button./strike  Sorry, just tested and that doesn't work. It used to, not sure when that changed.  It's not a proper solution, but using VLC would be a workable stopgap measure - it doesn't use the built-in Lion fullscreen functionality, and thus can be put wherever you like, and doesn't blank the other screens at the same time.  <answer38118> Install QT 7 from http://support.apple.com/kb/dl923 and open your movie with QT7. Then open Preferences and select Fullscreen tab and click on your second display.  Update:br strongMovist/strong is a great player. You can get it from here: http://code.google.com/p/movist/  <answer41140> The only way I can see fullscreen playing on a non-primary display (without editing System Preferences or adding additional software) is this:   ol liselect movie file in Finder/li liactivate Quick Look (click the eye button or press space bar)/li limove the Quick Look window over to the target display/li liclick the "expand to fullscreen" arrows button in its top right corner./li /ol  QuickTime Player Version 10.1 (501.8) on Lion - the Quick Look hack only works on non-streamed content so it is kind of a bummer. I seriously hope that Apple fixes this in a software update soon :-/  <comment39708> Thanks for the answer, but it still doesn't fix QT player. <comment43205> Ah! I didn't think of that. I will try it out and let you know! <comment46582> *No*, dear sales people, it will not trick me into buying and carrying around an AppleTV :-/ <comment85407> That _does work_ in Mountain Lion.
