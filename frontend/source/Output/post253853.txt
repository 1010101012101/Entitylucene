L2TP Authentication Credentials not being stored <body> When attempting to add a L2TP IPSec VPN connection in macOS Sierra, I'm unable to as the details in the 'Authentication Settings...' menu do not save.  Adding the password and pre-shared key, leaving the menu, and going back into it shows empty fields.  Clicking apply and then clicking 'Connect' shows a dialog to insert the password, the connection then fails (presumably because it's not using the correct Pre-Shared Key.  Why is this happening?  This is a recently purchased MacBook Pro Mid 2015. It was happening before I upgraded to macOS Sierra.
