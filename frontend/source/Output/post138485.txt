OmniGraffle: change characters spacing for text to occupy surrounding rectangle how? <body> Is there a simple command in OmniGraffle 6.0 x for strong(a)/strong stretching the character spaces or strong(b)/strong increasing font size of a word inside a rectangle (enlarge their distances) such that the word fills the entire rectangle nicely?   I would like to achieve an effect of the following kind: a square split into equal upper and lower rectangles; shorter word (e.g. "one") in upper, longer word (e.g. "four") in lower rectangle; words should align at their left and right margins and character spacings and/or font sizes should should remain even.
