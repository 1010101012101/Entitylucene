Setting up execution path in Terminal <body> I have no experience with using Terminal but I am trying to install a program msbayes  (installation instructions here.   The instructions say to set up an execution path using either  precode$ echo 'export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin' &gt;&gt; ~/.bash_profile /code/pre  Or   precode$ echo 'export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin' &gt;&gt; ~/.bash_profile /code/pre  I have tried both of these but am still getting a command not found response. What am I doing wrong? Any advice?  <answer232085> Are you copying the dollar sign into terminal?  The dollar sign in writing, like in the document, is just a sign that it is on a new terminal line.  You can copy and paste these commands into terminal and it should work. I just tried it on my machine  precodeecho 'export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin' &gt;&gt; ~/.bash_profile /code/pre  or  precodeecho 'export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin' &gt;&gt; ~/.bash_profile /code/pre  Then you can verify that they have worked by typing in this command  precodecat ~/.bash_profile /code/pre  And you should see  precodeexport PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin /code/pre  or  precodeexport PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin /code/pre  Depending on which one you used.  If you want the changes to also be applied to the currently running shell, you need to run  precode. ~/.bash_profile /code/pre  as well.  <comment283503> Can you copy and paste the error message you are getting? <comment285420> Thanks this seems to have worked but I still then get a "command not found" response when I try to do anything in the program <comment285422> Can you copy and paste the command you are running?
