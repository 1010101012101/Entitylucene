MacBook Pro unresponsive for a few minutes after opening the lid, AirPort trying to reconnect to wifi <body> I have a problem every time my 2010 MacBook Pro wakes up after I opened the lid.  The symptoms are as follows:  ul liThe display is completely normal, I can see the latest program I used, the top bar menu, the dock, everything/li liMoving the mouse is ok, and so is typing/li listrongClicks have no effect/strong/li listrongAirPort is trying to connect to a network/strong/li liSometimes the network I usually use can't be found and I have to turn AirPort on &amp; off to make it reconnect/li /ul  This is really annoying!  I use a 2010 MBP which runs Snow Leopard 10.6.8. The problem has occurred ever since I bought it.  Does anybody have the same problem? Is there any remedy steps I can take?  Any help is appreciated,  <answer17967> Changing the network channel solved the problem!
