Windows Setup does not show Boot Camp as an option for installation <body> I am downloading Windows 10 through Boot Camp.  During the Windows Setup when asked where I want to install Windows, Boot Camp is not listed as an option.  Why not?  <comment334933> What Mac, what OS? We have nothing to go on.
