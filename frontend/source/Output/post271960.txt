Managing macOS application windows like Ubuntu Unity <body> I'm a relatively new to using macOS for work and using macOS windows management (Mission Control?) turns out to be extremely annoying. I'm using Sierra OS. Here are some things that I would like to understand:  I like to work on two desktops and have some windows belonging to 1st desktop and some to 2nd desktop (think Unity). When I create a second desktop I would logically think that I can move one of existing windows to it, but right-clicking on the app in "dock" only shows: All desktops, This Desktop, None. Using the ^1, ^2 shortcuts brings the window to selected desktop but then shows it on the other desktop where it came from as well. Maximizing the window and restoring the size back to original will bring it back to original desktop as well, which seems to be a bug?  ol liWhat is a good way to assign windows to desktops if there is any in mac?/li liIs there a software that can override this annoying functionality? Another windows management package?/li liWhy does any maximized window appear on the very right side even it belongs to the most left desktop? Any way to stop this?/li /ol  I already tried looking for answers on the web, but haven't found any good solution, only mirriad of useless articles.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/z4TBa.png" alt="enter image description here"  Youtube video
