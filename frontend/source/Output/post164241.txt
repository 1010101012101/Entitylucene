How to save a shared video to my Camera Roll on iOS? <body> I have the app Photos on my iPad mini, on iOS 7.  I am viewing a stream shared by a friend.   When I am on a photo, I can save it to my Camera Roll.   But, when I am on a video, I cannot save it to my Camera Roll. The feature is missing.   strong1) How can I save a video to my Camera Roll ?/strong   I want preferably a solution that do not need a computer.  strong2) emBonus question :/em Why has Apple limited this feature to photos ?/strong  <answer166469> Maybe have your friend email you the video or upload it to  Dropbox or MEGA as private. Those websites allow you to download the videos  strongEDIT/strong Those website allow you to download the videos NOT from the stock iOS Photos app but from the websites.  <answer166470> Apple doesn't have a solution on iOS to accomplish this. I've not found any third party app from the App Store that will read the shared stream videos or receive a paste event (you can copy the video from Photos app on iOS, but pasting it anywhere seems to not work for me on iOS 8.x)  I use iPhoto on OS X to view the shared video and then import them into my library. From there, I can get the videos onto iOS. Not exactly your preferred solution, but it works well enough for me.  <answer179008> Copy the video and paste it in an iMessage to yourself.   <answer190052> There are now apps that can download these online videos directly into your camera roll. Most are free for basic functions and the ones that I have used include Video Download.  <comment192560> This is also missing in iOS 8.1.2 on my iPhone.. Just tried, there is no obvious way to manipulate (save/share/etc) a shared vid.  Neither the "Edit" or forward buttons that opens the functionality for a pic is present on the screen. <comment195097> There are many, many ways for the friend to share the video in a way you can then use on iOS - but there's not a good way for an iOS app to pull it from the friend's stream directly. <comment234755> Can you name one? <comment369284> The peoblem with this solution is iMessage videos are limited in duration, AND down-sampled. <comment374059> Have you tried to do this via icloud.com and download it from there?
