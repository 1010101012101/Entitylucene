Macbook Pro 13 Late 2013, BenQ GW2765HT, and Displayport cable <body> I recently purchased BenQ GW2765HT to connect my 13 inch rMBP via mini DP to Displayport.  After around 1 week of use, the displayport connection is flaky to get properly recognized. Sometimes it connects properly and sometimes it stays blank with "no cable connected" error. In such cases changing it to HDMI does not work on the first shot. After switching back and forth between HDMI and DP, it starts working.  In a similar question on this site, the answer was to turn off ddc/ci setting. But, in my case there is no effect.  I changed two cables, but the problem continues so it is not cable related. I tried setting DP protocol to 1.1 on the monitor, but that turns off anti-aliasing. I guess DP1.1 bandwidth is not sufficient to delivery additional Anti-aliasing bits at 1440p @ 60HZ.  I believe there is a problem on the monitor side as it fails to recognize HDMI when DP recognition goes bad, but works fine otherwise.  Any clues? Is there any command on the Mac to emulate cable insertion so that I don't have pull in and out the mini DP connector 10-12 times before things might start working? Or should I just return the monitor. The display is gorgeous though. BenQ does not talk about MAC compatibility and Cinema display is pretty expensive.  I dont know whether this rMBP has any special graphics card. System report is as below (when the monitor is fully working)  Hardware Overview:  Model Name:   MacBook Probr   Model Identifier: MacBookPro11,1br   Processor Name:   Intel Core i5br   Processor Speed:  2.4 GHzbr   Number of Processors: 1br   Total Number of Cores:    2br   L2 Cache (per Core):  256 KBbr   L3 Cache: 3 MBbr   Memory:   16 GBbr   Boot ROM Version: MBP111.0138.B16br   SMC Version (system): 2.16f68br   Serial Number (system):   C02MG191FH04br   Hardware UUID:    AB430E22-803E-5F38-BB9C-3764DC242F6    Chipset Model:    Intel Irisbr   Type: GPUbr   Bus:  Built-Inbr   VRAM (Dynamic, Max):  1536 MBbr   Vendor:   Intel (0x8086)br   Device ID:    0x0a2ebr   Revision ID:  0x0009br   Displays:br Color LCD:    Display Type: Retina LCDbr   Resolution:   2560 x 1600 Retinabr   Retina:   Yesbr   Pixel Depth:  32-Bit Color (ARGB8888)br   Main Display: Yesbr   Mirror:   Offbr   Online:   Yesbr   Built-In: Yes    strongBenQ GW2765:br   Resolution:   2560 x 1440 @ 59 Hzbr   Pixel Depth:  32-Bit Color (ARGB8888)   Display Serial Number:    47F01677019br   Mirror:   Offbr   Online:   Yesbr   Rotation: Supportedbr   Connection Type:  DisplayPortbr   Television:   Yes/strong    Based on the BenQ Forum, i bought the displayport org certified cable from Accell via Amazon. No difference.  <comment271207> It might help if you mention whether you have the model with the discrete video card.
