Is there a way to rename a sound card in Mac OS X? <body> I have multiple sound cards connected and would benefit from being able to rename them from their device name to something like "Headphones", "Surround system", etc. Is there a way to do this?  <answer301> The Sound Card’s name comes from the Device itself, which “publishes” its name. The operating system reads the name from there. I don’t believe you can rename it, but you can definitely go to strong/Applications/Utilities/Audio MIDI Setup/strong and create an Aggregate Audio Device (with the names you want) and select the input/outputs of each.  For example, you can create your headphones like this: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/otABb.jpg" alt="alt text"  <comment286> That's what I suspected. Thank you for the answer though, it seems to be the closest to a solution of this.
