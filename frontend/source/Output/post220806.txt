How do I save multiple images from my Dropbbox app to my Camera Roll <body> I need to save multiple photos from my Dropbox to my camera roll. From what I can see you can only do one at a time. Is there a way to this by folder? I have 60+ images and and doing one at a time will be tedious and time consuming... thanks!  <answer220839> Maybe try the Carousel app? They're about to discontinue it in March, but it should still be available. From what I recall, you should be able to select multiple images in that app, and you might be able to save them to your Camera Roll from there.  <comment267862> Thanks for the reply. I'll check it out. Cheers!
