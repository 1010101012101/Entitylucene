Odd issue with iTerm2 (built from Git repo) <body> I'm currently using iTerm2 version 3, built from the GitHub repo. My default shell is bash, but I have iTerm set up in a way to default to using zsh on startup. I had this set so that the default Terminal.app would open with bash, while iTerm2 would open with zsh. However, when I tried opening it today, I noticed it was taking longer than normal. Usually I run codesudo rm -f /private/var/log/asl/*.asl/code every day, since I know those log files cause bash to load slowly, so I know it's not caused by that. I tried closing iTerm2 and then got this as a result:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8AsV6.png" alt="close window dialogue"  Now...I'm typically ok with shell scripting.  But I'm emVERY/em confused how iTerm2 is running 188 instances of bash, and 94 instances of sh, ruby, xcodebuild and xcrun on startup. Is there anything in my dotfiles that might be causing this?  Look in codezsh//code or codebash//code for the startup scripts; I don't use fish shell often enough to make it a main preferred shell cause of the whole issue with oh-my-fish and wahoo! frameworks. Any help is welcome.
