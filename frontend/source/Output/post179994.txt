No sound in headphones when receiving text message on iPhone 5s silent mode <body> I have my iPhone 5s with headphones plugged in and listening to Spotify. The phone is in silent mode. The problem is that I do not hear any sound through my headphones when receiving text messages. However, if somebody calls me, I do in fact hear the calling sound in the headphones. Does anyone know how to get sound when receiving text messages?
