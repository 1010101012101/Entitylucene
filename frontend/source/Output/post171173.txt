"wants to make changes" dialogue <body> Suppose I want to run an application I have downloaded and I am prompted with the following dialogue.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Sfk9V.png" alt="enter image description here"  If I enter my username and password, being user that has administrator privileges, and press ok, does this mean the process can do absolutely anything (e.g. change my password or install a keylogger)?  This Q&amp;A is the closest thing I could find on this site, but I wanted a more conclusive answer.  <comment201373> The answer is yes you give the process root access which on OS X gives complete access - I can't think how to make this longer to become an answer <comment201374> @Mark ok thank you. Just let me know if you think the question is not suitable for the site or something. I am also interested whether it is possible to see exactly what changes would be made, like in the Q&A I linked to. In the linked Q&A, the installer is mentioned, which I think does not play a role here. Perhaps I can extend the question like this.
