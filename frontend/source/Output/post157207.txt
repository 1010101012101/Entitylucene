New Macbook collects full bandwith <body> My flatmate and I have a serious problem. He is gaming Counter-Strike like 24/7. I'm using my macbook for development and college stuff. I had an 2012 Macbook Air before. Everything worked fine, he never had ping problems, except i was making a huge download, then his ping would rise from 30 to 150ms (or whatever).  But since classes started again, I'm back here with my new Macbook Pro Retina 13" Mid 14 With OSX 10.10. Every action in the internet raises his ping up to 1000ms. Even if i just load a poor stream or open websites. If he streams something on his macbook, the ping just raises to ~150ms.  Do you have an idea what the problem could be, before we kill each other?  Thank you!  <comment184846> If your using Wi-Fi, try updating to 10.10.1.  Then report back if its still seeing high ping rates. <comment185741> @tron_jones - still the same problem
