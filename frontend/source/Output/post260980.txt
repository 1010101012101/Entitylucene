iTunes doesn't detect iPod 2nd generation <body> I have recently picked up an iPod 2nd generation off Amazon because my car will only accept devices with a 30 pin connector.  However, I plugged it into my MacBook tonight (running Sierra) and iTunes will not detect the iPod. What do I need to do to manage the 2nd generation iPod from my MacBook?  <comment326750> You can check if macOS detects your iPod through USB devices in System Overview. The cable you use might be a problem as well if you're not using the original 30-pin connector cable.
