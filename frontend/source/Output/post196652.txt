How can I be notified when my boyfriend tracks my iPhone? <body> I have nothing to hide, I don't need to fake my position, but I would like to know how often my boyfriend checks where I am. Is it possible to be notified when he checks on me? In the country where I live, Fmf live is not available.  Thank you!   <answer196658> Unfortunately no,  Find My Friend is a one way communication style app. It allows you to notify people of your location and see their location. Also, you have the ability to notify someone when you arrive, leave a place, or you can send your current location. You can also be notified if someone lease or arrives at a place (and they can do the same), however it does not have the ability to notify you if someone requested your location.  <comment234963> How does he check the location ? Using find my iPhone or using Find my friends ? <comment234966> Maybe you ought to change your iCloud password...
