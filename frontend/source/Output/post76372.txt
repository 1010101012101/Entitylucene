Create AirPort network from the command line? <body> Is it possible to put my AirPort in access point mode, so it creates an infrastructure (ie, non-ad-hoc) network from the command line on OS X?  Similar to using System Preferences - Sharing - Internet - Share from â€¦ to computers using WiFi.  <answer76376> After some hours of digging through the internet, it seems that the only way to put an airport in HostAP ("software base station") mode in OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion is to programatically call a the internal, undocumented, codestartHostAPModeWithSSID/code method.  I've updated the one example I could find online, and it does seem to work, with the one caveat that only WEP, not WPA, can be used: https://gist.github.com/4418079   <comment88592> This won't answer your question but might be of interest: /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/Versions/Current/Resources/airport <comment88595> Unfortunately `airport` doesn't seem to do anything related. In fact, `airport -s` doesn't show anything when running in hostap mode.
