Why do sidebar folders turn white? <body> Sometimes, not always, when I drag a file to a sidebar folder, it turns white.  The folder I'm dragging into turns white, and it doesn't turn back.   I have to delete the folder from the sidebar, and then re-import it, and then it's a normal color.  <answer287893> I have no idea why this happens, but you can go to strongFinder  Preferences/strong and select the strongSidebar/strong tab. At the very bottom of the window will be a "Recent Tags" option with a checkbox next to it. Uncheck the box and it's fixed.  <comment363923> Ah!  That's a great tip - way quicker than restarting!  I notice it only happens if I hold down ctrl more than about three seconds.  So I've been quicker with copying and I haven't had it happen too often.  Next time it does I'll try your fix!
