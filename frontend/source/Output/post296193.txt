View Actual Size of Image in Preview App <body> When I open an image in the Preview app on a Mac I get a low quality view of the image until I select: View   Actual Size option, then the image looks very good.    I have noticed the browsers also open the image with that low quality.  I have tried to save the image in Preview and Seashore (Another free app =) after selecting the actual size option trying to preserve the quality, but the browsers again open a low quality image.  Is there a way to save an image to PNG as it looks after the Actual Size option is selected in Preview?  <comment374090> Do you happen to have some screenshots? It could be a [DPI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dots_per_inch) problem; you can change the DPI when resizing.
