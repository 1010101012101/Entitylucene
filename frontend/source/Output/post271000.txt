"Show Keyboard & Character Viewers in menu bar" setting not remembered <body> I see no keyboard &amp; character indicator on the menubar panel, and trying to enable em"Show Keyboard &amp; Character Viewers in menu bar"/em in  emSystem Preferences  Keyboard  Keyboard tab/em, that has strongno effect/strong and, after closing and re-opening that settings window, emShow Keyboard &amp; Character Viewers in menu bar/em is still strongNOT/strong ticked.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZNvsk.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  I use more than one keyboard layout and I need to permanently see the active one on the panel, and switch between them from there (at the present I can only switch from shortcut), like in this image I found on the internet:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/twETC.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer271073> I think you are looking for this option:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HQz42.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment340713> I will look up the "Input sources" option as soon as I can. As for the rest more aggressive approach, looking at the link you posted - I am not sure I will try that, it seems recommended for more severe problems (`before you bring it into the Apple Store`) and also some comments there report chilling after effects. I will consider it though. I appreciate your assistance. <comment340724> I have mentioned the character viewer only in response to your comment that two buttons can be shown one in place of the other, I am mainly interested in displaying and switching keyboard layouts on the panel: from the button seen [the image you posted](https://i.stack.imgur.com/pYLbp.png), except I use more than one layout, as indicated in update to my question. <comment340727> I am almost sure that is the answer!! I cannot test on the spot but I will in a day or so. <comment340730> @cipricus if the answer resolves the problem, please remember to select the answer (and we can remove the comments as well) <comment340765> I think that having more than one keyboard on your list in system prefs/keyboard/input sources  should normally automatically put the "flag" menu in your menu bar, but I guess something must be amiss on your system. <comment341024> as simple as that. i'll look into the 'not remembered' part too
