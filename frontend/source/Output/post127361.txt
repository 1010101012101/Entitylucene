Why doesn't Macbook Pro continuously search for wifi like the iPhone does? <body> Here's a scenario:  I'm at home with my router turned off.  Neither my Macbook Pro nor my iPhone are connected to the wifi (obviously), though both search for a wifi connection upon being turned on/woken up from sleep.  Leaving both machines up and running, I turn on my router.  After a short while, my iPhone automatically connects to the newly discovered wifi, which is on its list of saved/remembered connections.  However, my Macbook never automatically connects to the wifi. If I click on the wifi button on the right of my menu bar I see "Wi-Fi: Looking for Networks..." and can then select my network from the list once the list updates. Alternatively, I can close my Macbook lid and when I reopen it (it wakes up from sleep) it will automatically connect to the wifi.  So my question is:  Why doesn't the Macbook continuously search for wifi like the iPhone does?  hr  strongEDIT:/strong  I cleared the log, closed my computer lid with the wifi off, opened my computer lid where it tried to auto-join a network but found none that it could join, then I turned on the wifi and manually connected.  Here is the console log:  precode2014-04-24 8:01:27.390 PM WindowServer[104]: device_generate_desktop_screenshot: authw 0x0(0), shield 0x7fd15cb8ad30(2001) 2014-04-24 8:01:27.426 PM WindowServer[104]: device_generate_lock_screen_screenshot: authw 0x0(0), shield 0x7fd15cb8ad30(2001) 2014-04-24 8:01:29.000 PM kernel[0]: AirPort_Brcm43xx::powerChange: System Sleep  2014-04-24 8:01:31.000 PM kernel[0]: hibernate image path: /var/vm/sleepimage 2014-04-24 8:01:31.000 PM kernel[0]: efi pagecount 43 2014-04-24 8:01:31.000 PM kernel[0]: hibernate_page_list_setall(preflight 1) start 0xffffff81d6cd7000, 0xffffff81fb523000 2014-04-24 8:01:32.000 PM kernel[0]: hibernate_page_list_setall time: 427 ms 2014-04-24 8:01:32.000 PM kernel[0]: pages 1446947, wire 356846, act 322978, inact 12881, cleaned 0 spec 166, zf 2677, throt 0, compr 0, xpmapped 182497 2014-04-24 8:01:32.000 PM kernel[0]: could discard act 168161 inact 131668 purgeable 35397 spec 416173 cleaned 0 2014-04-24 8:01:32.000 PM kernel[0]: hibernate_page_list_setall preflight pageCount 695548 est comp 41 setfile 1256022036 min 8589934592 2014-04-24 8:01:32.000 PM kernel[0]: [0x6c351e4000, 0x1000] 2014-04-24 8:01:32.000 PM kernel[0]: [0x6d47b99000, 0x19000000] 2014-04-24 8:01:32.000 PM kernel[0]: [0x6d9251e000, 0x32000000] 2014-04-24 8:01:32.000 PM kernel[0]: [0x1a6307000, 0x19000000] 2014-04-24 8:01:32.000 PM kernel[0]: [0x32ce62000, 0x32000000] 2014-04-24 8:01:32.000 PM kernel[0]: [0x369bac1000, 0x19000000] 2014-04-24 8:01:32.000 PM kernel[0]: [0x47b3194000, 0x19000000] 2014-04-24 8:01:32.000 PM kernel[0]: [0x5ce4430000, 0x19000000] 2014-04-24 8:01:32.000 PM kernel[0]: [0x5f2ff15000, 0x32000000] 2014-04-24 8:01:32.000 PM kernel[0]: [0x62bd8a9000, 0x19000000] 2014-04-24 8:01:32.000 PM kernel[0]: [0x62ffa62000, 0x19000000] 2014-04-24 8:01:32.000 PM kernel[0]: [0x68abd8f000, 0x19000000] 2014-04-24 8:01:32.000 PM kernel[0]: [0x6ace1cd000, 0x19000000] 2014-04-24 8:01:32.000 PM kernel[0]: [0x6af7ffd000, 0x19000000] 2014-04-24 8:01:32.000 PM kernel[0]: [0x6b33bd2000, 0x19000000] 2014-04-24 8:01:32.000 PM kernel[0]: [0x69fa8b4000, 0x17b26000] 2014-04-24 8:01:32.000 PM kernel[0]: [0x33247d7000, 0x15d1b000] 2014-04-24 8:01:32.000 PM kernel[0]: [0x6d60b99000, 0x13c6c000] 2014-04-24 8:01:32.000 PM kernel[0]: [0x47cc194000, 0x9b53000] 2014-04-24 8:01:32.000 PM kernel[0]: [0x4ee000f000, 0xbfff000] 2014-04-24 8:01:32.000 PM kernel[0]: [0x0, 0x0] 2014-04-24 8:01:32.000 PM kernel[0]: kern_open_file_for_direct_io(0) took 0 ms 2014-04-24 8:01:32.000 PM kernel[0]: Opened file /var/vm/sleepimage, size 8589934592, partition base 0x0, maxio 2000000 ssd 0 2014-04-24 8:01:32.000 PM kernel[0]: hibernate image major 1, minor 0, blocksize 4096, pollers 5 2014-04-24 8:01:32.000 PM kernel[0]: hibernate_alloc_pages act 526536, inact 147226, anon 3805, throt 0, spec 416339, wire 376612, wireinit 134660 2014-04-24 8:01:32.000 PM kernel[0]: hibernate_setup(0) took 0 ms 2014-04-24 8:01:32.000 PM kernel[0]: AppleThunderboltHAL::earlyWake -

Then it has a lot of trouble talking to the Router.  So lets try following.  Update Routers software, Firmware.  Reset your EFI  Confirm your Macs Firmware is up to date.

What to do? Delete all your network settings/profiles and start ower.  <comment149252> Did your computer register that it has lost WiFi in form of a message? <comment149273> @Buscar웃 The computer never "lost WiFi". It wakes up from sleep, tries to connect to wifi, and finds no acceptable networks <comment149290> You said "Leaving both machines up and running, I turn on my router." During the no router the computer should have be doing the search automatically, will not find a network till you turn on the router. Then it should find it. <comment149291> Please publish the Console log at the time stamp of turning on the router so we can see it connecting to the network. <comment150675> Hi @Buscar웃, I have edited the question so that it contains the log, though I doubt this will help. This behaviour has been noted on two different Macbook Pro computers <comment150693> Great lets look at it, and there it is, XO,CA ?? let me analyze that. <comment151193> Mac's Firmware is up to date. How do I reset EFI? By "delete all your network settings/profiles and start over" you mean to remove all wifi networks from my Preferred Networks, right? <comment166219> Still having this problem. The only solutions I haven't tried are the two I asked about in my comment above. <comment166227> It is trying to connect true proxy ? and to the TDX Home, and then it turns on AirPlay ? are those your settings ? Since your Network profiles are messed up, YES delete them as indicated above /Library/Preferences/com.apple.security-common.plist
