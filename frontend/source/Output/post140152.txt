How to prevent Terminal.app from displaying a tab bar when there is only one tab open <body> The image below is the header that appears when I open Terminal.app.  As you can see, only one tab is open, but a tab bar still shows (just has one tab that says "bash").  How can I prevent the tab bar from showing unless there are = 2 tabs?  It was working correctly until recently but I can't figure out what changed or how to fix.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gtJHJ.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer140159> Click "View" / "Hide Tab Bar" and the tab bar will go away and come back only when there is more than one tab open.  <comment165223> I will not have access to the computer that had this problem until Friday, but if this works then I will accept. <comment165924> Worked, thanks! <comment321805> I scrubbed all over the preferences panel looking for this...  never occurred to me to look for a top-level menu.
