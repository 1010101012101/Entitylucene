Change Firefox tab-switching  keyboard  shortcut <body> To move to the next tab in most browsers, you use kbdctrl/kbd+kbd&#x21E5;/kbd.  Then, to close it, you have to reach over to kbd&#x2318;/kbd+kbdW/kbd.  I don't like switching modifier keys like that; I'd prefer to just use kbdctrl/kbd for both.br Is there a way to change the shortcuts so that both shortcuts use the control key? It would be great to switch this globally, but otherwise a solution for Firefox would be fine too.  <answer17257> If you go in to System Preferences, you can then choose "Keyboard &amp; Mouse" where you will be able to re-wire shortcuts. I'm writing this from my iPhone, so I can't give you detailed instructions, but googling "mac change keyboard shortcuts" gave me lots of guides describing how to do it, among which this one from Apple: http://support.apple.com/kb/ht2490#l4  <answer21273> I belive in Firefox you can use kbd&#x2325;/kbd+kbd&#x2318;/kbd+kbd&#x2190;/kbd/kbd&#x2192;/kbd to view the open tabs.  <answer21279> This is not an exact answer to your question, but you can also use kbd&#x2318;/kbd+kbd1/kbd, kbd&#x2318;/kbd+kbd2/kbd etc for visiting each tab, as well as kbd&#x21E7;/kbd+kbd&#x2318;/kbd+kbd]/kbd or kbd&#x21E7;/kbd+kbd&#x2318;/kbd+kbd[/kbd to go to the previous/next tab.  <answer21343> strongThis is the definitive answer./strong Here are two official FireFox add-ons (plugins) that let you modify or define your own keyboard commands and shortcuts.  Key config  My Keyboard Navigator   <answer21629> To change a keyboard shortcut that appears in an OS X application's menu:  System Preferences  Keyboard  Keyboard Shortcuts  Application Shortcuts  Click the plus, and type the name of the command exactly as it appears in the menu, and choose a shortcut. (e.g. "Close Tab" and kbd&#x2318;/kbd+kbdW/kbd)  I would recommend, however, using the OS X standard for changing tabs, kbd&#x2318;/kbd+kbd&#x21E7;/kbd+kbd[/kbd/kbd]/kbd, since you don't have to take your hands off home-row typing position. I believe it works for Firefox and most other tabbed applications.  <comment18753> This is not a site for rants. I've edited your question to remove the rant part. In the future, please focus on the question and not the rant. Thanks for your cooperation. <comment18756> @Nathan: sorry if it sounded like a rant, but I thought saying that's it's illogical and un-ergonomical is pretty objective. Doesn't matter anyways. Edit: reread it, and maybe I overused "horrible" :D Sorry. <comment23304> Hmm, I guess that's a good alternative. As it looks I can't do exactly what I want I'll accept this. Thanks. <comment23774> I don't see how you can think the control key is more ergonomic than the command key. I need to move my thumb 1 cm to press control, and all my fingers are still available to press the letter in the way I normally would. Combos like ctl-A and ctl-Tab require me to shift my hand. <comment23778> I'm curious why you opened a bounty on a question that you answered (twice). <comment23793> Because I'm a newbie here and I just wanted to test and see how the bounty system works! <comment23840> @dazmax: I am only talking about this specific situation. You move to a tab with control-tab. To close it using control-W, you move only one finger over to the W from Tab. If you have to use command, you need to move one finger over to the W and the other over to the command key. Moving two fingers is less ergonomic than moving one.
