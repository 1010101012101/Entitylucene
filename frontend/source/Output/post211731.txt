Safari not displaying text <body> I have a fresh Mac OS X 10.10 (Yosemite) install, with every update available installed, on a iMac (2011). Safari (9.0) is acting up. Firefox is working just as it should.  I have tried the usual suspects, disk repair and deleting the cache to no avail. I have but a few apps installed, Logic X and a couple of other music apps, but the system is super fresh, it should not act up like this. Any ideas?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GP22V.jpg" alt="Screenshot comparing Safari with Firefox to illustrate the no text issue"  <answer211740> I would recommend clearing your font cache using OnyX and rebooting to clear things up.  <comment255628> Does this problem occur with other websites as well?  What is your text encoding setting?  (View  Text Encoding...) <comment255629> Yes, it does. One other observation: If i let the page load for like 5-10 minutes it will eventually show the text. <comment255630> It was ISO Latin 1, but i tried UTF-8 as well; no change. <comment256121> I tried doing so, and indeed did the text retur, but it turns out it is a far more complicated problem. It turns out none of the macs in out office can access certain sites, like youtube and google. I guess there is some problem with our router that filters something it is not told to do.
