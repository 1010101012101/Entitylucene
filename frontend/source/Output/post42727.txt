What is the Apple_PubSub_Socket_Render environment variable for? <body> After running:  precodeenv  ; #from with in terminal /code/pre  I see the following output:  precode... Apple_PubSub_Socket_Render=/tmp/launch-pc2V6P/Render ... /code/pre  What is this environment variable used for? Not really finding anything about what its for and why it is set by default.   <answer42728> PubSub is the backend for how Safari and Mail handle RSS feeds.  There are command line utilities too. From the pubsub man page:     pubsub -- Utility for managing RSS/Atom subscriptions via the PubSub framework   This variable is just part of that process.    The ability to read RSS feeds in Safari is going away in Mountain Lion, but I don't know if the entire RSS infrastructure is going away too.     <comment48595> Why are you asking? <comment48596> Because I have read this http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/book/cli-crash-coursech22.html <comment48597> Is there a specific problem you're trying to solve, or are you just curious? <comment48598> Yes what thats variable is for, I think the answer solves that... <comment310953> For information, it's still here on 10.11.5.
