How to know if an iPhone has been tampered with? <body> I'm a bit skeptical about by iPhone 7 that I bought a few days ago. Its screen at the top is kind of feeling a bit weird, and I've heard a story of sellers here in my country removing the tamper sensors in iPhones before selling them. How do I know that it hasn't been opened, since if it has, it removes the water resistance of the iPhone?  <comment316842> Instead of asking basically the same question again, please edit your existing one to add additional details.
