Viscosity OpenVPN Tunnelblick Connect but all rdp connections go dead after about 10 minutes <body> symptons: Open viscosity, select appropriate connection. Wait until connection resolves, get an IP address.  Use Microsoft Remote Desktop connection Client for Mac - Version 2.1.1 (110309)  Everything is fine for about 10-15 minutes.  Then connection goes dead.  RDP client notices after about 5 minutes and reports connection lost.  If I try to connect it fails (cannot connect).    I see nothing indicative of problems in the Viscosity log.  If I terminate OpenVPN and reconnect everything is fine until it happens again.  Here is a viscosity log of the issue occurring, note that it reports 'inactivity timeout' at 9:57 and restarts OpenVPN.  This occurs in tunnelblick as well.  precode Jan 08 09:37:05: Viscosity Mac 1.4.2 (1092) Jan 08 09:37:05: Viscosity OpenVPN Engine Started Jan 08 09:37:05: Running on Mac OS X 10.8.2 Jan 08 09:37:05: --------- Jan 08 09:37:05: Checking reachability status of connection...

Any advice or troubleshooting steps will be greatly appreciated.  <comment89607> Just tested with tunnelblick, both tunnelblick and viscosity go silent at almost exactly 10 minutes.  My theory is that the DHCP lease time must be about 10 minutes and when the lease expires it's not renewed.  I have no idea why. <comment89791> Figured it out, it's my fault.  I always have a VM running and connected to the VPN.  Once I disable that the connection is solid.
