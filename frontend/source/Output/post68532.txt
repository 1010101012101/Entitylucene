URL-scheme details for Reminders application <body> The Reminders application understands the codereminders:/code URL scheme, so that you can invoke it, for instance, from Terminal as codeopen reminders:/code (use of code///code is optional).  What I'm looking for is documentation of further elements of this scheme. Specifically, I want to construct URLs that allow me to do the following:  ul liopen a specific list/li liopen a specific reminder/li /ul  I've tried things like codereminders:74771907-EA34-4848-A935-0C839AE123CC/code using both list and reminder-item identifiers, but to no avail.  hr  strongUpdate/strong: jeeyul's answer points out that Reminders-related URL schemes are emundocumented/em, which would likely cause rejection of apps that use them when submitted to the OSX/iOS App Store.br For private use, however, this is not an issue.  See:  ul lihttps://developer.apple.com/library/ios/featuredarticles/iPhoneURLScheme_Reference/Introduction/Introduction.html for a list of official URL schemes on both iOS and OSX/li lihttps://superuser.com/questions/498943/directory-of-url-schemes-for-mac-apps provides good information for examining the schemes defined on a given machine./li /ul  <answer161968> I don't know the details of URL scheme. However the scheme is codex-apple-reminder/code not codereminders/code It can launch reminder app at least.   However the host and path rule is not revealed yet. Reminder widget can open Reminder with specific codeEKReminder/code,  So, there must be a scheme definition for it.  The scheme codex-apple-reminder/code is undocumented, So using it should be rejected.  <answer162011> jeeyul's answer mentions codex-apple-reminder/code as an alternative URL scheme.  While both codereminders:///code and codex-apple-reminder:///code work on OSX to merely emlaunch/em the Reminders app, it turns out that the following works emonly/em with codex-apple-reminder:///code, which shows stronghow to open (jump to) a specific emreminder/em/strong:  precodex-apple-reminder://{reminderId} /code/pre  Example: from Terminal, open the emreminder/em whose ID is code0BFDC528-306D-47A7-8E8F-895ACCDC6FFA/code:  precodeopen x-apple-reminder://0BFDC528-306D-47A7-8E8F-895ACCDC6FFA /code/pre  However, strongdoing the same for a reminder emlist/em does NOT work/strong, so this part of my question is still unanswered - I'm still marking it as accepted for at least providing a partial solution.  <comment189298> Thanks - curiously, for merely _launching_ the Reminders app on OSX, `reminders://` works just as well as `x-apple-reminder://` However, I've up-voted your answer for mentioning the latter, because it turns out that you can at least open specific reminders with it - see my [half-]answer. Incidentally, that the Reminder widget can open an individual reminder doesn't necessarily mean that it's using a URL to do so.
