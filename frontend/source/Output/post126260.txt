AppleScript to show package contents of hidden original of alias <body> I'm attempting to build an Automator workflow (which will be saved as a Service, so that I can both access it from contextual menus and invoke it with a keyboard shortcut), that will function much like the Finder's built-in "Show Package Contents" command, but which will additionally accept a package's alias as input. The service will satisfy the following:  It will only be available when the Finder's selection consists of a package or a package's alias.  Rather than show the contents of the package directory itself like the built-in command does, the Service will show the contents of the "Contents" directory (if it exists), located immediately within the package directory.  If the Finder's selection is a package or alias on the desktop, the Contents directory should be opened in a new Finder window. Otherwise, the Contents directory should be opened in the Finder window containing the selection.  My approach has been to have the script first determine whether the file is an Alias, and if it is, to tell the script to show the contents of the original. If the file is not an alias, I'd like to tell the script to simply show the contents of the input.  Excluding the possibility of an alias as input and assuming the input-package is selected in a Finder window, I can successfully write a script that shows the contents of the package's contents folder in the same window:  precodeon run {input, parameters}     set my_output to {}     repeat with oneItem in input         tell application "Finder" to set target of window 1 to ((oneItem as text) &amp; "Contents") end repeat return input end run /code/pre  When I try to set up an "if...then...else" scheme, I fail.  I'm using the latest versions of all relevant software.  <answer126277> You can try something like this:  precode   on run {input, parameters}     tell application "Finder"         repeat with oneItem in input             if kind of oneItem = "Alias" then set oneItem to oneItem's original item             set contentsPath to (oneItem as text) &amp; "Contents"             if oneItem's container as text = (path to desktop as text) then                 open contentsPath             else                 set target of window 1 to contentsPath             end if             activate         end repeat     end tell end run /code/pre  You may also want to include a test to make sure the input is the expected type.  <answer126289> codefolder "Contents" of/code also works with aliases:  precodeon run {input, parameters}     tell application "Finder"         repeat with f in input             open folder "Contents" of f         end repeat     end tell end run /code/pre  You can also assign a shortcut for showing package contents from System Preferences:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9isdJ.png" alt=""  Command-R shows the original file of an alias.  <answer126298> I got it:  precodeon run {input, parameters}     tell application "Finder"         repeat with f in input             reveal f             set target of window 1 to (folder "Contents" of f as text)         end repeat     end tell end run /code/pre  <comment147851> Welcome, we are not ignoring you, just waiting for someone who can answer your question. <comment147870> Please can you append a failing, if/then/else, attempt. Debugging why this is failing will likely lead to a faster solution for you. <comment147891> This workflow fails: "Run AppleScript failed - 1 error: AppleEvent handler failed." <comment147912> There was an extra colon. Try again.
