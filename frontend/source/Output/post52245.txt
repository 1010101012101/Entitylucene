Are all eBooks in the iBookstore DRM protected? <body> A few weeks ago I bought a book in the iBookstore. The title of this book is "Der Aurora Effekt" (German). Then a few weeks later I bought the book "The Tributes of Panem" (German version).   The first title I can copy to my Kobo eBook reader and read the book. But "The Tributes of Panem" was not readable!  Is it possible that not all books are DRM protected?  <answer52246> h1Yes./h1  (Not all books are DRM protected.)  Per the strongofficial iBooks FAQ/strong...     h3How can I determine which books are copy-protected (DRM) versus those that are DRM-free?/h3      iTunes can show you the kind of book you have by selecting the book and then choosing emFile  Get Info/em.      ul   liIf the Kind is marked as strongBook/strong, this is a book you strongdownloaded/strong from the Internet./li   liIf it is listed as strongPurchased Book/strong, it is a strongDRM-free/strong book downloaded from the iBookstore. /li   liIf it is listed as strongProtected Book/strong, it is a strongcopy-protected/strong book from the iBookstore./li   /ul   Only "protected books" have DRM protection.  <answer52277> Whether a book in the iBookstore has DRM is up to the publisher.  Two publishers I know of never do DRM, O'Reilly and Take Control, and there are others too.
