Where does OS X store USB mouse plist? <body> I've found that often when you are experiencing trouble with a peripheral, deleting the plist file can often fix the problem.   My USB mouse has been sticking/freezing for a second at a time lately.   I've looked throughout code~/Library/Preferences//code, but saw no filenames that make me confident enough to delete any of them.   strongUPDATE/strong  I was able to delete the codecom.apple.driver.AppleHIDMouse.plist/code file that was showing in the codeTerminal/code but not in the codeFinder/code.   pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"codePauls-iMac: soliddev$ ls ~/Library/Preferences/ | grep driver com.apple.driver.AppleBluetoothMultitouch.mouse.plist com.apple.driver.AppleBluetoothMultitouch.trackpad.plist com.apple.driver.AppleHIDMouse.plist Pauls-iMac: soliddev$ rm ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.driver.AppleHIDMouse.plist Pauls-iMac: soliddev$ ls ~/Library/Preferences/ | grep driver com.apple.driver.AppleBluetoothMultitouch.mouse.plist com.apple.driver.AppleBluetoothMultitouch.trackpad.plist Pauls-iMac: soliddev$ /code/pre  Unfortunately, the mouse sticking/freezing persists.  strongUPDATE/strong  At the end of the day, I've bought a new mouse, the problem seems to be fixed for now. Thanks for the help.  <answer204568> In Terminal.app:  codels ~/Library/Preferences/ | grep mouse/code  or  codels ~/Library/Preferences/ | grep mouse/code  or  codels ~/Library/Preferences/ | grep driver/code  should give you a list of suspects.  <answer205152> The tracking speed is stored in the  ~/Library/Preferences/.GlobalPreferences.plist file.  precodedefaults read -g | grep mouse "com.apple.mouse.doubleClickThreshold" = "1.1"; "com.apple.mouse.scaling" = "2.5"; /code/pre  The slowest speed shown in System Preferences is 0.0 and the highest is 3.0  You can change the speed by editing the plist directly or with codedefaults/code, but you have to log out and back in.  precodedefaults write -g com.apple.mouse.scaling -float 2.1 /code/pre  This AppleScript code would change the speed immediately:  precodetell application "System Preferences"     reveal pane "com.apple.preference.mouse" end tell tell application "System Events" to tell process "System Preferences"     set value of slider 3 of window 1 to 9.0 -- maximum, minimum is 0.0 end tell quit application "System Preferences" /code/pre  EDIT:      defaults find mouse will search your default domains, keys, and values for the word mouse, without the need to pipe to grep.  <comment246951> Is it an Apple mouse?   with `ls ~/Library/Preferences/ | grep mouse` I get: com.apple.driver.AppleBluetoothMultitouch.mouse.plist .  If your mouse isn't Apple branded, you could try grepping for the makers name. <comment247207> It is not an Apple Mouse, it's a Logitech USB mouse. `ls ~/Library/Preferences/ | grep driver` returned 2 files that seem to be bluetooth related and this file: `com.apple.driver.AppleHIDMouse.plist`. Would you think deleting this file might solve the sticking/freezing mouse problem? <comment247236> I decided to go ahead and delete the 'com.apple.driver.AppleHIDMouse.plist' file, but when I navigate to `~/Library/Preferences/` via Finder, that file is not there. I have vision of all hidden files/folders, fyi. To be clear, typing `ls ~/Library/Preferences/ | grep driver` in terminal produced `com.apple.driver.AppleHIDMouse.plist`, but That file does not show via the Finder. <comment247305> Those files should be visible in the Finder, they're visible on my system. You can try searching in the Finder while you are in the `~/Library/Preferences` folder. Type in the search bar and look for `mouse` , `mouse`, `logitech` , `Logitech`, `usb` or `USB`. If that doesn't show anything, then I don't know. <comment247306> Did the Logitech mouse come with software? Did it install a driver? If so reinstall the software or update it if there is that option. <comment247525> You misunderstand... the speed isn't changing, the mouse stops moving completely for a second or two then returns to normal.
