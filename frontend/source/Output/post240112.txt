Plugging in an external HDMI display makes the computer sluggish <body> 2015 2.7 GHz Intel Core i5, 8gb ram MBP and it usually feels snappy but when I plug in my external Samsung HDMI display it slows down considerably. Animations are janky, delays in editing text, and overall feels sluggish.  Looking at the activity monitor there is no spike in CPU usage or memory or anything.  Any ideas?  <comment295000> Have you checked your graphics card? The graphics card may be experiencing a heavy load. <comment295003> @Brick how do you check the graphics card in OS X?
