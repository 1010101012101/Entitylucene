QuarkXPress crashes when opening one project <body> strongI am having a problem with QuarkXPress 9.5.4.0 on an iMac running Mac OS X 10.11.6./strong   The problem is that whenever I try to open a particular project QuarkXPress crashes. I would normally have a backup, but I’ve only been working on this project since yesterday and haven’t got one.  strongIs there anything I can do that will avoid losing everything I’ve done up to this point?/strong  Please tell me if this is the wrong site for this question. I flipped a coin to pick between this one and the graphic design one. :)  <answer280713> QuarkXPress has a built-in process for validating project files that you can use to try and repair any file inconsistencies. To do this follow these steps:  ol liLaunch QuarkXPress/li liGo to strongFile  Open/strong (or press kbdcommand/kbdkbdO/kbd)/li liNavigate to and strongselect/strong the project file you’re having a problem with, but strongdo not/strong click on Open yet/li liNow press and hold kbdcontrol/kbdkbdshift/kbdkbdoption/kbdkbdcommand/kbd/li liWhile still holding these keys down, click on the kbdOpen/kbd button/li /ol  You emshould/em find that the project opens successfully without crashing QXP, but you may also find that your content has reflowed differently to how you had it originally. Now you should create a new version of the project by dragging the thumbnails from this one to a new one. See below for how to do this:  ol liStill in QXP, create a new project/li liMake sure the new project has the same layout and setup (such as emfacing pages/em or not) and also has the same number of pages/li liIn each of the projects, go to strongView  Thumbnails/strong/li liIn each of the projects, go to strongWindow  Tile/strong and select either emhorizontal/em or emvertical/em/li liNow, in your original project click the first page and hold down the kbdshift/kbd key while you also click on the last page/li liNow drag the pages to your new project/li liSave your new project using a different name/li liClose both projects/li liNow try to reopen the new project you saved at Step 7/li /ol  At this point, the best case scenario is that your new project opens without crashing QXP. If so, make a backup of it before working to get your design back to how you wanted.  If you can’t open the new project, then it’s likely the problem was a particular image, font, etc. If this is the case, follow Steps 1 to 9 again except at Steps 5 and 6 only drag one page across to the new project. If that works, then you know that page was fine, so repeat the steps to copy one page at a time and, as you do that, save your file using a different name each time. This way you’ll hopefully identify the page (or pages) that was causing the problem.  I know there’s quite a bit in this answer to follow, so if you have any problems or I’ve not been very clear, let me know and I’ll try to help you further.  <comment353106> Wow!! This worked a treat and I swear you saved me like 8 or 9 hrs of work! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! :) <comment353109> My pleasure! :) As an aside, QXP also offers native support for automatically saving backups of your projects. Go to QuarkXPress  Preferences... and select Open and Save in the left-hand pane. This will give you access to Auto Save and Auto Backup options. You may want to consider taking advantage of these. Good luck with your project! <comment353242> I use QXP almost daily and didn't know this trick. Thank you for sharing! :)
