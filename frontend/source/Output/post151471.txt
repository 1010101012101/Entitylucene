Time Capsule external connections <body> strongI recently purchased a new 2TB Time Capsule. Can I connect my old Time Capsule to it to serve as an external drive?/strong  <answer151472> Yes. You can use the New as main router and create a WiFi network. Then have the Old join in (as an Access Point in jargon). It's the same is accessing a shared disk on another Mac laptop/desktop.  Or you can link them with Ethernet cable.
