Can folder actions be inherited? <body> If I set up folder actions on a folder, is there a way to ensure that those actions would be also there for all subfolders of that one?  In other words, if folder actions are set for ~/bar, is there a way to ensure that they are there also on ~/bar/foo as soon as I have created the folder?  I have checked whether the folder actions are transferred when I duplicate a folder, but that's not the case, and this makes me think I am out of luck.  <answer127709> When creating the Folder action you will have to add all sub folder in folder action set up and   strongchose the folder action for each/strong.
