How to create a file with a specific Created at time? <body>    strongPossible Duplicate:/strongbr   How do I set the creation time of a file?       How can you create a files on a Mac that have a specific creation date (different from the current one)?  What I have found so far, touch can only alter the modified at time...  <answer56554> I believe you can do it with touch.  precodetouch -t YYYYMMDDhhmm /filehere /code/pre  <answer59851> SetFile can also be used to set the creation date before the modification date or in the future.  precode-d date    Sets the creation date, where date is a string of the            form: "mm/dd/[yy]yy [hh:mm:[:ss] [AM | PM]]" Notes:            Enclose the string in quotation marks if it contains spa-            ces. The date must be in the Unix epoch, that is, between            1/1/1970 and 1/18/2038. If the year is provided as a two-            digit year, it is assumed to be in the 21st century and            must be from 00 (2000) through 38 (2038). /code/pre  This would set the creation date to the modification date:  precodeSetFile -d "$(GetFileInfo -m test.txt)" test.txt /code/pre  SetFile and GetFileInfo are part of the command line tools package, which can be downloaded from developer.apple.com/downloads or from Xcode's preferences after installing it from the App Store.  <comment64930> [How to change the creation date/time of a file in Lion?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/49154/how-to-change-the-creation-date-time-of-a-file-in-lion) only mentions `touch -t` as well. <comment64931> `touch -t` normally only changes the modification date. The creation date is only changed if the new modification date would be before it. <comment64936> On 10.7, touch -t appears to work on my test system, even if the mod date is after.  I used touch -mt to change the mod time and it works fine. <comment64942> I meant that `touch file.txt; touch -t 199901010000 file.txt` would change the creation date, but `touch file2.txt; touch -t 209901010000 file2.txt` wouldn't. <comment64946> @Lri, thank you: I didn't come across it in my searches. <comment64947> @RichardBelisle thank you: it works! <comment68953> Awesome, thanks for finding this!
