How do you use scutil to set a domain specific DNS server? <body> I've seen how /etc/resolver/domainname works - but I'd like to know how to use scutil to do the same thing.   I've found results that look right ( scutil list State:/Network/Service/[^/]+/DNS )  precodeshow State:/Network/Service/11FBC19E-CBAA-4C2F-B2A9-606EF555698E/DNS  &lt;dictionary&gt; {   DomainName : hsd1.fl.comcast.net.   ServerAddresses : &lt;array&gt; {     0 : 10.0.1.1   } } /code/pre  But how do you use scutil to actually set that DomainName specific resolver?
