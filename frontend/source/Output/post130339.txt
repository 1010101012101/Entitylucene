Can't iMessage with a Samsung Phone <body> I am having trouble using iMessage with one of my contacts.  I can send messages to iPhones without any issues.  My contact's phone is a Samsung Galaxy S3.  Does anyone have any suggestions for me?  <answer130341> iMessage only works between apple devices. If you were using an iPhone it would be able to use SMS instead of iMessage when the other person has a non iOS device, but since you are using an iPad you can't contact them.   <answer130441> h2You can SMS from iPad to any mobile device that supports SMS/h2  ul licreate Google Account/li lienable Google Voice free account and set up your Google Voice number/li lidownload and install Google Voice - iPhone app, looks ugly, so you may want to:/li lienable Text message to email/li lienable Google Voice Voicemail/li lienable Google Voice Voicemail Transcriptions and while doing that, also:/li lienable eMail Delivery of Voicemail Transcriptions: Next to "Voicemail Notifications", check the box next to eMail the message to and select an eMail address to receive your voicemail transcriptions via email/li lisync your contacts with Google/li /ul  Now you can either use the Google Voice app for SMS, or Apple Mail, once first receiving an SMS, just reply like its an eMail. Messages longer than 166 characters get truncated rather turning into 2 SMS messages for eMailing SMS delivery only (the app behavior is different).  <answer240443> It's because iMessage only works through Apple devices;  not other companies text messaging  <comment152753> That is why I have to use my phone, thank you! <comment152899> If you want to be able to message people on non-Apple devices from your iPad, you might want to try to get your contact to use a cross-platform service like WhatsApp or Facebook Messenger. <comment152915> Footnote: Google Voice is only available to people who can tie the Google Voice number to a phone number based in the US. <comment152916> Where else would you want to? jk! Very good point.
