Make Facetime ignore incoming calls in macOS <body> Does anyone know of a way (hack or otherwise) to prevent incoming FaceTime and iPhone Continuity calls, other than disabling both entirely? I still want to make iPhone and FaceTime calls from my Mac.  FaceTime is ridiculously aggressive about incoming calls: It will not only steal your mouse and keyboard focus and tab you out of fullscreen programs, it will also lower your entire system volume and pause your music. This sucks because I get about 4 spam phone calls per day. I don't mind answering legitimate calls on my iPhone.  The focus-stealing problem is the biggest, and I'd settle just with fixing that. I've seen a question about that asked on Reddit but with no answer.  <answer294584> Have you tried disabling notifications? Or at least turning them down?  Under strong/strong → strongSystem Preferences/strong → strongNotifications/strong → strongFaceTime/strong, emuncheck/em codePlay sound for notifications/code, then change the strongAlert Style/strong to codeBanners/code. Banners shouldn’t steal focus.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bZWtT.png" alt="FaceTime Notification Settings"  You could also enable strongDo Not Disturb/strong while in fullscreen by kbd⌥ opt/kbd-clicking the Notification Center icon at the far right of your system menu bar. Some apps do this automatically, while others observe the codeWhen mirroring to TVs and projectors/code setting under the emTurn on Do Not Disturb/em header.  This is accessed by going into strong/strong → strongSystem Preferences/strong → strongNotifications/strong → strongDo Not Disturb/strong.  <comment372359> Huh, this seems like something I would have tried. I think it works and will update if I notice it's not doing what I want. Also, nice answer format.
