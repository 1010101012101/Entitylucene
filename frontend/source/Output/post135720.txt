iPhone 4S won't (properly) install apps <body> My 3(?) year old iPhone 4S, which has admittedly hit the ground a few times, has developed a new problem: apps download, but do not install fully; the icons never show on the home screens, and in General - Usage the icons show, but the apps have no names.  When connected to iTunes, the apps show as installed; ditto when connecting to the App Store.  Specs: MD240LL/A, 16GB (4.4 GB available), iOS 7.1.1 (11D201)  Any ideas what could be causing this and what would be workarounds?
