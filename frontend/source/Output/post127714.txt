Can Launchbar tag files? <body> I have LaunchBar auto select anything that is dropped into my downloads folder. I wanted to run a Hazel rule but only on files with a certain tag and I want to do this with LaunchBar.  <answer131165> Tagging is supported since LaunchBar 6, released June 11, 2014.  ul liYou either send a file or a selection of files from Finder to LB (codealt/code + holding codespace/code) or select a file (or – with nightly build 6.1 – a selection of files) within LB./li liThen press codetab/code, type a part of the Finder tag name and add the tag  by pressing codereturn/code. You have also the option to replace existing tags with the new tag./li /ul  You can display a file’s tags by pressing code→/code after selecting the file in LB.  LaunchBar 6.3 added support to work with multiple tags at once.
