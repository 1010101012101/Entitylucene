Stops snippets syncing between iPhone and Mac <body> A new feature in Mavericks in snippets. I use snippets on my iPhone and these are syncing to my Mac. How can I stop the snippets syncing to my Mac?  <answer113278> The snippets sync through iCloud. The simplest solution is to just log out of iCloud, or disable iCloud's Documents &amp; Data service in System Preferences, but it might not be ideal if you want to sync other iCloud data.
