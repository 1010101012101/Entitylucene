files pre-preview by hitting space: can I disable "transparency"? <body> I've got a lot of sketches in .png which have no background. When I hit "space" the pre-preview window is open, but it uses artificial transparency which does not allow to assess the image properly.   Is it possible to disable this behaviour and set background color to white for images with transparent areas like in .png format?  <comment318264> Any graphics app would require you to actually set a non-transparent layer behind it; otherwise how would you tell the difference between a correctly alpha'd image & one you'd left the background in by mistake?
