iphone Audio Book Reader <body> I am using my iPhone to listen to audio books. When the iPhone stays on, I can stop listenting and when I restart it remembers which file I was last listening to, and where in that file I was. However, whenever I turn off the iPhone, it forgets where in an audio file I stopped listening; I have to manually fast forward to where I was.  Is there a way to get the media player to remember where in a file I was when turning off the iphone, or is there a different player software that could do that for me?  <answer181999> There's a setting in iTunes to remember position…  Select all chapters, or books etc.br Get Info kbd Cmd ⌘ /kbd kbd i /kbd   Options tab.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/B2Ltm.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment216498> That is impressive 4 minutes to replay with customized screenshot. How many fingers do you have? <comment216503> the regular 10, though my typing style only uses about 4 of those ;-) <comment216508> well, you are way more developed, I can only handle 2 at the time. <comment216678> Thanks! This sort of works... now when restarting in the midst of a previous file the media player does remember the position. However, it does not remember which file I was listening to (it used to). I am listening to audio files that I ripped, and they show up as "Music". I tried to set as audiobooks but the media player goes nuts and just keeps cycling between files without actually playing them. <comment216679> you should be able to set them as audiobook in iTunes - that's how I got the HHGTTG in there, ripped CD, manually changed type. Works just fine. <comment216707> Did you set "remember playback position" before or after setting as audiobook? Second last post at https://discussions.apple.com/thread/5345505?start=30 says to do so, and I did as well... but I tried a few times, and every time, media player on iphone goes nuts, just quickly cycling between all the files from a single (original) dvd. <comment216710> tbh I don't recall which order i did things in. <comment218017> a late thought - you don't have 'shake to shuffle' enabled, do you? That would mess things up if you were jogging ;-)
