Comprehensive Clean out and migration of specific folders in Apple iTunes? <body> These are the Folders and Disk space being occupied by the Data held on by Apple iTunes as laid out below:   I have written down some current thoughts &amp; steps/ direction as well for each. There are lots of duplicates in the Backups &amp; VoiceMemos (determined via a Duplicate File Finder).   Please help / guide me in organizing and doing a comprehensive clean out of things in these folders.   Items in emItalics represent key questions/em on how to go about a certain part of this process?   Here is the Folder Tree, Space they occupy and Observations &amp; Thoughts.       strongC:\Users\Alex\AppData\Roaming\Apple Computer/strong           ..\Logs\CrashReporter – 300 M         strongC:\Users\Alex\AppData\Roaming\Apple Computer\MobileSync/strong           ..\Backups – 24.5 GB                  Clean iPhone 4 Backup              emHow to Eliminate Duplicates in iphone 5 Backup?/em (Search Again)              Migrate?? iPad Backup?

These you would have to chase manually.br You'd have to find an app that will play them without duplicating to another location, which iTunes would do by default. [unless they already show in iTunes, in which case you can audition from there &amp; delete as necessary.]                 Downloads – 700 M                        .TMP Downloads - DELETE                   Always safe to delete temp files.          strongiTunes Music – 10.8 GB/strong                  Podcasts – 5.9 GB -  emMigrate / Export? How?/em             Migrate by simply copying to another location.br I'm not fully familiar with how iTunes deals with podcasts it emthinks/em it ought to have but can't find. Might need to experiment.                 strongMobile Applications – 4.4 GB/strong – emHow to consolidate to single MA folder?/em           I wouldn't try to move apps, as you might just end up with duplicates. I'd either leave, or if space is at an absolute premium, delete.                 strongVoice Memos – 240 M/strong - How? Consolidate to Single VM folder           Manually, as above.                          .m4a files: 1/26/2011, 19040101, 20100703 – 20120506                      Music – 100 M                        Yoga/ Rave – (Poor titling and Tagging) – 45.6 M – Check &amp; Delete                   Few Singles – 50 M – Migrate and Clear                   All music would need to be handled manually, from within iTunes.br The exception would be anything you already threw out of iTunes, but didn't tell it to Trash - those would be an afternoon of guesswork &amp; comparison, I'm afraid.
