After installing SSD in 2009 iMac I only see a black screen <body> The computer chimes, and when I press any key like the option or R keys to enter recovery or the Startup Disk Manager, nothing happens. I tried to reset the SMC to no avail.   I have a 3TB portable HDD with a bootable install partition of Sierra I would like to install on the SSD.  <answer272006> Older Macs had what's called Parameter RAM (PRAM), newer Macs use Non-Volatile Random-Access Memory (NVRAM). Resetting this would be the first thing I'd do:  ol listrongPower off your iMac/strong/li listrongPress the kbdpower button/kbd emand then/em press the kbdcommand/kbdkbdoption/kbdkbdp/kbdkbdr/kbd keys./strong You have to make sure you press these keys before the gray screen appears or it wonâ€™t work./li listrongHold those keys down/strong until your Mac reboots again and you here the startup chime./li listrongLet go of the keys and let your Mac reboot normally./strong In your case it probably won't boot normally, but then power off again and try starting up again with the kbdOption/kbd key down to see if Startup Disk Manager appears./li /ol  Let us know how you go.  <answer272136> Fixed it. The DisplayPort connector came undone.  <comment342053> I reset the PRAM, but the screen is still black when I press the [option] key. Could it be a problem with the screen connector?
