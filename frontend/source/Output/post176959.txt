Finding an app or file? <body> I need to install the newest version of Perl on Macbook running Yosemite.  It currently has Perl5.18 built in.  I understand that the system sometimes needs this version and it shouldn't be altered.  I did successfully install the latest version of Perl but I can't find it using Finder or Terminal.  It did not overwrite the 5.18 version but went somewhere else.  How can I locate it?  Thanks  <answer176963> You can use codelocate/code to see where a Perl binary is installed  precodelocate bin\/perl  | grep perl\$ /code/pre  for example  precode$ locate bin\/perl  | grep perl\$ /Users/corti/perl5/perlbrew/perls/5.20/bin/perl /Users/corti/perl5/perlbrew/perls/5.20t/bin/perl /opt/local/bin/perl /usr/bin/perl /code/pre  By the way, I would strongly suggest to use Perlbrew to install an additional Perl version.  <comment209124> How did you install it ? MacPort ? Homebrew ? <comment209130> What You get when You type `perl` and press "â‡¥ TAB" twice in Terminal.app ?
