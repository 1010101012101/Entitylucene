Why is shared volume 'Music' always missing from the DEVICES part of the sidebar in Finder? <body> I have a mid 2010 17" MacBook Pro (MBP).  I also have a Windows Home Server (WHS) that I connect to regularly from my MBP.  Normally when I connect to a share on the WHS, that mount point is listed in the sidebar of Finder under codeDEVICES/code.    h1Problem/h1  Under codeDEVICES/code, one share never shows:      codeMusic/code   All other WHS shares (codePhotos/code, codeMovies/code, codeDocuments/code etc.) always show in that part of the sidebar when mounted.   The WHS (named codeBundywhs/code) appears as expected under codeSHARED/code, I can take that route to connect to the codeMusic/code volume.    I can eject the codeMusic/code volume and reconnect, but it still doesn't show under codeDEVICES/code.   I upgraded from OS X 10.7.2 to 10.8, the problem persists.   It's not stopping me from doing anything, just more of a hassle not to have the quick shortcut.  h2Questions/h2  Is there a reason why codeMusic/code will not show under codeDEVICES/code?   Is there anything I can do to make it show?    h2Notes/h2  Results of a command in Terminal:   precodedefaults read com.apple.sidebarlists | grep Music                 Name = Music;                 Name = Music;                 Name = Music;                 Name = Music;                 Name = Music; /code/pre  h2Results of second command request/h2  precode };             EntryType = 8;             Icon = &lt;496d6752 00000132 00000000 4642494c 00000126 00000002 00000000 00000000 01160003 00000000 c8c3bb37 0000482b 00000000 019faeb6 019fdd00 0000ca29 d33c0000 00000920 fffe0000 00000000 0000ffff ffff0001 0018019f aeb6019f acc8019f acc7019f a415019f a408019f a407000e 0036001a 00470065 006e0065 00720069 00630046 0069006c 00650053 00650072 00760065 00720049 0063006f 006e002e 00690063 006e0073 000f001a 000c004d 00610063 0069006e 0074006f 00730068 00200048 00440012 005a5379 7374656d 2f4c6962 72617279 2f436f72 65536572 76696365 732f436f 72655479 7065732e 62756e64 6c652f43 6f6e7465 6e74732f 5265736f 75726365 732f4765 6e657269 6346696c 65536572 76657249 636f6e2e 69636e73 00130001 2f00ffff 0000&gt;;             Name = Music;         },  { Alias = &lt;00000000 009e0003 00010000 00000000 00004244 63750001 ffffffff ffffffff     00000000 00000000 00001201 fffe0000 00000000 0000ffff ffff000e 000c0005 004d0075 00730069     0063000f 000c0005 004d0075 00730069 00630012 00000013 000e2f56 6f6c756d 65732f4d 75736963     00090026 00266369 66730000 01000000 736d623a 2f2f5269 636b4062 756e6479 7768732f 4d757369 6300ffff 0000&gt;; EntryType = 8; Name = Music; } {  "com.apple.LSSharedFileList.TemplateSystemSelector" = 1935822195; }; Icon = &lt;496d6752 0000001c 00000000 5359534c 00000010 00000000 744d7573&gt;; Name = Music; }, {                      {             Alias = &lt;00000000 009e0003 00010000 00000000 00004244 63750001 ffffffff ffffffff 00000000 00000000 00001201 fffe0000 00000000 0000ffff ffff000e 000c0005 004d0075 00730069 0063000f 000c0005 004d0075 00730069 00630012 00000013 000e2f56 6f6c756d 65732f4d 75736963 00090026 00266369 66730000 01000000 736d623a 2f2f5269 636b4062 756e6479 7768732f 4d757369 6300ffff 0000&gt;;             EntryType = 8;             Name = Music;             Visibility = AlwaysVisible;             }, {             Alias = &lt;00000000 009e0003 00010000 00000000 00004244 63750001 ffffffff ffffffff 00000000 00000000 00001201 fffe0000 00000000 0000ffff ffff000e 000c0005 004d0075 00730069 0063000f 000c0005 004d0075 00730069 00630012 00000013 000e2f56 6f6c756d 65732f4d 75736963 00090026 00266369 66730000 01000000 736d623a 2f2f5269 636b4062 756e6479 7768732f 4d757369 6300ffff 0000&gt;;             EntryType = 8;             Name = Music;         },                     { /code/pre  <answer35065> When browsing the shared drive, you should be able to drag the shared folder to the side bar under favourites header.  ul liIn reply to your comment.

Hope that helps!  <answer61168> h1First question/h1     Is there a reason why Music will not show?   One of the following commands, run in Terminal, might help towards an explanation.  precodedefaults read com.apple.sidebarlists | grep Music /code/pre  – expect a match of some sort. If no match, it'll be difficult to discover/guess how the entry was lost.   precodedefaults read com.apple.sidebarlists favorites | grep -B 2 Visibility /code/pre  Here, with Mountain Lion, I find codeVisibility = NeverVisible/code for some things – but not for the thing that I most recently removed from the sidebar, which leaves me wondering about code.plist/code files that are used for preferred removals in Lion and Mountain Lion.   h2Based on commentary, revisions and other answers/h2  If using the File menu to add the volume to the sidebar does not allow the volume to appear under codeDEVICES/code, we might view this as a bug in the OS.   The following command should reveal detail of the five entries for codeMusic/code:   precodedefaults read com.apple.sidebarlists | grep -B 3 -A 2 Music /code/pre  <answer61448> h1Second question/h1     Is there anything I can do to make it show?   If you want the codeMusic/code emvolume/em to appear under codeFAVORITES/code:   ul lino (sorry). /li /ul  It seems impossible to make an SMB a volume a favourite in the sidebar. You can drop the volume to that area of the sidebar, but the listing disappears immediately.   You can add the volume to the sidebar, after which it should appear (whenever mounted) under codeDEVICES/code.   With kbdCommand/kbd-kbdK/kbd in Finder, the volume can be a favourite in the strongConnect to Server/strong dialogue. Example:   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/sl3hr.png" alt="screenshot of the Connect to Server dialogue, with &#39;Favorite Servers&#39;"  Anything other than the root of the volume can be a favourite in the sidebar of Finder.   There's an Apple-defined listing for codeMusic/code but that's for the Music emfolder/em within the home directory. Example:   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/l5CEl.png" alt="screenshot of the Sidebar tab of Finder preferences"  <answer99676> My networked shares sometimes show, sometimes do not as well. If you manually codemount/code them after finder is loaded, they should show.   Many users have reported problems with shares not showing in Finder sidebar, since Lion and Mountain Lion.  <comment39997> Yes I can do that, but it was bugging me why the one share wasn't showing. <comment39998> The individual shares are not listed there, just groups.  Bummer I was hoping this fixed it. <comment40217> Well, shucks. I would next look into settings within your Windows Home Server environment — and now we're well outside of any expertise I have. Good luck! <comment40496> It could have just been accidentally trashed at some point without realising. <comment70913> I am running Mountain Lion now.  When I run the first command, I get the following results:  Name = Music;                 Name = Music;                 Name = Music;                 Name = Music;                 Name = Music; visibilty is not neverVisible for anything I want. <comment70944> You say that `Music` does appear under `DEVICES`. In which part of the sidebar does `Music` **not** appear? The `FAVORITES` part? In which part of the sidebar do `Photos`, `Movies` and `Documents` appear before you mount those volumes? <comment70949> Thanks. I assume that the upgrade to 10.8 has not worked around the problem with sidebar – true? <comment70954> The Sidebar tab of Finder preferences offers Apple-defined favourites, shared stuff, and classes of device; **not individual volumes**. <comment71053> When looking at finder, there are three main groups on the left side.  Favorites, Shared, and Devices.  Anything volume from another computer is shown under devices when I mount them.  They do not appear anywhere before i mount them.  To access them I click on my whs (named Bundywhs) under shared.  That will list the volumes.  If I connect to a share then it will appear under Devices.  Except for music. <comment71054> That is correct. <comment71104> As the question is becoming clearer, this answer is less relevant … but I'll leave it. <comment71106> OK, I added a little more to this answer. If you can edit your question to include (format as code) the result of the command, that'll be great. <comment71185> I added those in.  One thing from the notes you made to this answer.  In my case I do not mount these volumes from the file menu.  They are mounted when I log my machine in via a script. <comment71454> Thanks. Please mention the scripting, and whatever else may be relevant, in the question – it'll help people to read this page.
