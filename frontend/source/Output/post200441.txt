I can´t receive an app transfer on iTunes Connect <body> I´m trying to receive an app transfer on my iTunes Connect account, but I can´t be able to do that, because the form to accept the transfer is throwing me this error:     The phone number must be in a valid format. Preface the phone number   with ‘+’ followed by the country code (for example, +44 844 209 0611)   I try to capture the phone number in so many ways, but is impossible to continue.  <answer200711> ul liIf you are unable to initiate the transfer after reading the how-to, contact developer support./li liIf you don't see that a transfer in has arrived when the sender sees it processed, contact developer support./li liIf you have gotten the software to accept the transfer and you just need to wait a day for any bulk processing, then wait a day./li /ul  Last resort, https://developer.apple.com/support/  <comment241912> I have the same problem, did anyone solve this problem? <comment241958> Same here too. I'm from Brazil. Trying to contact iTunesConnect for further info. I'll post here when they answer me. <comment242098> In which country do you reside and what number did you enter? <comment242130> @emotality Yes, I used +52 for Mexico.
