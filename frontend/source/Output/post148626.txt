Changing /etc/hosts not getting affected <body> I have added the following line in my code/etc/hosts/code:  precode127.0.0.1   myapp.corp.com /code/pre  so my full code/etc/hosts/code looks like:  precode127.0.0.1   localhost 127.0.0.1   myapp.corp.com 255.255.255.255 broadcasthost ::1             localhost  fe80::1%lo0 localhost /code/pre  After this, I have run the following commands:  precodesudo dscacheutil -flushcache sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder /code/pre  After which I have started the local server, but   precodemyapp.corp.com:8080  /code/pre  is not working. Where as codelocalhost:8080/code works. I tried even restarting my machine, clearing the browser cache. Nothing helped.   Where I'm making mistake?  <comment175038> Did you edit that file as root?  Open the file up again to make sure your changes took hold.  Making that edit works on my machine without having to flush anything. <comment175043> Yes as a root only I have edited the file. <comment175096> Try dig or ping that domain to see what your OS think its IP address is.
