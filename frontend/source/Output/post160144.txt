How to delete Apple ID without password? <body> How can I delete an Apple ID from an iPad without the password to the Apple ID?  I am purchasing a second-hand iPad from my friend's shop. The previous user of this iPad didn't reset all the content and I do not have his Apple ID password and his email.  Is there a way to delete previous owner AppleID account?  <answer160147> you sure have his email if you know his Apple ID. You can delete it if Find My iPad is not enabled. Otherwise it will become locked if it is.  These what you do before buying second hand Apple device
