Is it possible to hide the name of the desktop icons? <body> I know it is possible to hide the name by renaming the file/folder to something else. The problem comes with my cloud showing in the desktop. I want it to show and I don't want to change the names of my folders.  I made a cool icon set for the few things I've got in my desktop and the names there just don't fit.  <answer142269> Using just Finder to hide filenames on the Desktop is (to my knowledge) not possible, but I would be happy to be proven wrong about that.  I realise you don't want to rename files and folders, but the only workaround I know of to "hide" the filenames is to rename them to a space " ".  <comment167604> *"I know it is possible to hide the name by renaming the file/folder to something else."* <comment167606> Yes I realise what he said, and I acknowledged that in my answer: `Using just Finder to hide filenames on the Desktop is (to my knowledge) not possible.` I'll edit my post so it shows that more prominently. <comment293072> FinderPop? It has sooo many functions.
