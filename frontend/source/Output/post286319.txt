MySQL does not recognize tables after XAMPP reinstall <body> For some reason mysql.server didn't start on my computer. This occurred randomly without apparent reason.   I've uninstalled XAMPP and installed it again.  This time, mysql says that the tables I used don't exist.  precodeTable 'my_database.my_table' doesn't exist in engine /code/pre  While I can clearly see them in code/Applications/XAMPP/xamppfiles/var/mysql/code   I donâ€™t understand this error. What is going on here? What should I do?  <comment361263> Your question is rather unclear. We don't see what you see in your mysql folder. To simplify life and answering your question add a directory listing or a screenshot! Also: what does *"I am not getting this error."* mean? Did you create a mysql dump before uninstalling XAMPP?
