How can I “Delete All” from Inbox mail folder in iOS 8.1? <body> Is there a way to mass delete compiled list of emails on iOS devices (like can be done in os x)? I only know two options: select individually &amp; swipe "left" and from bottom select "edit", then selecting each message individually. I tried solution described in similar question without success (described as iOS 7).  <answer157166> ul liIf it is not already showing, from your Mailboxes view, select Edit &amp; check the All Trash option. This will then be added to the bottom of your Mailboxes list.  strongemNeeded later./em/strong  /li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6rlTJ.png" alt="enter image description here"  ul liFrom All Inboxes, or your chosen Inbox, select Edit, then Mark, Mark all as read [seems to make a difference, toggle unread/read just so it gets the idea]./li liThen Edit, check the first item, which enables the Mark, Move &amp; Trash options./li liHold Move &amp; keeping it held, uncheck the item you just checked./li liRelease Move./li liThe Move options screen should appear.br Select Trash./li liWait until all items have been moved [the graphics seems to do it immediately, but experimentation has shown it can take a while to actually move, if there are a lot./li liReturn to Mailboxes, select All Trash./li liEdit, Delete All, done./li /ul  emCaveat/em... It seems that if you open any individual Mailbox after doing this, they are all returned. I think you may need to wait for the Settings  Mail...  [mail account]  Advanced  Deleted Messages, Remove... period to expire, before it becomes permanent.  <comment201802> THANK you for this. What an absolutely absurd, hacky ridiculous way for Apple to handle a very very simple task. <comment201804> For sure - a simple 'delete all' even if it asked you 3 times 'are you sure?' would be preferable. <comment346590> Works great for archiving all email matching a search on iOS 10!
