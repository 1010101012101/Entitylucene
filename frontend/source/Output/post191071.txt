Which graphics cards or integrated GPUs support metal? <body> Apple announced metal for OS X.  Apple's website clearly states some features will not be available on all macs, which seems to refer to metal support.  But is there a list of already confirmed GPUs, most importantly are intel integrated GPUs supported?  This would help me choosing a future dev computer with metal support this summer.  hr  We know Metal on iOS is linked to OpenGL ES 3.0 support. All devices which support OpenGL ES 3 also support Metal.  Is there a direct link between Metal support and a specific version of OpenGL (and maybe unrelated to graphics OpenCL)?  <answer191078> In the WWDC 2015 video "What's new in Metal, Part 1", Rav Dhiraj from the GPU software division states at 8'40"     Metal is supported by all Macs introduced since 2012. (Nvidia, AMD and Intel)   This means :  ul liIntel HD Graphics 4000, Iris 5000 &amp; 6000 family,/li linVidia GT 600M, 700M family,/li liAMD R9 M family,  /li /ul  <answer198385> I'm running a mac pro 3,1 with a gtx 760 card (kepler based) and according to the metalinfo app released by netkas it is metal supported:  MetalInfo! Metal Device Name:  NVIDIA GeForce GTX 760 Lower Power Device: No Headless Device:    Yes logout Saving session...completed.  Turns out all you need is a modern graphics card!  <comment226963> Let's see whether somebody digs out some publicly available information about this. <comment226976> Doesn't it coincide with OpenCL compatible GPU drivers? <comment226984> Not exactely : https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT202823  It's probably with openGL 4/OpenCL 1.2 <comment227160> Perfect! I just watched the keynote and this is exactly what they say: all configurations since 2012 across the 3 vendors (intel, nvidia, amd).
