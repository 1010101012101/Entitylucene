How to change the path of application in OSX <body> I removed strongphonegap/strong from    precode/usr/local/bin/phonegap   /code/pre  and installed it again using codenpm/code, now when running codephonegap/code, I see this error:    precode-bash: /usr/local/bin/phonegap: No such file or directory /code/pre  while codephonegap/code is installed in    precode/Users/myUserName/.nvm/v5.8.0/lib/node_modules /code/pre  How can I fix this?  <answer234383> I can't speak to the odd path you've installed this software into, but the reason the shell says it can't find it is that bash (and other shells) maintain a hash table with the locations of executable binaries that have been run before.  The reason behind this is so that the shell doesn't have to actually search for it each time it needs to execute it.  See: http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.html#Command-Search-and-Execution  To force bash to re-hash the table, use 'hash -r' .  <answer234384> It sounds like you need to emlink/em  code/Users/myUserName/.nvm/v5.8.0/lib/node_modules/phonegap/code  to  code/usr/local/bin/phonegap/code  h2Step 1/h2  In terminal, run   precodels -l /usr/local/bin/phonegap /code/pre  You'll probably see something like:  precodelrwxr-xr-x 1 jsmith wheel 36 Mar 26 12:05 /usr/local/bin/phonegap -&gt; /some/other/path/to/phonegap /code/pre  If it starts with a lowercase codeL/code then it is a link. It's probably pointing to a file that no longer exists, so you can remove it by going  precoderm -f /usr/local/bin/phonegap /code/pre  Please be careful with coderm/code it means "remove" or "delete" and there is no undo.  Then, you will need to make a new link from the existing codephonegap/code to the place where it is expected to be:  precodeln -s /Users/myUserName/.nvm/v5.8.0/lib/node_modules/phonegap /usr/local/bin/phonegap /code/pre  You do emnot/em want to add code/Users/myUserName/.nvm/v5.8.0/lib/node_modules//code to your $PATH because that will eventually change. That's the whole reason to link them to a static path like code/usr/local/bin//code.  emNote: you may need to add codesudo/code before those commands, if you get some sort of permissions error./em  (Also, sorry about the codepandoc/code reference earlier. I had copied/pasted an actual example file from my computer and meant to change it and missed one.)  <comment286090> What's the output of `which phonegap` ? <comment286091> @MateuszSzlosek nothing, literally nothing <comment286092> Do you have `/Users/myUserName/.nvm/v5.8.0/lib/node_modules` in your `PATH`? If not, try to add it. <comment286093> Or You can make a symlink in `/usr/local/bin/phonegap` to the existing phonegap executable. <comment286094> @MateuszSzlosek I have /Users/myUserName/.nvm/v5.8.0/lib/. is this enough? <comment286574> what is the output of `ls -l /usr/local/bin/phonegap`? <comment286576> You will need sudo on the ln and rm commands - and did you mean pandoc? <comment286581> you may need sudo depending on /usr/local/ permissions. pandoc was a typo/copy/paste relic. Thanks.
