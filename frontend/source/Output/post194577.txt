Unable to view uploaded photos/videos on iCloud.com <body> I can see that my photos/videos are backed up to iCloud, however, when I log into icloud.com to view them from my PC, the images do not populate.   The app has been installed onto my computer.  <answer194607> If you have made a backup of your device and the photos it doesn't work. For synchronisation of your photos you need to use iCloud Photo Library which was introduced with iOS 8.
