How can I fix the Spotlight index for an encfs-mounted directory? <body> Until recently, on OS X 10.8, I was using Alfred (which in turn uses Spotlight) to search files and directories on an encfs-mounted partition (which is mounted off a folder in my Dropbox directory).  I used to use the command codesudo mdutil -i on ~/Dropbox-encfs/code to enable indexing for that partition once it had been mounted (typically, I remounted every time I rebooted).  However, since upgrading to OS X 10.9, entering the same command returns the error codeError: unknown indexing state/code. Indexing and searching on my main root partition continues to work:  precode~$ sudo mdutil -a -s /:     Indexing enabled. /Users/myuserdirectory/Dropbox-encfs:     Error: unknown indexing state. /code/pre  Has something changed in OS X 10.9 that might cause this? How would I go about debugging or fixing this problem?  I'm using encfs version 1.7.4p1. I've already tried turning on and off the indexing (code-i on/code, code-i off/code), and using the code-E/code flag to mdutil to erase the store.  I mount the encfs partition using the following command:  codesudo encfs --public -ovolname=Dropbox-encfs ~/Dropbox/.encfs-crypted ~/Dropbox-encfs/code  Aside from the indexing problem, the mounted encfs partition otherwise seems to work fine.  I should add that I am also seeing warnings of this form in code/var/log/system.log/code:  precodeDec 23 14:51:20 montpelier.local mds[57]: (Warning) Volume: vsd:0x7ffe0c826c00 Open failed.  failureCount:7 /code/pre  <answer115289> Appending the option code-o local/code to the codemount/code (i.e. codeencfs/code) command seems to work...  <comment134723> I'm on 10.9.1 and can get the status to show "Indexing enabled" for the encfs volume when appending the option `-o local`. Nevertheless, files from inside the volume still do not appear for me in searched for some reason. <comment134745> @GJ, perfect, that worked for me - and I do get the search results. Thanks. Not sure why it doesn't work for you - perhaps indexing hasn't yet finished? I monitored it with the Spotlight icon in the top-right. If you turn this into an answer, I'll mark it correct. <comment134774> Let me be more precise: I can search inside the encrypted volume when initiating the search in a Finder window that is currently viewing the volume, and switching the search scope at the top of the results from "This Mac" to just "Dropbox-encfs", which means the Spotlight index is probably fine. My problem is that I can't get combined results across both the entire regular disk and the encrypted volume. Any ideas for that? <comment134786> @GJ, hmm, well I don't do my searches that way - I use Alfred to initiate my search, as I mentioned in my Q. I just tried it in Finder, and the results do seem to be separated. I think that may be by design, though. <comment147326> Andrew, do you also get the dropbox to get stuck on the "syncing" mode due to the spotlight folder having permission problems? Or did you manage to work around that?
