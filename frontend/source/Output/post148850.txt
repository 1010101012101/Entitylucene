Note: if you do any of these you most likely do not need to use the code.noindex/code extensions since files hidden from the finder will not be typically be shown in Finder Spotlight searches.  ul licodechflags hidden fileToHide/code (as already mentioned) does this by setting OS X file attributes./li liuse the Unix style period at the start of a file name code.fileToHide/code, of course this will hide the file from the Finder and the command line. /li licreate a code.hidden/code at the file system root and list the filenames of files to hide from the Finder. This was the way to do it in the first several versions of Mac OS X prior to the chflags method. /li liThere is also a classic Mac OS 9 file attribute that can hide files, but this should be considered highly depreciated/li /ul  Note that the various hiding methods and .noindex should all work on Folders too.   <comment175350> Awesome! I just switched to Zsh and did chflags hidden **/*.bak.noindex; chflags hidden **/*.new. Cleans up my spaces so much. I can now work normally creating bak files. They will just be hidden. I can unhide them when I need them. Thank you!
