How to add apps or files to the Finder toolbar in 10.9 Mavericks? <body> In previous versions of OS X, I could drag an application or any file onto the Finder toolbar, creating a persistent shortcut that works in all Finder windows.  It's no longer working in Mavericks. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ubSMw.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer106223> I was looking for the same thing. The closest solution I could find was to add the app to the sidebar. Select your app and hit kbdCmd/kbd+kbdCtrl/kbd+kbdT/kbd.  <answer106287> kbdcmd/kbd + drag does the job! This got me trying for a while.  <answer139003> In OS X 10.9, Mavericks, you have to hold the kbdOption/kbd and kbdCommand/kbd keys to add it.  <answer182585> The reverse of this operation is holding command, then dragging the folder back out. The problem of having unwanted folder or files linked and residing on the toolbar confounded me for a long time. It had had the effect of making the Spotlight window INVISIBLE when in Finder.   <comment140805> So obvious! Thanks!!
