Monitoring network usage of individual applications? <body> I want to monitor each application's network/internet usage on my Mac.  Sort of like how Activity Indicator shows total upload/download usage -- but I also want to know particular application usages.  Is this possible?  <answer17022> The app Little Snitch can do this. Among many other things, it shows traffic by app.  It costs $29, but there is a free trial available.  <answer17041> Another app I've used is RubbertNet.  Also not free, but has a free trial available.  <answer47762> You could look at WireShark.  It may have a daunting interface, but once you learn it, you can track traffic by port.  You can also check out the built-in terminal utilities NetStat, TCPDump and PCap.  Using codenetstat -t -u/code will display the send and receive queue by process name.  <answer47781> If you are using iOS 5+ you can use the remote virtual interface   precode$ # First get the current list of interfaces.  $ ifconfig -l  lo0 gif0 stf0 en0 en1 p2p0 fw0 ppp0 utun0  $ # Then run the tool with the UDID of the device.  $ rvictl -s 74bd53c647548234ddcef0ee3abee616005051ed    Starting device 74bd53c647548234ddcef0ee3abee616005051ed [SUCCEEDED]    $ # Get the list of interfaces again, and you can see the new virtual  $ # network interface, rvi0, added by the previous command.  $ ifconfig -l  lo0 gif0 stf0 en0 en1 p2p0 fw0 ppp0 utun0 rvi0 /code/pre  You should be able to use wireshark or tcpdump, or ngrep on the problem, via the mac.  EDIT: ipfw is deprecated, but you can just turn on logging and see which packets go where. I don't know how to do that with pf :(  EDIT: I don't know why I thought this was for iOS. Apologies  <answer47854> A combination of  h1strongHandsOff!/strong and strongSurplusMeter/strong/h1  is my current solution. HandsOff is an advanced firewall which similar to LittleSnitch. It's not free, but a trial version is available. Surplusmeter on the other hand is free and open source.  Among the features which you need for monitoring network usage are:  ul limonitoring network activity of every process (HandsOff!)/li liget the network usage of individual processes (HandsOff!)/li lilog total network usage (SurplusMeter)/li /ul  HandOff does only display the network usage since boot. It does not log the data which is why I need SurplusMeter. However, SurplusMeter only logs the total network usage for all applications.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HKv5W.png" alt="enter image description here" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pNZyT.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment54025> @koiyu What do you need that the existing answers don't provide? <comment54946> @KyleCronin It's not that the existing answers wouldn't work – I was merely interested if there were more alternatives. <comment54947> Truly interesting—but won't help me monitor the network usage of an OS X app on OS X. <comment246298> Sadly SurplusMeter has been discontinued :(
