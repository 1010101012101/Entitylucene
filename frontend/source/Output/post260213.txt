How to determine whether a browser on my Mac (or one of its extensions) is spying on me? <body> Is there an easy way how I can check whether or not a browser (or one of its extensions) collects and sends the URLs to a third party?  I am using mostly Safari, sometimes Firefox, rarely Google Chrome, all on Mac OSX 10.11.  I am looking for a tool that would show me all URLs that any of the browsers sends to a third party (if any), i.e., that goes to some other server besides the original IP address of the URL.  I am fine with a command line tool, so long as it is simple to use.  h1Background/h1  I have just seen this report on TV about browser plugins that collect basically all URLs (German only, sorry): Nackt im Netz: Auch intime Details von Bundespolitikern im Handel.  It basically shows how many data are collected, how much you can deduce from the complete history of URLs, and that there is a huge business selling and exploiting that data. (They call it "spying on you".)  To some extent you can read about all this on this web page (in English): Warning: Your Browser Extensions Are Spying On You  Thanks a lot in advance for any hints and tips.
