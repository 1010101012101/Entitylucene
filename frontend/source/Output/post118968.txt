How to change device name in Profile Manager <body> I run Maverick 10.9 Mac mini server. After enroll some new devices into Profile Manager I need to change their name. I can't find any field that could change the device name. Thanks  <answer119015> You can't use Profile Manager to change the name of a device, the device name is one of the keys.  <comment138862> Hi Tony, Is there a way to change it from the server? Thank you
