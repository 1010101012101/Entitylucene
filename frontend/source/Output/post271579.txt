Kill all terminals so they don't reappear <body> If I open up terminal with code⌘Space terminal/code and hit code⌘n/code a bunch of times, I get many terminals.  I can get rid of all of them using codekillall Terminal/code, which sends the signal codeTERM/code by default.  However, when I open the terminal application again, all of the previous sessions are restored instead of creating a fresh session.  Is there a signal I can use to kill terminal applications in such a way that they aren't restored when I launch the terminal application again the same way that code⌘Q/code works?  <answer271625> I'm no Terminal guru, however it appears to respond in the same way as any other app.    If you quit it, then at next launch it will restore all previously open windows.br This is a global pref, set from System Prefs  General  Close windows when quitting an app.  If you don't want to change this pref globally, then the simplest solution would be to close the windows manually before Quit.  kbd Cmd ⌘ /kbd kbd Opt ⌥ /kbd kbd W /kbd is the system-wide shortcut to do that.  As far as I'm aware, codekillall Terminal/code is the same as kbd Cmd ⌘ /kbd kbd Q  /kbd in that respect, i.e. a 'polite' quit command.
