Sshfs or its substitute in Apple products? <body> I instructs my Apple friend to get Sshfs, i.e. to mount an outside target, to home -directory but he cannot find sshfs for Mac. Dose there exist some substitute or some Apple-compiled version for Sshfs? If it exists, how can my friend install it?  <answer64485> You can get sshfs with MacPorts. Just download macports and run  precodesudo port install sshfs /code/pre  in a terminal window.  <answer73187> Harald suggested a package-installer but some alerts: package-installers such as MacPorts and Homebrew have problems such as old packages and broken packages. For example, the Homebrew's Sshfs is broken at the time of writing. Package-installers contain MacPorts and Homebrew here. You may be interested in this thread here. It is better to find the newest installation so you won't face odd errors. For example, the Sshfs -development files are here and the packages here.  <answer129336> ABSOLUTELY!!! You don't need MacPorts, or Homebrew, or Cocoa.  MacFuse + MacFusion will do it.   If you want to mount an OS X drive through SSHFS from another computer on the network, you only need to enable Remote Login on OS X.  <comment75748> Do you know whether some GUI alternative exists for Sshfs? I am not sure whether my friend is able to use sshfs, perhaps liking some ready GUI tool also. Anyway +1 -- if I can remember right, you need to install the Xtool or Xkey -something from developer -CD to get MacPorts running, right? Any idea whether it is possible to get MacPorts without the CD? <comment75765> Sorry, I don't know a GUI for sshfs. Typically, you need XCode for macports â€“ but you can get that from the App store. Still, it is not really easy for the computer semiliterate. <comment75769> ...perhaps some of them [here](http://howto.blbosti.com/2010/09/mount-a-remote-ssh-folder-in-ubuntu-cmd-and-gui/), some GUI -software a bit like Sshfs. <comment80911> There should be a GUI here https://code.google.com/p/macfuse/wiki/MACFUSE_FS_SSHFS
