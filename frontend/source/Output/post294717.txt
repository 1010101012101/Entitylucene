Sierra: New mac after Time Machine restore, wrong user <body> Using Internet Recovery, I installed Sierra onto a new 2017 Macbook Pro. Durring the install, when prompted, I chose to restore from a Time Machine backup of my older 2013 MBP.  I've done this in the past for several macs without a problem.  This time, in addition to restoring my user and home folder, I also got a user for our company's IT department named "macdesktop".   During the install of Sierra, I saw a dialog that said "this mac can be configured..." with my company name.  I assume they are using some internet-based or recovery-partition-based configuration.  After the restore, I rebooted and logged in with my user name and password from the old Mac.  I got my desktop, dock, and other settings like I expected.  My name is also on the menubar.  strongHowever/strong, the "current user" in System Preferences/Users in not me but "macdesktop".  I am on the list as an admin user, but not the "current user".  Worse still, in the terminal prompt it shows the user also as "macdesktop" instead of me.  Typing codewhoami/code shows indeed "macdesktop".  How did this happen, and how can I remedy this?
