How to connect a System with a static ip outside of Airport extreme range <body> we have a network routed by an Airport Extreme Station. The ip range is 172.16.x.x  We need to connect an industrial machine to this network in order to exchange UPD-Packets. This machine unfortunatly has a static ip-address in the 172.31.x.x range.  Since the airport station is limited to 172.16.x.x, 10.0.x.x or 192.168.x.x it does not seem possible to connect the machine directly.  Or is there? Do we need a separate router maybe?  Thanks a lot.  <comment212894> This isn't an Airport Extreme question.  The correct thing to do is is figure out how to change the IP of the "industrial machine", whatever that is. <comment212969> its a robot ... ;) <comment213093> Whether it's a robot or a weather station is not significant.  The fact is the "static IP" is what should change.  Static means that it's assigned in advance and not a dynamically assigned by the network as the device joins the network.  Static does not mean _etched in stone._ <comment213111> Yes, Tyson i am aware of that. However the Robot is just there in the exhibition as an example and the company who "donated" it for the couple of days are in no interest to change ANYTHING on that system. They do not intend to mess with the IP or anything else - they are flexible as a stone here.  However, i have found a practical solution: The machine will be connected to one of the Macs by means of a separate USB-Ethernet dongle. The Mac connected to that dongle is setting up a second network and using pfctl to route everything needed to the machine. Works like a charm.
