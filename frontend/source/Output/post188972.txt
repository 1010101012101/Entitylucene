Lost entries on my iPhone 4 but not on my iPad <body> I noticed this morning that I have lost all my calendar entries on my iPhone but not my iPad. I can't enter anything new on my iPhone either but am still able to on the ipad. The only calendar entries now on the iPhone are the holidays permanently stored. My phone is synced as well.  <comment223818> The first thing you want to check is icloud.com to see if your calendars are there.  If not you will need to recover from a backup.. http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4859 This article is on backing up and restoring your device <comment224031> @vembutech Since they did not disappear from the iPad, that is likely not the issue. <comment224032> Ensure that you are still logged into your iCloud account under Settings  Mail, Contacts, Calendars.
