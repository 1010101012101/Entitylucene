App Previews for iPhone 6+, using an other iOS device <body> I'm trying to create an App Preview Video for a game we did. I recorded using QuickTime, plus iMovie to create it. I recorded the videos with iPhone 5, iPhone 6 and iPad.  But I don't have an iPhone 6 Plus to record on 1920x1080. So my question is, will users who are on an iPhone 6 Plus see the video or only the screenshots?  I read some similar topics, but the answers were contradicted.  <answer194765> You will need to create one specifically for iPhone 6Plus according to this: https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/LanguagesUtilities/Conceptual/iTunesConnect_Guide/Appendices/Properties.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40011225-CH26-SW10
