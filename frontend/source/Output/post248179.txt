Why does Preview cut off margins of PDF after annotating? <body> If I highlight text in a PDF, save it, close it, and reopen it, the newly opened version has a large part of the right margin cut off, and the highlight is displace (see image). This only occurs on some PDFs. Anyone know why this occurs or how to fix this?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/AIcCx.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <comment306446> Is it zoomed in (what happens when you press `command + 0`), or are you physically unable to scroll to the right? (Just trying to get a sense of what you mean when you say "cut off"). <comment307521> Cannot scroll to right. It is not zoomed. That portion of the PDF is cropped off and gone. <comment364072> Yes, I have the same problem, although it happens for only some pdf files.
