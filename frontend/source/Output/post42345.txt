Where can I download Filemerge - the app for comparing two tools and merging them? <body> I would like to install Filemerge, but can't find where to go to download it. Where can I download it?  <answer42346> FileMerge is part of strongXcode 4.x by Apple/strong which you can download from the Mac App Store.  The following is taken from the description:     Xcode is now distributed as an application, rather than as an installer. This change enables Xcode to be updated directly from the Mac App Store.      ul   liIncludes SDKs for Mac OS X 10.7 Lion and iOS 5/li   liNew code signing workflow supports signing OS X apps with Developer ID/li   liAdds installation of command-line tools to the Downloads preference pane/li   liOpen Developer Tool menu launches Instruments, strongFileMerge/strong, and other tools/li   liARC migration tool converts both retain/release and garbage collected code/li   liAdditional bug fixes and stability improvements/li   /ul   But FileMerge.app is now embedded inside the Xcode.app package and is not easily accessible as a standalone tool... Unless you do this:  ol liBrowse to /Applications/Xcode.app/li liRight-click - Show package contents/li liContents - Applications/li liRight-click FileMerge.app - Make Alias - Enter password/li liCopy the Alias to somewhere, like /Applications/li liDelete the original Alias/li /ol  Now you can use as a standalone tool, as before!  <answer42371> Alternatively, if you don't need the entire Xcode distribution, DiffMerge is also very similar and free.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/XBi0k.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer266891> I made a one-liner to install FileMerge and the other developer tools from Xcode 3.2.6 without installing Xcode itself. Tested on 10.12 and FileMerge still works (although some of the other apps don't). It is easily uninstallable too, just delete code/Developer/code or code~/Developer/code.  The total install size is 0.3GB, rather than 10GB+ of Xcode.  https://github.com/szhu/install-standalone-xcode-tools  <answer286432> Install XCode and start FileMerge by using the command line tool codeopendiff/code.  Example:  precodeopendiff file1.txt file2.txt /code/pre  See also the man page for opendiff.  <comment202707> Just wanted to note that DiffMerge is free as in beer, but is not free software. Downloading it requires entering an email address, and distributing it "outside your organization" yourself is prohibited.
