TextEdit keeps crashing <body> I am using TextEdit to edit some tcl files. periodically, or even frequently, but not always, when I go to save the file, I get a spinning beach ball. I tried launching text-edit via the command-line, but i was not imparted with any additional error information.   So what might be making TextEdit crash? I have OSX 10.6.8 on an imac. I have all the updates my computer will allow.  <answer202961> To figure out why TextEdit is crashing, your best bet is to pull up Console and look for error messages from TextEdit.   That said, there are so many better text editors available on OS X.  Unless you have a really good reason for using TextEdit, I'd suggest trying any of these:  ul liSublime Text: http://www.sublimetext.com//li liAtom: http://atom.io//li liTextMate: https://macromates.com/download/li liBrackets: http://brackets.io//li liText Wrangler: http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler//li liBBEdit: http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit//li /ul  <comment244950> Yeah I started using Geany  http://www.geany.org/  and it hasn't crashed again yet! I'll lookinto that console
