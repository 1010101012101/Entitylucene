iPhone Contact Reverts to Old Data After Edit <body> I have several iDevices that I use: iPad, iPhone and an iPod, all of which sync contacts with iCloud.  I am experiencing the phenomenon where I update a contact on my iPhone and instead of syncing the new data to iCloud where the other devices can pick it up, the phone is pulling the old data down from iCloud and over-writing the updates I just made.  Any ideas what the problem could be?  <answer251028> Hmmm... In general when I run into syncing problems like this I'll log in on icloud.com with my Mac to see what's in the cloud (versus what my devices show).  For problematic devices it's recommended to remove the account (or just disable Contacts from iCloud in this case). When prompted, choose to delete the local data. After a few minutes enable it again and then be patient everything syncs.  <comment311954> Workaround: log into iCloud.com with a regular browser and try updating there.
