bash script to verify that brew cask is installed <body> I am writing a script to setup a mac development environment, however I am running into an issue on some peoples macs where cask does not install. Is there a way I can verify if cask has been installed in bash?  Ideally I am looking for something like:  precodeif caskIsInstalled then      # do stuff... fi /code/pre  <answer210726> I ended up asking this on stackoverflow, where I was able to come up with this.  precodeif ! brew info cask &amp;&gt;/dev/null; then   echo "Failed to install Cask (Homebrew Extension)"   exit 1 fi /code/pre  <comment254258> Does [this](http://stackoverflow.com/a/7522866) help? <comment254325> @ArthurHammer A bit, but it did not take me far enough.
