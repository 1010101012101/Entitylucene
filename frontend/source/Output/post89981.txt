Remapping keys in iterm2 <body> I'm trying to remap some of the default key combinations in iTerm2, and would like to understand what is going on when I bind keys to "Send Hex Codes".  A previous post helped me get started with remapping the ctrl-a and ctrl-e key combos to cmd-left and cmd-right, respectively, but I would like to remap other key combos as well. (Link to previous Stackoverflow post).  I have a vague understanding that there are hex codes involved, but I am at a point where I can't figure out where to go next to understand what's going on or what to do.  <answer89990> Those hex codes are just sequences of bytes. For example mapping a key combination to code0x66 0x6f 0x6f/code would make it insert codefoo/code. code0xc3 0xa4/code would insert ä if you use UTF-8. code0x1b 0x1b 0x5b 0x43/code means codeescape escape [ C/code.  Some sequences of bytes like ANSI escape sequences and even single bytes like ASCII control characters have special meanings in terminals.  To make ⌘← and ⌘→ go to the beginning and end of line, you can assign them to 0x01 (^A in caret notation) and 0x05 (^E in caret notation):  ul li⌘←: Send Hex Codes: 0x01/li li⌘→: Send Hex Codes: 0x05/li /ul  You can make ⌥⌦ delete a word forward by assigning it to code\ed/code:  ul li⌥⌦: Send ^[ d/li /ul  Changing ⌥← and ⌥→ to code\eb/code and code\ef/code in iTerm's preferences would also change them in programs that don't support readline or emacs-style keybindings. Another option is to add this to ~/.inputrc:  precode"\e\e[D": backward-word "\e\e[C": forward-word /code/pre  You can run coderead/code and press key combinations to see what characters they insert. For example ⌥← inserts code^[^[[D/code by default, where code^[/code is escape in caret notation.  See also http://code.google.com/p/iterm2/wiki/Keybindings.  <answer139055> Check out Karabiner.  Within this tool you can create key custom mappings that are specific to applications. It comes with some tools to help with that.  <answer207455> I'd suggest to install Key Codes ($0) by Many Tricks and find out the shortcuts for yourself.  For instance if you want to remap the default shortcut for (forward) deleting a charcter – which is Ctrl-D (code⌃D/code) – to be as simple as pressing the forward delete key (code⌦/code), you would…   ol liOpen the app and press codeCtrl-D/code  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/a7rqm.png" alt="Key Codes Example"/li liBack in iTerm 2, add the Unicode shortcut in iTerm  Preferences  Keys  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wr6zc.png" alt="iTerm Send Hex Codes"/li /ol  emNote: Don't copy and paste it, just type out the Unicode without spaces./em  <answer293158> The best way that I found was either with sending keycodes (as described by @pattulus or using vim key bindings.  strongNote on key codes:/strong Actually you cannot make it work by sending the unicode string as described above, you need to send both the modifier and the key to gether in case of kbdControl/kbd+kbdD/kbd you need to send this as code: code0x840101 0x4/code where code0x840101/code is the control key modifier and can be obtained through Key Code.  strongNote on sending as vim sequence/strong: As described in iTerm2 documentation, you can send a key code in vim-bindings format such as code\&lt;C-d&gt;/code for sending kbdControl/kbd+kbdD/kbd (note that code\/code is important).  I personally prefer vim key binding because it's more readable and later you will understand what you have done.  <comment105657> Has nothing to do with bash. Removed tag. <comment170252> Thanks. I run into this answer when looking up a solution for my question [here](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/144481/sending-controlalt-char-to-terminal-in-iterm2). How  can I look up the hex code for a specific key combination? (in my case I am interested in the combinations `Ctrl+Alt+char` with `char` being `i`, `j`, `k`, `l` and `u`)
