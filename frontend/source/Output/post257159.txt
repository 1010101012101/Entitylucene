iPhone screen randomly turns on <body> After installing iOS 10, I found that the screen on my iPhone 6s turned on at seemingly random times, and it slightly annoyed me. I now know that this feature does what it is supposed to (turn the screen on when the phone enters certain positions), but I want to disable it.  Is there a setting can I use to do so?  <answer257161> I believe you are referring to the new strongRaise to Wake/strong functionality.  It can be disabled by going into strongSettings/strong â†’ strongDisplay &amp; Brightness/strong. Toggle strongRaise to Wake/strong emOff/em.
