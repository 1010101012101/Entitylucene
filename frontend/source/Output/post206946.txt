How do you exclude applications from the 'open with' menu <body> I've got quite a list of installed application. The result is there are many applications bloating the 'open with' menu.  Is there a way to exclude applications from the 'open with' menu?  If it's possible to exclude applications from both certain file types and from all file types, that would be great.   <answer206982> No, they're included automatically by the OS, but if you want to reset the file, you can try this:  ol liOpen Terminal in /Applications/li liType the following command:  code/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Versions/A/Support/lsregister -kill -r -domain local -domain system -domain user/code/li liRelaunch Finder, click codecmd/code+codealt/code+codeesc/code and select Finder and click Relaunch/li liNow the "Open With..." menu is reseted!/li /ol  <comment348324> Thank you for asking this question.  I've got it even worse than you doâ€”I'm a developer, so I have archived versions of every major version of my app on my Mac (part of Xcode's archive functionality), and all of those archives show up in the list!  Worse, all versions accept the same files, so macOS doesn't seem to want to let me manually set it for the newest version; instead it tenaciously hangs on to an older, buggy version as the default!
