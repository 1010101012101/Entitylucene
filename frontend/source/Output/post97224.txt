Macbook Pro Retina and Dell u3011 video driver problem <body> i have a macbook pro retina with OS X 10.8.4 (12E55) , and i'm connecting it to a dell u3011 monitor using a mini-display to displayport cable , it was working great until today whenever i connect the cable my monitor goes to energy save mode , i thought this was a cable problem so i bought a new one and the problem still remains , i connected to the monitor using HDMI and its working fine , is it a video driver problem?  <answer115859> Incredibly late answer, but I had the same issue and what worked for me was to reset the NVRAM.   <comment114070> are you on battery power ? <comment114071> no , not on battery power <comment114219> sorry for been late :) so how did you tell your MBP what to do when you plug in external monitor, so it does not run off the build in one ! <comment114225> it works out of the box when i connect the cable , no need for configurations <comment114233> Well,, check your energy save settings n the system preferences anyway.
