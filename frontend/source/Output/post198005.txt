MacBook Pro took a small tumble has minor scuffs on the right side <body> My MacBook Pro took a small tumble off of my recliner last night and scuffed the right side from the brick of the fireplace. I just took my case off last week because the case was looking pretty bad and of course, as soon as I take it off it falls for the first time. My Macbook has been kept PERFECT and this little scuff really REALLY bothers me. I know its silly, but I'm a perfectionist and can't get over it! Any experience with repairs on this? I'm not expecting it to be fixed for free, but wondering about a price range etc...img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gHc9G.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer198033> Nothing you can do without replacing the entire aluminum case, which probably isn't worth the trouble.   ul liSince it's cosmetic damage, Apple's warranty won't cover it./li liMaybe if you found a really skilled machinist, they could make it look better. But it would probably mess up the labels on the ports, so not worth it./li /ul  <answer198039> Keyboard, Trackpad, Battery and Topcase is one module, so is the display. So probably driple-digit, close to four-digit. Selling yours and buying a new one would probably even be cheaper.
