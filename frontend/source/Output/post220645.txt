Writing to NTFS volumes <body> I have been trying to copy some large media files to my external hard drive which is formatted to NTFS. It looks like we cannot write to NTFS volumes in OS X. I have tried the solutions provided in this question, but they all seem very old.   Are there any new apps to mount codeNTFS/code volumes to read and write mode in EL Capitan?   <comment267071> The accepted answer on the linked question has been updated as of May 2015, so I suggest that you try the solutions recommended there first. If they don't provide a specific feature you need or if you run into problems installing/using them please ask a specific question about that. <comment267077> Ok, I follow all the steps in http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/20889/how-do-i-write-to-ntfs-drives-in-os-x/213575#213575 but I still cant write to the volume <comment267079> If the documentation of the used tools doesn't help, please ask a new question explaining the steps you did and were you are stuck. Include a link to the answer you are referring to for reference.
