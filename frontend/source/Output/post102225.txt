How can I share the internet connection between an android phone and a macbook? <body> I try to create a portable Wi-Fi hotspot with my android Sony Xperia P (android 4.2.3) as it works with Windows flawlessly. With the macbook, I connect with the newly created Wi-Fi hotspot. The mac seems to connect (it gets an IP from the phone), but I can't navigate. Nothing happens. It is stuck.  Any idea?  The mac is a Macbook pro retina 13, with updated Mountain Lion.  <comment120399> can you ping a website from the terminal ? <comment120539> Nope. I get a timeout after a while <comment200977> Are you using an password for WiFi ?
