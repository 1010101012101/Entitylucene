Yosemite: Safari's window is too wide <body> I'm a web developer and like to develop with a narrow browser window to somehow emulate how my website will look on a mobile phone. With pre-Yosemite-Safari it was possible to create such a narrow window that you could easily judge the look of your site on mobile. With Yosemite, this seems to be impossible. Any suggestions?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gO1gG.png" alt="Picture from an iPhone."  Picture from an iPhone. I'd like to replicate this on the desktop. Note the line break after "Analytical"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/PjPjW.png" alt="Situation on the desktop after upgrading to Yosemite"  Situation on the desktop after upgrading to Yosemite  <answer152067> You can enable "Develop" menu in Preferences  Advanced.  Then you can select choose the User Agent to be iPhone or whatever. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ynl8S.png" alt="enter image description here"  And then resize the window appropriately:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5Dxxa.png" alt="enter image description here"  strongEdit/strong: This doesn't get around the minimum width for the window. Here is a workaround. Go to View  Show Sidebar. This pulls out the sidebar, which can be resized making the viewport smaller.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8cxQj.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment178979> Maybe I put it wrong, but following your advice doesn't let me make the window narrower than without changing the user agent. Before Yosemite, I could make Safari almost half as narrow as now which came very close to the width of a Safari on an iPhone 5.  On my iPhone, when I visit Wikipedia, the width only allows for a little bit more than "Today's featured article" to be displayed and the first line of today's article features only the two words "The Analytical" before the line break. <comment178981> I see what you're saying. See my edit at the bottom. <comment178982> You could install Xcode and use the iOS simulator that's built-in to run Safari. <comment178988> This workaround should do for now. I also submitted my issue to Apple in the hopes that they will change this behaviour back. <comment178991> Doing it this way is a workaround anyways. To get more accurate rendering, you should run the iOS simulator and launch Safari from there or just test on your phone.
