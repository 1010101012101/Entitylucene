How can you switch users at the login screen, without administrator access, with only one local account (the administrator) and many network accounts? <body> Sometimes, a network account is logged in, and the user doesn't/forgets to log out. When someone else uses this computer, the lock screen shows. The only options that I know of from here are:  ul liClick cancel, which does strongnot/strong switch the user/li liForce shutdown the Mac by holding down the power button/li liFind their password, login, and logout/li /ul  If I had an administrator, I could (probably) add another dummy local user account, and it would show a user account switcher, but I don't have admin access.  How can I switch the network account without admin access other than the above methods?  <answer236545> As long as it is ok to forcibly log-out the user, you just need to to logon as the local admin using codeApple Remote Desktop/code (available in the App Store) or ssh (through a terminal), and kill that user's codeloginwindow/code process.  You must login to the computer and not simply "Share screen" from emFinder./em  Then you will be able to login.    Here's a really easy-to-read article about this.  Of course, for either of those options to work, you have to enable strongRemote Login/strong and strongRemote Management/strong in "Sharing" under the System Preferences.  The Sharing menu is shown below:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Fd06I.png" alt="sharing menu in osx"  If you would rather use emfast-user-switching/em, which I personally don't like because it can often really slow down your computer, then you can set up an "logout user after x minutes of activity" option in the System Preferences - Security &amp; Privacy, which will return you to a login screen.  There may also be nice hacks if you search around, that allow you to get the user-switching icon or a keyboard shortcut setup to do a fast-switch, or trigger a switch or logout by tweaking a call to CGSession, although that may have been possible only in older OSX versions.  There is a huge discussion of many other ideas in that last link as well.
