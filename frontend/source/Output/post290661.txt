Iphone 7 Blocking numbers mysteriously <body> I’m having an issue with my iPhone 7 and I believe it’s been compromised. One of the phone numbers in my phone was mysteriously blocked and one happens to be the one phone number that shouldn’t be blocked under any circumstances. I only realized the number was blocked when the person informed me that she wasn’t able to get through to me. I’ve had the phone with me the entire time. Does any one know how that phone number could have become blocked?  <answer292679> There are few things to check before you can make sure numbers are automatically blocking on your device.   ul liGo to strongSettings   Phone  Call Blocking and Identification/strong and check if you find the same number which you think is blocked?/li liAlso at the top you'll see apps that have access to call blocking. See if there is any app that is automatically blocking numbers?/li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/87K4E.png" alt="enter image description here"  If your answer is NO to both questions then you should check with your phone carrier and see if there is any problem in your phone network.   <comment366919> Ist that number being blocked repeatedly and reproducibly, or just once or occasionally?
