MacBook Pro still has a distinctive smell — what is it? <body> I have a MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Late 2013), and when I open it up, I still notice a certain smell, which I associate with the aluminum somehow. I wouldn't describe it as the same as the new Mac smell which gets so much press. What could be the source of the smell? Aluminum in itself does not have an odour.  <comment294862> Do you use the MacBook in a special environment (e.g. extreme temperatures) <comment294864> Nope, nothing unusual in the environment. Mix of work and home, basic business environment. <comment294877> Well I can't go over there and smell your computer, but my own computer can produce a smell that reminds me of burning plastic if the processor is doing too much for too long and getting too hot (it can near 200F). Other times I can still smell something that I notise a lot if I put my nose above a warm computer screen or iMac. Just something from the internals, maybe glue I don't know, getting warm. Does yours have the same smell when it's off?
