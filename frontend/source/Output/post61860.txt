What port is this *picture* (mid 2007 13 inch macbook)? <body> I've been trying to hookup this MacBook I have to an external monitor, but I don't know which adapter to buy. I bought a VGA adapter on eBay, but the connector is really thin. Can someone direct me to what port this is, and bonus points if you can find me an ebay listing.  I've looked up the model on Apple but they don't give me specifics on the item. It's a mid-2007 13" MacBook.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/St1wt.jpg" alt="mid 2007 13 inch macbook left side ports"  <answer61862> This pictured connector on your mid 2007 13 inch MacBook is a strongmini DVI connector/strong according to http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3235  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/09KdI.jpg" alt="Mini DVI port illustration"img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Mysbj.jpg" alt="Apple M9320G photo"  The Apple part number for the strongApple Mini-DVI to VGA Adapter/strong is: strongM9320G/strong.
