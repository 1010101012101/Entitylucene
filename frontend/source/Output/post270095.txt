How can we downgradar Iphone 4s from 9.3 to 7.X <body> Can you please help me on downgrading Iphone4s from 9.3 version to 7.x.  I tried many ways and i found it didn't work. Also i lost my Power button after upgrading to 9.3 version. So, this is kind of challenge for me to downgrade. Please help.  Right now while i am doing downgrade i am seeing an error saying that "tatsu declined to authorize this image on this device for this user".  Thanks, Nagendra.  <comment339370> Welcome to the community Nagendra. Unfortunately there is no way to do what you want. I've voted to close your question because a number of other _duplicate_ questions exist. For example: http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/207879/168832 Hopefully the community will be able to help you in future if/when you have another question relating to an Apple device. <comment339374> @Monomeeth - I've flagged to the canonical dupe - & also the one you mentioned; best to have them all leading to the same place, as we find them.
