No more multi-language detection autocorrect in mac os x 10.7.5? <body> I've updated to Mac OS X 10.7.5 and now the autocorrect no longer works as beautifully as it used to. Prior to update, whether I was in mail, safari, wherever, it detected the language &amp; suggested the appropriate correction…now it is only detecting one language (the first on my list in settings) and doesn't detect when I'm using the second language on my list in system preferences.  Can I revert back to the previous software versions b/c this is really frustrating?!?!  …or does anyone know how to fix this??  <answer136485> You should find the setting in your System Preferences.  Select Automatic by language or your choice.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/BXmHo.jpg" alt="spelling"  <answer136488> In System Prefs/Language &amp; Text/Text/Spelling, go to the Setup item on the list and make sure that only the languages you are interested in have their boxes checked.  You need to also check that Edit  Spelling and Grammar  Show Spelling and Grammar is also set correctly in the app you are using.  That is the best you can do.  I've rarely heard of anyone who thought Apple's multilingual spellcheck was very satisfactory.  But it should detect both languages, unless one of them is a 3rd party add-on dictionary, in which case there is no guarantee.  If by chance you are talking about the Pages app or Word, let us know, because the above is not relevant for that.  <comment161892> have you looked in the sys - pref- keyboard- Text ? <comment161900> Under keyboard there is keyboard & text but that has to do w/shortcuts… <comment161911> thank you…I've checked this in mail and it's once again working as before. In safari, however, it's not working. For example prior to the update if I'd type a post on my Facebook Business page in Dutch, it would recognize and suggest spelling correction where necessary…now it only recognizes English…I was actually most always quite happy with the spell 'check' prior to the update…it was mostly correct!
