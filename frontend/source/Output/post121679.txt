Browse and Select unsupported files <body> A website is asking me to upload pdf documents but once I browse to upload all the files (pdf format) they are greyed out and not selectable.  I have tried Chrome, Safari, Firefox but there is no change in the behaviour.  It's not only one pdf, in which case I would think the file is corrupted or something.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/flSgp.png" alt="details"  <answer121686> At least a fix for this in Chrome will be dragging and dropping the file to the fileupload control on the page.  strongDrag/strong the file to "Choose file - no file selected" and strongdrop/strong it there, it will be ready for upload.  <comment141849> a quick request, what is the web site you are using? <comment141850> Its RWTH University online application <comment141853> Its first time I am facing this after 6-7 years working with OS X.
