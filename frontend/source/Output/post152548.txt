Download app from iPad to iPod touch with different Apple ID <body> How do I download a purchased app on iPad to an iPod touch with a different Apple ID? My daughter purchased an app and put it on her iPad, and I want to put it on an iPod touch that I gave my grandson with my Apple ID.  It won't let us do that.  <answer152551> Correct, it won't let you do that.  You'd need to re-purchase it on the other ID, or investigate Family Sharing - one credit card, multiple family members, multiple account IDs, shared apps &amp; content, with Parental Control.
