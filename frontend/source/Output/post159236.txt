Compatibility of my Korg keyboard to my new Yosemite Mac + Logic X + software issue <body> You can imagine the excitement, as a student,  when someone brought me a new iMac  21.5 desktop running Yosemite two weeks ago.   I connected my Korg M50 with my Yamaha USB-MIDI interface cable and opened my new download of LogicXx and have not been able to get any connection since the day it came out of its box!!! None of my software from my 2010 Mac is compatible and the only thing that has work is Sibelius 7. I have tried so many things and the keyboard will not show up in the Audio-Midi. All my software is 'unsupported'  As my previous computer graphics card crashed, I had backed it up but can not get anything from that either. Any suggestions, apart from burning it!  <comment187172> Does the USB/MIDI box flash the activity lights when the keyboard's connected & powered up? Active sensing should make it constantly flicker. That would tell you the MIDI is working, after that you'd need to look at the USB. USB/MIDI interfaces have been standard system-supported since USB was invented, no drivers, so it shouldn't be that. Check cables & try replacing with known-good. Don't run USB/MIDI hubs through another USB hub, run them direct.
