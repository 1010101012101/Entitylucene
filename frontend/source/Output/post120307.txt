Automatically reduce MacBook brightness on connecting to external display? <body> I would like my macbook to reduce its screen brightness to zero when I connect it to an external display. I know there's no such setting, but how would I go about writing a script that would do that?  The reason for brightness reduction is that I don't use macbook's screen when I connect an external display and I often forget to reduce brightness on it. Would be great if it reduced the brightness itself.  <comment140335> Simply close the lid and you're done? No screen with light, no script. Just easy! <comment140358> Yea clamshell mode FTW! <comment140472> @Robuust would've worked, but I need to use the trackpad.
