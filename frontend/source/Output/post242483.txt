Cam going on and off with hangouts <body> have a MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2015).  When I connect to a meeting on hangouts, the cam keeps going on and off (the green light goes and off as well).  I'm saying hangouts because that's the tool I use for doing such things. Do you know if there is a way to fix the problem?  (for now I'm not considering it to be an hardware problem)  strongUPDATE/strong: this problem started after helpdesk changed my user domain. As a proof I switched to a local user and everything is working fine  <comment298288> Likely an upstream bandwidth issue.  I assume you mean Google Hangouts? <comment298431> Does something local like Photo Booth have this problem as well? <comment298473> @JMY1000 I've added an update <comment305496> I'm having the same thing. Not in a domain.
