Does Mavericks support OpenCL? <body> I installed the new OS X Mavericks and new Xcode on the "mid 2011" Macbook air.  I run the code from this question, trying to test if the GPU supports OpenCL. But It seems to behave the same it behaved on Mountain Lion. It seems Mavericks doesn't support OpenCL yet.  <answer106233> Mavericks supports OpenCL but your GPU is not compatible (there are no OpenCL drivers for it).  Try running the example with codeCL_DEVICE_TYPE_CPU/code, Simply set the variable codegpu/code to 0;  precodeint gpu = 0; /code/pre  This paper says OpenCL Support on Sandy Bridge is limited:      3rd Generation Intel® Core™ Processors with the Intel® HD Graphics 4000/2500   Your Macbook Air is equipped with HD Graphics 3000.  <comment124799> Seriously? my intel gpu doesn't support opencl? <comment124801> @0x90 Unfortunately it seems to be the case. There is some confusion about this issue. If I were you I'd look into the matter in more details before giving up.
