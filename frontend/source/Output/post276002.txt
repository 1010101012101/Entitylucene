Preventing timed access settings from propagating between AirPort base stations <body> I would like to set up two AP base stations on my network with different timed access settings. I want to be able to modify the settings for my kids' devices without taking everything else down on the network when the base station restarts.  The AirPort base stations have a feature in which, when a base station is restarted, its settings get propagated to the other base stations on the network. I'd like to prevent this.  Is there a way to have multiple base stations on the same network, with unique timed access settings for each?   More info: I have an AirPort Extreme set to bridge mode providing the bulk of access for the house. I would like to add an AirPort Express to the same network, with access for the kids. I don't want them on a separate network, because I want them to be able to print and use AirPlay to devices connected via the AP Extreme.  Thanks for any help.  MM
