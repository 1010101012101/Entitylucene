Macbook sees Japanese keyboard instead of native US English <body> Mavericks on Macbook Pro Retina A1398 (US keyboard with horizontal Enter) shows Japanese keyboard (JIS, with vertical Enter) on enabled keyboard viewer. How do I make Mavericks to recognize and to show its native US Keyboard layout? I have tried to reset SMC and PRAM with no success.br p.s. I have tried changing input sources to U.S. as well - does not change the orientation of return on bluish keyboard on the right - mac OS still thinks I have JIS...  <answer173943> Go to System Preferences  Keyboard  Input Sources tab and click the "+" key to add the US Keyboard:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MwTzK.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer173952> It sounds like your machine is not recognizing the "keyboard type" correctly, thinking you have a JIS (or ISO) type instead of ANSI.   See this article for some suggestions on fixing it:  http://m10lmac.blogspot.com/2009/12/fixing-keyboard-type-problems.html  <comment204720> Thank you, Icon. That does not change the orientation of the Return key. I do actually use U.S. input source already. Even then the keyboard viewer shows layout vertical enter as it probably thinks that I might have actual Japanese keyboard, which is nonsense. I am trying to understand how to change the way OSX thinks about my actual keyboard.... <comment204740> Does keyboard viewer show the topmost leftmost character key to be a 1?  If not, what? <comment204850> Thank you, Tom! You've got it. Unfortunately Mavericks do not have spatial file suggested in the article no more and I've tried reseting PRAM and SMC already with no effect. I think it is something to do with internal keyboard marking since mac stubbornly sees JIS instead of ANSI... <comment204852> It shows 1 in the top left corner... <comment204855> Did you try the  Terminal Command? <comment204857> Yes, Tom! OS recognizes my ANSI as JIS. So it finds no issues. *2015-02-22 20:57:25.351 KeyboardSetupAssistant[659:507] No unknown keyboard connected - terminating logout * <comment204858> I am afraid that I have to replace the topcase and that will take forever... <comment204859> Similar issue, but with external keyboard... http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=1582071 <comment204860> No solution, except replacing the thing...
