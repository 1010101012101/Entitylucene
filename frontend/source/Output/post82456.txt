How do I stop Apple from offering me iTunes 11 as a software download in OS X <body> I don't want to disable Apple software update, I just want to prevent myself from accidentally overwriting my iTunes 10 with a working Party Shuffle/iTunes DJ with the new iTunes 11. I have iTunes 11 at work, where it doesn't really matter what I've got installed because I can't play music during the day, and I've tried to come up with some combination of smart playlists that effectively duplicates iTunes DJ... but it doesn't work. The tools aren't there.  So, how do I do it, how do I selectively block updates for iTunes 11?  <answer82541> If you're using Lion or earlier, you can just block updates from Software Update. After Mountain Lion, I don't think you can...  Keep a backup of your iTunes by copying the .app to somewhere safe - that way, you can easily restore to the backup. (Also consider backing up your Music Library and ~/Library/iTunes)   <answer83847> The methods differ based on whether you are using OS X Mountain Lion, or an earlier edition.  strongFor OS X Mountain Lion/strong (where updates are now merged with the Mac App Store):  ul liRefer to strongHT2357 How can you ignore a software update in Mountain Lion? &ndash; Apple Support Communities/strong.
