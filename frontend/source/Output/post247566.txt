Windows 10 runs extremely slowly in Parallels 10 <body> I'm running Parallels 10 on a 2014 MacBook Pro with OS X El Capitan (10.11.6). I have five virtual machines set up for various versions of Windows (7, 8, and 10).  For some reason, my Windows 10 VM runs extremely slowly – it boots, but then everything grinds to a halt (the Mac overall, not just the VM). Often, the only way out is to force shutdown and reboot.  The VM itself is a completely clean copy straight from Microsoft (indeed, I can never get it to run fast enough to actually do anything with it). My four other VMs all run perfectly fine, obviously on the same hardware, and I have all five configured identically.  I know that Parallels 11 advertises that it's ready for Windows 10, implying that previous versions aren't – but my Parallels 10 installation emdoes/em list Windows 10 as an option in the VM configuration. So it would seem it's supported.  Is there anything I can do to fix this, or is the solution just to upgrade to Parallels 11 (even though in theory my current setup should work)?  <answer247573> I've had a better experience with Parallels 11 than I did with 10 so you might be worth considering an upgrade to improve the experienced.   <comment305500> I'd go for Parallels 11 - Win 10 works just fine on my machine, compared to earlier Win OSes. I don't have a true comparison, though, as I went straight to 11 as soon as it was released.
