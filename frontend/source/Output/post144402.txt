What happened to Apple made server racks? <body> Simply the question is, what happened to the the Apple made server racks? It is very disappointing to see Apple doesn't support the back-end hardware since 2009. I know there is a Server Mini, and OSX server, but lets face it, we want a professional and fast hardware to backup OSX Server.   <answer144410> Simple answer:  Apple discontinued them in 2010.  According to other sources sales were poor, and Steve Jobs responded to their inquiry:     Hardly anyone was buying them.
