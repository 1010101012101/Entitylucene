ScanSnap S1500M Time-out <body> Not sure why, but after about 5 minutes of scanning, my ScanSnap just bails on me. I would use their documentation, etc. but nobody knows what this error code is so I wanted to seek the geniuses here and I think it likely that others must have had this problem.  When I’ve used this scanner with another computer it works fine.  I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling the software many times, but I’m not sure I’ve completely uninstalled the software because it still retains my custom profile, which I believe may be the source of the problem. Maybe that would be a great first step is to get a complete list of the files to uninstall, since there must be at least a portion of it which is manual.  img src="https://cl.ly/WJM4/Screen%20Shot%202014-06-29%20at%201.00.59%20PM.png" alt=""  precodeTime-out occurred during communication.

Sorry for the one liner, but I sometimes take pity on weak Googlers.  <answer136565> I have one of these scanners and have noticed it can be sensitive to how it's connected on the USB bus. If the problem continues, try connecting it directly to a USB port on your Mac instead of through a hub (if it's not already directly connected).  <comment161943> how is this a Apple products question! <comment161944> This question appears to be off-topic because it is about Fujitsu product. <comment161951> @Buscar웃 It is connected to a Mac and so the driver software and reported errors are on topic and as works elsewhere likely an issue with the OSX setup <comment161954> @Mark Please enlighten me where do you see that in the question, connected to what Mac, and how is the error a Mac problem? <comment161955> @Buscar웃 "When I’ve used this scanner with another computer it works fine." and the image is an OSX dialog box _ the answer suggesting is a driver issue <comment161956> Thanks for clarifying that all he needs is a updated Fujitsu driver. You solved another "Apple" problem :) <comment161961> Heck, a problem is a problem. I exist to solve problems. <comment161977> Is this "other computer" running OS X or another OS? <comment162018> From http://apple.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic: "third-party hardware, services and software when associated for use with Apple products", so this question is definitively on-topic.
