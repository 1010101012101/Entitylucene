How do I get Launchpad's incremental search to work again? <body> Launchpad's incremental search has stopped working for me. I've tried killing the Dock (Launchpad and window management is all part of the Dock) but Launchpad is still unresponsive to the keyboard. I have also found it won't let me rename anything either, though I can re-arrange the icons.  Logging out and back in doesn't fix it and restarting seems to alleviate it (but that is hardly a fix).  <comment106075> Have you also tried restarting? It worked for some people in https://discussions.apple.com/thread/4138001. Are there any relevant log messages in Console? <comment106076> @LauriRanta Restarting is not a solution according to the thread. <comment106077> They just said that restarting worked but the issue returned at some point. If that happens, there could be some log messages when it stops working. You could also try [rebuilding the Launch Services database](http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20071102084155353). <comment106162> @LauriRanta No log events to speak of.
