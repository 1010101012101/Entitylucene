Switch spaces with apple script <body> My goal is to switch spaces from within an apple script. My shortcut to switch to the 4th space is codectrl+4/code, but when I tried this in an apple script nothing happens:  precodetell application "System Events"     keystroke "4" using {control down} end tell /code/pre  What am I doing wrong?  <answer227503> I do not know why, but using key code instead works  precodetell application "System Events"     tell application "System Events" to key code 21 using control down end tell /code/pre  <comment277298> If this works for you, you can mark it as accepted by clicking the check mark. This shows the community that the problem has been solved. <comment277336> Possibly the reason this works is that the key code for 4 'above qwerty' is 21 but the 4 on the 10-key is 86 & the key commands for switching Spaces are sensitive to that. <comment277352> @Arc676 I will, in 2 days when the system will allow it. <comment277423> @Tetsujin That makes sense, thanks for your explanation!
