Move user folder (HDD) back to main drive (SSD) <body> Since large SSDs were quite expensive a while ago, I've strongmoved my User directory/strong to a 1 TB HDD back then. Now I'm going to upgrade to a 1 TB SSD and am thinking about the best and safest way to strongmove the user directory back/strong.  Here is what I came up with for now:  ol liUse delstrongSuperDuper/strong/del strongCarbon Copy Cloner/strong to make a bootable backup of my current system SSD and copy it to the new SSD. Update: SuperDuper doesn't copy the recovery partition and I see no reason why not to keep it, if it is present – CCC does copy it./li liUse strongDisk Utility/strong to enlarge the copy of the partition from 256 GB to 1 TB, Update: This step might be unnecessary since the drive will be partitioned with 1 TB /li liShutdown and strongswitch the drives/strong - new replaces old SSD/li liStart to strongSingle User Mode/strong by pressing kbd⌘/kbd+kbdS/kbd/li liUse strongrsync/strong to copy the User directory from the HDD to the new SSD/li /ol  Using:  codersync -arv --progress /Volumes/files/Users/MYUSER /Volumes/osx/Users/MYUSER --exclude /Volumes/osx/Users/MYUSER/Pictures /Volumes/osx/Users/MYUSER/VirtualBox\ VMs/code  Excluding Pictures and VMs since they should stay where they are for now.  ol start="6" liexit; and reboot/li liGo to codeSettings › User › MYUSER › Advanced/code and set the home folder to the location on the new SSD/li liFinal reboot/li /ol  hr  strongQuestions/strong  ul liDoes this procedure make sense?/li liI'm not sure about Step 2. is increasing the partition size necessary and the right way? Note: The old SSD has 256 gig while the new has 1 TB. Or do I have to partition it anyway before using Super Duper?/li liIs there a way to tell TimeMachine about the relocated User folder or will it delete everything and then write everything from scratch? Note: I've another 2 TB backup drive for Time Machine Backup present./li /ul  Would appreciate your feedback, thank you!  <comment291816> You may also have to correct permissions / chown the folders to the new account. <comment291916> @Hefewe1zen will keep that in mind, thanks.
