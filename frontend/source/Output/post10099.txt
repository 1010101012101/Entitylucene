What file comparison tool can I use under OS X? <body> My favorite file comparison tool was Beyond Compare but since I recently switched to OS X, i'm no longer able to use it and I'm looking for an alternative, preferably a free one.  Update: I made the mistake not to specify that I am also looking for a tool that does directory comparison, not only files. Because this could make the already answers invalid I made another question for this What directory comparison tools can I use on OS X?  <answer10100> FileMerge is bundled with XCode, but I prefer Kaleidoscope which is not free.  <answer10101> You can use codediff/code if you're using the command-line.  <answer10106> I use Kaleidoscope. Or just plain, old codediff/code from the CLI  <answer10175> There's also DeltaWalker.  It's $40, and there's a trial available.  <answer10176> Changes.app has a great reputation and lots of features. Kaleidoscope is great too, and has a beautifully designed UI.  It's also worth mentioning if you're doing programming that Xcode 4 has visual diff tools built in now too.  <answer10243> DiffMerge from Sourcegear is simple and free.  <answer10248> It is not great, but the FileMerge bundled with the OS can be launched from the command line as codeopendiff a.txt b.txt/code.  <answer36631> There are a great many comparison tools available. Many do directories and files. Some even perform as merge tools (2 and 3 way). Of these some have already been mentioned in other answers and your choice will depend on what features you require, and how much you are prepared to pay for the tool. There is a good Wikipedia page with a comparison of many of the better known ones.  <answer36734> I use Folder Sync It costs $8.99 on the Mac App Store. It works really nicely.  <answer87188> This is an aggregation of the answers posted on SO's deleted clone, Graphical diff for Mac OS X.

Ditto anthonyg's recommendation. <comment10799> It looks to be much better than the FileMerge from XCode, thanks. <comment105966> +1 for Changes.app Is the only one with a GUI which you can ignore both leading and trailing whitespaces.. <comment114405> For anyone using [MacPorts](http://macports.org/) `kdiff3`, `meld`, `tkdiff`, listed above, as well as [`xxdiff`](http://sourceforge.net/projects/xxdiff/) are all available through `port install`. <comment131774> To find FileMerge (assuming you have XCode) ...start up Xcode and choose 'Xcode' menu - Open Developer Tool - FileMerge. Or you can avoid starting up XCode by poking around in /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Applications/FileMerge.app <comment131840> Changes was acquired by BitBQ in October of 2012.  The latest link for changes is: http://bitbq.com/changes/ <comment131904> I tried meld via Macports and a huge number of dependencies were required. I have since shifted to using TextWrangler's diff. This does directory comparisons and you can merge changes line by line. It doesn't do three way compare though. <comment140719> FWIW meld is also available via brew. `brew install meld`. <comment149466> When Harry Wood says "poking around" he means typing in the terminal: open /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Applications/FileMerge.app <comment159770> @Roberto or via Finder - Go - Go to folder... (Cmd+Shift+G) <comment164944> this saves my day. Thanks @thilo <comment167181> Actually the way I tend to "poke around" is...  right click on 'Xcode.app' - 'Show Package Contents' <comment188139> P4Merge is free, very nice, can be used as both a diff and merge too, doesn't need to be downloaded with a perforce client anymore, and can even visually diff images! [Download here](http://www.perforce.com/product/components/perforce-visual-merge-and-diff-tools) <comment189799> @HarryWood @Roberto you can open filemerge from console without needing to poke around: `opendiff file1 file2` <comment230739> As a long time user of Beyond Compare (over 10 years), I could say that the only thing that I was missing from my old Windows period was BC. Now @orangebreeze will get a lots of votes as there is nothing so good as BC and I tried most tools. <comment235395> Came here to find out how to open filemerge (i always forget!), and noticed i'd already left a comment explaining how in the past **\*high fives past self\*** <comment243662> Thank you so much..  **TextWrangler** is realy easy to use. <comment265155> [StackExchange Software Recommendations](http://softwarerecs.stackexchange.com)
