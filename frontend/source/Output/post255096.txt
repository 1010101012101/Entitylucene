iOS 10.0.2 - Apple Configurator - Downloading software although it is up to date <body> I tried using apple configurator to prepare and supervise some iPads but it ended up crashing them and displaying the iTunes logo and an indication to plug it in. I managed to restore the iPads through iTunes and then manually update them to iOS 10.0.2 using wifi.  Unfortunately, now when I try to prepare the iPads using Apple Configurator as I would normally, it keeps trying to download and install iOS 10.0.2 although on the iPads it says it is on the latest software. This, in turn, then crashes the iPads again. When restoring the iPads on iTunes I chose set up as new iPad and then tried preparing which didn't work. I also chose restore from backup and then tried preparing which still didn't work.  How do I overcome this and get them to work as normal i.e. be able to prepare and then supervise them on configurator without them crashing?  Many thanks in advance  <comment317650> I have resolved the issue; you don't set the iPad up manually (i.e. sign into iCloud, set up wifi etc) until after you have prepared the device!
