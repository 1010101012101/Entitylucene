If you really need to, you could use Option 3 listed in the tutorial you linked to, the Apple Digital AV Adapter, combined with some sort of external video capture device for you Mac like the Elgato Game Capture HD Game Recorder.  <answer148291> At the moment it's not possible with a cable, but it will be possible in Yosemite by using your charging cable and QuickTime.
