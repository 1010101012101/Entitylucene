Weird trackpad & keyboard issue with MacBook Pro E2015 <body> I've had some issues with my trackpad and keyboard on my MacBook Pro 13 (Early 2015) for the past 3-4 weeks. After being awaken from sleep mode, they were sometimes unresponsive. At first, a couple of hard reboots made them work again, but lately no number of reboots fix it. However, they usually come back to life again by themselves after some time (12-24 hours).  At wake up, when the trackpad and keyboard stops working, I found this error message in the system's log:  precode5/9/16 22:44:49.000 kernel[0]: Error: AppleHSSPIController::doSPITransfer NAK received from device 5/9/16 22:44:49.000 kernel[0]: Error: Apple Internal Keyboard / Trackpad::IssueMessage Failed to issue message the bus error: 0xe00002eb 5/9/16 22:44:49.000 kernel[0]: Error: Apple Internal Keyboard / Trackpad::setPowerState AppleHSSPIDevice : Resume Device in Power On failed with error 0xe00002eb /code/pre  Some other findings:  ul liThe keys can sometimes wake the computer, but as soon as it wakes up they don't work./li liThey don't work at boot (i.e., cmd+R, cmd+V etc do not work)./li liI've reinstalled Mac OS (using net recovery, cmd+opt+R).

However, here's the weird part. strongWhen I boot up Ubuntu from an USB stick, the keyboard and trackpad work perfectly./strong Rebooting into Mac OS, they're still dead however. I have a hard time imagining that this is a hardware problem for that reason.  Any ideas what could be the problem, and how to solve it?  <comment305942> If someone stumble in here with the same problem: after a lot of back and forth, I handed in my MacBook to Apple. They replaced the trackpad cable and now it works perfectly. <comment347927> I'm having the same issue now on a Macbookpro12,1 (works in Ubuntu, doesn't work in Mac OS), but for quite a while, my macbook has required a PRAM reset (these days, even that requires an external keyboard. SMC reset works on the internal keyboard though) on every boot to be able to input anything at all without a ~40 second delay. Did you have that as well? <comment347939> @hyperair No, that doesn't sound familiar. It could happen that the keyboard had a slight delay just before it died. But other than that, if it worked, it worked perfectly. As I said, in the end, I sent it in for repair, and that fixed it. A couple of month later, the same problem popped up, and went for repair directly then. <comment348177> Wait, so the problem keeps reoccurring?
