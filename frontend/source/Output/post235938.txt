Phone playing tricks on me <body> Currently, I'm using an iPhone 5s with ATT service.   When I was up in the mountains for a concert, my phone was showing no service available, and all my calls were failing consistently.  However, I would frequently get notifications from the Google inbox app about new emails.  This also tends to happen when I turn off cellular data for the app (in my home area where there is perfect service) which sends me notifxations of new emails, but says no data when I launch it.  What's happening behind the scenes? Has anyone come across this?  <comment288653> The short answer is the towers signal reaches much farther than the phones.  No service is a condition when 2-way communication can not be achieved.  I.e the tower might be able to reach you fine with its signal, but the phones signal is not powerful enough to reach the tower. <comment288663> OK, then the weird notifications I'm getting, do they add on to my data use even though I turn off data for the app? <comment288731> Notifications use data, yes. Turning off cellular data for the app doesn't disable notifications for that app. To do that, you need to go into settings and turn off notifications for that app. There isn't a way to turn off cellular data for notifications, though. So it's either notifications always or never. <comment288732> http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/148102/iphone-4s-i-keep-receiving-notifications-over-3g-for-apps-that-ive-disabled-ce
