Yosemite keeps dropping WiFI connectivity <body> After upgrading to Yosemite, my Macbook Air drops off the WiFi connection many times a day. The following ping test demonstrates that restarting WiFi leads to a successful reconnection.  precode$ ping 8.8.8.8 PING 8.8.8.8 (8.8.8.8): 56 data bytes Request timeout for icmp_seq 0 Request timeout for icmp_seq 1 Request timeout for icmp_seq 2 Request timeout for icmp_seq 3 Request timeout for icmp_seq 4 Request timeout for icmp_seq 5 Request timeout for icmp_seq 6   (Turn Wifi Off, Turn Wifi On) Request timeout for icmp_seq 7 Request timeout for icmp_seq 8 Request timeout for icmp_seq 9 Request timeout for icmp_seq 10 Request timeout for icmp_seq 11 Request timeout for icmp_seq 12 Request timeout for icmp_seq 13 64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: icmp_seq=14 ttl=49 time=68.005 ms 64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: icmp_seq=15 ttl=49 time=203.014 ms 64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: icmp_seq=16 ttl=49 time=227.464 ms /code/pre  Why does Yosemite keep dropping Wifi? Mountain Lion was working great. My iPhone is connects to the same Wifi network without a problem.  <answer155820> I could be completely wrong with this, but I did have a time when an old 2010 Macbook would drop wifi and struggle to pick it up again.  My resolution was down to my router being both 2.4GHz and 5GHz with a "Smart Band" tech which would swap between bands for devices. Taking off this Smart Band feature and connecting to one specific band did resolve my issue. It may not be strongthe/strong answer, but could be worth a try :)  <answer155832> This isn't a solution, and it isn't a emdefinitive/em answer, but WiFi/Bluetooth issues have been reported by many users (including yours truly) of OS X Yosemite. Apple is reportedly working on a fix, which may or may not help all of these users.  <answer197693> I fixed this issue on my Early 2013 MBP on 10.10.4 by doing the following (lots of other stuff was tried first).  ul liDisable WiFi/li liOpen emFinder/em/li liPress codeCmd+Shft+G/code to go to the folder code/Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration//code/li liDelete (or move) the following files:  ul licodecom.apple.airport.preferences.plist/code/li licodeNetworkInterfaces.plist/code/li licodepreferences.plist/code/li /ul/li liRestart your computer/li liRe-enable WiFi/li /ul  <answer201016> thanks doublesharp.  I have three macs that are continually dropping the WiFi connection - all running Yosemite and one of them being a BRAND NEW 5 day old Macbook.  I deleted the files you recommended and the Wireless Diagnostics app (spotlight will find it) now runs without registering dropouts every few minutes.  If this continues to work for another hour I will do the same on both my other Macs.  I do have to say that Yosemite is absolutely the WORST Mac operating system I have ever experienced.  And I started with Jaguar!  Steve would say "it just doesn't work".  5 minutes later:  I opened Skype and the Macbook dropped the Wifi Connection...  <answer201039> Troubleshooting WiFi connectivity is one of the more frustrating issues I deal with personally/professionally.  For people looking for assistance (and the OP if the issue still persists), you will want to isolate things and gather data.  ol liUse Wireless Diagnostics to capture and analyze the wireless network - both before you have a problem, during the problem, and after the problem./li liGet a piece of paper to diligently write down the details in your WiFi icon when you option click it: (all the data can be relevant, but focus on BSSID, Tx Rate and Channel initially. Once you have 10 data points, you can narrow down what's happening between your Mac and your WiFi router.br img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/UQXyg.png" alt="enter image description here" /li liYou may need to capture WiFi logs and codesysdiagnose/code to collect the precise reason why WiFi dropped and when. You may need engineering help to analyze these logs./li /ol  In the case above, the ping is a poor tool to tell WiFi issues. Not only does WiFi have to work, the IP addresses need to be working, DNS needs to be working, the upstream link needs to be working, the routing (BGP/whatever) that your ISP has configured needs to be working. Basically, If you can't call a number across the country - rather than focusing on no answer, you can focus on if your Phone is connected to the wall jack.  If you can ping a device on your local network (the router number above 10.0.10.1) would be way better to see if WiFi is viable rather than pinging 8.8.8.8 which lies far outside your control of the local network.  If anyone wants to dig into their data, post a new question with the details above and @bmike me in the comments here. I often like to help dive into this sort of issue once the data has been collected or there's a chance to get to the data to know what's happening.  If you don't want to collect the data to nail down why your disconnects are happening (and how often it really happens), here are other things you can try:  ol liGet off 2.4 GHz - use 5 GHz as it's far less susceptible to interferance and channel overlap./li liIf you are on 2.4 - get a tool like WiFi Explorer to make sure you have a viable environment to have a reliable experience./li liIf you want to learn more and have limited time to piece things together from internet volunteers, this take control book by Glenn Fleishman is excellent./li /ol  <comment183321> Seems to be a common problem; see this google search, Limited to only Apple discussions site - https://www.google.co.uk/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=yosemite+dropping+wifi+connection&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&gfe_rd=cr&ei=FwpiVIm-BNCq8wejloKgAw#q=yosemite+dropping+wifi+connection+site:discussions.apple.com&safe=off&rls=en <comment242326> As written in [this answer](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/153009/bluetooth-and-wifi-interfering-with-one-another-since-yosemite) wifi 5Hz shouldn't interfere.
