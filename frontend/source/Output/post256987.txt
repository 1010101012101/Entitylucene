Creating an icon for a homebrew installed software (evince) - Mac OS X <body> I installed Evince, the famous PDF reader that comes pre-installed with several major GNU/Linux distributions, on Mac OS X using   precode brew install evince /code/pre  now, to open it, I have to type every single time "evince" on terminal. Is there any way to create an icon for that program, that could be moved in my applications folder?  <answer256988> Try linking apps with this command:  precodebrew linkapps evince /code/pre  If there are .app-style macOS wrapper apps in its formula, it will be linked to code/Applications/code. You can alternatively link those apps to code~/Applications/code with this command:  precodebrew linkapps --local evince /code/pre  You can check if linking is successful with:  precodels -lrth /Applications /code/pre  Now look at the last lines if there are "evince" related items in the list.  If linking was not successful, try to link it manually. You can link "evince" executable file to code/Applications/code:  precodeln -s $(which evince) /Applications/Evince /code/pre  <answer257507> Simply use a wrapper like Platypus  ul liDownload and install the script wrapper Platypus. /li liCreate a shell script /usr/local/bin/evince.sh with the content  precode#!/bin/bash  /usr/local/bin/evince /code/pre/li liOpen Platypus and create a new app like indicated in the screenshot below:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/u9WLT.png" alt="enter image description here"/li liChoose a nice icon (1024 x 1024 px linked) like this one:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/byetG.png" alt="enter image description here" (48 x 48 px example)  and hit the create button/li liSave the app to an appropriate folder (e.g. /Applications) and create a Dock item /li /ul  <comment321728> Thank you!
