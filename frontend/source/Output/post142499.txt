How do I make sure that OS X Mavericks is successfully installed? <body> How do I know if OS X Mavericks was installed successfully? In the App Store, will the button next to the OS X Mavericks app be shown as "Installed" after the completion of installation?  <answer142501> Click the ï£¿ in the top left of your screen and select "About This Mac". If it says "Version 10.9.x" then you have successfully upgraded to Mavericks!  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vScIo.png" alt="enter image description here"  The installer app should have removed itself, but if it didn't you can go ahead and delete it manually.  And in the App Store it should show you a "Download" button instead of a greyed out "Installed" button. This is so you can download it again to reinstall OS X or install on another Mac. The App Store is not the place to check what version of OS X is installed, only to emdownload/em apps and new versions of OS X.  <comment167879> Do you mean the App Store status? Or... where? <comment167996> yes! I mean the App Store status...will it be shown as installed? cos mine still shown as download. <comment168112> Besides that, what about the app store status? <comment168123> @skycloud92 See edit.
