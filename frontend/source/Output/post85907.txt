wifi.log disappeared? <body> I had some trouble with my wifi connection so I figured, I could switch on logging for airport via  codesudo /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/Versions/Current/Resources/airport debug +AllUserLand +LogFile/code  Now as far as I remember, the code+LogFile/codeshould redirect the airport debug log from kernel.log to wifi.log. Checking Console, I notice that there is no wifi.log under /var/log/. On a closer look, I noticed that kernel.log disappeared as well.   After some googling I found this post, in which it says that kernel.log was merged into system.log. Now if that is true, I'm suspecting that the reason I can't locate wifi.log might be that it was perhaps merged with system.log as well. Does anyone have some further info on this?  <answer91847> Mountain Lion does log a limited amount of information to   code/private/var/log/wifi.log/code  To read that file – and its siblings such as codewifi.log.0.bz2/code – use Console.   Included with the operating system is a diagnostics app that can enable debug logging. With that level of logging enabled you can then use Console to:   ul liview all messages/li liadd a system log query/li liand so on./li /ul  Also in Stack Exchange:   ul liWifi Diagnostics get WiFi performance (2013-01-02)/li /ul  <comment99634> As far as I can tell, all the debug info from airport that used to be in `/var/log/wifi.log` is now located in `/var/log/system.log`. Also, the `+LogFile` option has disappeared. <comment107969> With the latest update, wifi.log appears in Console again. So do a number of other logs that previously disappeared.
