iOS strange tab “DEVICES” in Wi-Fi Settings <body> img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/45841444/temp_to_pub/IMG_2191.PNG" alt="wifi DEVICES tab" br Does anyone ever see this DEVICE tab in the Wi-Fi Settings page?br It very strange, it's my first time saw this.br And even more, while I tried to connect to this SSID.br iOS pops up a dialog said "xxxxxx Is Not Connected to the Internet Are you sure you want to use this network?" What is this? And how to achieve this?  <answer146944> This can happen when (for example) a MacBook computer was used to create it's own Wi-Fi network.   The pop-up you see indicates that after you connect to this SSID you won't have internet access.   Such networks are called Ad-Hoc networks (more info: Wiki) .  <comment173356> Cool!
