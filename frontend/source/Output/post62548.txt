How can I universally change the icon for a type of file when the default app doesn't recognize it <body> I use BBEdit for my coding. I know how to tell all my .cfm, .php, etc. files to open in BBEdit. But The icon is just the plain Jane (what did she ever do?) dog-eared document icon. Instead I'd like to customize the document icons by file extension so that .cfm and .php look distinct from each other. Any way to do this that doesn't involve me editing BBEdit's plist or periodically repeating the process so newer documents now have the right icon shown?
