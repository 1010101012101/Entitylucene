Upgrade iMac 5K Graphics card drivers <body> Since the last Update of the new Mirrors Edge Catalyst game, I can't play it anymore as it requires the new AMD 16.20.1025 or newer drivers. My config: iMac 5k late-2014 27", 24gb RAM, 4 GHz Intel Core i7, AMD Radeon R9 M295X 4096 MB, Windows 10 Pro (Bootcamp)  Bootcamp doesn't list any available updates, and when I download the default Windows 10 drivers from AMD website, there is always an error message and it can't be installed :(  I know that actually the drivers are always customized by Apple, but I bought this game online a few days ago and now I can't play it at all anymore.  Is there a way to somehow update the graphic card drivers? Or does anyone know when Apple will release them as an update?  Thanks in advance :)  <comment298672> What's the error message? <comment298816> The error message is "AMD Radeon driver version 15.301.2101 detected. The required driver version is 16.20.1025 or newer. ..." <comment299194> That sounds more like the game error - I meant the Driver error when you try to install it. Have you tried http://support.amd.com/en-us/download/mobile?os=Windows%2010%20-%2064 ? <comment299916> @Tetsujin Yeah sure I did, but it says that no compatible hardware was found and it couldn't be installed... :/ <comment299920> hmm... then I'm stuck, sorry :/ <comment300060> ok np thanks anyways :)
