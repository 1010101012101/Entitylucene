Not receiving SMS from fellow iPhone users <body> With Wi-Fi disabled on iPhone 4 with iOS7, or when out of range of a signal, I only receive text messages from other iPhone users as iMessage posts once the Wi-Fi is enabled, or am within range of a signal. Have verified that the "send as SMS when iMessage is unavailable" feature is enabled on the sending iPhones.  This problem has not existed prior to the iOS 7 upgrade, although I don't know if that is either relevant or related to the issue at hand.  Have also tried resetting network settings as per previous post: Not receiving Text Messages after upgrade to iOS 7 Have also removed/replaced SIM card, checked/verified/reset/reverified APN settings with carrier (Platinum Tel), warm boot, cold boot.  Any ideas?
