What is the server URL thru which Apple updates occur? <body> I would like to know what is the URL thru which Apple updates occur.  I need this to setup caching for my Squid Proxy server.  <answer91870> Apple has documentation for their Software Update server built in to OS X Server here -- see under "Other services".  This doesn't seem to give the detail you need, but it does mention the code/etc/swupd/swupd.conf/code configuration file, which might contain that information.  <answer91884> According to this Apple KB Document, ports 80 and 8088 are used for SUS.
