Can't get microphone to work on iMac13,2 <body> I'm asking on behalf of a colleague who can't get the microphone on their 27" iMac (model iMac13,2, 27-inch, Late 2012 with Intel i5 2.9 GHz) to work.  In Sound preferences, all the setting look fine, nothing muted, and the microphone is shown as the input. However, software like Skype isn't picking up anything.  I'd really appreciate any help to diagnose and fix this problem, the System Report from the iMac is here:  http://www.solarsendit.net/d03hTxdQQ5x46ux6  Let me know if there are any more specifics I can provide. Thank you!  <comment258384> Instead of the model number (13,2), could you provide the year? <comment258405> @IronCraftMan Added, thank you!
