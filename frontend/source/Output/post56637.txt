OSX Network: "could not save because write access was not granted" <body> We have a really basic network of Macs here in our studio. We keep all our files on a machine running Leopard server, but we're all on Lion.   The problem we're having is every single time we open a file and then try to save it, we get the error  precodeCould not save &lt;FILENAME&gt; because write access was not granted. /code/pre  The easy work around is to do a save as. The weird thing is if you simply close the file without doing a save as, it disappears from the folder it was in.  I didn't set up our server, but I know we tried to enable all the permissions we could for every user. Thanks for your help.  <answer83577> There are Apple-created bugs in OS X 10.5 "Leopard" client &amp; server when copying files to/from AFP shared volumes.
