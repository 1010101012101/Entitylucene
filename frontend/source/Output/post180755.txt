iPhone 6 won't connect to wifi but other devices will <body> This morning, when I woke up, my phone would not connect to my home network. My Airport utility app has both router and internet on green, other devices connect to home network. However, when I try to connect in Wi-Fi settings, it will move my home network up from the list to just below my Wi-Fi switch, but no checkmark, just the spinning circle. Any thoughts?  I have already restarted the phone, modem, and router. I have also done the General settings reset of all network connections.  How to connect my phone to my home network?  <comment214761> just to clarify, it sees the network but it wont connect to it. <comment214792> Have you tried connecting your iPhone to a different WiFi somewhere? <comment214865> I'd try "forget this network" and then re-add it. <comment214910> @Tyson resetting network settings forgets all networks...
