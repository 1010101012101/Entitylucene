Do the Magic Mouse or Magic Trackpad support “middle click”? <body> I'm currently using the old Apple Mighty Mouse and I configured clicking on the trackball as a "middle click" that's been very handy for opening links in new tabs, closing tabs, etc. However, the mouse is starting to show its age and I've been looking at Apple's Magic Mouse and Magic Trackpad, and I'm wondering - do either of these support the "middle click" operation? If not, is there a gesture or a multi-finger click that can be used for the same things (i.e. opening new tabs, etc)?  <answer3816> Our friends over at SuperUser have an answer for us:     Here are two utilities that will allow you to customize gestures on the Magic Mouse, including adding middle click:      ul   liMagicPrefs/li   liBetter Touch Tool/li   /ul   <comment3599> Thanks for the quick reply. It's too bad that they apparently don't support it "out of the box", but I'll check those programs out. <comment3600> Yeah there is a lot of potential for the mouse which apple didnt make use of. I haven't used any of those apps but I have heard good things, and have seen how configurable some of them are (very!). <comment3606> I use MagicPrefs. It's not *quite* as nice as a real middle click, because the mouse seems to get a bit confused sometimes. I think I will try BetterTouchTool and see if it's any better.
