Completely uninstall an application <body> Is there a way to completely delete an application from my Macbook? I don't mean to just save the space by deleting it from the applications folder, but to delete all the files that it uses to make it run. I don't worry about the files it produces.  <answer116757> Deleting the application from the Applications folder emis/em deleting the application.  Some will store further data in code~/Library/Application\ Support//code.  <answer116770> There are several 3rd-party “un-installers” available for Mac. The one I use is AppZapper.  There may be files in "~/Library/Application Support/{folder name of app}" and there may be a preference file in ~/Library/Preferences/.  Sandboxed apps have their data in "~/Library/Containers/{folder name of company}"  Some applications may also install more complicated things like kexts. Most of those apps will have their own uninstallers.  <answer116780> I ask your question before. Really, the best way to delete application is (if you can't remove this app by simple 'x'-button pressed) "AppCleaner"  Yes, you can manually delete these files from Application Support folder or from Library/Containters folder.  But...br You will have unexpected result.  Just a one example (not related to deleting apps, but related to command line usage and os x).  I have experience in command line usage, but, after prompt command 'purge' in OS X, which will give me more free RAM, I gain only a headache, because my XCode app becomes insane.  So, be sure in what you will do.  <answer117362> Well known you can go ahead and download "AppCleaner".
