Enterprise Account and Developer Account app migration <body> I am developing an iOS application using the company's enterprise account. The app ID, certificates and profiles are stored in this account. We want to distribute the app through App Store as well, so we recently purchased another (normal) developer account and created a new App ID within this account. My question is whether or not these different App IDs will be a problem? If so, what might these problems be and how can I eliminate them.  Note that we have not yet distributed the app through any channel.  <comment360257> So long as an app has been approved at least once, it can be transferred to another account, if this is what you want. The question is not entirely clear so my answer may not be applicable.
