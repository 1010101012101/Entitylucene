Messages sending a picture (on both iOS 10 and macOS Sierra) to a group but it shows failed (while it's actually sent) <body> I have a Messages group thread since many months ago, and we regularly send photos/videos in that group. Since the last several weeks (I've upgraded to iOS 10 and macOS Sierra, but I can't tell if it started exactly with the upgrade) any photo/video that I send to that group is displayed as not delivered (red exclamation at the right of, "Not delivered" text below the message). This is happening both on iOS and macOS, to the very same group. If the error occurs at my iPhone, my Mac does get the image successfully, and vice versa. The recipients in the group also can see the photo, but the original sending device insists on saying that it's not delivered.  How can I solve this bug? It's annoying, creates confusion (I'm not on perfect connection, what if it actually really fails to deliver and I think it's a false positive), and sending me all sorts of "Message failed to send" notifications and (!) notification badges on icons.  <comment320609> Are you 100% sure that every person in that group chat received the image/video?  Messages might be interpreting it as 'not sent' if 1 or 2 members of that group can't receive the image.
