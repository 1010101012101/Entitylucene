How do I remove the Finder context option after removing an app? <body> I got an app a long time ago (called SourceTree) that adds an option to Finder's context menu. The way I installed the app was by simply moving it to my Applications folder, and it didn't come with an uninstaller. I transferred all my stuff to my new computer via Time Machine, and the option in Finder is unfortunately still there. How can I get rid of it without re-installing the operating system?  See the last option in this context menu: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2EZUA.png" alt="Finder context option"  <answer65478> Check in code~/Library/Services//code. It probably installed a service there that didn't get uninstalled. You can safely delete the file.  If you don't find anything there, look in strongSystem Preferences → Keyboard → Keyboard Shortcuts → Services/strong for an entry with the same name as the context menu item. Right-click that entry and it will offer you a emShow in Finder/em option, from which you can delete the file.  <comment76931> Great! There is no folder called "Services" in `~/Library/Application Support/`, but I found the keyboard preferences to be very useful. I was able to disable the options like I wanted. Thanks! <comment76932> Sorry, that should be `~/Library/Services/`. I'll correct the answer.
