Tool for drawing bezier lines - inspector for the length of the line <body> Looking for a tool what allow me:  ul lidraw shapes with bezier lines/li lithe inspector shows the stronglength/strong of the line/li /ul  For example OmniGraffle allows draw a shape with bezier lines, but it doesn't show the length of the line e.g. for the following image omnigraffle show shows only the width and height of the bounding box.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6CxhT.png" alt="enter image description here"  strongI need the length of the line./strong  Any such tool?  <answer204310> Just found:  The Inkscape could measure the path length:  ul liselect the path/li liclick codeExtension/code - codeVisualise path/code - codeMeasure path/code/li /ul  It will attach the length of the path into image. Not the native OS X app (needs X.org), but works OK, and it is free.
