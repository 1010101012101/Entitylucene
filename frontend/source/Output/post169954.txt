Local web server <body> I'm running OS X Yosemite and I'm trying to setup Apache so I can access files over my WiFi for my Chromecast application (runs using NodeJS).  So I followed some tutorials online (http://www.glenscott.co.uk/blog/re-enable-apache-php-web-sharing-on-os-x-yosemite/) and I can access my websites at:  codehttp://localhost/~cameron/code  I can also access something at:  codecameron.local/~cameron/code  strongOne thing that's confusing me is where does just localhost and cameron.local point? I can't find the file I see anywhere! I tried code/Library/WebServer/Documents/code but it's NOT the index.php file there... Any ideas where I can find it? Or find out? A spotlight search for the contents doesn't return anything!/strong  Anyway when trying to access the contents of an example site on say my iPhone, etc, I can't do it! Because of my use of codelocalhost/code so it would try and find the localhost of the device rather than my Mac.  I thought I could just replace codelocalhost/code with my ip address... but when I enter my ip address nothing happens... I just get an endless loading.  How do I solve this? Do you have to do anything special to get ip addresses working?  Shouldn't just be able to do:  codexx.xxx.xxx.xxx/~cameron/examplewebsite/code  <comment199667> Can you add a link to the tutorial you've followed? It will make it easier for others to understand what your setup is now? Also, which files did you modify/install/add? <comment199691> Added the tutorial link. <comment199703> cameron.local should let people access the sites folder in your home directory (~/Sites) <comment199762> `http://cameron.local/` should be identical to `http://localhost/`. To access the content of a user-specific Sites folder, use `http://cameron.local/~cameron`. Does this reduce your confusion? <comment199908> Be careful here: `cameron.local` should be the same as `localhost` when browsed to on your Mac called `cameron`. It will **not** be the same as `cameron.local/~cameron` or `localhost/~cameron` (which between the two of them should be the same). <comment199948> Yeah but I don't know where cameron.local and localhost are pointing when I don't specify the username... In any case the ip address is what I'm really trying to get working.
