Indian Rupee Symbol <body> On OS X, Shift-Option-2 prints the Euro symbol strong€/strong.   Is there a shortcut to print the Indian Rupee Symbol strong₹/strong?  <answer124534> You could use the Text replace function.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/utnz7.png" alt="Rupee"  Now every time you type Rupee (or Rup, or what ever you like to use) in a text document it will be replace with the Rupee symbol.  This solution is my preference since there are No special finger breaking key combination, and nothing to remember.  <answer124535> There might be one if you are using a keyboard layout from around that part of the world (I don't know). Also, there might be an easier way to do this, I am not an expert.  ol ligo to System codePreferences &gt; Keyboard/code/li liclick "Show Keyboard and Character Viewers in Menu Bar"/li liIn the new menu bar item select "Show Character Viewer" /li liSelect "Currency Symbols"/li liRight click the ₹ and select Copy Character Info/li liPaste this into Text Edit and then copy just the ₹ itself/li liGo back to codeSystem Preferences &gt; Keyboard &gt; Text/code/li liClick the code+/code to add a new text replacement value/li liPick a memorable but seldom used key combination (unfortunately here you cannot use modifier keys)/li /ol  For the last step I used "rupee" which caused that symbol to appear while I was writing these instructions. (I then deleted it which is why I was able to type "rupee")  <answer124543> h3DefaultKeyBinding.dict/h3  Create code~/Library/KeyBindings/DefaultKeyBinding.dict/code and enter  precode{ "$~2" = (insertText:, "₹"); } /code/pre  This rebinds ⇧⌥2 to insert ₹br code$/code = ⇧, code~/code = ⌥  Quit and reopen applications for the change to take effect  <answer124559> Suggesting inserting a shortcut instead of editing the keyboard layout is IMAO a stronghorrible/strong suggestion.  Grab Ukelele and edit it properly™, instead.  i.e. if what you want to do is modify your keyboard layout, what you should actually do is... surprise surprise... modify your keyboard layout. Using workarounds such as those suggested is insane.  <comment145667> You need to specify what keyboard you are using. QUERTY, QWERTZ others ? just read the 6 letters starting at Q. <comment145668> Buscar: QWERTZ, AZERTY, what ever the first row of your keyboard is... It does not tell you anything interessting about the rest of the keyboard layout. Especially when it comes to modified keys. Besides, knowing that Alt-Shift-2 results in €, you could already guess what layout it is. <comment145669> Well the Alt-Shift-2 results in ”, not even close to the €, which is alt-E on my keyboard. So knowing what is the keyboard layout is important. <comment145670> Indeed there are hardly any layouts with the rupee sign assigned to a combination on OS X. This is probably the most convenient method. <comment145672> Heh, I didn't think that you already have the rupee character here in the question, so steps 1-6 aren't strictly necessary. <comment145673> Well, this is not limited to US layouts. <comment145674> Took me about 20 seconds to select an US layout, press Alt-Shift-2 and get a € sign. <comment145694> How would you type the text in your answer with that shortcut in effect? Wouldn't it prevent the letters R-u-p-e-e from staying uncorrected wherever you typed them, no? <comment145696> This is more in keeping with the idiom of typing a sequence of keys and releasing them all at the same time to generate a special character. Using auto correction is OK if the shortcut is memorable and doesn't conflict with something you might type, like the actual word for instance. <comment145701> @bmike Rupee does not work inside webpage like this one, but it works everywhere else on my may mac, like Mail.app, TextEdit, Notepad, Calender, Finder file naming ect.. <comment145708> This is great, the down side is it kills the €, but it might be ok if one does not uses that one. <comment145709> @Buscar Indeed, the given shortcut was just an example. <comment145723> As noted by bmike, best to choose a non-word (Rup?) for your shortcut. <comment145726> Ukelele is fine, but suggest you delete your pejorative comments about other solutions, there is really nothing wrong with them. <comment145727> @TomGewecke It makes sense to do that :) <comment145739> @TomGewecke IMAO yes, they are profundly wrong. What the OP actually wants to do is change the layout, so he should just change the layout. Doing strange workaround makes no sense under any point of view. <comment145857> @Buscar웃 It is a QUERTY keyboard US layout. <comment145859> Thanks, but I made a fool of my self already :( <comment145861> Would you mind describing in more details how the problem described by the OP could be solved with Ukelele? This would make for a more helpful answer. <comment145862> @grgarside I really like the idea. I tried your code, but it doesnt work when I restart the application. Is the mapping correct.. One typo I found was the insertText: should also be surrounded by double quotes. The content of my `DefaultKeyBinding.dict` is     `{ "$~2" = ("insertText:", "₹"); }` <comment145863> @patrix nice idea! Cannot do it now but hopefully I'll edit it later. <comment145866> @MaxRied good to know, I just didn't want to claim this would work if he had a different layout since I don't have one to try it on. <comment145870> Great technique, but might be a bit complex for the average user... <comment306067> Should that really be empty quotes? Or should the rupee symbol be inside the empty quotes?  This doesn't seem to work. I'm on 10.11.4 El Capitan. <comment326070> How does it know to map to the rupee symbol if the insertText value is only ""?  Thanks! <comment326071> @Joe - In the double quotes on the right, do you have to put the rupee symbol in there or should it be empty?  I don't understand how this is supposed to work.  Thanks.  (It isn't working for me using either grgarside's method or yours.) <comment326072> @jmort253 The value is not blank – seems your browser/font doesn't support the character as it's definitely there between the last pair of quotes. <comment326126> @grgarside - Ok! Thanks for confirming.
