Mac Numbers - How do I add up cells containing data (text) per column <body> In my Mac Numbers Spreadsheet, I have got a column containing a product title. I would like to add up the cells containing a title at the bottom on my spreadsheet. What formula do I use for that? Please note: Some of the cells are empty.  <answer246110> This is a job for COUNTIF(). The syntax is not complicated, but it is briefly described here: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/5954557?tstart=0 There are also a number of questions showing how to use it in this SE if you search 'COUNTIF'.   <answer246114> The function you need is CountIf, which takes two parameters: a range of cells and a test condition. Suppose you have a chart of customers and product purchases, and you want to tally what each customer purchased each quarter: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zncj5.png" alt="**spreadsheet sample data**"  Cell B11 contains the formula codeCOUNTIF(B2:B10,"=Product A")/code and  Cell C12 contains the formula codeCOUNTIF(C2:C10,"=Product B")/code, etc.   The first parameter is the range of cells you are counting in. The test condition must be enclosed in quotes, and usually you're going to want to specify a comparison operator. For more complex queries like using other cells, etc., you'll want to search Google or Ask Different.  <comment303364> He wants to count. Summing the text would be meaningless.
