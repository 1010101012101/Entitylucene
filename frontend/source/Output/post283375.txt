Is it possible to add hosting to some image hosting in share menu? <body> I have a MacBook Pro. I can make screenshots. It lands on the desktop. By opening the context menu I can press the Share button.  Is it possible to add some button which will share the image on some image hosting? For example, I had Gyazo on Windows and now I use Lightshot. I can select region of my screen and picture immediately hosts on the server and link to the image is in my buffer.  I mean this menu:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/A3YUH.jpg" width="360"  Is this possible on Mac?  <answer283376> You can use strongImageShareUr/strong which adds a share extension for uploading to Imgur.  Choose More to enable the extension for the first use, then you can select an image and choose Share → Upload to Imgur and follow the instructions.                   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MpeiZ.png" width="160" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vfQCm.png" width="313"  Despite the author's message on the page that it doesn't work in Sierra, I've just tried it on 10.12.4 and it works great.  <comment357259> Work like a charm!
