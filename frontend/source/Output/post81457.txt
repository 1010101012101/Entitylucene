Full screen videos in Chrome suffer a lag <body> I have an issue concerning full screen videos within the Google Chrome browser. The video lags for a second.br Since it is too hard to explain, I captured 16 seconds of video.    What could be the cause on this?  <answer81458> If I've understood the video correctly, it's the long animation you're wondering what is? I don't see any other lag, please do correct me if I'm wrong.  Using the HTML5-version of YouTube, utilizes OS X's built in full screen mode. The animation from single-window to full screen in OS X emis/em this slow, and it annoys me as well. Try disabling the HTML5-mode from here, or to shorten and/or remove the full screen animation it alltogether, see this question and it's answers.  <answer87659> Seems like running it in HTML5-mode fixed the problem for me  <comment93914> yea thank you it did fixed my problem :) <comment93915> You're very welcome, and welcome to AskDifferent! :) <comment102491> How do you do that?
