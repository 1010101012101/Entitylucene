OS X Disk Utility shows more data <body> On OS X El Capitan Disk Utility shows me that I have 48 GB Movies, but I don't have this films really.  Where can I find these movies that shows Disk Utility?  <answer232656> Both Disk Utility and About This Mac use spotlight data to categorize the used space in terms of classes of data:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6QQ8L.png" alt="enter image description here"  You can use Finder to search for items using the same classes:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GMiQv.png" alt="enter image description here"  Some notes:  ul litype in the search box the text: strongkind:movie/strong em(as you type look for the hints as the system shows you possible values of kind)/em/li lichoose list view (the four lines icon top left)/li licontrol click and add size so you can then click it and sort by size/li /ul  You can save this "smart folder" or add a filter like size  whatever limit you want so you can review all large movie files or just all large files.  <comment284315> Thank you. It works,  but I cant understand, why some .ts files or js files are marked as movie? and when I deleted some films, why they saved there too ? <comment284316> Hop into [chat](http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/38/ask-different-chat) and let's see if you need a quick tip or a new question for that specific item... Does that work @Gor ?
