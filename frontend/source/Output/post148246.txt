Late 2013 Macbook Retina Windows 7 x64 Bootcamp "No device drivers found" <body> I have been trying for days to get Windows 7, 64 bit installed on my late 2013 Macbook Retina using bootcamp and always run into the same problem - when the Windows installation starts it gives an error message saying "No device drivers were found for my CD/DVD device..." and prompts be to try to browse to a location to find the drivers.   When I try to browse for the drivers I see two drives:  ul liBOOTCAMP (C:)/li liBOOT (X:) ul liProgram Files/li lisources/li liUsers/li liWindows/li /ul/li /ul  (C:) is my bootcamp partition and I am assuming that (X:) is my install drive, but the file structure looks nothing like what it looks like from Mac OS X.  I never get the prompt asking me which partition to install Windows on.  I am using a USB drive and a Windows 7 64 bit ISO with Bootcamp Assistant. Everything goes smoothly in BCA. I have tried several different ISOs including one recommendation to use a specific ISO that is supposed to be a "full" version which includes additional drivers, but still with no luck.  <answer148898> The (fixed) Pre-Installation Environment (boot.wim) of your Windows_7.iso doesn't contain the necessary drivers to use the USB3-interface of your codeLate 2013 Macbook Retina/code. So a "non-standard Windows7.iso" including "additional  drivers" without injecting/implementing them into the boot.wim won't help much either. Btw codeBOOT (X:)/code is strongnot/strong your install drive but the mounted boot.wim.  To circumvent limitations (new drivers, new hardware) Microsoft uses the $WinPEDriver$-feature to provide drivers at installation time.  Apple Boot Camp uses this method to provide the necessary drivers with the boot medium - your external USB drive.  Please check if you meet the following requirements:  ol liBackup of your entire hard disc/li listrikeWindows 7.iso Home Premium x64, Professional x64, or Ultimate x64 (these three are us-en digitalriver isos and here is a full list of all images available there)./strike Please use Microsoft Software Recovery to download the proper Winodws 7 release./li liFormatting of the USB-device (according to Apple):  If the size of the disk is 32 GB or less it should be MS-DOS (FAT).  If the size of the disk is over 32 GB it should be ExFAT.  Try to use an USB thumb drive (size 8 GB or bigger). If you don't have a thumb drive, try to use an USB hard drive smaller than 2 TB. ExFAT formatting with  Apple codedisk utility.app/code often doesn't work (means: formatting ends in FAT32 instead of ExFAT) and according to different sources a volume size limit of 2TB exists for MS-DOS (FAT) (=FAT32)./li liBoot Camp Support Software version: 5.1.5640  download link: Latest Boot Camp Support Software/li liFile/Folder structure of the root of your boot device (your external USB-drive):/li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/syxlo.jpg" alt="root files and folders"  ol start="6" liIf your boot device doesn't contain code$WinPEDriver$/code, codeAutoUnattend.xml/code and codeBootCamp/code please download and extract codeBootCamp5.1.5640.zip/code and copy the contents of the resulting codeBootCamp/code folder to the root level of your install drive./li liIf your install drive already contains those files and folders then check if the USB drivers are present. (Paths: /$WinPEDriver$/IntelxHCISetup/Drivers/HCSwitch/Win7/x64/ and /$WinPEDriver$/IntelxHCISetup/Drivers/xHCI/Win7/x64/). If they aren't present the wrong Boot Camp Support Software package has been chosen. Delete code$WinPEDriver$/code, codeAutoUnattend.xml/code and codeBootCamp/code and continue with step 6./li /ol  Now the installation should work.  If the installation still doesn't work a more time consuming way has to be chosen (modifying the boot.vim) and i will write a second answer.  P.S. Did you already check this apple.stackexchange question/solution? Especially the comment of user codefunkylaundry May 18 at 16:38/codeto the 1st answer: "the key was to entirely remove the bootcamp partition and then add it again"  <comment175470> Wow, thanks. I will try this out when I get home from work. I saw that link you mentioned before but it didn't really seem applicable (I don't have an optical drive). <comment175638> Wow indeed +10 on that. Where have you been all this time, we need more answers like this one :) <comment175680> so did it work? <comment175793> Worked. The only thing I did different was use a different (never used, 32GB) USB drive. Now there's just the issue of not being being able to swap the fn and ctrl keys under bootcamp... <comment176821> @mclaassen http://blueskyworkshop.blogspot.de/2011/05/swap-control-and-command-keys-on.html?m=1 <comment176911> Unfortunately there doesn't seem to be a way to switch the fn key (not the command key)  http://superuser.com/questions/422750/how-to-swap-ctrl-and-fn-key-on-a-macbook-pro-running-windows-7-via-boot-camp <comment231032> These ISO links are dead now <comment231068> @MetalGear Added different link. Thanx for your hint. <comment231163> @klanomath I want use key which came with my dell laptop and with that key "Microsoft Software Recovery" page is suggest to contact to dell for windows dvd. <comment269806> Thanks for the very detailed answer and instructions.  Unfortunately it's still not working for me. I followed all the instructions. I have the same kind of Mac. I'm still getting the 'no device drivers found' error.  Do I need to copy the drivers to the Windows directory, and then browse to them during the Windows install? That was suggested somewhere else.
