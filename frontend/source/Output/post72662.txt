What OS X signal strength test apps exist to measure Wi-Fi networking? <body> Is there a way I can get more details on the strength of my Wi-Fi signal?  I'm looking for either an app I can download or a system command that I can run in terminal that will expose the noise of other signals that aren't mine and may be occupying the same channel as my current network.  <answer72667> Netspot might be what you need I got this the other day but have not had the time to use it yet. Not sure of the price now, I got it for free from the app store.  https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/netspot-wifi-survey-wireless/id514951692?mt=12  This app is designed for laptops so you can survey the area which you have to map. Hope this helps.  <answer72692> You might also try iStumbler.  I use it, and it does show channels and noise. It's free/open source.  The site describes wifi features as:  ul liLists visible wireless networks with complete information. /li liInspector shows detailed information including a high-resolution graph, notes, extended properties and samples. /li liAlways displays the connected network, even if it's private. /li liGraphically indicates network type and encryption status. /li liSignal and noise graphed over time for the selected network./li liConnection monitor for connected network./li /ul  <answer72694> I usually use one of these:  ul listrongAirlock/strong, a great freeware dashboard widget (http://www.pimley.net/projects/#airlock):  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/m4fwA.png" alt="enter image description here"/li listrongWi-Fi Diagnostics/strong (code/System/Library/CoreServices/Wi-Fi Diagnostics.app/code), an application included in Mac OS X since 10.7 "Lion" (see http://subrosasoft.com/blog/tips-and-tricks/hidden-wi-fi-diagnostics-tool-in-mac-os-x-10-7-lion):  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ovjbs.png" alt="enter image description here"  The WiFi scan (from FileNetwork Utilities) shows signal strength and noise:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/IL6EP.png" alt="enter image description here"/li /ul  <answer72879> I would recommend WiFi Explorer from the Mac App Store. It shows signal and noise, as well as SNR measurements for all the networks in range. It also has a nice visualization to determine channel conflict and overlapping. It's not free but it's worth the couple of bucks.     Scan, find, and troubleshoot wireless networks with WiFi Explorer.       Quickly identify channel conflicts, overlapping and other factors (e.g. configuration issues) that may be affecting the connectivity and/or performance of your wireless network in homes, offices and other sites.      Find open, ad-hoc and even rogue access points. WiFi Explorer detects 802.11a/b/g/n wireless networks and supports 2.4 and 5 GHz channel bands, as well as 20 and 40 MHz channels.      Get an insight into the network details: name (SSID), MAC address (BSSID), device manufacturer, signal strength (RSSI), noise, channel, band, security configuration, supported data rates and much more.      Monitor signal strength of each network over time and export metrics (average, maximum signal strength, etc.) and network details to CSV file format.   <answer72893> To simply show the strength of the WiFi network you are connected to you can alt+click on the Airport icon. Look for the text codeRSSI/code, it will show a negative number. The closer to zero it is, the stronger your signal.

One is graphical and the other command line based.  ul li/System/Library/CoreServices/Applications/Wireless\ Diagnostics.app (on newer OS) and /System/Library/CoreServices/Wi-Fi\ Diagnostics.app (on older OS)/li li/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/Versions/Current/Resources/airport  /li /ul  The former will draw a very nice graph of signal and noise for you and can perform wireless scans, Bonjour service mapping (both locally and across the internet IPv4 and IPv6), ARP, and just about anything that the normal network utility tool does except for port scanning.  I symlink the airport command into /usr/local/bin so that you can call it from any shell.  precodeAir:~ me$ ls -l  /usr/local/bin/airport  lrwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel  89 Apr  4  2012 /usr/local/bin/airport -&gt; /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/Versions/Current/Resources/airport /code/pre  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/grOCK.png" alt="Network Utilities window of the Wi-Fi Diagnostics app"  The terminal command is more useful for scanning and changing the way your device joins networks than getting signal or noise information, but codeairport -I/code does dump details that normally are shown when you hold the option key and click on the Wi-Fi icon in the menu bar (such as MCS, RSSI, Noise, and transmit rates).  If you want more powerful tools, start with these professional quality and reasonably priced apps:  ul liWiFi Notifications - free and simple notifications to narrow down when significant events happen on WiFi/li liWiFi Signal - runs in your menu bar/li liWiFi Explorer - full analysis and nice graphs - slightly more expensive/li /ul  <comment84654> I use this a lot an it's a solid app with nice information density. <comment84657> I've used NetSpot at my office (about 10,000sqft) to map signal strength from my five Cisco AeroNet WAPs; it worked extremely well but only because I had a good schematic graphic of the floorplan to use as a reference when plotting locations.  If you can create a map of your area - even just an approximate sketch - and import that into NetSpot, you will undoubtedly get better results. <comment99933> nice tool, but not for average user. I tried it, and un installed it. Making a map of the area is a pain. <comment99935> A quick access to same is, Hold the option key click on the wifi icon and at the bottom you will see the "Open Wi-Fi diagnostics" in OSX 10.8 <comment162306> Just updated iStumbler (there's an 'e' in there) and it's no longer free or open source.
