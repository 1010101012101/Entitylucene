Trackpad gestures stop working <body> From time to time, my Magic Trackpad gestures will stop working. I can restart to bring them back, but this is pretty disruptive.  Is there a process I can kill to bring them back?  (I've tried turning off the Magic Trackpad; unfortunately, it doesn't fix the problem.)  <answer32620> If resetting the necessary prefs does not help but the Magic Trackpad is emstill connected/em, this is a beautiful alternative: strongBetterTouchTool/strong  In fact, this is much more fun since it makes the Magic Trackpad so powerful.  http://www.boastr.de/  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/IYUFk.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer41933> For me, the problem was that dragging got turned off in Universal Access somehow.  Go to Settings - Universal Access - Mouse &amp; Trackpad - Trackpad Options and turn on Dragging if it's not enabled.  <answer44023> When a reboot didn't fix this, I went to strongSystem Preferences  Trackpad  More Gestures/strong and changed codeMission Control/code to strongSwipe up with three fingers/strong and codeApp Expos√©/code to strongSwipe down with three fingers/strong.  Those gestures now worked with 3 fingers. Then I changed it back to codeSwipe up/down with four fingers/code on both and they started working again using the four-finger gestures.  In 10.8, running codekillall Dock/code seems to bring back trackpad gestures as well.  <answer113467> This started happening to me on my early-2013 MacBook Pro since I upgraded to Mavericks.  It happens both and with and without the Magic Trackpad.  Based on the note at the end of Andrew's answer, I ran codekillall Dock/code from a Terminal window and the gestures started working again.  This blog post has more information about the issue and there is an Alfred extension to fix it too.  <comment154509> `killall Dock` has worked for me on 10.9.3 too
