How to switch window with swiss german keyboard? <body> I got used to switching between open windows in an application on my other mac (US keyboard: codecommand + tilde/code.  This doesn't really work on swiss german keyboards, since the tilde is generated with: codealt + n/code. Pressing command + alt + n behaves the same as codecommand + n/code, that is, the applications tend to open new windows instead of cycling existing ones.  Any tips?  <answer33619> Never mind, I just figured it out by myself:  It turns out, on swiss german keyboards, the shortcut for cycling through windows is not codecommand + tilde/code but instead codecommand + backtick/code. The backtick is on the same key as caret, which is the first key to the left of the backspace key. Therefore, I need to press:  precodecommand + shift + ^ /code/pre  <answer112260> And you can edit this in your general settings  keyboard  shortcut to suit your needs.  <comment51738> This does not work on my German keyboard. <comment63566> @gentmatt: For the german keyboard, it may work with `command + ` and `command + ` resp.

Feel free to edit this into the flow of the top voted answer or flesh out your answer since the two together might be the best answer. <comment132081> @bmike, in fact, I'm just going to accept this answer, as it includes information on how to find out the correct answer for any keyboard ;-) <comment291061> I have tried (command + shift + ^) and (command + ) on my Swiss keyboard, but .... no luck. Does anyone have other options to suggest? Thanks. <comment298624> Just for the record, on the German keyboard it's `command + shift + \` `. The apostrophe is on the same place on the German keyboard as circumflex on the Swiss one, i.e., to the left of backspace.
