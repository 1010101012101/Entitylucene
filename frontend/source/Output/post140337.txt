Copying only files without a special string in filename <body> I have to copy only files from a folder that don't have following string in its filename: NNNNxNNNN (a 3 or 4 digit number followed by the character x followed by a 3 or 4 digit number again - it's the resolution of an image in the filename)  I'm trying for about an hour with the "find" command but it never does what it should do.  <answer140392> As codefind/code's code-name/code does not support regular expressions you will have to explicitly define the four cases  precodefind /source/ \     -not -name '*[0-9][0-9][0-9]x[0-9][0-9][0-9]*'           -and \     -not -name '*[0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]x[0-9][0-9][0-9]*'      -and \     -not -name '*[0-9][0-9][0-9]x[0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]*'      -and \     -not -name '*[0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]x[0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]*' \     -exec cp {} /destination/ \; /code/pre
