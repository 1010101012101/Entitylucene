Batch update Apple Keychain passwords using terminal <body> I have 41 webform password items stored in Keychain.  Each item has the same password (since each of them is a different wifi router in our building).  Every few months, I need to update all of these items to reflect the new password set up our sys admin.  Is there a quick terminal script that I can use to batch update the password of any item whose name contains "10.18.124." from "oldpw" to "newpw"?  <answer283899> This should be possible with security(1).  The command should like something like this:  precodesecurity add-generic-password -a 10.18.124.1 -w "newpw" -j "Password Updated 2017-05-17 12:04" -U /code/pre  ul licode-a/code Specify account name (required)/li licode-w/code Specify password to be added/li licode-j/code Specify comment string (optional)/li licode-U/code Update item if it already exists/li /ul  I don't think there is a "contains" feature so you maybe have to loop this.
