Script that opens URL link in new mail in Mail.app <body> I receive some mails which always come to my mailbox in the same format. The email address of the sender is always the same, the text inside is also the same, and there is one link each time in those mails (always the same domain name for the link).  I'm looking to create a script that would automatically open this hyperlink in my browser, as soon as I receive one.  I've set up Mail Rules to activate a script, but I can't figure out how to write the script so it would open the URL of the link found inside the new email each time.  How could I write this script?  <comment358538> Questions asking for code must demonstrate a minimal understanding of the problem being solved.
