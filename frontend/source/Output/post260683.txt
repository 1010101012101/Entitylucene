Keyboard shortcut for service only works after I manually run the service <body> After I assign a keyboard shortcut to initiate a service in System Preferences, I press the keyboard shortcut and nothing happens. I have to first click on the service title under the services menu (found if you click on the application title in the top left corner of the screen). Only then will the keyboard shortcut function correctly.  If I quit that application, I have to manually click on the service title under the services menu each and every time I re-open the application. I would've thought that the fix would "last" until the computer is shut down or restarted, but nope, it lasts only until the application is quit out of.  It may sound as though I am making a mountain out of a molehill, but this extra step essentially defeats the purpose of the keyboard shortcut in the first place, especially since I usually do not know and cannot keep track of if I have already manually run the service since the last time that I opened that application.  I have to repeat these steps for every application, including stock applications like Finder. Otherwise, the shortcut will not work while I am in that application.  This happens for every service I created.  This happens regardless of the keyboard shortcut.  Is there any way to have the keyboard shortcut trigger the service without having to manually run the service first?  hr  My computer runs OS X El Capitan, version 10.11.6. It should be noted, however, that I first observed this bug from the very first time that I assigned a keyboard shortcut to my service, which was at least a year ago. In other words, I have never experienced the keyboard shortcut function as it was designed to work.  hr  It should be noted that this bug is not unique to my computer; reports of others experiencing this idiosyncrasy abound on the internet...  Service not running the first time it's invoked via key combination  Services shortcut not working properly  Assigning a shortcut to a service  Assign a shortcut to running a script in OS X (read the last paragraph in this answer)  <comment326418> That totally is not how it is supposed to work. Sadly I can't think of a good way to fix or troubleshoot this issue. What if you try to make the shortcut something that no application could possibly use. Like `cmd+shift+alt+ctrl+0`? <comment326468> I assigned the shortcut, `cmd+shift+alt+ctrl+0` to initiate a service, as suggested. I still had to manually run the service before this shortcut did anything. <comment326500> Maybe if you [reinstall(repair) the OS](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204904). If you don't format the drive, it'll keep everything and just rewrite all system files. That could work... Well, this next one is not really a solution to the problem, but _perhaps_ a way to get around it. This is totally not the only application, but a pretty decent free one: [Aptivate 2](http://www.apptivateapp.com/). I've maybe once tried it, but it should do the trick. There are many alternative applications that do what Aptivate does. I personally use [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) mostly <comment329423> Please add the OS X/macOS version information to your question, e.g. OS X El Capitan 10.11.6 or macOS Sierra 10.12.1, etc. <comment329455> @user3439894 I've updated my post to include my operating system. <comment372335> same here with 10.12.6
