How do I know if an update requires restart in macOS Sierra? <body> How do I know if an update requires restart in macOS Sierra? I just updated iTunes and read the description of the update, but couldn't find any mention of a restart required. After a moment the computer restarted without a warning. Luckily, I wasn't in the middle of anything important, but I'd like to avoid such forced restarts in the future.  Edit: There was also a macOS Sierra update today. In the figure below, there's no mention of a restart required. I also followed the two links, but found no mention there either. I'm pretty sure that the info shown here was the same prior to the update. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZTAjD.png" alt="Screenshot of one of the updates installed recently in App Store"  <answer272611> When you look at the Updates list in the Mac App Store, it will indicate in the info if a restart is required. Below is an example of this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QfEeA.png" alt="Restart Required"  You will see the words emRestart Required/em followed by an icon of a white triangle within a grey circle (looks like a reverse emplay/em button).  Prior to installing the update, just check the info against each update to see whether any of them require a restart.  Security updates and OS updates usually require a restart. Most other apps don't.  <comment342619> Thanks for your answer, but I've edited my question and provided a counterexample. I was expecting a restart, of course, ensuing a system update. <comment342627> Yes, but the screenshot you've added to your question was taken of the update **after** it was installed. This will no longer indicate that a restart was required. The indication of a restart being required is only present _before_ you install it. In addition, I also know that sometimes people click on Update All (in the case of multiple updates) and get caught out because one of them required a restart. So you really do need to check all of them if choosing to install multiple updates simultaneously. I've updated my answer to show you an example. <comment342638> Prior to the update I really tried to find a notification of a restart, but I guess I somehow managed to miss that. Well, thank you anyway! Now I know where to look in the future.
