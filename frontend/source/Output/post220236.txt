Use network path without mounting as a drive <body> I've recently moved to OS X from Windows, and I wish to point a couple of programs towards a network share. On Windows I could open a program's emSettings/em and enter a path as code//my.network.share/path/code and I'm trying to find out if this is possible in OS X.  I know from this question that I can mount the network share and then point a program towards it, but Windows allows me to enter such a path without the share having been mounted. I had hoped that I could enter the network path prefixed with codesmb:///code but OS X won't allow this.  The reason I don't want to mount the share is that it won't always be present. Therefore, I only want to emrequire/em the network location when I open a specific program.  Is this possible in OS X or do I need to mount the share first?  <comment266737> ***"..I wish to point a couple of programs towards a network share.."*** *&* ***"..On Windows I could open a program's settings and enter a path.."***                  What exactly do you mean by these? <comment266748> For example, using Calibre for managing ebooks, and it requires a library which may be located on the local computer or a server. When setting up this library, Calibre presents a text field into which you can enter a network path. <comment266799> Any chance you could provide a screenshot? If you post an image, I'll try to point you towards the closest OS X equivalent or a reasonable substitute. <comment267105> A screenshot of... the text box into which one enters the path? <comment267243> You have a problem which you are trying to solve. I don't fully understand the problem or the question, but I understand enough of it to know that I may be able to help you with it, provided some clarification. Take a photo or provide some kind of accurate visual representation of what you're attempting to describe so that I can actually "see" the problem for myself. Then I will try my best to help you. <comment267244> Try to include the entire screenshot. Minimal cropping is best.
