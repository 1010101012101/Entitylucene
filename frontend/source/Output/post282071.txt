Time as x-axis in chart with Apple Numbers <body> I'm trying to make an area chart in Apple Numbers (on Mac) where I have a series of values I want to plot on y-axis against time on the x-axis. Each value has a date that it occurred but the dates aren't equally spaced. Numbers is showing them as if they were equally spaced. Is it possible to plot them relative to their point in time?  <answer282090> This can't be done with an area graph. You need to use a scatter graph, or to insert hidden rows for each increment missing. This has been an annoyance of mine for a long time â€” I have provided feedback to Apple and you may do so too.  <comment355121> I managed to do it fairly easily with Google Sheets instead
