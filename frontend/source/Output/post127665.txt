You do not have the necessary read, write and append privileges on the selected network backup disk <body> I have OSX Server running on a mac mini in my home.  I've been using it for doing Time Machine backups from my MacBook.  This worked fine until I changed the password for my user account on the mac mini.  At that point, backups on my laptop started failing, indicating that I needed to update the password that the laptop was storing for the mac mini.  However, when I try to do so (at strongSystem Preferences  Time Machine  Select Backup Disk.../strong), I get the following error:     "You do not have the necessary read, write and append privileges on the   selected network backup disk."   The laptop is running OSX 10.9, and the mac mini is running OSX 10.8.  Has anyone using OSX Server for backups experienced something similar to this? Does anyone know how to fix it (without losing all of my previous backups)?  <answer127666> I still don't know what caused the issue to come up in the first place, but I was able to get around it by going to strongServer.app  File Sharing  [my backup volume]  Edit Share Point.../strong and then adding my user to the strongAccess/strong section of the page with Read &amp; Write permissions.  I don't know how/why it worked before or why changing the user password caused it to stop working, but doing the above gets around the issue.  <answer209394> If you've previously connected to said network drive before and are having trouble reconnecting, it's possible, the folder where the time machine back-up resides is locked. I would try navigating to the network folder, look for "TimeMachineBackup" and if you see a locked logo on the folder, simply right click - get info, and uncheck the locked box, then try initiating the time machine to use the network drive again.
