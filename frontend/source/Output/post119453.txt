Automated production of bibliography from pdfs <body> Over the years I have carelessly scattered academic articles (almost invariably pdfs) over my file system. There are also all kinds of other scattered pdfs that are not academic articles.  ol liIs it possible to search for and find (most of) those pdfs that are articles/reprints from (academic) journals? I don't mind a few false negatives and false positives./li liOnce I have a list of pdfs that are articles, I would like to have an automated way of producing a bibliography, for example an EndNote bibliography or a JabRef bibliography./li /ol  Has anyone compiled and used a program called "pdf-extract"? Would that be helpful?   <comment139335> Look at an app called "Papers" that stores PDFs and journals. http://www.papersapp.com/mac/ <comment140053> Thanks, Chris. I've looked at reviews of "Papers for Mac", such as http://blog.macademic.org/2013/10/18/papers-3-a-step-in-the-wrong-direction/ and they are not enthusiastic. I'm going to look into Sente. Also I think EndNote can do what I want---the university has a site licence.
