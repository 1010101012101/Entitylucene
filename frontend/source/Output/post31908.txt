Verify a CD/DVD from ISO <body> Is there a tool (preferably free) in OS X that will allow me to verify that an ISO was written to a CD or DVD correctly? I want a tool that can do that without going through the burn first.  If there's a tool that can be used from the command line, that's fine too.  <answer31909> You have two choices that I can see if you don't want to re-burn and re-verify.  ol liMount the ISO and the DVD and do a recursive diff of the two file systems. For example, if the DVD is code/Volumes/DVD/code and the ISO is code/Volumes/ISO/code then:  codediff --recursive /Volumes/DVD /Volumes/ISO/code/li liCompare the MD5 sums of all the data on the two images. So:  codemd5 original.iso/code  codedd if=/dev/disk1 bs=2048 count=169383 | md5/code/li /ol  I'd take option #2 over #1 personally, though both are less than great ways to do a comparison.  You could also try exploiting codersync/code to do the comparison instead of using codediff/code. If you ran codersync/code with the code--checksum/code, code--recursive/code and code--dry-run/code options what you'd get back is a list of transfers that rsync thinks it needs to make to make the two file trees look the same.  <comment168809> Thanks! Note for people using option 2: open Disk Utility and unmount the DVD volume first, otherwise `dd` will report that `/dev/disk1` is busy.
