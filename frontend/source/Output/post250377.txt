What is this package 'com.comyp.pkg.sfinst ' <body> Somehow my macbook is infected by 'strongTrovi/strong' malware &amp; I am not able to remove it. So I decided to check all the packages installed.  'strongcom.comyp.pkg.sfinst/strong' was in the list of installed packages.  I did not find any results for 'strongcom.comyp.pkg.sfinst/strong' on google. So can anyone tell me what is this package installed for?
