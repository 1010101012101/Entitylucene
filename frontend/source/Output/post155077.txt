How to find ip address of Iphone connected to Mac <body> I want to find IP Address of Iphone which is connected through usb to my Mac.  Kindly note that Mac and Iphone are on different networks.   I used ideviceinfo which gives me the Iphone MAC address. I did not have any luck finding IP address from MAC address either.  <answer155086> If you are on a WiFi network, go to the strongSettings/strong app, then strongWi-Fi/strong.  On the Wi-Fi screen, touch the circled-i to the right of your connected network, and the IP of your phone will be displayed along with some other network information.  <comment182595> Yes i know that, but that does not solve my problem. I want to get IP address of IPhone **from Mac machine**
