Will Terminal show a progress bar when I copy with "cp"? <body> Is is possible to display a progress bar when copying files in Terminal using cp?  <answer19123> precode#!/bin/sh    strace -q -ewrite cp -- "${1}" "${2}" 2&gt;&amp;1 \       | awk '{         count += $NF             if (count % 10 == 0) {                percent = count / total_size * 100                printf "%3d%% [", percent                for (i=0;i&lt;=percent;i++)                   printf "="                printf "&gt;"                for (i=percent;i&lt;100;i++)                   printf " "                printf "]\r"             }          }          END { print "" }' total_size=$(stat -c '%s' "${1}") count=0 /code/pre  It's not perfect, but it works... drop that in a directory path and name it something similar..   <answer19150> You can use rsync instead.  precodersync --progress /copy/from /copy/to /code/pre  <answer156332> If you are copying large files or directories using cp, you can open up 'Activity Monitor', go to the 'Disk' tab and look for the process 'cp'. Here you can keep track of how many bytes have been written since the last boot, giving you a rough idea of the progress. (OS X 10.10).  Hope that helps!  <answer275224> During codecp/code, kbdCtrl/kbdkbdT/kbd displays the current percentage (on macOS at least)  <comment20937> â€¦you could also consider using `rsync` instead. <comment21113> Wait...how do I get that to run??? <comment21115> Speedwise, which is faster, rsync or cp? <comment21116> If all files being copied do not exist in the destination I don't think there will be a noticeable difference. If some of the files do exist in the destination then it will vary because rsync does some checking. Rsync will usually (but not always) be faster in that case. <comment118852> I don't recall whether OS X had an `strace` command at the time this answer was written (July 2011), but it definitely doesn't today. <comment368141> Using `rsync -P /copy/from /copy/to` is equivalent to `rsync --partial --progress /copy/from /copy/to` which will display the copy progress, as well as resume the transfer if it is disconnected.
