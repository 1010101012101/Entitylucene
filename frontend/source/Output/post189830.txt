How can I select an item from the icon bar alongside the menu bar using only keyboard keys? <body> I have intermittent problems using a built-in MacBook mouse (another story), and need to select the Bluetooth icon from the menu bar using only the keyboard:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QuNVD.png" alt="enter image description here"  It appears that the shortcut keys kbdCtrl-F2/kbd (or kbdCtrl-Fn-F2/kbd) allows me to navigate to the menu bar (it selects the Apple menu initially), but kbdRight/kbd doesn't allow me to navigate to the icon bar.  How can I get there and select an item from that icon using only the keyboard?  <answer189832> I just figured this out. The answer is kbdCtrl-F8/kbd (at least by default, assuming no shortcut customisation), or on some keyboards kbdCtrl-Fn-F8/kbd.  <answer189866> You might find this post useful: http://lifehacker.com/321595/access-the-dock-and-menu-bar-from-your-keyboard     Access your menu bar and launch dock items from the comfort of your keyboard with the Ctrl-F2 (menu bar) and Ctrl-F3 (dock) shortcuts.   And how to select an item:     You can use the arrow keys to navigate if you prefer, but on the menu bar, for example, there aren't trigger letters for each item like Windows menus offer. Instead, just start typing the name of the menu bar item you want (for example, Edit) and then hit Enter once it's selected. You can then repeat this for actions within the drop-down menu.   Extra tip:     If these shortcuts don't work for you, you may either need to use Ctrl-Fn-F2/F3 or enable them with Ctrl-F1 (or Ctrl-Fn-F1).   <comment225351> Thanks. Those key combinations don't allow you to access the icon bar, though. <comment306478> Thanks. Those key chords were exactly the ones I wanted.
