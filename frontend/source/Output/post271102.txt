Restricted Messaging <body> My daughter has an iphone and I would like to restrict when and who she can text with.  I'm aware that you can turn off the messaging completely but that's not wanted.  Is there a way to only allow texting to and from specific numbers.   <answer271103> You can't restrict strongMessages/strong by person/number.  You can only turn strongMessages/strong emoff/em or emon/em.  This site can show you how to do that while using Restrictions to prevent your daughter from making changes.  There are some 3rd-party applications that might be able to do what you want.  Search the App Store for messaging apps that have that feature.
