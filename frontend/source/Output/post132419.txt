Has a Graphics Driver or Something for Intel HD 3000 Been Changed in Mavericks 10.9.3? <body> So I updated to Mavericks 10.9.3 and didn't really thing anything of it, it just said security updates. After playing a few games and working on my project with OpenGL, I've noticed that performance was significantly lower. I've had my computer for 3 years, and it wasn't out of the question I had downloaded so much shit that it finally decided to bod it down. I backed up the drive, erased it, and did a fresh install. It actually seems to be running quite a bit faster than before, which is great, but the OpenGL problem didn't really improve. I haven't tried it with third party games yet because I need my computer and can't download 20+ gigs of games, but I noticed blender seems to also have a bit of a lower frame rate. That raises the question, did apple do something to the drivers or something to effect only OpenGL?  Here are my system specs incase anyone is wondering: OSX 10.9.3 2.3 GHz Intel Core i5 4 GB 1333 MHz DDR3  Intel HD Graphics 3000 384 MB 13-inch MBP Early 2011  Blender could be just preforming normally, theres no FPS counter and I could just be such a bad programmer I screwed something up to cause the performance to drop, I don't know. If anyone could provide any insight, I would be very grateful. Thanks.  <comment155741> What is the exact OpenGL problem you are experiencing? Also, I highly recommend you download [Open GL Extensions Viewer](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/opengl-extensions-viewer/id444052073?mt=12) if you want to test your machines capabilities and get some hard numbers to go by. It's a great program.
