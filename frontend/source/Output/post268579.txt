Why does this external hard disk not disappear? <body> I have a Western Digital external hard drive. It has 2 partitions: codeWD Time Machine/code, formatted as HFS+ and encrypted, and codeData/code, formatted as exFAT. When I eject the disk and unplug the cable, nothing looks wrong. But when I look in Disk Utility, something strange appears:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/d5gf8.png" alt="Disk"  The disk is definitely physically unplugged from the MacBook. The output of codediskutil list/code is:  precode/dev/disk0 (internal, physical):    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *121.3 GB   disk0    1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1    2:          Apple_CoreStorage Macintosh HD            80.4 GB    disk0s2    3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s3    4:       Microsoft Basic Data                         39.6 GB    disk0s4    5:           Windows Recovery                         471.9 MB   disk0s5  /dev/disk1 (internal, virtual):    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:                            Macintosh HD           +80.0 GB    disk1                                  Logical Volume on disk0s2                                  F26AD7A0-4D62-4081-9B74-4D7BB1D9E08B                                  Unlocked Encrypted  /dev/disk2 (external, physical):    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *1.0 TB     disk2    1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk2s1    2:          Apple_CoreStorage WD Time Machine         450.6 GB   disk2s2    3:                 Apple_Boot Boot OS X               134.2 MB   disk2s3    4:       Microsoft Basic Data Data                    419.4 GB   disk2s4  /dev/disk3 (external, virtual):    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:                            WD Time Machine        +450.2 GB   disk3                                  Logical Volume WD Time Machine on disk2s2                                  A8C50A3A-89F2-4F80-9F09-4B557AD4A583                                  Locked Encrypted /code/pre  When I replug the drive, only the codeData/code exFAT partition mounts. In Disk Utility, the "ghost" drive is still there, but the real drive only appears to have one partition - the codeData/code partition. I've ejected that drive and unplugged it, and now I have this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/oO8UJ.png" alt="Double Drives"  Restarting the computer removes these fake drives. However it is very inconvenient to restart the computer every time this happens (especially because it's fairly common). I also have a SeaGate drive, but I've never had this problem on that drive. Also, when under Boot Camp in Windows, and I use this disk, there are no issues (although, the codeWD Time Machine/code partition doesn't "mount" in Windows because it's encrypted). Any ideas?
