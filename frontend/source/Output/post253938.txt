Three finger drag not working in Safari 10 <body> I've noticed that three finger drag does not work in the latest Safari.  I used to be able to select text or pan in Google Maps easily. Now I have to push finger.  Outside Safari it works as usual.  I use BetterTouchTool if that makes any difference. Old school glass trackpad with click.  <answer254360> Make sure to update to the latest version of BetterTouchTool. Everything = 1.86 should be compatible with Sierra.  <comment316135> So is your question about BetterTouchTool not working properly or macOS not recognizing the gesture? <comment316249> No. This is a built in OS X feature that does not work.
