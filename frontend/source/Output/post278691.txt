Is there a way to programmatically change macOS display resolution? <body> I've trying to find a way to programmatically set my display resolution, but I can't seem to find a way. codedefaults/code at least doesn't seem to control it.  I'd prefer an answer that doesn't rely on AppleScript.  <comment350772> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10596489/programmatically-change-resolution-os-x
