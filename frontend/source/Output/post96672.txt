How to send "delayed" sms? <body> Instead of sending an SMS emright now/em, I would like to send a "delayed" SMS. For example, delay it by 45 minutes, or 60 minutes, etc.  Is there any way to do it?  I have tried the apps txtot, FutureText, and SMS Scheduler, but they don't work. The default iPhone "Messages" app cannot receive SMSes sent by these apps.  <answer97905> Without jailbreak what you ask isn't possible. Third party Apps from the App Store can't access the SMS service.   With a jailbreak there seems to be apps on the Cydia Store that have this function. Like strongFuture SMS/strong.  <answer99148> you should try txtot+ it works, and it free to try!  <answer99158> If you are going to jailbreak your iPhone, I can strongly suggest biteSMS. It supports schedules texting among many other things. A killer app!  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/70QSC.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer116242> Try Joopz.com, works great and you don't have to jail break your phone.  <answer230366> The RemindMe service offers a text scheduler that does what you need:     Create SMS appointment reminders for specific events at a date and time specified by you. You can schedule text messages as a once off reminder or for recurring events.   <comment116544> It doesn't work.

What steps did you take to send the delayed SMS? <comment281222> That's true, but it somewhat clunkyâ€“it's designed as a calendar app, not as an automated SMS service.
