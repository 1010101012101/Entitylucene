Keyboard shortcuts for renaming file and accepting extension <body> When I try to rename a file (by pressing enter, then changing the extension of the file), it pops up with an alert asking "Are you sure you want to change the extensions ... " and the old extension is selected in blue. I haven't found a keyboard shortcut for selecting the new extension from the popup alert. Is there a way? I need to rename dozens of files, and doing it all through the keyboard would be so much quicker than selecting this one alert with a mouse.   <answer25627> There is no keyboard equivelant that I am aware of...  You could however use the terminal to make your life a little easier. If you need to rename the files one at a time, use the command   precodemv orig_file_name.ext new_file_name.newext /code/pre  <answer25760> After trial-and-error, figured it out. It's kbd&#x2318;/kbd+kbdU/kbd.  <answer25761> Those buttons highlighted in blue (e.g in your case "keep old") press enter; for those button with a blue background (e.g in your case "Use ...") press space bar.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1cgkY.png" alt="Extension Text Box"  <answer25763> You can disable the prompt under Finder's Preferences (see picture below):  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/SAK0w.png" alt="enter image description here"  This might save you some time if you are renaming multiple files. Additionally, you may want to look at Rename. It is a free utility that should serve you well for such simple batch renaming.  <answer96429> In Mountain Lion, kbdâŒ˜/kbd + kbdA/kbd works like a charm  <comment29247> I discovered Cmd-U works for accepting the file extension change. <comment29248> Make sure that you have full keyboard access set to "All Controls" - ctrl + F7 toggles this feature <comment29947> Nice!   I will have to try that.
