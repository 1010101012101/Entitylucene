One Apple ID and notifications <body> I recently upgraded my iPhone 4 to an iPhone 5. At the same time we purchased an iPhone 5 for my wife. We are using the same Apple IDs, which I have set up over a year ago. Everything seems to work ok except for one thing, notifications: I don’t seem to be able to get notifications on my iPhone, but my wife, whose notification settings are the same as mine, does get them.    For example, we’re both set up the same way for USA Today but she is the only one who gets the news notifications. Does the same Apple ID allow for only one phone to be notified? Is there a way to correct this?  <comment81271> Your Apple ID has nothing to do with notifications. Are you having the issue only with USA Today or other apps too?
