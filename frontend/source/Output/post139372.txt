Can Find My Mac be disabled on a stolen MacBook without a password? <body> My friend had his MacBook stolen from his house but he didn't have a password on his MacBook so if the thief logged out of his iCloud can it still be tracked since he already put a lock on it?  If he deletes the iCloud account while the MacBook isn't connected to Wi-Fi can he still track it if the MacBook connects to Wi-Fi?  <answer139435> ol liNo, not without the original password/li liNo, but you can sign into your icloud account from a different device and track the computer/li /ol  <answer164703>    Can Find My Mac be disabled on a stolen MacBook without a password?    Yes, it could be done also on MacBook with account password.  If you don't have configured a password to choose boot options the thief is able to delete all your content, without having your root password. He can simply:  ol liDo not connect your Mac in internet./li liTurn on Mac pressing kbdCmd/kbd+kbdS/kbd to enter in CLI mode./li liChange your admin account password (I have intentionally omitted details on this step)./li liLogout./li liLogin using your account with his password./li liDisable all services related to iCloud, so disable Find My Mac./li /ol  In this case you're unable to locate your Mac and the thief is also able to reinstall from zero the Mac OS X.  <comment164347> possible duplicate of [Lost my Macbook pro with retina display.
