What does the "4G" that appears on my iPhone 4S's AT&T network indicator mean? <body> Since upgrading my iPhone 4S to iOS 5.1 (from 5.0.1), the AT&amp;T network status indicator now reads "4G" where it once read "3G". What has changed from the previous version? Does this "4G" mean the same thing as it does on the "new iPad"?  <answer43087> It means that you are connected on HSPA+. It's actually a 3G technology, and unfortunately, you probably won't experience any speed increase in downloading or surfing.  The 4G technology for the "new iPad" is LTE, and is much faster than the existing 3G band.  4G iPhone On AT&amp;T? New Network Indicator Causes Controversy   <answer43091> h1Nomenclature/h1  The terms strong2G/strong, strong3G/strong and strong4G/strong do not refer to a emspecific/em wireless standard, but a a whole embunch/em of different standards:   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mkXnh.png" alt="enter image description here"  There has been controversy on what standards should be referred to as strong4G/strong. When Apple introduced the iPhone 4S, they followed other companies in referring to HSDPA as a strong4G/strong standard. HSPA+ is the successor to HSDPA.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Rwrpy.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  h1DC-HSPA+/h1  Technically, strongHSDPA/strong and strongHSPA+/strong are strong3G/strong wireless standards. However, HSPA+ has received technological upgrades which increased the theoretical throughput to become similar to that of strongLTE/strong.  strongIf 4G were to indicate speed rather than a wireless standard, it's legitimate to refer to the upgraded HSPA+ as 4G/strong. However, this improved HSPA+ should be referred to as strongDC-HSPA+/strong, not merely HSPA+.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vPkAy.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer43107> The 5.1 update provides a labeling change for iPhone 4S users - "3G" is now "4G". As the other answerers have noted, HSPA+ is technically considered a 4G technology. A MacWorld article states:      The strong4G label/strong in iOS 5.1 instead reflects AT&amp;T’s perspective, namely   that strongthe carrier’s HSPA+ network (also known as Evolved High-Speed   Packet Access) qualifies as 4G technology/strong. Carriers tend to refer to both HSPA+ and LTE—the cellular network technology built into the new iPad—as 4G, though the inner workings of the technologies are vastly different.   The new iPad, however, uses LTE, a different 4G technology. There's more information about the differences between LTE and 3G in this MacWorld article.  <comment49002> Basically everything to do with cell networks is a mess, and the indicators on the status bar are an indication of speed, ie if it says 4G things will download faster than if it says 3G.
