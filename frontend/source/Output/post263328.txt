Zoom content not screen with Magic Mouse <body> many windows users used to use kbdControl/kbd + kbdMouse Scroll Wheel/kbd for zooming in and out.  But in codemacOS/code this doesn't work. I can zoom with gestures using touchpad, but I mostly use codeMagic Mouse/code.  There is an option to enable zooming screen, but not the content in codeAccessibility/code settings. This is not what I am trying to get.  kbdCommand/kbd + kbd+/kbd on the other hand works in some applications (in most applications I need), but this is keyboard combination, is there any way to get the same result as kbdCommand/kbd + kbd+/kbd but with Magic Mouse Scroll ?   I would be grateful for any help.  Thanks  <answer263329> Sorry,i never saw Content before(too rush),,codeCMD/code + Magic mouse scroll in most cases doesn't increase the font size, 'zoom' in. Increasing the font size system wide isn't possible without setting it specifically for Applications (if you know the menu title) in keyboard shortcuts. However, you can emulate a system wide zoom in level with a double tap of the mouse (using magic mouse) by turning that system feature on in:  codeSystem Preferences/code  codeMouse/code  codeSmart Zoom/code  But still Incase of screen,,Go to codeSystem Preferences/code  codeAccessibility/code, and in the list on the left click the item code"Zoom"/code.  Then make sure that feature is enabled (checkmarked) in the pane on the right, and that Control has been set as the codemodifier/code.  Then Just hold down the [control] key, then slide your finger to the top or bottom of the mouse, and youâ€™ll zoom in and out just like you would with a mouse scroll wheel.  Hope this solves your problem!
