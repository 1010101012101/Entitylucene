Start docker in background at boot <body> I would like to autostart a docker container in the background at boot. I do not want it to start at login, but at boot (to serve a HTTP interface to all my colleagues on the LAN) before/without anyone logging in. I have tried to start the Docker App using a file in code/Library/LaunchDaemons/code, but it seems like the Docker App requires the user to be logged in first.  When googling, I get a lot of solutions for old VirtualBox style Docker, but I would prefer to use the official (xhyve) docker.  Running MacOS 10.12.1. Docker installed by just downloading the Docker App dmg from Stable channel.  <answer259390> *    strongemUnder construction/em/strong      Docker for Mac is launched sandboxed (or not, if disabled in the Docker prefs) while logging in by a LogInItem in the application bundle probably using this HelperApp method.  This is the reason why neither a launch agent nor a login item (in System Preferences  User &amp; Groups  $USER  Login Item) is available.  hr  Probably it's very costly to impossible to launch a user owned sandboxed container &amp; webserver image to serve the wanted HTTP interface.   Maybe it's possible by using a classical method and installing xhyve &amp; docker-machine-driver-xhyve with homebrew instead of a VirtualBox solution and linking the boot/user Docker environment and the user Docker environment.  <comment323573> Did you install xhyve and probably docker-machine-driver-xhyve with homebrew? <comment323959> @klanomath, no I downloaded this dmg: https://download.docker.com/mac/stable/Docker.dmg and drag-and-drop:ed Docker into my Applications. <comment324522> Please add a link to one of the ***"lot of solutions for old VirtualBox style Docker"*** which fits your need.
