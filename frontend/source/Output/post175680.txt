Undo changed Calendar event <body> I spent some time entering a Calendar event on my Mac. I was viewing on my iPhone, and somehow "moved" it around. Can I undo this?   <comment207277> that depends, if you did not do anything after the "move" you could undo. <comment207279> @Buscarì›ƒ How do you undo on the iPhone? I couldn't seem to find any such option. <comment207281> Shake the phone (yes, I'm serious) and a popup appears asking you to undo. <comment207282> If it's to late, maybe use timemachine on your mac if you have it configured.
