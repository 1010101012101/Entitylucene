Can I undo changes made via "defaults write"? <body> I've been messing with Bluetooth audio settings to try to keep my Bluetooth speakers from popping by changing settings via codedefaults write/code, but I'm afraid I've made the problem worse.  I'd like to revert to the defaultâ€¦ defaults, bringing them back to where they were originally or, more specifically, where they would be for a new user account or new system.  Is this as simple as using codedefaults delete/code on the appropriate domain and key?  <answer102470> Yes, usually you can just use codedefaults delete/code. If for example you have run codedefaults write -g NSScrollAnimationEnabled -bool false/code, you can undo the changes by running codedefaults delete -g NSScrollAnimationEnabled/code or codedefaults write -g NSScrollAnimationEnabled -bool true/code (and by reopening applications to apply the changes).  Even if the preference key had some value before you used codedefaults/code, it shouldn't matter if you delete the key. It is generally safe to delete preference keys or even complete files, and they can usually be recreated by OS X or applications.  The property lists modified by codedefaults/code are stored in directories like code~/Library/Preferences//code, code~/Library/Containers/com.apple.mail/Data/Library/Preferences//code, or code~/Library/Preferences/ByHost//code. You can edit a plist in a text editor after converting it to XML with codeplutil -convert xml1/code.  <comment120692> Thanks for the advice.  In my case, I found the `.plist` for `com.apple.BluetoothAudioAgent` and removed it, which eventually resulted in the default defaults finding their way back after disabling and enabling Bluetooth audio a few times.
