Keyboard remapping in Lion? <body> I've used keyremap4macbook for the last few years to turn the right Alt key into a forward delete. Unfortunately, the tool has stopped working in Lion.  Does anybody know of a keyboard remapper that already works in Lion?  <answer18219> Turns out I had an old version.  The new, officially Lion compatible version from the keyremap4macbook homepage works fine.  <comment19648> I'm in the same boat, only worse. I have a Japanese keyboard, and the default keymapping doesn't work in the terminal. The backslash key (Â¥) produces a unknown-symbol box in the terminal. This is actually one of the big things preventing me from upgrading. <comment19699> I imagine keyremap4macbook will be updated soon for Lion. <comment19848> Wait, never mind. I just installed Lion anyways, and keyremap4macbook seemed to work fine. What problem are you having? <comment19872> @Fake Name: It just doesn't work. I can see the prefPane, but I can't make any changes (they revert as soon as the mouse button goes up again), and the only setting I had (Alt - Forward delete) is not set anymore. I'll try reinstalling it. <comment19877> @Fake Name: You were right, it worked. I think I had a really old version installed, and for whatever reason didn't see on the homepage that there were newer versions.
