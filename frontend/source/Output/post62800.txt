Mysterious hard disk space vanishing? <body> I'm running Snow Leopard on a Late 2009 unibody MacBook.  At the moment I was trying to do some late spring cleaning, and clearing up some HDD space. Now here's the weird part:  My User's folder shows that it occupies 179 GB of space. However when I go into the folder and add up the usage of all sub-folders and files within it, it comes to somewhere about 75GB.   I'm just very curious as to where the other 104 GB resides.   Any help would be appreciated!  Thanks!  <answer62849> Might I suggest using one of the myriad apps available at your disposal to hunt down and find the rogue files that plague you? An excellent option that I found (and free to display the content, though not to delete from within the app) would be the DaisyDisk app. It'll show you exactly what's using up your space in a relatively intuitive/futuristic display.  From there, it's a little matter of simply deleting the files in question.  <comment72468> Could it be files in ~/.Trash/ or ~/Library/? How did you get the size of the home folder and the combined sizes? Do they match `du -sh ~`? <comment72473> In addition to the good comment above to check actual disk usage, I would want to run disk utility and verify the catalog and other file system structures to be sure that isn't causing the discrepancy. <comment72501> Could this be related to TimeMachine--local backups not transferred yet? <comment72503> "ephsmith There is no local backups on 10.6. It was only introduced in 10.7 <comment72513> And ~/Library is visible in 10.6 as well.  But there are still invisible folders to take into account. <comment72518> Thanks guys! It turns out that a folder called ".nx" (NX Client Folder) was hidden, and was eating up almost 80 GB of space). I used OmniDiskCleaner to find that out. <comment72519> Thanks! I used OmniDiskClearner to get to the problem.
