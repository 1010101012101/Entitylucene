Eject (not unmount) USB devices via terminal (SSH), and redetect a USB device after ejecting <body> Other than right click the device and select eject (this is not unmount, because it completely delete the device in codediskutil/code), and then replug the device, is there a way to do this via terminal?  For example, if I eject a USB Mass Storage device, it will be removed from codediskutil list/code output. I can find it again via codeioreg -p IOUSB -l -w 0/code with output as such:  precodeMass Storage@1d160000  &lt;class AppleUSBDevice, id 0x1000009d8, registered, matched, active, busy 0 (1 ms), retain 14&gt;     {       "sessionID" = 8439571007835       "iManufacturer" = 1       "bNumConfigurations" = 1       "idProduct" = 25479       "bcdDevice" = 262       "Bus Power Available" = 250       "USB Address" = 2       "bMaxPacketSize0" = 64       "iProduct" = 2       "iSerialNumber" = 3       "bDeviceClass" = 0       "Built-In" = No       "locationID" = 487981056       "bDeviceSubClass" = 0       "bcdUSB" = 512       "USB Product Name" = "Mass Storage"       "PortNum" = 6       "non-removable" = "no"       "IOCFPlugInTypes" = {"9dc7b780-9ec0-11d4-a54f-000a27052861"="IOUSBFamily.kext/Contents/PlugIns/IOUSBLib.bundle"}       "bDeviceProtocol" = 0       "IOUserClientClass" = "IOUSBDeviceUserClientV2"       "IOPowerManagement" = {"DevicePowerState"=0,"CurrentPowerState"=3,"CapabilityFlags"=65536,"MaxPowerState"=4,"DriverPowerState"=3}       "kUSBCurrentConfiguration" = 1       "Device Speed" = 2       "USB Vendor Name" = "Generic"       "idVendor" = 1423       "IOGeneralInterest" = "IOCommand is not serializable"       "USB Serial Number" = "29FEA949"       "IOClassNameOverride" = "IOUSBDevice"     } /code/pre
