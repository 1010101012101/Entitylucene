NO audio on macbook air 2010 <body> so I have my macbook air (late 2010) and it has been working fine for a good while, now all of a sudden for no reason (Ok i may of dropped it but the drop was less than 1 foot and mac showed no damage after) but the speakers dont work and when i plug my 'kotion each' (headphones) into the port the audio symbol is grey and no audio ANYWHERE.  yes I have tried to wiggle the headphones and have looked many other places no luck...  <answer236984> A drop is a drop - 1 foot or 10 feet - you dropped it.    More than likely, you broke something on the I/O Board  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bYPRt.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  This goes for around $70 on Amazon.  I just purchased one to fix a friends 2012 MBA and it was super easy to fix.  You just have to remove the back cover and one screw holds this board in place.  It removes pretty easily.  <answer236985> Reboot your mac. thats all... really...
