How to turn off Mac's sounds by default? <body> In some situations I would open my macbook in a public place or library, and I still have something open that produces sound, such as music or a chat program giving notifications. I would like to have my sound be muted by default when I open the lid. Anyway to achieve this?  <answer204993> Have you tried muting the sound?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pNXNY.png" alt="enter image description here"  Muting the sound before closing the lid and/or rebooting will keep the sound muted.  I also found this: Mute volume of macbook on sleep  <answer204997> Control Plane is ideal for this sort contextual computing. It's a free, open source app in which you can configure a context. For example a context 'library'. In that context certain rules apply (i.e. mute device). The context can be automatically triggered by numerous things (i.e. sleep/wake event, connected wifi, running applications, ...)  It is useful in many other situations as well, I use this app extensively.  Here is how you can configure Control Plane to do what you asked for:  ol liCreate a new context and give it an appropriate name (i.e. emmuted/em) img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/SwSNd.png" alt="Contexts view in Control Plane"/li liUnder emEvidence Sources/em make sure emSleep/Wake Event/em is checked/li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6cPkc.png" alt="List of evidence sources in Control Plane"  ol start="3" liUnder emRules/em add a new emSleep/Wake Event Rule/em and set it so when system goes to sleep it activates the emmuted/em context with the confidence slider set to 100%./li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/VxHpb.png" alt="New Sleep/Wake Event rule"  ol start="4" liUnder emActions/em add a emMute/em action (emSound and Music Actions  Mute/em). Set it so that system is muted on arrival at context emmuted/em./li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/CY6c4.png" alt="New Mute action in Control Plane"  There you go. You could of course make the context switch to emMuted/em more intelligent by using and combining different rules (each with its own confidence level).  <comment247190> I want my sound to be automatically muted. I know how to mute the sound in general. <comment247191> Ok, I edited the answer with a link to something similar. <comment247192> Thanks, maybe this is too much a duplicate?
