How can I stream audio to multiple computers at the same time? <body> I'm trying to stream music to different computer's speakers simultaneously. Currently I'm doing this by physically timing the start of the song on each computer.   Are there any built in utilities or applescripts that will sync one instance of a song on two devices? I'll resort to commercial options if necessary but I'd prefer some nifty scripting.  I have a 2006 Intel iMac and a 2012 Macbook Air.  <answer91829> You can combine AirPlay in iTunes 11 and up with something like AirSever to accomplish this with good results and very little effort. (Note: For more options on how to turn your Mac in to an AirPlay receiver please see: Can I use a Mac Mini as an Airplay audio receiver?)  Install the AirPlay receiver software of your choice on the machine you want to stream audio emto/em.  Start iTunes on the machine you want to stream audio emfrom/em. In the upper left hand corner of iTunes, right next to the volume slider, you'll see the output device selection icon. It looks like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DLvNK.png" alt="Output device selection icon"  Press it and select the "Multiple" tab at the top of the screen. Select both "Computer" (which is the computer you're running iTunes on) and the name AirServer machine from the list.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ldopI.png" alt="Multiple output device selection"  Play something in iTunes and should play, simultaneously, on both machines.  <answer91872> I've been using Airfoil to do this for years.  Only one Mac needs to have the music: it is streamed across the network to the other.  You need a reasonably well performing network for this to work well: sometimes my WiFi plays up and the audio can get a little out of sync as a result.  For me, it works best when using their software on both Macs (Airfoil on one, Airfoil Speakers on the other).  There is a small delay when you press play before the music starts, to enable a buffer to be built up.  <answer151513> You can use VLC (free, open source, cross-platform): it has a feature to stream music/video across your local network, thereby allowing to be used to stream audio to multiple computers at the same time.    Guide:     ol   liDownload VLC media player /li   liInstall VLC on each computer you plan on streaming to or from./li   liOpen VLC on the main computer (the computer which has the files you want to stream). This computer will control all the streaming and file   playing./li   liClick File, then Wizard. Select Stream to Network, then click next./li   liOn the input screen you can either use what is currently in the playlist or a saved file. You can select music files, video files,   discs, or even playlists. I chose to use a playlist. /li   /ol      img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/K4ep6.jpg" alt="enter image description here"      img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0JTi6.jpg" alt="enter image description here"      ol start="6"   liOn the streaming screen select RTP Multicast. Next fill in the address you will be using. I used 239.255.100.100. Click next./li   /ol      img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7S6WQ.png" alt="enter image description here"      ol start="7"   liOn the Encapsulation format use whatever is already selected, and then proceed to the next screen./li   liOn Additional Streaming Options in the Time-to-Live option put the number of how many routers you have. For example I have two routers,   one wired, and one wireless so I would put 2 in./li   liClick Finish to start streaming. Note you will not hear the file playing, because we need to connect to the stream, which is the next   step./li   liOpen another instance of VLC. (You can do this on the same computer or different one.)/li   liClick File, Open Network Stream, and then choose UDP/RTP Multicast. Enter the address from step #6 (239.255.100.100) and leave   the port numbers alone. Click Ok and then you should hear/see the   music/video being played (may take a few seconds). Do this step for   each computer that wants to watch/listen./li   /ol      img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gQ7Bk.png" alt="enter image description here"   <comment107860> Found an app called [Soundfly](http://www.abyssoft.com/software/soundfly/), but so far I can only get it to stream to the other computer, not play on both. <comment107918> Not allowed to upvote yet, but *upvote* <comment369642> i am able to stream audio successfully with above method. I've used Udp method for this instead of rtp. I'm facing this issue: :https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45089287/vlc-udp-stream-stops-after-any-interrupt-or-track-change-in-lan-in-mac-os
