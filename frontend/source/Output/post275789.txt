Resizing preview pane in Finder column view <body> When dragging the border of a Finder window in column view with preview visible to resize it, it seems arbitrary whether Apple will take or make space by adjusting the preview pane size or by showing more or less of the ancestor columns.  Is there a way to resize just the preview pane?   Is there a way to show more or less of the columns while keeping the size of the preview pane?  <comment346990> There's a kludgy fix, option-drag one column smaller, then drag the window bigger. That's the best I know;  if it will do, I'll post as an answer if no-one comes up with a better fix. <comment347026> @Tetsujin Thanks for offering something to try. It didn't work for me.
