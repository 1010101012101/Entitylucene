Newly added images not showing in "Desktop Pictures" <body> I have just bought myself a new Mac and am finding the new OS a little alien at present.  I've just downloaded a new background screen and moved it to the /Library/Desktop Pictures/ folder.  However when I go to "System Preferences"-"Desktop&amp;Screen Saver" none of my newly downloaded images are showing up for me to choose a new background image.  Any idea why this is happening as I was told that that folder was the default location where all desktop background images are stored (NB: I do NOT want to leave my newly downloaded images in any other folder but the default one)  <answer153992> Rather than code/Library/Desktop Pictures//code try code~/Library/Desktop Pictures//codebr That's where mine seem to be stored.  Mac has 2 [or more] libraries, one for the whole system &amp; one for each user.br The tilde ~ is a shortcut for codeboot_drive/users/my_name//code - your Home folder.br [Think of it like using code%appdata%/code etc. from the Start menu in Windows]  The code/Library/code folder is hidden by default, but easily accessible.    Quickest way to get to it from the Finder is   ul likbd Cmd ⌘  /kbd kbd N /kbd for new window/li likbd Cmd ⌘  /kbd kbd Shift /kbd kbd G /kbd for Go.../li liCopy/paste code~/Library/code or code~/Library/Desktop Pictures//code in this particular case./li /ul  If you find that you need to access it more frequently, there are methods to show it permanently, but I'll leave that for another question.  strongemEdit/em/strongbr From discussion, this folder may not exist by default... so here's how to make then add to Desktop &amp; Screen Saver.  ul liOpen ~/Library then /li likbd Cmd ⌘  /kbd kbd Shift /kbd kbd N /kbd for New Folder. Name it Desktop Pictures. Drop your intended backgrounds in there./li liOpen System Prefs  Desktop &amp; Screen Saver/li liDrag the new Desktop pictures folder to 'Folders' in the list on the left of Desktop &amp; Screen Saver/li liIt should be immediately usable as a source./li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/TLsN3.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment181214> It appears that although ~/Library is there ~/Library/Desktop Pictures/ isn't.  I'm using Maverick on a Macbook Pro.  Here is what it shows when I try to go to that location: http://i.imgur.com/m6pXOT3.png <comment181221> hmm... interesting.. OK, adding to my answer so I can use pics... few ways to do it, this might be easiest.
