"Sign in to download from the App Store" with a different Apple ID <body> I am trying to update software on a Macbook. Before doing so, apparently I have to "Sign in to download from the App Store." It provides me with a form asking for an Apple ID and password to do so.  However, the Apple ID field already has an Apple ID in it, which is not the one I wish to use, and the field is disabled, so I can't change it.  Why is the field disabled? How do I enable it so I can change the Apple ID to sign in with?  <answer97557> It is disabled because each app downloaded from App Store has a receipt that links to one specific account.  And that app you wish to update is linked to the account that is already filled in for you.  If you wish to update the app with another account (assuming the app is purchased on both account), you will have to first delete the app, and install again.  <answer152762> Shane Hsu's answer is correct, but there is also another way to do it if you don't want to delete the app: There is one file for each app that contains the "receipt" for that app's previous download from the Mac App Store. The file is named codereceipt/code. Here is how to find it and move it to a different location, so that the Mac App Store will allow you to enter a different Apple ID:  Find the app in your code/Applications/code directory:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ya0Bg.png" alt="iPhoto"  Right-click, and choose "Show Package Contents":  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KvM9C.png" alt="Show Package Contents"  In the new window that has opened, double-click the codeContents/code folder to go into that folder.  You will now probably see a folder named code_MASReceipt/code. "MAS" stands for "Mac App Store." It should have a file inside of it named codereceipt/code:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jTLs3.png" alt="receipt"  Move the code_MASReceipt/code folder to the trash:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hlx5c.png" alt="Move to trash"  Now, close the Mac App Store and then launch it again. Hopefully, at this point, when you try to update the app, its Apple ID field will be empty.  If this doesn't work, you will probably want to put the code_MASReceipt/code folder back, by opening the Trash:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/T6zm8.png" alt="Put back"  <comment114449> Have you tried signing out of the store from the menu-store-sign out? <comment171278> what about apple default apps. Can't delete 'em. <comment222622> This is not the proper answer, see @Mike Morearty's response below. <comment254986> I did what you recommended and now I get another alert ```This update is not available for this Apple ID either because it was bought by a different user or the item was refunded or cancelled.```. Is there anyway to bypass that?
