Where I can find My Lists in the recent Foursquare v8 app? <body> After recent upgrade of Foursquare app (v8.0.2), all my Lists disappeared, so I can't find any method of accessing them from the iPhone app (I can still see them when accessing from the website).  Does it mean it's a bug, feature or managing of the lists are now depreciated?  <answer144788> I've asked the support and I've received the following answer:     Currently you can save to your to-do list on the Foursquare app.   Saving to other lists should be coming soon. Your lists are available   if you visit Foursquare and navigate to Profile  Saved Places. See   you existing lists by tapping on "See all of your saved lists."      To add to your list, simply go to a listing on Foursquare and hit   â€œSave." To remove, simple tap "Save" again. Keep in mind lists are   viewable to the public.
