Running a Service in QuickBooks <body> I have written a script that works on its own or when I run it from Automator. But when I add it as a service to QuickBooks I get and error message:  em"The action Run AppleScript encountered an error."/em  This is the script :  precodeactivate application "QuickBooks 2016" set windowtitle to the name of the front window of application "QuickBooks 2016" tell application "System Events"     tell process "QuickBooks"         click button "Print" of toolbar 1 of window windowtitle         click checkbox "Shrink report to fit page width" of tab group 1 of sheet 1 of window windowtitle         tell menu button "PDF" of sheet 1 of window windowtitle             click             --menu item 2 is "Save as a PDF"             click menu item 2 of menu 1         end tell     end tell end tell /code/pre  Any suggestions appreciated.
