How to open a file using Applescript? <body> Seems to be a very simple question, but i cannot find the answer in the many many documentation that is around on Applescript.  I have a non-scriptable application for which i want to open a file using the File Open dialog in the application. This is what i came up with so far:  precodetell application "CubicSDR"     activate end tell  tell application "System Events" to tell process "CubicSDR"     set position of window 2 to {-1920, -296}     set size of window 2 to {1635, 500}     click menu item "Open Session" of menu "File" of menu bar 1     ...... end tell /code/pre  Then i have tried to select a file, open a file, click a file, nothing seems to work. This can not be as hard as it seems considering that this is such a common operation. Does anybody have a code sample i can work off?  <answer258413> Here you go:  precodetell application "Mail" to open "Library:Desktop Pictures:Small Ripples graphite.png" /code/pre  Replace "Mail" and the file with the app and file you want to open your file with, respectively.  <comment327724> The application that needs to open the file apparently is not AppleScript enabled. So i have to do it through the System Events. <comment327743> @TonMachielsen thank you for letting me know that this way did not work with our specific application. What is the language your OS is set to? <comment330108> OSX is set to English (US).
