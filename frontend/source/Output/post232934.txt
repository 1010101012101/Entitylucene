Can automator run when Macbook lid is closed? <body> If i set an automator scrip to run each evening at 23:00 but my Macbook / Macbook Pro is closed (not off, but the lid has been closed) will / can the automator script still run ?   <answer232936> No, the Automator workflow will not run when your MacBook's lid is closed.  This is because your Mac is asleep and not actively running user applications and processes. You can prevent your Mac from sleeping when the lid is closed. Be aware that this is not recommended by Apple.
