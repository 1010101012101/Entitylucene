Parental Controls flooded system.log with errors <body> I was digging around for fun, and found that my codesystem.log/code was strongemflooded/em/strong with errors. Here is the output of codesudo cat system.log | tail -8/code:  precodeMar 19 15:33:06 THE-COMPUTER parentalcontrolsd[113]: -[ActivityTracker appDidLaunchOrBecomeFront:launched:] [1844:ezra] -- Got an error when saving MOC: Error Domain=NSCocoaErrorDomain Code=259 UserInfo=0x34dd00 "The file “events.data” couldn’t be opened because it isn’t in the correct format."

Also, they are going on all the time. Could anyone shed some light??  <answer89652> There is a sandboxing error where the process responsible for writing log files is running into the inability to write those files.  Three things could help:  ol liModifying your logging protocol to exclude that sender/li liTurning off that part of parental controls/li liUpgrading to a newer OS/li liFiling a bug report with Apple to get the underlying logic error corrected./li /ol  <answer103553> I had to remove the account with Parental Controls and stop using that feature. It became a CPU melter in my case. You may also want to upgrade to Mac OS X 10.6.8.  <comment56118> It might help to know which OS X version you are talking about. <comment56200> @SethNoble Snow Leopard (10.6.6) <comment56252> If possible, try updating to 10.6.8.  I don't know if that will fix it, but it will at least provide a better baseline. <comment81718> I have the same issue on 10.6.7. There are about 10 new messages per second. I can't even read my logs anymore.
