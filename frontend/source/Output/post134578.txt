Do splitters for mac combined mic/headphones exist? <body> I am looking for a splitter that turns my 3.5mm headphone and mic port on my Mac mini into two 3.5mm headphone and mic ports or one audio out port and one audio out/mic port.   I want to be able to leave my speakers plugged in and use my headphones/mic at the the same time. I will turn off speakers when using headphones and mic, but don't want to keep reaching around to plug and unplug.   I was unable to find anything that does what I want. Most splitters seem to only split the combined port into one audio out and one mic port.   <answer135106> How about the "Wiretap" from Extrasensory devices?  img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0216/6508/products/wiretap_golden_1024x1024.png?v=1362078881" alt="Wiretap diagram"
