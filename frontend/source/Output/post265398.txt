What change does the OS need to make, given this message? "iCloud Preferences wants to make changes to your account" <body> This message appears when I log on to my machine. It doesn't tell me what change it wants to make, so I deny it access to my system.  Does anyone know what change it is trying to make?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ui0R4.png" alt="System Preferences: iCloud Preferences wants to make changes to your account. Type your password to allow this."  <answer265554> It's trying to set up the iCloud account as a trusted authentication platform for your local user account. This is usually for a feature such as the Apple Watch unlock, whereby the Apple Watch can unlock your local account through iCloud.  <comment333029> Thank you. Seems unsafe to ask for your password without explicitly stating the reason though.
