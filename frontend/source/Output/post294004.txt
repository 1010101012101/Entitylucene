How to reset an iPhone safely <body> Apologies for the noob question but I'm looking around and finding different answers (including data not getting restored). So I would like to make sure I'm following the right process.  My girlfriend's iPhone is acting slow and freezing from time to time.  Therefore, I would like to restore it to its initial state and start all over.   More info:   ol liHer iCloud is full and not backing up anymore/li liShe forgot her Apple ID password /li liContacts, SMS, photos shall be restored after the reset/li liWhatsApp data also should be restored (I think this should be done from within the app)/li /ol  Ideally, I would like to:   ol liBack up all data through iTunes on PC/li liPerform a factory reset/li liCreate a new Apple ID /li liRestore photos, contacts, SMS/li liFresh install WhatsApp and restore corresponding data /li /ol  Would this work as expected?   <answer294006> Your first step should be to head to https://iforgot.apple.com and change your Apple ID password. Since one of the methods of retrieval will be to have a link emailed to you, strongdo this before wiping your iPhone/strong. If you have strongActivation Lock/strong enabled, emyou will need to provide this password anyway/em after wiping.  Donâ€™t create a new Apple ID unless you emspecifically/em want a new one.  When you backup to iTunes, make sure your backup is encrypted: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/myDO7.jpg" alt="Encrypted iTunes Backup"  This will allow your account passwords, Health, and HomeKit data to be backed up, and will encrypt your local backup with a password. Do not lose this password!  iTunes should immediately start backing up your iPhone. After that you should be safe to codeErase All Contents and Settings/code on your iPhone, then restore your local backup via iTunes.  Do note that it is not possible (or very difficult) to selectively restore apps, settings, etc. A restore restores all your apps and settings as they were at the time of the backup. However if there was any system corruption, etc. a wipe &amp; restore should take care of such problems.
