Scheduled Ringer Volume Change for Work Hours <body> Can I schedule the ringer volume to drop during work hours and then go back up at the end of work?  <answer270594> Yes, you can use "strongDo not disturb/strong":  ul liGo to Settings  Do Not Disturb/li liEnable "Scheduled"/li liSet your desired schedule/li /ul  Your phone will be muted as long as you are within the DND schedule.  To see how exactly this feature works you may have a look at Apple's explanation for Do Not Disturb.  <comment340061> This will silence the ringer, though, not reduce the volume as the OP requested. <comment340066> Isn't "dropping the ringer volume" the same as "muting the phone"? <comment340067> Not to me, but perhaps the OP can clarify.
