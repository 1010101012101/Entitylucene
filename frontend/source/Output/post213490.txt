csrutil: command not found <body> I am using a Mid 2012 MacBook and recently upgraded it to OS X 10.11 El Capitan. I was having trouble with it's new SIP feature and wanted to disable it.  I tried to boot into OS X Internet Recovery using Cmd+R, which started Internet Recovery. When I tried codecsrutil disable/code in Terminal, it returned code-bash: csrutil: command not found/code. Then I tried booting into Recovery HD and tried the same command in the recovery mode there to get the same error.  My question is how can I access codecsrutil/code command to disable SIP? Am I missing something?  strongUpdate/strong I am putting the recovery terminal commands I have tried in the following screenshot. Kindly zoom it to see clearly  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ii5rl.jpg" alt="Terminal commands"  <answer213492> The netboot image loaded by booting to Internet Recovery Mode apparently doesn't contain the executable emcsrutil/em.  The emOS X Base System/em loaded while booting to Recovery Mode should contain it though. By pressing kbdcmd/kbdkbdR/kbd a 2-step procedure is initiated: First the Mac is booted to Recovery HD and then after expanding BaseSystem.dmg to "OS X Base System" (which is the name of the mounted BaseSystem.dmg). If you see an animated globe after pressing kbdcmd/kbdkbdR/kbd your Mac probably doesn't have a Recovery HD.  Check the system version (or product version) of the Recovery HD/Base System:  To check the system version (1 in the screenshot below), boot to your main volume and enter the following in Terminal:  precodediskutil list #to get the disk identifier of your Recovery HD; usually it's disk0s3 with a size of ~650 MB diskutil mount disk0s3 cat /Volumes/Recovery\ HD/com.apple.recovery.boot/SystemVersion.plist | grep -A 2 ProductVersion /code/pre  Additionally you may mount BaseSystem.dmg and check the system version (2 in the screenshot below) there also:  precodeopen /Volumes/Recovery\ HD/com.apple.recovery.boot/BaseSystem.dmg cat /Volumes/OS\ X\ Base\ System/System/Library/CoreServices/SystemVersion.plist | grep -A 2 ProductVersion /code/pre  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5Q6FX.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Download and reinstall the latest OS X El Capitan full installer if the system version of the base system is 10.10.x or lower.  <answer247621> Late to the party but had the same problem. Solved it by, at startup, hold down the option key, ‚å•, until you can choose what to boot from and then click on the recovery one, should be Recovery-"version". Then you can follow the same steps as earlier stated - open terminal and write csrutil disable/enable.   <comment257726> how about `/usr/bin/csrutil disable` or `/Volumes/your-OSX-10.11-disk/bin/csrutil disable`? <comment257729> Related: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/208636/csrutil-is-broken-on-recovery-hd <comment257730> @patrix I have a recovery partition locally and tried to boot into that too, along with internet recovery. <comment257799> @maetsoh Nope still the same error. There isn't any csrutil file in both location. <comment258057> I have tried these commands, but these also didn't work. Kindly check the updated question. <comment258059> @noob As stated in my answer "...enter the following in Terminal booted to your main volume..." you have to boot to your main volume and then execute the commands. <comment258060> Oh OK! I couldn't run the commands on the terminal, so I directly checked the SystemVersion.plist directly from finder. It's reporting ProductVersion as 10.10.3. So the recovery OS is older. How can I update it too? <comment258061> @noob Simply reinstall OS X El Capitan 10.11.1 after downloading it from the app store booted to your main volume. None of your documents or settings will be overwritten or use the tool in this [answer](http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/209020/93229) <comment313923> Does not work!! <comment350654> Yep, that solved it in my case, where I had multiple systems on several partitions and drives installled.
