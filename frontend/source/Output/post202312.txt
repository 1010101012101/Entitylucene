How can I keep my Mac from restarting? <body> I'm about to download a 1TB collection of files. It'll take about 7 days.  I want to make sure that my computer doesn't shut down or restart while the download is happening.  <answer202318> There may be a piece of commercial software that can intercept a call to reboot/shutdown however I do not know what it is, if it exists.  My suggestion, despite you editing out the issue in your OP, is to fix the issue and not look for a workaround!  That said, I give you a workaround that you certainly can test and it should prevent a software call to reboot/shutdown however if the reboot/shutdown is being caused by a hardware issue then this will not work.  You can rename the codereboot/code and codeshutdown/code commands in: code/sbin/code  Example in a Terminal:  precodesudo mv /sbin/reboot /sbin/reboot.ori sudo mv /sbin/shutdown /sbin/shutdown.ori /code/pre  ul liNote: Once you renamed the codereboot/code and codeshutdown/code commands the strongApple/strong menu's strongReboot.../strong and strongShut Down.../strong commands will not work./li /ul  If you need to reboot/shutdown, before renaming them back, you'll have to do it from a Terminal using: codesudo /sbin/reboot.ori/code or codesudo /sbin/shutdown.ori/code  The reason you need to do both, even though you say it rebooting not shutting down, is because without knowing the cause of your reboot issue the codeshutdown/code command can be use to reboot not just the codereboot/code command, e.g. codeshutdown -r now/code will immediately reboot the system.  <answer203217> I found a simple solution that's been working for 6 days. Even when I intentionally try to restart my computer as a test, the computer stays on.  What I did is leave a Word Doc open with random text in it, but strongI didn't save it./strong  That shows me an error when my computer tries to restart, but it keeps the system on.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/060PT.png" alt="This is the error message I get"  <comment244023> You said "_and I don't want to bother hunting down the problem_", well you just may have to!  I'd suggest you look at the system.log to see what's happing just before the shutdown occurs for a clue as to what's causing it. <comment244024> Thanks for the suggestion. My concern is that The download will take about seven days. So even if I find the problem that causes my computer to restart now, something else my crop up. I'm looking for a bulletproof solution that will keep my computer from restarting for the next 7 to 10 days. <comment244028> I am down voting your question. Basically, if you aren't motivated to solve your issue, you cannot expect others to do so. Adjust your wording & I'll remove the down vote. In short, we cannot solve the issue without knowing the cause. <comment244030> @scot I'm a little hurt by I respect your choice. <comment244046> Removed the down vote.
