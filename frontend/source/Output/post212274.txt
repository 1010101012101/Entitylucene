Cannot symlink gcc-5 instead of clang on OS X 10.10.5? <body> I've installed gcc-5 via codebrew install gcc5/code, and I've tried linking gcc (which is clang by default) to gcc-5, but whenever I try running gcc, it's using clang. I've also checked that code/usr/local/bin/code is first in my PATH variable. Here's how it all looks in my terminal:  precode$ which gcc-5 /usr/local/bin/gcc-5 $ which gcc /usr/bin/gcc $ echo $PATH /usr/local/bin:/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/bin:/opt/local/bin:/opt/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:~/.composer/vendor/bin:/usr/texbin $ gcc clang: error: no input files $ gcc-5 gcc-5: fatal error: no input files compilation terminated. $ ln -sf gcc-5 gcc $ gcc clang: error: no input files /code/pre  Also, in ~/.bash_profile, I've put codeexport PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH"/code in the last line of the file, and it appears 1st in $PATH, I've played around a bit and discovered that it's somehow read in reverse, as if every export appends to the front, is that normal behaviour?  EDIT: I would prefer to avoid using alias for things like these.  <answer212473>  precodeln -sf gcc-5 gcc /code/pre   You might be thinking of an alias, but that symbolic link doesn't really do anything unless you're in /usr/local/bin. You need  precodeln -sf /usr/local/bin/gcc-5 /usr/local/bin/gcc /code/pre  <comment256397> What does which gcc show (or better type -p gcc) - also why do this any build system will allow an easy chnage of C++ compiler <comment256558> Can't believe I've missed it, thanks! :)
