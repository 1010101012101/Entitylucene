Can't open app from another developer <body> I have tried control-click to open the app. It asks if I want to open it anyway but then nothing happens, and I don't get that question a second time. No radio button appears in security to open it anyway, and I have tried quarantine as suggested but that doesn't work.  <comment349548> Ask the developer. Based on only that information, no-one else can guess. <comment349599> Agree with @Tetsujin. Your best bet would be to contact the developer(s).
