iPad PDF software to edit, merge, annotate etc well PDF documents like in desktop? Also working with Math formulae? <body> emThis thread is a part of the major thread about using iPad for education purposes here./em  This thread here made me realize that that it would be super-cool to be able to merge PDF documents and other documents in iPad.   strongHelper questions/strong     ol   liHow can I do it with documents of different formats? /li   liDoes there exist an app to merge PDF documents?/li   liPossible to merge images or even Doc/Docx -documents with Math -formulae?/li   /ol   <answer69660> Have you looked at PDF Merger? It can read .doc and various image formats.  https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pdf-merger/id453413252?mt=8  <answer69661> emI am trying to summarize and categorize here things./em  There are general program such as GoodReader that are not good in small things such as searching or merging but good in reading with things such as light-adjustion. This is probably because the iPad's screen-area is limited, better to do a specific thing very well instead of many things poorly. I will list below more specific apps in iPad but many of them such as PDF Expert have iPhone version so iOS apps in that sense. Have a good reading!  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xJtBf.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  I think if you want to do things very well in iPad you need to follow some sort of Unix-philosophy: less is more. Limitations such as area and virtual keyboard set clear design-guidelines such as avoiding extraneous things. New features always have trade-offs -- often in hard-to-measure things such as usability and accessibility. Despite lacking some objectiveness here I will outline apps in categories below. Please, feel free to suggest better categorization. You may find this thread here useful if you are new with iPad, iOS i or Apple ecosystem.  strongI. Apps prone in Reading/strong     I. Papers app with things such as reference-lookup, grading and academic preview      II. GoodReader app with things such as Light-adjusting      III. Side-by-side app with cool intention but works badly, unfortunately no better alternative yet.   strongIII. Apps prone in searching such as Content-search over all documents/strong      I. PDF Expert           It has a content-search and indexation, may create downtime in copying DropBox things elsewhere -- a lot of small files apparently.           img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/cgiYS.jpg" alt="enter image description here"         More about apps with content-search here.   strongIV. Apps with good support for formats such as mathematical formulae/strong     I. iAnnotate           iAnnotate is the only one currently able to read Windows proprietary formats well. Yes, I know: this is a bit painful particularly if you face this kind of files every now-and-then, you cannot yet find a killer app good in everything for iPad! For this kind of cases, iAnnotate helps you to see the math -formulae but you still need a desktop for editing or pay for Microsoft to edit the formats online.      <comment85009> I don't know if it does merging, but GoodReader does PDF annotations and it reads a bunch of different formats, so it deserves a mention in section 2. <comment85027> @MarkThalman added it to the section `"I. Prone in reading..."`, there is some overlap here-and-there but there are still apps better in one thing than others. Is this categorization fine? <comment86416> Questions on this site are stand-alone entities. They aren't part of "threads", but they do contain a single coherent question in the body of the post. They also don't contain random hyphens inserted at odd places.
