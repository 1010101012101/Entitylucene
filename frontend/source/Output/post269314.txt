Video player with subtitle based seeking <body> I am looking for a video player like MX player on android. There if I swipe on the lower half of the screen I can seek forward/backward to the next/previous subtitle line, while swiping on the upper half seeks forward/backward in time.   Swiping of course will not work on a mac (unfortunately), but a keybinding for subtitle based seeking will also be fine.   Any suggestions? Thanks!
