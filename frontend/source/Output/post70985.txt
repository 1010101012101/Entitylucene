Make the Menu Bar never show while in Full Screen <body> Pretty much every application I use in full-screen (including Firefox, MacVim and the Terminal) have tabs on the top of the screen.  The problem is, when I move my mouse to reach the tabs I'll often accidentally touch the top of the screen, bringing in the OS menu OVER the tabs:  img src="https://i.cubeupload.com/xJMnPL.gif" alt="Illustration - moving mouse to top of screen in fullscreen apps makes menu bar appear"  Is there any way to change this behavior? I'd prefer it if the menu bar would stay hidden when I'm using a full-screen app, even if my mouse does touch the top of the screen.  <answer142054> The menu bar can NOT be hidden on command whenever you like to due to limitations in Mac OS X. Apple can do this in their own programs but they have NOT made it possible for other developers in Mac OS X.    One of the reasons being that Apple Menu sits on the Menu bar and is helpful if the application becomes unresponsive or if the user needs to log off /shutdown the machine.   There is an application called Menu Eclipse which lets you change the Menu Bar behaviors(except for hide it).  <answer251138> The closest solution I've found is to do as mentioned earlier, disabling "Displays have separate spaces" in Mission Control. This only makes sense in a multi-monitor environment, as the menubar still shows on the primary monitor.  If you make the app "go fullscreen" (click green button), it fills the whole screen, but all other screens go black, and the menubar gets moved to the app's screen.  So the solution there is to manually expand the app's edges as far or high as you want.  Once upon a time, VMWare had some kind of full-screen workaround that didn't use Apple's full screen mechanism.  Unless/until Apple sees this as a problem that needs fixing, you're going to be hard pressed finding a non-hacky solution.  It is emso/em integral to how the operating system works (like the home-button on the iPhone/iPad/iPod).  <comment82447> Yeah, this is really annoying. I wish there where a `defaults write` variable one could edit. But so far I've not heard about anything like that. It is especially annoying when using a VM in full screen. Ubuntu has the menubar at the top and I like it that way. But I'm constantly triggering the OSX menu bar to appear. :( <comment152626> There is ONE thing you can do, but it sacrifices using the menu bar entirely - i.e., in addition to stubbornly hiding it, you can't even manually activate it (via the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl`+`F2`) or, it appears, operate any of the menu bar's items via their assigned keyboard shortcuts, either :(. But it DOES get rid of the menu bar out-right if you really want to get rid of it for a specific program. Download 'PresentYourApps' (it's on CNET), run the app you want to remove the menu bar for, run PreentYourApps and set the options for that app accordingly. It'll modify the app and restart it. <comment152631> Ok further info: what 'PresentYourApps' does is basically set the LSUIPresentationMode or 'Application UI Presentation Mode' value in the Info.plist for the app in question: documentation [here](http://is.gd/B9zpnZ) and a guide at Lifehacker [here](http://is.gd/1xLHA1). Instead of '4', use numeric value '3' for 'All hidden' mode, which is what my above comment's steps do in that easier GUI - but again, 'All hidden' annoyingly disables ALL access to the menu bar when in that app, while 'All suppressed' DOES hide the menu but the mouse invokes it when hit top of the screen, which we don't want. <comment160664> Can you try disabling the option "Displays have separate spaces" on the Mission Control section of the System Preferences app? I know it changes the behavior of the menubar but I can't test it on my current machine because I am not running Mavericks. <comment188487> "Menu eclipse" doesn't hide the menu bar. <comment236370> Any solution yet? <comment256125> the menu bar could be triggerable by a keystroke or by a longer pause - this would still allow for the user to break out of a broken app while also not interrupting their tab based work flow <comment267256> See also http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/114958/in-fullscreen-disable-auto-hiding-mac-menu-bar (VirtualBox) <comment300200> Can you re upload the image? The Dropbox link now links to a 404. <comment312039> Try the browser Vivaldi, where you can have tabs at the bottom of the screen? <comment312090> This can't be 100% true, since there are a lot of full screen games which don't allow you to access the menu bar. Although they are presumably using non-standard functions for full screen. <comment312106> @Wowfunhappy I would assume that is the result of running applications in the game mode. <comment342804> http://kb.parallels.com/en/123101 (Parallels has this in "game" mode?) <comment347140> if only we could specify a bigger delay... this is really annoying
