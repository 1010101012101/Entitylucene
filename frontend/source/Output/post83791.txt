What are some good data recovery programs to try on an SD card? <body> My friend imported a bunch of videos from his GoPro into iPhoto and foolishly let iPhoto delete upon successful import. He claims that iPhoto then quit unexpectedly and all of the videos are gone.  My guess is the files are still in the library but not in the index. I will have a look later today when I go to help him out. However, in case the files are really gone I'll try to recover them from the SD card.  Any suggestions for doing that?  <answer83795> I successfully used TestDisk to get photos back from an SD card.   <answer121693> Your best chance of recovering the photos from the SD card is digital picture recovery software.  Many of them offer a free trial you can download and try before you buy it.  Picture Rescue 2 http://www.prosofteng.com/downloads/download.php?prodID=93 by Prosoft has been around for over 10 years and is easy to use, plus will show you a thumbnail preview of the photo prior to recovery.    <comment98081> My guess was right, the videos were still in the library's masters folder but not showing up in the application itself. <comment272643> Thanks. TestDisk worked great and it is free!
