Why won't this script bind to my server? <body> I am trying to figure out why this script is not binding client computers to the OD server.  It is a firstboot script that is part of a netrestore image that runs at login.  It does seem to run because it does delete itself upon restore.    The bind command in the script does work if i execute it manually on clients, so that part does seem to be configured just fine.    Can anyone help me see what is wrong with this thing?  precode#!/bin/sh  ### # First Boot script that is used along with a launchd item.
