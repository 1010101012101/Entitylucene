How can I shut off the confirmation prompt when I delete conversations in Messages in OS X? <body> I receive a lot of messages on my MacBook Pro on a daily basis. Periodically throughout the day I need to delete multiple conversations in messages for clarity purposes. Each time I delete a conversation thread I receive the following prompt:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/RqU2l.png" alt="Delete Confirmation Pop Up Dialog Box"  I have looked around in Messages preferences and I can not see any readily apparent option to disable the deletion confirmation pop-up dialog box. Is there any way to disable this dialog in Messsages or otherwise?  <answer99743> After reviewing the preferences as well as codedefaults/code, there does not appear to be a way to disable the confirmation message.  <answer99747> This is more of a workaround. If you enable the "Save history when conversations are closed" option under Preferences-Messages, you won't be prompted when deleting conversations.   <answer186188> You can hold Option and click Delete or (x).  <comment117351> This is what I figured but I'm still holding out hope. I'll give it a day or so before I choose an answer. <comment117462> Yes I saw this some time ago but I currently do not wish to enable this functionality. It is however, a semi-viable work around. <comment219869> This seems to be new behavior since I originally posted this question.
