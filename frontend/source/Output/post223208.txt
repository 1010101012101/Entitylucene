AppleScript : Set do script result as variable <body> I would like to get the result of this search and display the result in a notification or safari popup.  " set result to do shell script "curl https://www.binlist.net/json/" &amp; cc without altering line endings" only have as a result the same value of the main query  precode-- Web site https://www.binlist.net -- Get https://www.binlist.net/json/431940 set cc to the clipboard set finalresult to do shell script "curl https://www.binlist.net/json/" &amp; cc without altering line endings set the clipboard to finalresult  display notification "result is " &amp; finalresult /code/pre  The result won't display as a notification so for now, its only set as clipboard Also the result is really raw can I clean that somehow ?  precode{\"bin\":\"431940\",\"brand\":\"VISA\",\"sub_brand\":\"\",\"country_code\":\"IE\",\"country_name\":\"Ireland\",\"bank\":\"BANK OF IRELAND\",\"card_type\":\"DEBIT\",\"card_category\":\"\",\"latitude\":\"53\",\"longitude\":\"-8\",\"query_time\":\"1.370709ms\"}"" /code/pre  Thanks.  <answer223266> You want the strongbrand/strong and the strongcountry_name/strong from the codeJSON/code data, you can use a JSON parser.  Here is an example of parsing codeJSON/code in codepython/code  precode-- Get https://www.binlist.net/json/431940 set cc to the clipboard as string set finalresult to do shell script "curl https://www.binlist.net/json/" &amp; cc &amp; "  |  /usr/bin/python -c 'import json, sys; obj=json.load(sys.stdin); print obj[\"brand\"],obj[\"country_name\"]' " display notification "Result is " &amp; finalresult --&gt; "Result is VISA Ireland" /code/pre  <comment270566> Given your example JSON, what would you like to see displayed? <comment270568> I just ran your code with having set `431940` on the clipboard and the `final result` set back to the clipboard was exactly what I see if looking at https://www.binlist.net/json/431940 in Safari.  So not sure what your issue is with formatting other the the results displayed in Script Editor e.g `set the clipboard to "{\"bin\":\"431940\...` the backslashes show there are not on the clipboard.  Are you saying they are? <comment270570> Here is my result, I was wondering can I just keep "Visa" and "Ireland" and display in a notification : {"bin":"431940","brand":"VISA","sub_brand":"","country_code":"IE","country_name":"Ireland","bank":"BANK OF IRELAND","card_type":"DEBIT","card_category":"","latitude":"53","longitude":"-8","query_time":"651.384Âµs"} <comment270575> Sorry but it is not clear, to me anyway, what you're asking in the last comment. <comment270733> That's great thank you
