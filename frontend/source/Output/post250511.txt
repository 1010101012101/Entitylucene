spotify doesn't care about mission control settings <body> I have my Mission Control (el capitan, 10.11) settings the way I like: "When switching to an application, switch to a Space with open windows for the application" is OFF.  This works very well except for Spotify. Also, I have Spotify "locked" for a specific Desktop.  It's very annoying to do a cmd-tab and switch 3 desktops. And then, it doesn't switch back with another cmd-tab.  How can I make Spotify obey the Mission Control setting?  <comment311103> To clarify, I just don't want to switch to Spotify when I'm on another desktop. This is ok for every other application. <comment311114> I am not clear as to what you are describing as the problem. <comment311150> Spotify doesn't behave as the other windows. If I'm on desktop 1 and Spotify is on desktop3, when switching to Spotify (with cmd-tab), I don't want to go to desktop3.
