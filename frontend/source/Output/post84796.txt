Apple wireless keyboard + iPad 4: can I map a key to the home button? <body> I use the Apple wireless keyboard A1314 (newer model, using two AA batteries) with my iPad 4th (or is it 3.5th generator? whatever is the newest) generation. Is there a way to map one of the buttons to the home key? Is it possible to do this with a jailbroken iPad, if not a jail-unbroken iPad?  An earlier answer says it isn't possible, but refers to iPad 2, so I don't know if anything has changed in the 1.5+ years.  This is more than a minor annoyance with the otherwise great Incase Origami stand, because the home button is physically blocked with the iPad in portrait mode.  <answer243330> This is an old question, but for anyone else coming across it, the answer is Command-H is the shortcut to display the home screen.  FYI  ul liCommand H displays the home screen/li liCommand-Tab shortcut displays the task switcher/li liCommand-Space toggles the search bar/li /ul  <comment97677> I don't think it is possible still. If you don't mind using the right-click on your mouse as the home button, this might work: http://www.iphonehacks.com/2012/10/how-to-use-a-mouse-on-the-ipad.html (NOTE: It's a jailbreak tweak.) <comment97691> Oh cool! I'll have to get a bluetooth mouse and try this.
