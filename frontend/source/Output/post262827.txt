Time Machine: backup disk not recognized <body> I have browsed this group for similar topics, but all of them concern Time Capsule, connected over the network; my problem is with an USB disk.  I have a similar problem, but persistent.  What happens is that the backup disk is not recognised: the Time Machine preferences say "Backup will be done when the backup disk will be connected", or something similar.  Clicking on "Select disk" in the T.M. System Preferences window, the backup disk is listed both in the section "Backup disk" and in the section "Available disks"; clicking on the disk icon in the "Available disks" section and then on the "Use that disk" button starts the backup.  But after some hours I am again stuck with the "Backup disk not connected" error.  The disk itself is a Western Digital WD Elements 107C USB disk, visible in the Finder with all its content.  Computer: iMac 27" mid 2010; OS: OS X Sierra 10.12.1  What I have done:  ul liRemoved the backup disk in the T.M. System Preferences window, then added the same disk as backup disk; nothing changed./li liUsed "Disk Utility" to check with "First aid" the backup disk (that was OK); nothing changed./li liErased and reformatted (with Disk Utility) the backup disk, then selected again that disk for Time Machine; nothing changed./li /ul  Please, help...
