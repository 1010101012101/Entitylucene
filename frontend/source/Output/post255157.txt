Sierra Beta: External keyboard won't type "a" and types an "i" instead of "h" after several seconds of being plugged in <body> This is driving me crazy and I think I've done all the obvious troubleshooting. Where might OSX be keeping keyboard-specific settings that would do this?  Here's what's happening:  ul liWhen I plug in the keyboard to either USB port on my MBP, it works fine for about 3 seconds/li liThen, the "a" key stops working (no response), and when I press "h" it types an "i" instead/li liIt works fine when I boot in Recovery Mode/li liIt works fine on other computers/li liDifferent USB keyboard works fine on this computer/li /ul  Of note:  ul liI am running macOS Sierra 10.12.1 Beta (16B2333a)/li liI recently installed and removed Keyboard Maestro/li /ul  <answer255247> I have met the same issue, you can fix this by install the latest Karabiner-Elements.  <answer255253> EDIT: I updated my machine to the latest Beta and I also got this issue. I resolved it by going to:  Preferences - Keyboard - Modifier Keys...    And then "Restore Defaults".  This is a known issue in latest Beta.  <answer255524> As noted by others here, doing a "Restore defaults" on the modifier keys solves the problem (System preferences  Keyboard  Modifier keys...).  I was having the same problem - I restored defaults and the keyboard started working fine :)   strongNote: Re-configuring your custom modifiers after you restore defaults will not re-introduce the buggy behaviour. i.e., once you've restored defaults, you can go ahead and re-customize your modifiers as they were before./strong  Happy clacking!  <comment317748> Have you tried going to keyboard settings? Making sure the keys are mapped properly? I think there's a way to check that in System Preferences <comment317762> Yup, definitely nothing weird in there. Set to Canadian English. Tried US English just for fun, no difference. Also, I don't see any keyboard-specific settings in there (the laptop's builtin keyboard works fine, other USB keyboards work fine...). I did go through the "Keyboard Type" wizard there and it successfully sets it up as the ANSI standard US 101/102-key keyboard. <comment317768> Entertain me this... if you have a usb hub or usb extension, plug it in through that and tell me the results. <comment317864> Welcome to Ask Different!

Unfortunately, same result. <comment317885> Thanks Mateusz, could you link to a source for that? I have seen a few other USB keyboard related reports here and there but with some key differences. <comment317917> @maciej I saw some comments here and there that says if you reset the modifier keys preferences it may fix the issue. Worth trying. <comment318083> Same issue. H and I was fixed by Ukelele. But have no idea, how to fix "A", cause it even do not read any keycode. <comment318477> Thanks Mateusz, this solved it for me as well. After restoring to defaults, I was able to change them again without issue.
