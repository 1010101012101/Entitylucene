iPhone iOS Exchange not showing new folders <body> for some reason my iPhone's Exchange account won't add new folders that I created in Outlook. Emails come in, but not new folders. I am not sure how long I've had this problem so I can't pinpoint to an iOS update or anything like that.  Things I've looked into:  ul liPUSH LIST - Everything I've searched and read mentions adding folders to a push list, however these new folders don't even appear to add to the push list./li liRESET ACCOUNT (works) - The only work around I have to delete the Exchange account entirely on the iPhone and then add it again. THEN, I get my new folders./li liTOGGLE EMAIL - Turning off and then back on the "email on/off slider" in the account settings does NOT help either./li /ul  Here is what I'm running:   ul liiPhone 4S w/ iOS 7.1.1/li liWindows Server 2003/li liExchange Server 2003/li liOutlook 2010/li /ul  Any thoughts?   Thanks
