Various random website cannot be reached (cannot allocate memory) <body> With process of elimination and testing the problems on 2 different Macs, 4 different networks, and many different browsers, I have isolated the cause of my network issue to be the actual Mac.  Certain sites, even though they are up, are completely unreachable by one of my Mac. Visiting on Chrome says:  precodeError code: ERR_OUT_OF_MEMORY /code/pre  Safari says:  precodeThe operation couldn't be completed. Cannot allocate memory /code/pre  codeping/code says:  precodeping: sendto: Cannot allocate memory /code/pre  I have no idea what to do next. I check my Network setting and no proxies are on. Is there any way to reset my network settings? Or any commands to provide more information to allow more diagnostic?   Thanks.  <answer122203> What fixes it for me for wireless connection is this:  ol liGo to network preferences/li liOpen the connection data/li liOpen "Advanced..." properties/li liGo to "TCP/IP" tab/li liSet "Configure IPv4" to off (remember the previous setting)/li liClick "OK" and then Apply/li liWait for the connection to be reset/li liGo back to TCP/IP and re-enable IPv4 to the previous setting/li liClick "OK" and then "Apply" again/li /ol  After the connection restores, the memory errors are gone. Still no idea why it happens or why this fixes it, but seems to work for me and is much faster than rebooting.   <comment138442> Have you considered restarting the computer to determine if you have a program with a memory leak or if indeed there is a problem with the system and apps after a fresh start? <comment138443> Actually just time will eventually fix the problem. But it will happen again for random other sites like facebook or even google. I'm not even sure if it's a virus or some kind rerouting my network traffic or something. <comment142556> Also may be a dupe of this: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/73263/getting-out-of-memory-error-when-trying-to-load-specific-websites-am-not-out <comment258222> This worked to restore access to a particular website that I was not able to access. It was very frustrating, but these steps solved it.
