Broken Command Line Tools on Sierra, can't install Node.js native packages, build Python etc <body> I'm on macOS Sierra 10.12.1 (16B2555) with Xcode 8.1 &amp; Command Line Tools installed but I can't install any Node.js native add-ons, I can't compile Python etc.  I've tried removing Xcode and Command Line Tools (the latter via removing code/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/code) and then reinstalled Xcode from App Store and Command Line Tools via codexcode-select --install/code but the problem is still there. For example, this is what happens if I try to install the codecontextify/code npm package on Node.js 7.2.0 or 6.9.1:  precode$ npm install contextify  &gt; contextify@0.1.15 install /Users/mgol/_/node_modules/contextify &gt; node-gyp rebuild  gyp WARN download NVM_NODEJS_ORG_MIRROR is deprecated and will be removed in node-gyp v4, please use NODEJS_ORG_MIRROR gyp WARN download NVM_NODEJS_ORG_MIRROR is deprecated and will be removed in node-gyp v4, please use NODEJS_ORG_MIRROR gyp WARN download NVM_NODEJS_ORG_MIRROR is deprecated and will be removed in node-gyp v4, please use NODEJS_ORG_MIRROR   CXX(target) Release/obj.target/contextify/src/contextify.o make: ccache: No such file or directory make: *** [Release/obj.target/contextify/src/contextify.o] Error 1 gyp ERR! build error  /code/pre  It works fine on a colleague's machine with the same OS.  I sometimes see App Store notifying me of a Command Line Tools upgrade for Xcode 7.3 which seems off, maybe my setup has some leftover from the old Xcode?  Any ideas? I feel lost in what else I can try.  <answer266088> You may want to accept the Xcode license:  In terminal as a sudo user run:  codesudo xcodebuild -license/code  <answer266091> From your log, it looks like the build process expects ccache to be installed.  Depending on your preference, use either Homebrew or MacPorts to install ccache, and then try the build again.  <comment339479> That was it (`brew install ccache` fixed the issue) but my other colleagues didn't have to do it on their machines and it still worked for them so I still don't fully understand the issue... <comment339480> I've already accepted the license so that wasn't it.
