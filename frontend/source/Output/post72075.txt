Bluetooth 4.0 Dongle detectable by iPhone 4S/5 <body> I bought a CSR Bluetooth 4.0 dongle, when plugged into my computer, initially my iPhone 5 could not detect it, but if I set the dongle to broadcast as Headset mode in the Bluetooth settings, the iPhone detects it instantly.  strongI am wondering how to configure the Dongle so that if I plug it into a USB car jack (for example), the iPhone can detect it right away?/strong  Are there any tools or software that I need?
