App to allow battery charge only to a certain extent <body> I'd like to charge my rMBP battery only up to 85% or 90%, in order to preserve it.  Is there any app that stops charging at user selected percentages?  If not, is there any other method? (Apart from manually detaching power cable, obviously).  <comment209415> Buy a plug power timer, work out how long 1 percent takes to charge and then set it to the appropriate time for the current percentage and the needed percentage. The Timers do exist but I have only every found one on sale in a pound (Â£)  shop once. the timer is like a count down timer (egg time style) not a 24h timer. I use mine for my iron otherwise I will forget to turn it of. <comment209422> This one is not from the uk but as an example http://www.hpm.com.au/Products.aspx?pid=422 <comment209457> What do you mean "preserve it"? <comment209577> I mean, to maintain it around 40%, in order to maximize its lifespan.. <comment209578> Mh, perhaps i found the solution... Excluding the middle pin of magsafe2 (signal) will cause the macbook to user wall power but NOT charge the battery.
