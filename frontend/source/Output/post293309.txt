Charge Apple magic mouse 2 using iPhone lightning Qi wireless charger <body> Can I charge Apple magic mouse 2 using iPhone lightning Qi wireless charger adapter and pad?

Please note though, if you're referring to pre-release Apple hardware then your question will be off-topic on this site until it is released. <comment371041> Sorry for lack of details, I think these should be compatible with the current model magic mouse 2.
