Cannot restore due to older version of iOS <body> I got the iPhone 6s this afternoon and tried to restore the backup from iPhone 6 which is on iCloud. 6s could not restore the backup because 6 was running iOS 9.0.2 and 6s was not. I set it up as a new phone (both have the same name) and upgraded to iOS 9.0.2.  Is there a way to use the old phone's backup?  <answer221360> Now that you've upgraded the phone, you should be able to go in to Settings  General  Erase All Content and Settings.    This will reset the phone like new, except having the latest version installed.    When it restarts, you'll be able to restore from your newer backup.
