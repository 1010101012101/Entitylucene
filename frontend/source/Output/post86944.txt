Can I share my internet connection and redirect clients to my web server? <body> I often share my internet connection with other Macs and devices and want to know if I can redirect client's web requests to my local web server.  Is it as simple as having them use my client's IP address or do I need to set up a proxy or otherwise configure things on my Mac or my client's devices?  <answer92154> If you really want to configure your network in such a way, here are a few bricks I'd advise to start with:  ol liInstall Squid version 3 and configure it in transparent mode. You may use MacPorts to build, configure and install it. With codeMacPorts/code you would do it with: codeport install squid3/code./li liInstall Apache. With the same codeMacports/code, you would have to do it with: codeport install apache2/code./li /ol  You will find many documents on the web to help to build this, but I didn't find any one complete and good enough to recommand it.  <comment100517> I don't think so, redirection is quite complicated. <comment100530> I agree, the internet sharing feature is really limited to simple sharing, with virtually no advanced configurable options. <comment100551> What about a proxy server? there must be a way!?
