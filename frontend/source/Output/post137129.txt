Is there an alternative to "Everything" on OS X? <body> strongSpotlight/strong does pretty much, but it lacks two critical features.  ol liIt cannot search arbitrary locations. It excludes system locations for a better user experience I guess./li liIt cannot index external drives./li /ol  For example I often search the ID of a chrome extension to get to its folder. That's way faster than typing the path. Unfortunately, I do not know how to do this on OS X  Is there an alternative on OS X that includes the features of strongEverything/strong?  <answer137130> In your case probably the      mdfind   will do great job.  It is not a GUI but a Terminal command, and it will search everywhere and everything.  Once found you can triple click on the line (to select it) and Right Click and use the "Reveal in Finder".  <answer137139> If you show hidden files you might be able to search for them via spotlight. Most drives should be indexed (as long as their HFS+ formatted I believe)  <comment162864> So far - my spotlight can index external Devices and also System Folders ... Please check your Settings and let us know <comment162865> Try to use [Alfred][1].

I have checked all the items, and have no folders excluded. <comment162867> @bMalum, my external devices are formatted as NTFS. I don't know if this matters. <comment162869> @demas, thanks. But this seems to link to a question concerning SQL. <comment162870> @Aszune'sHeart, Sorry. it was my mistake.  Here is correct link - http://www.alfredapp.com <comment162871> Searching for something or for specific. Do you always know the file name you are searching for? <comment162896> @Buscarì›ƒ, it cannot not be more specific. For example I often search the ID of a chrome extension to get to its folder. That's way faster than typing the path. Unfortunately, I cannot do this on OS X. <comment186220> Why is this question down voted?
