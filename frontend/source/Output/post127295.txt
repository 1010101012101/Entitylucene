How to open a file in Excel from the command line <body> Is it possible to tell Excel to open a file from the command line?  In Linux, I could do this using the command  precodelibreoffice --calc test.xlsx /code/pre  <answer127297> You can use the open command:  precodeopen test.xlsx /code/pre  or, to specify the application explicitly:  precodeopen test.xlsx -a /Applications/Microsoft\ Office\ 2011/Microsoft\ Excel.app/ /code/pre  or even,  precodeopen test.xlsx -a "Microsoft Excel" /code/pre  <answer252598> To open the excel file from the directory, this is the command you should use   precodelibreoffice --calc /Path/Of/The/Directory/Excel.xlsx /code/pre  To open new excel file use  precodelibreoffice --calc /code/pre  <comment149195> Thanks. I didn't know that the `open` command exists, and that there are so many different ways to do it. <comment314331> Are you sure this works on OSX (especially the first command)?
