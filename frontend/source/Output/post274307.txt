Can't find 68GB local backup folder (regular backups on an external hard drive) <body> A few days ago my local hard drive shows 68 GB of backups. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/z9uby.png" alt="screenShot"  I regularly backup with time machine on an external disk and even after running a backup these file stayed. I tired using SupaView and DaisyDisk to look at the files but both do not have access even while using then as an admin. Therefore I don't even know where this folder is or what i contains. I have OSX El Captain (10.11.6)  Has anyone had the same issue or know what and where this folder is?  <answer274308> It's likely your Local Time Machine Snapshots.  In Sierra, these are stored in code/.MobileBackups/Computer/code, but it's not advisable to manipulate this folder directly. Either use the Time Machine application to delete individual snapshots, or disable local snapshots altogether by running the following Terminal command:  precodesudo tmutil disablelocal /code/pre  I can't say why MacOS isn't cleaning them up after you've run an external Time Machine backup. EDIT: On my MacBook Pro, I also see some old backups that pre-date my last external backup.  <comment344858> I haven't updated to Sierra yet I have El Captain (10.11.6) <comment344859> I forget if they're stored in the same place on El Capitan. You may also find the backups in /Volumes/MobileBackups, but I'm not sure if that only appears while the local backup is actually happening. <comment344861> In DaisyDisk, when scanning your drive as admin, do you see 68+ GB of "hidden space?" <comment344866> I found the files. My new problem is finding out what size they are. I found one folder from before my last backup. <comment344867> @SkeletonBow yes it's marked as hidden space <comment344875> If you don't mind using the terminal, you can use the command `sudo du -ch /.MobileBackups` (if that's where you found them). You'll need to enter your password to run it. The very last line of the output will show you the size of all the backups, combined. <comment344975> Thank you that worked. I found out that the file from before the last backup has 61GB. I'll try another backup and when that does not get rid of it i might have to delete that folder
