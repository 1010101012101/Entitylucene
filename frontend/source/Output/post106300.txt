How can I disable this mutli-monitor window-cutoff in Mavericks? <body> If I drag a window in between two screens, half the window disappears. Is there a flag I can set from the command line or pref option somewhere to disable this?  My chrome window below is in the middle of my two monitors with the left half hidden. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/haCTX.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer106312> Try going to strongSystem Preferences/strong → strongMission Control/strong → and unchecking the option for strongDisplays have separate Spaces/strong.  <answer106448> have you tried system pref  mission control  and uncheck "displays have separate spaces"img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/da6Q5.png" alt="U"  <comment124838> have you tried system pref  mission control  and uncheck "displays have separate spaces" ? <comment124848> Feel free to delete this answer, once @Macmaniman has returned  and answered himself
