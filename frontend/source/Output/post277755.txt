Which OS for a 2GB RAM MacBook Air from 2011? <body> My Macbook Air from mid 2011 has 2 GB RAM, its processor is 1.6 GHz i5, 64 GB of flash storage. Its OS is the one it had originally, Lion.  Many apps require to upgrade the OS - e.g Slack. Yet I don't think going for Sierra with 2 GB RAM is a good idea, and I can't upgrade the RAM as it is impossible on new Macbook Airs.  Which OS would my MBA handle, would Yosemite or Mavericks be manageable for it ?  <answer277760> It will take Sierra - which means unless you already have any earlier OS in your App Store purchase history, that's the only one you can get for it.

Everything since Mountain Lion 10.8 is supplied through the App Store only, & belongs to the Apple ID that 'bought' it through there [even though it didn't cost money]. The only way to get anything older than 'current' is to have already 'bought' it, so it's in your App Store purchase history. <comment350221> You said, "_Apple haven't sold an OS for money since Lion 10.7_" and that is not correct as Apple sold OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion, I know because I paid for it! OS X 10.9 Mavericks was the first free version of OS X. <comment350227> Close, even if no cigar - though that wasn't really the point I was trying to make.
