No ringing for FaceTime, no alert sound for iMessage <body> I'm not getting ringing for FaceTime and not getting alert sounds when IMessages come in. I believe I've got all my setting right, and I can see the calls coming in if the iPad is in use. Do not disturb is not on, volume is not muted, the apps all have sound settings, etc.  <answer262232> I have been having the same problem.  I won't know if it works 'till someone calls - but I have just found in SettingsDo Not DisturbAllow Calls From, change to EVERYONE.   <comment319041> Welcome to Ask Different.
