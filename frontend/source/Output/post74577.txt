iPhone doesn't sync over WiFi <body> I can connect to the PC via Remote app on the iPhone, but the iPhone can't see the PC to Sync and the PC won't recognize the iPhone. I've done syncing over WiFi before.  I'm using iPhone 3GS w/ iOS 6 and Windows 8.  <answer74579> Here are the standard steps to set it up:  ol liMake certain that your computer and iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch are connected to the same Wi-Fi signal./li liConnect your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch to a Mac or PC via USB. Launch iTunes if it doesn’t do so automatically./li liHighlight your iDevice in the sidebar. (or choose at top right if iTunes11)/li liClick "Summary" in the menu bar. Scroll down to the "Options" section./li liCheck the "Sync with this (iOS device) over Wi-Fi" box. Click "Apply."/li liDetach your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch./li liInitiate an iTunes Wi-Fi Sync by tapping Settings  General  iTunes Wi-Fi Sync  Sync Now on your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch. Or, plug it into an outlet/li /ol  Does it fail at a particular point?    subsource/sub  <comment86635> When you say you can connect via Remote, are you referring to the Remote App on the iPhone? <comment86660> Yes, I'm. I've also edited the question. <comment86661> I have the "Sync with this iPhone over Wi-Fi" option checked. After detaching the iPhone I can't initiate the sync. All I can see is "Sync will resume when DT2-NTB is available.". <comment86662> @PeterDraexDräxler, in step 7 above, have you turned on the service on the phone itself? <comment86671> What service on the phone do you mean? I'm connected to a WiFi. <comment86673> It's curious, now it works without changing any settings. This happens to me often. It sometimes works and sometimes does not. <comment86680> @PeterDraexDräxler, hmmm, that is curious.  That strikes me more as a network issue rather than an iTunes/iDevice issue.  Does your Remote app ever fail to connect? <comment86682> Since I have add an exception to the firewall, I have no problem with the Remote app. Sync fails also when I turn off the firewall completely. It seems to me like iTunes recognizes the iPhone after really long time being on a same WiFi.
