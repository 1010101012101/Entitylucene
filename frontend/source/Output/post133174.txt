Debian won't book on MacBook Pro <body> I erased the entire content of my MacBook Pro when installing debian. Now, the laptop will not boot into Linux.   When I insert USB again it will start installation again. I even selected bootable flag on the partition but still will not boot.  The issue is that I do not have Mac OS either to go back...  Do you have suggestions what to do?  <answer133209> press cmd + R for internet recovery  <comment157806> without asking why did you not create a bootable osx on USB did you read this https://wiki.debian.org/MacBookPro
