Two Time Machine users on USB hard drive with encrypted drive - second computer does not recognize Time Machine volume <body> I am trying to use a single USB hard drive for two encrypted Time Machine backups.    I partitioned the USB drive in half.  I set the iMac connected to the USB drive to encrypt Time Machine to the first partition.  I set the other partition to share (username/password for the volume).  The first iMac works fine.  The second iMac never recognizes the drive as a Time Machine back up volume, just as a share point.  I've done this before not using encryption and it worked.  Target computer: iMac, USB drive connected and partitioned. Set to back up using Time Machine in encrypted mode to one partition. Set up to share the other partition by user name and password. SMB turned off.  Source computer: SMB turned off. Can not identify the second partition as a Time Machine available volume - shows as a share point.
