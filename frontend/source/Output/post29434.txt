Is there any way to open a recently closed tab in Safari in iOS? <body> Is there a way to open a recently closed tab in the Safari browser in iOS? I am specifically looking for a solution that works on the iPad.  emFor reference, here is this question for the Mac./em  <answer29435> Yes. Hold down on the code+/code icon that you use to open a new tab in the upper right corner of Safari and you'll be presented with a list of recently closed tabs. Pick one to re-open.   As far as I know this is an iOS 5+ feature, iPad only.  <comment33803> Yes. This is iPad exclusive, as iPhone/iPod touch do not have tabbed browsing. <comment266700> This works in iPhone 6s with iOS 8. Maybe the older version didn't work in iPhone.
