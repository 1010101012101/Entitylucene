Preserve spaces order on monitor unplug on MacBook <body> I'm running the latest macOS (10.12.6) and something keeps annoying me stronga lot/strong with Spaces: if you have an external monitor plugged in and spend some time configuring/customising your spaces placement, when you unplug the monitor, everything is semi-randomized. Semi, because most of the spaces will stay in the same order, but the number of spaces and the location of the spaces will still change.  Here is what I have when the monitor is plugged in:  ul liMonitor  ul lispace 1: empty/li lispace 2: app/li lispace 3: app/li lispace 4: empty/li /ul/li limac book screen  ul lispace 5-10: app (1 per space)/li lispace 11: empty/li /ul/li /ul  When I unplug the monitor, it becomes this:  ul lispace 1: apps that was previously on space 5 and 6/li lispace 2-3: ok, same apps as before/li lispace 4-5: empty/li lispace 6: app that was previously on space 7/li lispace 7: app that was previously on space 8/li li^ repeat up to space 9 / previously space 10/li lispace 10: empty/li lino more space 11/li /ul  This is mostly annoying because I use keyboard shortcut to move between spaces, so basically I have a mental mapping of shortcut to app, but then it's all mixed up as soon as I unplug the monitor.  Is there a way to prevent this behaviour?
