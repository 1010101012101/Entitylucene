How do I use time machine to restore my entire computer, rather than a file? <body> Is is possible? What is the easiest (most hassle-free) way of accomplishing this?  <answer491> To recover your entire system:  1) Connect your Time Machine backup disk to your computer.  If youâ€™re restoring your system because of a problem with your startup disk, make sure the disk has been repaired or replaced.  2) Insert your Mac OS X Install disk, and double-click the Install Mac OS X icon.  3) In the Installer, choose Utilities  Restore System from Backup.  4) In the Restore Your System dialog, click Continue.  5) Select your Time Machine backup volume.  6) Select the Time Machine backup you want to restore.  7) Follow the onscreen instructions.  <answer496> The easiest way would be to start 'Migration Assistant' under Applications/Utilities and then select Time Machine (of course, having it already mounted). This will create a new account with all your entire working data and configuration (on any mac).  <answer89856> In 10.7 and later you can start up from the recovery system and choose Restore From Time Machine Backup.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/JA6xq.jpg" alt="" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/tJenM.jpg" alt=""  Or if the backup was made on a different Mac, Apple recommends using Migration Assistant.

I don't wish to gain any rep from these as they are not my questions. It also give people the ability to expand on them and make them better. <comment481> Makes sense. Thanks for the clarification. Cheers <comment1334> You should mention that this was copied and pasted from [an Apple.com support page](http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?path=Mac/10.5/en/15638.html). <comment70837> And what if you don't have Mac OS X Install disk ? <comment91765> To clarify in step 6, does this mean you can restore the entire system from a previous date, as in "I want this system restored as it was three weeks ago?" <comment144744> I *love it* that my Mac does not have a disc drive so I am 100% sure that none of this disc stuff is required by me
