You can usually access it from almost any program and it's a generic palette, so the changes you make, will be global and shared across applications.  It's almost always (by convention) located in the Edit menu of any application. In this case, this is Google Chrome's Edit menu:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4Q95h.jpg" alt="Edit"  Once you select the emSpecial Characters/em palette, you will be presented with the following palette, where you have to click on it's "toolbar"  and select Customize List:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/aYFMp.jpg" alt="Special Char Palette"  From the sheet list, scroll down until you find Sign/Standard Symbols, and/or experiment with others. You can find things like: ☎☏✆��  Please bear in mind that:   1) The above screenshots were taken under OS X Lion (10.7), the Snow Leopard version of the Character palette is similar and you will find it in the same place, but as far as I can remember, won't allow customization, you'll have to play seek and find. :)  2) OS X Lion supports Emoji, which cannot be displayed in Stack Exchange and I'm not sure what other OSses support them natively.

For those, you'll probably have to try to find and install a font like "Mac Dingbats" that contains Apple-related glyphs. <comment21118> @NR4TR thanks, it's an useful tip!
