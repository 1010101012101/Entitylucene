Check / remove proxies from iPhone USB Personal Hotspot <body> I installed Charles Proxy to do some testing, later I disocvered that any traffic going through Personal Hotspot is also routed though to a local port. I've remove the Mac OS X proxy settings, but unless I have Charles open, I cannot connect over HTTP.  I have checked System Preferences  Network and there's no trace of any proxy settings. Can I use any command line tools to list and remove proxies?  <answer112936> Old question but for anyone else that hits this problem:  Within Terminal.app issue the command:  precodenetworksetup  -setwebproxystate iPhone\ USB off /code/pre  Afterwards, you can check that is disabled by using:  precodenetworksetup -getwebproxy iPhone\ USB /code/pre  This should return codeEnabled: No Server: 127.0.0.1 Port: 8888/code   <comment132550> Can then check that is disabled by using `$ networksetup  -getwebproxy iPhone\ USB `  Should result in  `Enabled: No Server: 127.0.0.1 Port: 8888 `
