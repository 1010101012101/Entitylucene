VPN server authentication error <body> I'm running 10.8.5 (not server) on my home laptop and wanted to set up a vpn server on it. I found a number of tutorials online (eg http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20060616150640529) for configuring vpnd and have gotten to the point where it's up and running. I set up a shared secret password according to the tutorial. When I try to login from my phone using my standard admin account and password it fails with this  precode2013-10-10 16:50:45 PDT Incoming call...

I do not recommend using the dscl command that you're referencing above to configure your user record. The 'pwpolicy' command could be better suited for that task.  <answer232512> I ran into the same error, but none of the solutions posted online worked. It turned out that strongVPN usernames are case sensitive/strong. For example, if the OS X user is "bob", but the account was originally created as "Bob", then when the VPN server tries to authenticate with Directory Services it will fail if the username isn't capitalized the same. This drove me insane for a long time.  Other services (such as ssh) are case-insensitive, so it didn't occur to me to capitalize my login name. Once I did, the VPN server worked like a charm.  I hope this helps someone.  <comment123550> That did it! Stupid error on my part but hopefully will be indexed by the googles and help someone else in the future.
