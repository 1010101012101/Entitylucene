MBP - Switch back to built-in microphone <body> I have some Apple earplugs with a broken microphone, therefore I cannot talk. I would like to switch back to the built-in microphone. However, there is no option to do so in the Sound System Preferences, and only this is shown:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/SIKpJ.png" alt="enter image description here"  And if I unplug the earplugs, I only see the built-in microphone.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Y8rt0.png" alt="enter image description here"  How can I switch to the built-in microphone, when I connect the earplugs?  <answer225854> Apple headphones, works as Combo Jack, ie ear headphone + microphone external, so you'll have to use another headset. give it a try.  <comment274148> Pretty sure you can't; it's a hardware switch, shifts both sources simultaneously. <comment274150> I know that. I did mention that they had a broken mic. So, can I change it? Add to answer please <comment274152> @thebro21 If I understand the answer correctly, it's not possible to switch only one part of audio if you plug in a combo jack. <comment274153> @patrix I see. Thanks for clarification. That does answer my question <comment274187> You want to use only a headphone jack, and built-in microphone? what version of OS X? El Capitan?
