Setup ikev2 VPN server (strongswan) <body> At home I've got a mac mini continuously running as a DB/web/timemachine server. Now I wanted to add VPN server to the mix. Out of interest I read up on it, and it seems like an IPsec/ikev2 server seems to be the most secure.  So I installed strongswan using homebrew:  precodebrew install strongswan --with-suite-b /code/pre  Since I have little knowledge on how to configure strongswan, I was following this tutorial on configuring strongswan. This seems to work but I get stuck at the point where I need to setup the firewall rules.   Has anyone ever tried to setup strongswan on macos? If so, what do I need to do such that I can connect from any network to my home network?
