Text Expander - enable/disable using script <body> Folks, Prior to upgrading to mac os sierra, i had a simple script that used to help me enable or disable textexpansion using text expander.  Here's the script -   precode    tell application "System Events"     key code 80 using {control down}     end tell /code/pre  For some reason this no longer works. Can somebody please help. Basically this script invokes the key press control-F19 using key code 80 for F19. MY script runs but for some reason the system only beeps and there is no effect on Text expander. The script is assigned the f15 key to run.  <comment316764> Does anyone have a solution for this?
