How to copy pages/sections from one Pages document to another? <body> I have read here that you can simply copy/paste pages between documents. When I highlight a page, there is no option to copy and nothing happens (except the typical warning sound) when I hit cmd-c. Drag and drop doesn't work either. I have the newest OSX and pages versions. Is there any solution?  <answer288906> I think this used to be an option in the old version of pages - where you could just highlight a page copy it and past it over to a new doc.   Now you would need to select all content on a page copy that and past it over to a new already existing page on a new document.   To select content: if you open the pages window up (larger than the white page) you can drag a selection box over the content you want, starting from off the page.
