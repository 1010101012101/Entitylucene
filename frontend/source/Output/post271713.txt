Using a list of photos to find from multiple backups, copy, replace and tag <body> Hope someone can help.  After discovering issues with transitioning from iPhotos to Photos, I've been consolidating my backups. My aim is to replace truncated and damaged files (1,400 or so) which I've identified.  As I've got a list of problem files, my thought is I need to firstly search the backups identifying which files do or do not exist, then output the results and paths to a file.  I'm struggling with that bit! I know there must be a logical solution.  The second part. Because the files spread throughout the backup(s), my hope is that I can use the 'cp' command to copy the correct files and overwrite the truncated.  I'm also adding a 'Green' tag to each copied file so I can find the with a custom search later.  This is an example of what I've got so far;  emcp -pf "/Volumes/Mac Time Machine Backup 1/Pictures/iPhoto Library Main.migratedphotolibrary/Masters/2011/05/01/20110501-192510/IMG_6506.JPG" "/Volumes/iMac/Photos without Movies/Masters/2011/05/01/20110501-192510/IMG_6506.JPG";xattr -w com.apple.metadata:_kMDItemUserTags '("Green\n2")' "/Volumes/iMac/Photos without Movies/Masters/2011/05/01/20110501-192510/IMG_6506.JPG"/em  I know it works, as I've copied, replaced and tagged a single file.  I know I could fire the list from Terminal, but with over a thousand files, some maybe missing, it's going to be messy. I guess my question is, would you suggest a more elegant way of finding, copying, replacing and tagging using my list?  I'm a Mac users for many years, but fairly green when it comes to this sort of thing!  Any help most gratefully received.  Thank you!  Dan
