Why do the Image Capture Extension and softwareupdated processes consume so much memory? <body> I recently updated my 2008 MB Pro (2 GB RAM) to Yosemite from 10.6 and I've found that it's often unusably slow. After keeping an eye on Activity Monitor over a couple weeks, I notice that the Image Capture Extension and software updated processes are often using over 400MB of RAM, 95% of which is compressed.   Quitting the processes seems to make the system more responsive, but I assume that these are supposed to be running in the background.  The only applications I usually have running are Safari/Chrome, Textmate and LibreOffice. I've been closing app's from the bar when I'm not using them.  Are there any settings I can tweak to change this behaviour? Could it be a bug? (I've noticed similar complaints elsewhere online)  Notes:  ul liI have a relatively large iPhoto library, but I don't leave the program running/li liNo peripherals (usb keys, cameras, storage, etc) are physically connected/li /ul  Update:  I did a firmware restart several weeks ago and the Image Capture Extension has been behaving so far. softwareupdated continues to have high memory demand, the process regularly ends up with 400+MB of compressed memory. I suspect that at least some of my problems are related to (un)gzip constantly running.  <answer171900> Since I upgrade my late 2009 iMac (4GB memory) to Yosemite, the system had not been performing well. It would be slow at time particularly after it had not been rebooted for a a day or more. In the Activity Monitor I noticed the it Image Capture Extension was steadily growing to become a major user of memory, and the memory pressure was in the yellow as the extension used more memory. I could not determine what program or process was causing this. I then installed two 4GB memory boards increasing my memory to 12GB. Now the Image Capture extension stays at a low value (25-50MB) and does not grow, and the memory pressure stays in the green. Memory is now cheap, your 2GB is likely your problem.   <answer177723> I have a similar problem.  iMac mid 2011 with 12Gb Ram, Yosemite.br Image Capture Extension taking up 6.04Gb of my memory.br I do use my computer for days without restarting.  iPhoto, Preview, iMovie and Final Cut.br I have to restart every now and then.br Doesn't seem like Yosemite clear memory when you close apps.    <answer191187> Apple fixed this problem in the Yosemite 10.10.3 update. Image Capture Extension no longer has the memory leak.  <comment202327> These processes are runnning in the background. They are managed by `launchd` which will restart them automatically. You can kill them at will. <comment202328> Is the problem of `Image Capture Extension` memory abuse appearing after using iPhoto, after making image manipulation within `Preview`, after making a screen capture or using a scanner? <comment202329> The fact that killing `Image Capture Extension` lets you recover a normal behaviour is a hint that this application isn't correctly freeing its memory. <comment203811> I could certainly install more RAM, but I'm not inclined to bother for a 7yro laptop. I'm just hoping to make it usable enough to be a spare computer. <comment210345> Welcome to Ask Different!
