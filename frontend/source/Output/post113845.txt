No sound from headphones under ubuntu 13.10 <body> I have a fresh ubuntu on iMac. I have managed to set up the sound from the native speakers, however, there is still no sound from the headphones. I have disabled automute in alsamixer, but this didn't help. Does anyone know what to do in this case?  <answer117462> The solution was found by adding a row of codeoptions snd-hda-intel model=imac27_122/code to code/etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base.conf/code as explained here.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zSozi.png" alt="enter image description here"
