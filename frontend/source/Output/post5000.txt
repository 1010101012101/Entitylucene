How can I remove pending downloads in iTunes? <body> I have an update for the Dexter game on iPhone which is 400MB in size. Since I don't play this game anymore, I deleted the app. But iTunes still wants me to download the update and tells me I have "1 iTunes Download available".  I tried deleting it (pause then emright-click/em-*delete*), but the download keeps coming back.  Is there a way to permanently remove those available downloads?  <answer5008> Is there a strongDownloads/strong item in the Store area of the column on the left side of iTunes? If so then you can click on it, click on the stalled download, and delete it.  strongEdited to add/strong  There are a couple of places you might check after quitting iTunes. The first is   precode/Users/yourUserName/Music/iTunes/Mobile Applications/Downloads/ /code/pre  Make sure it's empty, and if not, remove what's in there (set it aside so you can put it back if it confuses iTunes later).  The other place is:  precode/Users/yourUserName/Music/iTunes/Mobile Applications/ /code/pre  and look for the file codeDexter.ipa/code (or codeDexteGame.ipa/code or whatever the game is called). Delete this file -- it's the actual now-outdated game that iTunes is trying to update.  Otherwise iTunes has the need to download it stored in its database and doesn't care about files.   I take it that agreeing to the download doesn't help?  <answer35552> Go to the file,br Slide slowly to the left on the download icon until you see a Delete button in a red box.  Try it few times if it doesn't work.  <answer38549> I had the same issue w/ two apps that I did not want to download. I finally downloaded both apps and then deleted them.   <comment5069> Did that. The download keeps coming back. <comment5095> I added a couple of suggestions to my answer. If those don't work and accepting the download doesn't work then the only thing I can think of isn an iTunes wipe (after backing up all of the iTunes content) and reinstall. <comment5108> A much simpler solution (to wiping iTunes, +1 for your answer above which is detailed and good) is just to let the thing download and then delete it, assuming you're on broadband. <comment5112> @mat Thanks, I'll try that. <comment5113> @msa I thought of it too. That'll be my last resort. <comment5238> I'm going to mark this answer as accepted, even though I had to download it -twice-. <comment32771> Have you tried logging into the iTunes store and hiding the app in your account before deleting it? <comment32779> Is that something you could always do? I thought it was something new (or is it only the fact that you can now also do it on iOS?). But no, I didn't tried that at the time. <comment32780> Apologies, I didn't look at the date of the question until you pointed it out. It is new. <comment40506> Your caps lock is on. <comment93449> BIG UPS to @MatthewFrederick!!!!!! There are not words to describe how angry I've been even looking at iTunes the last month!!! <comment170449> "Let the thing download and then delete it" was the only thing that worked for me. <comment171264> I recently had this problem and for whatever reason, the only way I could get it to work now was to let it download and then delete it.
