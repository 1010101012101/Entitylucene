Music file downloaded by iTunes is wrong <body> I am listening to Pink Floyd's album, which songs form a coherent set of songs (no silence between the two songs) and Apple Music subscription apparently has the wrong file. That album has been released in studio version (this is the one which I am listening to), but also in several "live editions" which completely do not fit with the studio version. Unfortunately one of the "live" songs is being played instead of "studio" song breaking the album.  Is there a way to override the choice of songs downloaded by iTunes from Apple Music by providing a mp3 file (which I do own legally).
