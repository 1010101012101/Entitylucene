Where did the command-backtick keyboard shortcut go in 10.7 Lion? <body> With every Mac OS X I've ever used, hitting command-backtick (`) cycled to the next window.  I just installed Mac OS X 10.7 (on top of a perfectly fresh 10.6), and command-backtick does nothing at all.  Did this feature go away?  <answer50759> This feature is still present (I'm using 10.7.3 and it works for me).  Go to emSystem Preferences  Keyboard/em and check the keyboard shortcuts. In the list of 'Keyboard &amp; Text Input' shortcuts you should see 'Move focus to next window' kbd⌘/kbd+kbd`/kbd.   Make sure it is checked, and it should work.  <answer50781> You might also be interested in Hyperswitch.  Along with kbdCommand ⌘/kbd + kbdTab ⇥/kbd, hyperswitch allows kbdOption ⌥/kbd + kbdTab ⇥/kbd to switch between windows of the same app. I find it much more useful than kbdCommand ⌘/kbd + kbd~ (tilde)/kbd since kbdCommand ⌘/kbd + kbd~ (tilde)/kbd only iterates through all windows, rather than just toggling between two.  <comment58154> (I know the answer, but it was tricky to find, so I was going to file my own question-and-answer, but apparently I need to wait 8 hours for that.) <comment58176> Isn't this the default? I've upgraded machines to Lion and used new Macs with Lion and all have had this turned on. <comment58179> That character is not a tilde. This is a tilde: ~. <comment58184> Yes, that is the answer I had found.  From a fresh install of 10.6.3 from a retail DVD onto a blank disk, upgraded immediately to 10.7.3 from the Mac App Store, it had a default of command-F1.  It's doubly strange, since typing command-F1 didn't even work for that, even though both the command and F1 keys work fine in other contexts!
