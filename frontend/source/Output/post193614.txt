Devices not showing up for AirDrop <body> I have   ul liiPhone 5 (with iOS 8.3)/li liMacBook Pro Early 2013 (with OS X Yosemite 10.10.3)/li liiPad Air (with iOS 8.3)/li /ul  My iPhone is paired with the MacBook, so e.g when my phone rings, I can see it in my computer. But when I want to AirDrop photos from my iPhone the MacBook, then I can't see the MacBook in my iPhone AirDrop targets.  I can see the iPad, I can see my wife's iPhone, but not the MacBook.  On MacBook, I can see the iPad, my wife's phone and even my iPhone and I can drop to there, but not the other way around.  Before I started troubleshooting, the iPhone and MacBook were mutually invisible (I only saw iPad from both). After a while of trying things and sending files back and forth, my MacBook started to see the iPhone, but I did not manage to make it work from the other way. Still, the iPhone seems to be much "less" visible than the iPad - which I see almost instantly and always, the iPhone only seems to appear after a while.  Just to make it clear:  ul liboth iPhone and MBP have BT turned on/li liboth have AirDrop visibility set to Everyone/li /ul  I would be glad for any suggestions to fix this - what settings to check, logs, whatever.  <answer193628> For AirDrop to work, you need   ol liWi-Fi and Bluetooth on —although you don't need to be connected to the same network for AirDrop to work./li liAirDrop activated —probably the "Everyone" setting will help with visibility on iOS./li liIf your Mac is older than 2012, you may have some issues./li liYou have to be closer than 30 feet (9 m)./li liYou may wish to check your firewall, but given your specific situation —you see the iPad— that may not be a problem./li /ol  Check this document in case I missed something.  <answer235125> Try sending a file to the iPhone from the Mac.  My iPhone was able to discover my Mac by doing so when I was having issues sending a file to my 2012 MacBook Air (OSX10.11.3) from my iPhone6S Plus (iOS9.3.2), leading me to this page. I tried all the settings and workarounds mentioned on this page and my Mac was able to discover my iPhone, but not vice versa.  <answer244641> I was having the same issues as described in this post.  That is:  ol liCan send file from Mac to iPhone./li liCan not see Mac on iPhone airdrop screen./li /ol  To "fix" it I did this:  ol liOn Mac: Stopped a utility called "TokenLock".  (it uses bluetooth)./li liOn Mac: Forgot iPhone./li liOn Mac: Re-pair to the iPhone./li liOn iPhone: Accept pairing./li liOn iPhone: Observe message that "Connection Unsuccessful 'Mike's MBP' is not supported"/li liOn iPhone: Observe that despite message Mike's MBP became available for Air drop on iPhone./li liOn iPhone: send pictures to Mac./li /ol  <answer246218> After pulling out hair for almost an hour, tried the following which solved the issue.

I did again run through your checklist and I have to confirm that all items are checked. Both have WiFi&BT on, both seen by Everyone. Mac is Early 2013. Devices just next to each other. Firewall disabled. I did try to run Console App, which shows some activity and some error, but I am not sure if it's related - I would like to confirm before posting, but I can't match the given IDs and addresses to anything (e.g. phone MAC or IP address, <comment230998> It may be relevant to consider that the [iPhone won't have Wi-Fi / Bluetooth connectivity always on to save battery](http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/49753/38539). That may account for it not appearing instantly (if it is locked while you search for it). <comment231072> So I run Console again at home. I see some entries regarding discovery of the iPad, but nothing which looks like relared to the iPhone. <comment231073> I know that when iPhone/iPad is locked, it's not shown. It works quite nicely with my iPad and my wife's iPhone - lock, disappear, unlock, they appear again. But still no joy between my iphone and MBP. <comment231075> Sorry to hear that, it works almost instantly on my setup (iPhone 6 iOS 8.4, iPhone 5 iOS 8.3, rMBP late 2013 OS X10.10.3). <comment231159> Yes, that what I would expect. And I would get to that state. There are some more suggestions on internet like logout from iCloud and login again, which I might try when I have time, but I hoped there might be some more straightforward procedure to find out where the problem is. <comment262625> I have the same problem. Is there a solution to this? My iPhone 6s doesnt show my MAC from 2013 on airdrop settings :( <comment262626> It now started to work for me, but hard to tell why - I am on different wifi, I have iPhone6s instead of 5 (and iOS 9) and some time has passed. <comment285737> I started my Mac and the iPhone 5c and now both shows up in AirDrop <comment287553> "AirDrop is a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma." -- Sir Winston Churchill. <comment316118> I tried the steps 3+4 and it seemed to work. I will see if it will help multiple times and if so, will accept your answer. <comment366674> When I did step 3, my MacBook appears on iPad.
