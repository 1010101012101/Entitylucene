Xcode 6.1 , Storyboard, Ctrl+Drag doesnt work, not even blue line <body> I just upgraded to XCode 6.1  I started to create a Mac, Cocoa application.  In story board, i put a button on view controller, and tried to CTRL+DRAG it to the source code.  Problem is that it doesn't work, at least i have to see the blue line despite of where im going to drop it, but nothing happens at all and blue line doesnt appear and control stays put :-s   What am i doing wrong?  <answer158720> If you right click on the button you must see a menu with button actions. Move the cursor over any circle and it will appear a Plus symbol. Select and drag to your source.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bngFL.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer158729> I have not played with Storyboards much.  But I think you need to drag to the viewController.h file rather than the AppDelegate.h  <answer158759> Well, i know its stupid, but i found the problem.  It doesnt work because im connecting to the Mac using VNC :( It seems connecting to Mac remotely , doesn't reproduce or simulate Keyboard keys and mouse clicks, even though i can see ctrl key goes down on "Keyboard Viewer" when i press ctrl, but something is wrong with VNC that prevent Xcode to act correctly.  I used two different VNC clients and none of them worked, I update this post if i can find a solution.  <answer187969> just delete everything inside DerivedData Folder (/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData)  It worked for me :)  <answer231912> I realise I'm a bit late, but my solution to this problem was to ensure that the class that interface builder was "dragging to" was the same as the class that it was under: in other words, everything must be in the same class.  For example, if I have classes codeA/code and codeB/code, and a storyboard: I would need to ensure that the storyboard is set to a class. If I set it to codeA/code, it would only connect elements to class codeA/code, if I set the class to codeB/code, attempting to connect elements to class codeA/code would have a blue line but no codeInsert Outlet or Action/code or codeConnect Outlet/Action/code.  hr  A visual representation:  precodeViewController.swift:  import Cocoa class FirstClass: NSViewController {     // some code here }  class SecondClass: NSViewController {     // some more code here } /code/pre  Here we have declared two classes, codeFirstClass/code and codeSecondClass/code. If you look at  your blank storyboard (codeMain.storyboard/code for the purpose of this answer), you should see something similar to as follows:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HrSku.png" alt="Normal Main.storyboard look."  Now, click the window under the View Controller (blank on a new project), and select the tab that looks a bit like a newspaper in the Inspector.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1tvGe.png" alt="View Controller and class."  You should see the default class (ViewController) formatted as a placeholder string in the text field for "Class". Attempting to kbdControl/kbd+Drag would not allow you to create an instance of whatever element you're trying to add to either codeFirstClass/code or codeSecondClass/code, but only allow it for the class specified, codeViewController/code (for some reason I can't screenshot it).  To add an element to codeFirstClass/code, change the text in the Class field to codeFirstClass/code (with any luck autocompletion should finish it for you): img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/RjWab.png" alt="As seen"  Now, kbdControl/kbd+Dragging an element from the Interface Builder to codeFirstClass/code should work, but will not apply to codeSecondClass/code. Change the custom class name to whichever class suits your needs.  <comment186578> Hijherran, thanks for your answer. Actually i am aware of that, but my concern is why CTRL+DRAG doesnt work, that weird. I would like to use ctrl+drag as i used to <comment186579> OK, but, could you see this menu when you right click? <comment186585> yes of course, i see this menu and when i drag circles beside menu items, i can see the blueline. but when i press ctrl and drag a control (buttton), that blue line doesnt appear. <comment186587> Yes, you are right and i intend to do that, problem is that the blue line doesn't appear at first place, no matter where i am going to drag it to. Its not only in StoryBoard, i have same problem with xib files as well.
