Install rEFInd on separate partition (Errors) <body> I am trying to install rEFInd a separate partition but have run into an error. I'm doing this because I want to install Ubuntu on my other partition (separate from my Mac and and rEFInd partition). Here's my diskutil list:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dyJvs.png" alt="enter image description here"  I run the command code./install.sh --alldrivers --ownhfs /dev/disk0s5/code and get this output:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lZG09.png" alt="enter image description here"  I don't know where to look for the error messages. The rEFInd partition is formatted as OS X Extended (Journaled). Once I get this working, I want the rEFInd partition to load up first when I boot my computer. It's not recognized as a startup partition right now.  <comment257467> rEFInd needs to be put on an EFI formatted partition, which is essentially FAT. Please make sure you capitalize the EFI part in rEFInd, as that's the proper name. <comment257475> @IronCraftMan I formatted it as MS-DOS(FAT), but still get the same error.
