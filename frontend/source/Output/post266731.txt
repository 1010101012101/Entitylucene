How to backup a whole homedir in iCloud on OS X? <body> strongBackground/strong  I'm running OS X Sierra in a MacBook Pro. I use iCloud to backup all of my files. I went to codeApple/system preferences/icloud/options/code to select the apps and documents that are stored in iCloud.  strongExample/strong  I want to move a whole directory to iCloud. For example I currently have a user directory codeMacintosh HD/Users/myUserName/code.  strongQuestion/strong  How do I get my full user directory to be tracked on iCloud? So in my example that would be codemyUserName/code.  <comment334494> I don't believe iCloud natively supports this behavior. You could try writing a script that periodically copies (perhaps a compressed version of) your home directory to iCloud, but depending on the size of that directory, that could get pretty tedious. For the sort of backup functionality you're talking about, [Time Machine](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201250) is probably what you should use instead.
