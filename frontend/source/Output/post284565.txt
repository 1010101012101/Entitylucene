MacOS shutting down after password and loading screen, safe mode not working <body> After entering password on login, the loader gets stuck 2/3rds in and shuts down. Seems like my account is corrupt somehow. Have tried to access safe mode to create an alternate admin account (pressing down shift key while booting), but the normal login screen just shows up again.  Any way to rebuild my user account without having to do erase and reinstall MacOS?  Edit: Single user mode, CMD-S on boot, isnt working either, it gives some kind of build error which I can't recall atm.  Specs: MacOS Sierra, Macbook from early 2012.  <answer284583> To create a new Admin account you will need to delete the /var/db/.AppleSetupDone file.  If single user mode is unavailable you may be able to remove it via Terminal when booted from Recovery HD.  precodemount -uw / rm /var/db/.AppleSetupDone /code/pre  Reference :  http://www.theinstructional.com/guides/how-to-re-run-the-os-x-setup-assistant  You may have more serious issues with your OS however that should be taken care of first if you can't use single user mode.  <comment358859> It sounds like you need to focus on fixing single user mode first.  Have you been able to boot from the Recovery partition?
