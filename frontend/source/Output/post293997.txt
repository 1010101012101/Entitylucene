IPhone 6 randomly plays Yodeling sound <body> My wife's IPhone 6 will randomly play a looping Yodeling sound. It usually does this while she is not using the phone (middle of the night while running a "fan sound" app, asleep in her pocket in the middle of a meeting, asleep on the couch while she is knitting, etc...)  The only way to stop it is to restart the phone. She will close all background apps, but that doesn't stop the noise.   It used to happen every couple days. Now it is happening 1 or 2 times a day. It has happened at all times of the day.  It is not an alarm or a calendar event. The yodel noise is also not a sound she can find anywhere on her phone (not a ringtone or an alarm or a part of a song)  We haven't tried a factory reset yet. I'm worried that this is an annoying part of some app she downloaded (that plays the sound even after it has been closed).. but I don't know what app that might be.  What might be causing this? How can we fix it?  <comment371036> Definitely sounds like an app notification. Don't factory reset—if no one can provide an answer just go through **General** → **Notifications** and start disabling notification sounds to find the culprit.
