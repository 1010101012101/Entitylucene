How to deal with commands of conflicting names listed in `brew doctor`? <body> So after codebrew doctor/codeI`ll get the following without any recommendation:  precodeWarning: You have external commands with conflicting names.  Found command `brew-cask` in following places: /usr/local/bin/brew-cask /usr/local/Library/Taps/caskroom/homebrew-cask/cmd/brew-cask.rb /code/pre  Is there a way to settle that conflict?  <answer219001> I don't use casks much, but on my test machine I just tapped the cask infrastructure to see what it installs today. I have the codebrew-cask.rb/code file and not the one in code/usr/local/bin/code  If you have a backup system, back up and then delete code/usr/local/bin/brew-cask/code and rerun codebrew doctor/code. You could also rename the file if you don't want to hassle with backups.  precodemv /usr/local/bin/brew-cask /usr/local/bin/ZZdeleteZZbrew-cask brew doctor /code/pre  That way a program or script calling the tool won't see the file (or sym link) in /usr/local/bin. You could then test things a bit and clean up the file in question. It also is easier to fix if my hunch that the one in codebin/code is needed somewhere and the tool is wrong to complain about both.  Additionally, there looks like a change was made somewhat recently to cask/brew integration:  ul lihttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/27770168/how-to-uninstall-homebrew-cask/li /ul  My uninstall steps were different than the ones linked above since I installed cask today and not from before. My results might not match yours in that case :(  <answer219012> You could also remove the cask additions and see if the clean up script removes the remnants:  precodebrew uninstall --force brew-cask /code/pre  At that point, you can re-run the installation according to the current instructions:  precodebrew tap caskroom/cask /code/pre  Just the uninstall alone solved your issue for me when I ran across it.  <answer219107> I faced this exact warning today. For me, simple codebrew update &amp;&amp; brew upgrade &amp;&amp; brew doctor/code worked.  Got finally, the satisfying codeYour system is ready to brew/code log.   <answer219429> Important December update (from https://github.com/caskroom/homebrew-cask):  Homebrew-Cask will now be kept up to date together with Homebrew.  If you havenâ€™t yet, to switch to the new system, run:  precodebrew uninstall --force brew-cask; brew update  /code/pre  <comment264907> Since cask runs on top of brew - did you run the recommended cleanup tools? It's probably not going to solve things, but it might help isolate the issue to brew or cask: `brew update ; brew cleanup ; brew cask cleanup` - Also - could you list one cask you use so we can try replicating your setup? <comment264908> For the first time I'll get the following when running clean up tools: `Warning: Skipping czmq: most recent version 3.0.2_3 not installed` `Warning: Skipping git: most recent version 2.6.4 not installed` `Warning: Skipping libsodium: most recent version 1.0.7 not installed` `Warning: Skipping node: most recent version 5.2.0 not installed` <comment264909> I'll try that. Thank you! <comment264911> I'll moved it and `Your system is ready to brew` <comment264912> But the upper `Warnings` after clean up remains <comment264913> @HiThere Yeah - I'm not always so hot to fix a brew doctor warning until I have an actual downstream error. Yes - they often can cause issues, but brew itself is so large - not everyone builds from source and not everyone uses casks at all. Some people only come for the casks. Please ping me if you have an error with a specific package install. I'm trying to learn more how the brews work, so I'm up for real problems to help troubleshoot and possibly solve. <comment264914> I got the node warning - so I just `brew rm` those packages and will let them install next time I need them. I think a cleanup / migration step was added recently, but can't speak for certain on that yet without more digging. For now, I'm happy to have a clean cleanup run. <comment264924> That seems like a better solution if it works :-) <comment264956> May I ask what that command is doing? <comment265080> I had two versions installed. This removed the offending one. See  https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/blob/master/share/doc/homebrew/FAQ.md for details. <comment273820> This solved it for me. Thanks! Nice of you to post that command so that I didn't have to fish it out.
