Color Profiles Wonky - Mac OSX / Photoshop, PDFs, etc <body> Been trying to print a simple JPEG file (set in RGB mode) to my HP 3511 Deskjet. I know my printer is capable of printing in color. It's done it before. I did a test print the other night through HP, which had little colored blocks on it, and those printed fine.  When I go to Photoshop, and hit File - Print... my options are pretty limited. If I select let Photoshop Manage Colors, my print comes out in draft mode, grayscale. If I select Printer Manage Colors, my only Printer Profiles are Generic Gray Gamma 2.2, Generic Gray profile, and sGray. I can not select anything else.  I'm on a Macbook laptop. I updated to Mavericks a bit ago, don't know if that changed a bunch of stuff. I tried updating my printer driver yesterday too- that didn't make a difference.  When I print from Adobe PDF, it does the same thing. And from Preview. What is going on!!!!!
