Booting to windows bootcamp causes the machine to keep rebooting <body> I have a MacBook Pro late 2015 with Windows installed via bootcamp. Unfortunately, I don't use it often so I don't know exactly when my problem came about.  When I boot to windows, the screen remains black (lit, but black) with no Windows logo. Moreover, when I turned my sound up, I discovered that it kept playing the boot chime over and over again. My guess is that it can't find the OS, but this doesn't make any sense to me, since I haven't touched its partition.  I did, however, create a new partition out of my MacintoshHD and subsequently rejoined the two. But this didn't affect the Bootcamp partition (shouldn't have affected the bootcamp partition?).   Does anyone have any ideas for what I can do to solve this? I can still see the partition in Disk Utility. I'd prefer not to reinstall (I accidentally corrupted it a year ago and the reinstallation process was not fun).
