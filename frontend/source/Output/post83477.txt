Error copying large file to usb 16GB Thumbdrive <body> Trying to copy a file (Win7_IE8.vhd) to a USB drive.  The file is 9.07GB in size according to my Mac file info.  The USB drive is 16GB.  I bought it new 10 minutes ago. This is its first use.  I get: The item "Win7_IE8.vhd" can't be copied because it is too large for the volume's format.  How can I overcome this issue to copy this file which seems like it should fit?  <answer83482> The answer was that the default formatting was FAT32 which has a limit of 4GB per file.  The answer was to format the drive.  As I'm copying from Mac to Linux I chose the Ex-FAT format, all the better to interchange with.  I used the Disk Utility which is within a 'Utilities' folder which is itself at the bottom of the applications list.  <comment108288> Ex-Fat is the best option indeed. It reads and writes on OS X, Linux, and Windows systems.
