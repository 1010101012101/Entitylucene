MacBook is displaying the message "no hardware installed" when I click on wifi? <body> So I have a MacBook Pro 2009 running OS X El Capitan. Recently the wifi has stopped working.   When I click on the WiFi icon it displays the message "No hardware installed", but Ethernet still works.   Is there any way of fixing this by using a WiFi dongle or something of the sort, if so do I need a specific dongle and how do I install it?  Thanks for any help.  <answer277159> Try resetting the NVRAM and SMC first before going out and spending money on a new WiFi adapter.  You can do this by:  strongNVRAM/strong  ol liReboot the Mac and immediately hold down Command + Option + P + R keys together/li liContinue holding all Command+Option+P+R keys until you hear the Mac reboot sound again, then release all keys concurrently/li /ol  strongSMC/strong  ol liPlug the laptop into a power source/li liPress and hold all of these keys at the same time: Control + Shift + Option + Power/li liRelease the keys/li liPress the Power button to turn it back on/li /ol  If that doesn't fix it, then you might need to buy an adapter.  There are a lot of good ones out there that work with Macs.  I would just go to your favorite online retailer and search WiFi adapters for Mac.  That should bring you plenty of options.  <answer277165> If you are getting the message "No hardware Installed" it means that macOS is not detecting your WiFi adapter for one of two reasons:  ul liIt's not installed (it physically doesn't exist)/li liIt has failed/li /ul  Chances are it's the second option.  You can confirm this by running Apple Hardware Test (AHT).  Hold the D key while booting from a powered off state with the AC adapter connected.    Regardless if the first or the second, you will probably have to replace it with another Airport card  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uNLBm.png" alt="enter image description here"  ifixit.com has an excellent tutorial and step-by-step to replace the board.  It's a time consuming reapir - I wouldn't say difficult, but more detail oriented.  If this is not your cup of tea, I recommend taking it in for service.  <answer293944> I had this same problem. I reset NVRAM and SMC to no effect. I also ran the Apple Hardware Test and it came back as a hardware problem. But...  But then I did this, and my wifi was back, working just like new.  ol liSwitch to Finder/li liClick on 'Go' (top menu) - 'Go to Folder...'/li liCopy and paste this into the field: code/Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/code/li liFind and trash codeNetworkInterfaces.plist/code/li liReboot/li /ol  I would suggest making a copy of this file, naming it something different and storing it on your desktop before deleting the file - just in case. But this worked for me. Hope it works for you.
