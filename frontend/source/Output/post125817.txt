Macbook Webcam light turns on for a second when computer is waked <body> Most of the time when I login or open the lid my macbook bro mid 2012, the webcam light turns on for about a second and then turns off. Is there anything I should be worried about like a virus using my webcam to take photos of me from my computer or something?   <answer125849> It's possible you have installed, or someone else has installed, a system utility to capture the image from the iSight when opened. This is often something an anti-theft application might do, in order to track down the user of a stolen laptop.  One combination of utilities that can do this sort of thing is "sleepwatcher" (http://www.bernhard-baehr.de/) and imagesnap (http://iharder.sourceforge.net/current/macosx/imagesnap/)  You might check to see if there is a file at   precode/etc/rc.awake /code/pre  or an invisible file in your home directory called   precode.sleep /code/pre  If so, sleepwatcher is installed.   <comment147281> Possibly, but the webcam can also be used without the light on... As per Dutch government, put a sticker on it if you don't use it on purpose.
