Mac mini as a "router" <body> I'm looking to use a Mac mini as an endpoint in a site-to-site vpn. Our router doesn't support OpenVPN so i have a static route on the router that looks like  precode10.22.0.0/16 -&gt; 10.1.1.28  /code/pre  ul li10.22.0.0/16 is the subnet I want the office to connect to  /li li10.1.1.28 is the mac-mini. /li /ul  On the Mac mini traffic comes in 'en0' and via the routing table on the mini should go out 'utun1'  precode 10.22/16           172.16.130.21      UGSc            2     1107   utun1 /code/pre  From inside the office the static route on the router is working. If I do a traceroute from a laptop in the office I see it hitting 10.1.1.28 but it ends there. On the Mac mini I've only tried to run  precodesysctl -w net.inet.ip.forwarding=1 /code/pre  That hasn't helped... I've done this a lot in Linux and needed iptables rules.   So is there a trick in OS X?  <answer179265> Does your router support VPN passthrough? You can then setup OpenVPN on the Mac and use port forwarding on the router.  <comment212455> Please add the system version! <comment212460> If it is 04.01.2015 then it would not work.
