Mavericks kicks out users on my Windows server when locally connecting with Remote Desktop <body> I recently upgraded my macbook into Mavericks. I have a Windows Server 2003 and I connect several machines to that server. The machines that connect to this server are all Windows based except for this Mac machine. We connect using the Remote Desktop Service, and we connect both from within our local area server and externally.   Before I did the upgrade, I had no problems connecting to the server. Now, with Maverick, every time I connect, the other users that were already connected remotely to that machine get kicked out.   I am not sure if this is the proper place to ask this. Id appreciate some feedback on where can the best place to post this problem be and how I can give more details about it.   Edit: I discovered this happens when I access within my local area network. When I access the network from an external network, I do not have the problem mentioned above.   <comment127141> Your edit says it happens on both the local network and external network, but the way you formatted it suggests you intended otherwise. Can you clarify? <comment127154> Clarified. Thank you for pointing that out. <comment127381> Is it clear now, Than? <comment127447> It's clear to me, but unfortunately I do not know the answer
