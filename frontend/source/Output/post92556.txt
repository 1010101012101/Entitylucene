iphone (or ipad mini) as a helmet mounted display <body> I like to watch educational videos from coursera on my iphone or ipad mini while I walk.  I was thinking of making a helmet mounted mount where I could essentially do without holding the ipad in my hand - perhaps using a bicycle helmet as a starting point.  Question: Do you know of something like this that already exists?  Note: The TregoBag will not fit my requirements I think.  Thanks.
