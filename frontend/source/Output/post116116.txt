How to write to a Windows formatted disk from OS X? <body> I have 4 external hard disk formatted on Windows as NTFS, but they are lying unused since I bought a Mac. So I am looking forward somehow I should be able to write to those disc without having to format them! Is there anyway I can do that?  I also tried NTFS-3G but it is giving me this error!  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dYVHJ.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer116118> h2Paragon NTFS or Tuxera NTFS/h2  Paragon NTFS and Tuxera NTFS will let you read/write NTFS partitions on OS X. They integrate with Disk Utility as well, letting you erase and partition such disks.  <comment135868> "Tuxera NTFS for Mac" should also work with OS X Mavericks: http://www.tuxera.com/products/tuxera-ntfs-for-mac/
