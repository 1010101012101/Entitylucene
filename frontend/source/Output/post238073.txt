Screenshot Save Destination <body> I am constantly using the kbdcommand/kbd-kbdshift/kbd-kbd4/kbd command to take a screenshot, since it is so easy, but it will always save to my Desktop, and I like having my Desktop clean. It is becoming a hassle to constantly move all my screenshots into a separate folder. Is there a way to change the save destination of the screenshots automatically? I would really like it to be able to save in a folder.  <answer238076> Yes, you can change the default screenshot location with the following Terminal command where code&lt;path&gt;/code is the location you want them to be saved:  precodedefaults write com.apple.screencapture location &lt;path&gt; /code/pre  Then relaunch SystemUIServer for it to take effect:  precodekillall SystemUIServer /code/pre  <answer238082> You can also download a free app called "TinkerTool" if you are interested in doing it without going into the Terminal.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ThwhS.png" alt="enter image description here"
