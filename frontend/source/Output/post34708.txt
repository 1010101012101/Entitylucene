Is my iPhone model number MC922LL/A unlocked or locked? <body> I have seen that there are many other model numbers of iPhone 4S's, but I have not seen any info about model number MC922ll/A  Is an iPhone 4S of this model unlocked or locked to a specific mobile carrier?  <answer34710> It appears from various sales websites that this model number is locked to AT&amp;T. (Source)  <answer34762> I got a 4S MC922LL as replacement phone from A pple(my 4S was having issues).  I put my friend's T-Mobile sim and it is working.br I've tried it multiple times even after restarting the phone and it is still working with the T-Mobile Sim.  It seems to be unlocked.  <answer34765> If it's anything like it is here in the UK, it's the device's UID that determines whether it is locked - Apple have a massive database of the UID's along with references as to whether they are locked (this is why warrantee swap-outs always come out with the same lock).   Normally contacting the networks, if you're a customer in 'good standing' they'll let you unlock for 'international use' - which is exactly the same as unlocking the phone.   <answer166534> I have this iphone model # and it's actually one of the first iphone 4s that were sold by AT&amp;T via their site/retail/warehouse. It can be unlocked via Appple or At&amp;T themselves. I got it unlocked when my contract expired and moved to T-mobile ever since.   <answer209486> AT&amp;T has a site to check and ask for device unlock:  ul lihttps://www.att.com/es-us/deviceunlock/#//li /ul  <comment252699> Welcome to Ask Different.
