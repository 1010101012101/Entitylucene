iTunes Playlist missing songs iTunes ver. 12.5.1.21 <body> I have recently updated to iTunes 12.5.1.21 on a Windows 10 Pc. Many of my playlists are missing songs. I researched this issue and it looks like you can restore your iTunes library to correct this issue. Well upon restoring my library to a previous date it will display all my playlist with the correct amount of songs. Then after 10 seconds it revert to the new playlist with the missing songs.   Is there some sort of playlist sync that is currently prioritizing a new playlist?
