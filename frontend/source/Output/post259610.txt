How to make fullscreen windows appear next to the current space with "...rearrange spaces based on recent use..." disabled <body> I keep a lot of apps running at the same time. I keep some apps in fullscreen next to the first desktop for general usage, and some other fullscreen apps next to a second desktop for "work" stuff.  The problem is that when I put an app in fullscreen it is placed next to the last space. I know that enabling strong"Preferences  Mission Control  Automatically rearrange spaces based on most recent use"/strong would make apps to be placed next to the desktop I'm in, but I chose to disable it because I don't want spaces to move.  I noticed that there's a (bad) workaround:br - keep the green fullscreen button of an app clicked until it is presented the choice for placing it in the left or the right side of the screen;br - release the mouse in order to assign the app to a side;br - click anywhere on the side of the app; the app should now be fullscreen and should be placed in the next space (not at the end).  strongIs there a way to keep that option disabled while at the same time be able to open apps in fullscreen directly next to the desktop I'm currently in?/strong
