Leopard Mail app keyboard shortcut <body> I've recently switched to Chrome for developing and have thus started using the build-in Developer Tools instead of my previously preferred Firebug workflow. Just today I found a keyboard shortcut (Command-Shift-I) that jumps straight to Inspect Element rather than just opening the Developer Tools like Command-Option-I does.  The problem I'm having is that this shortcut also opens the Mail app, which I do not use. I've looked in the Keyboard Shortcuts preferences and I don't see the aforementioned shortcut anywhere. Anybody know where I can disable this shortcut?  <answer7901> kbdCommand/kbd + kbdShift/kbd + kbdC/kbd  Will open up the inspector, and let you click an object to Inspect.   https://superuser.com/questions/175529/google-chrome-keyboard-shortcut-to-view-resources-inspect-element  <answer49583> hotkeys for Chrome on Mac OS X (from here):  ul likbdCommand ⌘/kbd + kbdOption ⌥/kbd + kbdI/kbd to open Developer Tools/li likbdCommand ⌘/kbd + kbdOption ⌥/kbd + kbdJ/kbd to open Developer Tools and bring focus to the Console./li likbdCommand ⌘/kbd + kbd Shift ⇧/kbd + kbdC/kbd to toggle Inspect Element mode.  /li /ul  <comment8553> I don't know where you found the Command+Shift+I to Inspect Element.  In Chrome, if you go to File, right above Print you see Command+Shift+I is Email Page Location. <comment8557> You're right. Somehow I got this confused with Command + Shift + C as zevlag pointed out below. Thanks. <comment8558> My confusion. See comment above, thanks for the help.
