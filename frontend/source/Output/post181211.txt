No Stable VPN using Cisco AnyConnect on iOS 7 <body> I am attempting to establish a VPN using Cisco's Anyconnect on iOS7. Once I hit "connect" it repeatedly connects and un-connects. The multiple connections also show up in the log file. I have tried to do the same thing with an iOS8 device and have had no issues at all. The application states that it is compatible with iOS6 and up, however this is the only OS that I am having issues on.   I hope someone can help! Thanks!  <comment215470> what is your Version ? 3.0.12249? and what is your device? check here http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/vpn_client/anyconnect/anyconnect30/release/notes/rn-ac3-0-iOS.html#pgfId-1154896 <comment215474> the device is a iPhone 4s and the Cisco version is 3.0.12249 yes, so according to that it should be compatible.
