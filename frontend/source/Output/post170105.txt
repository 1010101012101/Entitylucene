List USB devices on OSX command line <body> Can I List USB devices on OSX - similar to codelsusb/code on Linux. I know I can access from codeSystem Information/code.  <answer170108> Run this command:  precodesystem_profiler SPUSBDataType /code/pre  <answer170118> In addition to codesystem_profiler SPUSBDataType/code (suggested by @kjs), you can also use codeioreg -p IOUSB/code:  precode$ ioreg -p IOUSB  +-o Root  &lt;class IORegistryEntry, id 0x100000100, retain 10&gt;   +-o EHCI Root Hub Simulation@1A,7  &lt;class IOUSBRootHubDevice, id 0x100000227,$   | +-o HubDevice@fa100000  &lt;class IOUSBHubDevice, id 0x10000027a, registered, $   | | +-o Apple Internal Keyboard / Trackpad@fa120000  &lt;class IOUSBDevice, id 0$   | | +-o BRCM2070 Hub@fa110000  &lt;class IOUSBHubDevice, id 0x1000002b4, registe$   | |   +-o Bluetooth USB Host Controller@fa113000  &lt;class IOUSBDevice, id 0x10$   | +-o FaceTime HD Camera (Built-in)@fa200000  &lt;class IOUSBDevice, id 0x100000$   +-o EHCI Root Hub Simulation@1D,7  &lt;class IOUSBRootHubDevice, id 0x100000228,$     +-o HubDevice@fd100000  &lt;class IOUSBHubDevice, id 0x10000027b, registered, $       +-o IR Receiver@fd110000  &lt;class IOUSBDevice, id 0x100000288, registered,$ /code/pre  By default it clips to the window's width (80 chars in the example above), so you may want to add code-w0/code to get a full-width display. Also, adding code-l/code will show details (probably more than you need) about each of the devices:  precode$ ioreg -p IOUSB -w0 -l     +-o Root  &lt;class IORegistryEntry, id 0x100000100, retain 10&gt;   | {   |   "IOKitBuildVersion" = "Darwin Kernel Version 14.0.0: Fri Sep 19 00:26:44 PDT 2014; root:xnu-2782.1.97~2/RELEASE_X86_64"   |   "OS Build Version" = "14B25"   |   "OSKernelCPUSubtype" = 3   |   "OSKernelCPUType" = 16777223   |   "OSPrelinkKextCount" = 185   |   "IOConsoleLocked" = No   |   "IORegistryPlanes" = {"IOACPIPlane"="IOACPIPlane","IOPower"="IOPower","IODeviceTree"="IODeviceTree","IOService"="IOService","IOUSB"="IOUSB","IOFireWire"="IOFireWire"} [...etc...] /code/pre  [EDIT]: If you just want the device names, you can filter the basic list to trim the junk:  precode$ ioreg -p IOUSB -w0 | sed 's/[^o]*o //; s/@.*$//' | grep -v '^Root.*' EHCI Root Hub Simulation HubDevice Apple Internal Keyboard / Trackpad BRCM2070 Hub Bluetooth USB Host Controller FaceTime HD Camera (Built-in) EHCI Root Hub Simulation HubDevice IR Receiver /code/pre  <comment199950> possible duplicate of [List all devices connected, lsblk for Mac OS X](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/107953/list-all-devices-connected-lsblk-for-mac-os-x) <comment199958> Why the downvote? Seems like a reasonable way to do it... <comment199961> some ppl are just ?*! <comment199963> Thanks - this looks like the `System Information` (which it probably is) but shows way too much detail, but is handy to know <comment199964> still shows more than I wanted, but is a convenient 1 line per device list <comment265607> This is a better answer if you need access to fields like Vendor ID or Product ID. <comment313672> This shows different information, such as power usage in amps. <comment322250> Is there a convenient way to use this information to mount a device? I have a nook that `ioreg` shows as connected, but `diskutil list` does not show it. Is there any info from `ioreg` that I could use to mount the nook? <comment322267> @stiemannkj1: I'm not familiar with nooks, so I'm not sure how they're supposed to show up on a Mac. As I understand it, mounting it will require a device drive that recognizes it as something disk-line (should the standard USB driver do this?), and having something like a recognizable filesystem on it. I'm not familiar enough with the driver system to know how to check this, but I don't think `ioreg` can tell you what you want to know. <comment329890> An additional advantage of this command is the ability to output in XML, for cases where a parseable output is needed: ```system_profiler -xml SPUSBDataType```
