Mac-to-Mac VPN Xcode speed: AFP vs VNC <body> I connect from home-Mac to work-Mac over VPN. Then I have 2 options in codeFinder/code:  ol liVNC: screen-share (restricts you to work-monitors' resolution)/li liAFP: mount the work-directory, then open the codeXcode/code project (can fully utilize larger home-monitors)/li /ol  Now, strongwhy is option 2. emmuch/em slower than 1.? sIs codeXcode/code so network-hungry?/s The AFP itself seems to be slow, that is, it takes ~2 s to open up a not-yet-"indexed" directory (and all its files' icons)./strong   OS X 10.9 built-in VPN (PPTP) &amp; VNC, Xcode 5  hr  Anecdotally, the VPN itself most likely isn't an issue, since a colleague is satisfied with his VPN Windows-to-Windows performance over slower home-connection.  <answer108313> You are basically being punished by having put your project on a slow, slow harddisk.  There is much more network traffic than you think when working with files remotely and on such a slow connection you will really feel it.  Most modern IDE's expect files to be locally available, not on a slow, remote drive.  I would suggest looking into mirroring your work files between your work and home machine as needed.   To my knowledge there are two basic approaches:  ul liFile synchronization:  Use "rsync" to move changed files back and forth as needed.  This is good if you need to edit locally, but compile remotely./li liSource repository:  Work locally until you have a satisfying result, commit the revised sources locally to the repository, and then update the remote sources from the repository.  This works well if you can work fully locally./li /ul  Please report back what worked well for you.  (Incidentially this is why Remote Desktop for Windows is such a good thing.  It uses the bandwidth very, very well making Windows usable even over a very slow connection, and allows for a much larger display than on the remote host)  <comment126021> What speeds do you get when you copy files from the work-directory to a directory on your local harddisk? <comment126028> @Hobbes, I get 85 kB/s (home - work) and 700 kB/s (home - work). Measured with `rsync -a --progress --stats --human-readable source destination`. <comment126038> Does Activity Monitor show large amounts of network traffic during an AFP session? <comment126043> @Hobbes, interestingly no. While doing a build both speeds hover at ~40 kB/s. If I move between the classes fast I can get it to 100 kB/s max. To give you an idea of how slow it is: after switching to a ~500 LOC class, I have to wait ~10 s to get syntax highlighted. :) <comment126049> There's one more thing to check then: is Xcode slow if you open a project on your local disk? <comment126055> @Hobbes, Xcode is fast when opening project on **local-disk** (thanks to SSD), but slow as hell when opening project from **VPN-AFP-disk** (takes a minute to show Xcode interface, then I also leave it for an hour for indexing). PS. I don't want the liability of having the company's project on my local-disk; also, the project interfaces to a web-service on company's LAN. <comment127526> Sensible suggestions, but is it normal that it takes ~2 s to (fully) open a directory over AFP? (I've updated the **bold** part of the question.)
