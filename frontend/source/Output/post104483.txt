Strange OSX 10.6.8 Networking Issues <body> I have a Mac Mini running OS X Server 10.6.8 in a small business environment running Windows and Macs. Late last week there was a strange problem that occurred in that the machine wouldn't boot. I was able to isolate this down to an mDNS issue and followed the instructions here to resurrect it.   Now whilst that worked (and solved one of my problems), it's created another. The machine now has no outward access. I can't see any other network devices on it, and the internet doesn't seem to be working (despite all settings appearing to be valid). What's weirder is that by typing in the IP address, I am able to screen share with any other machine in the network. As I need that machine to use as a time machine backup, how am I able to get the network connections running on it again (I imagine it's something to do with Bonjour).  The problem that it solved is that the device now shows up in Windows networks and I no longer need to authenticate before I get access to the shared folders. This is my desired outcome as the only file sharing features it needs is a dropbox for staff email backup, but I fear after reconfiguring Bonjour I'll lose this functionality.   So that brings me to my other question, is there a way I can disable authenticated file sharing and just allow guest access? As it will be a Dropbox only security concerns aren't an issue.
