How to make Facebook for iPhone open links in Safari? <body> Is there a way to make Facebook for iPhone (and other iPhone apps like Google &amp; Yelp) always open links in Safari (or YouTube, etc.) instead of in an internal web view?  The native apps like Safari &amp; Youtube seem to usually work much better than web views. Plus, iOS 9 adds a back button that takes you back to the original app with one tap.  <answer207120> There's no such possibility. App developer would need to implement this in the app.   P.S. You can open links from Facebook in Safari - click "Share" when viewing the link and choose "Open in Safari".  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bruRp.png" alt="enter image description here"  supImage from: howtogeek.com/sup  <comment249743> OK. Thanks. I know that, but I want links to open in Safari on the first tap.
