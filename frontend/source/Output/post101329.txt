Help with importing photos from SD card <body> I am trying to drag pictures from an SDHC card into an album in iPhoto. It was working fine, but now every time I try, it shows me a message that says the file could not be imported because it is an unrecognizable format. The pic is in JPG form. What do I need to do to correct this problem?  liI am using a card reader to access the card, not from the camera directly. liI am using an iMac with the latest software./li  <comment119369> what program do you use on your Mac to open those? that program needs to be associated with the images on the SDHC card. <comment119370> Feel free to edit this to differentiate it from our previous question covering this issue â€¦ it can be reopened if it's indeed covering different or new ground.
