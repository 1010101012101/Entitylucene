Launch different apps based on file name (other than the extension)? <body> I'd like to have different apps handle .jpg files based on a naming convention I'll use for the .jpg files. Specifically most will go to Xee, but ones containing strongthumb/strong should instead cause VLC to be called with the same path and file name, but with .mp4 (or .mkv, etc.) extension.  Is there an existing script / app that does this? I'm guessing the way to do it would be to create a shim app (sort of like choosy) that handles the main file type based on extension, and then hands off to the apps you configure based on a ruleset.  <answer214345> Just create an Applescript Droplet to read the name and extension of dropped files and triage them with if statements. This script should get you started. Save it as an application, and then you can put it in your dock or some place convenient to drop files on it.  precodeon open these_items     repeat with i from 1 to the count of these_items         set this_item to item i of these_items         set the item_info to info for this_item without size         set theName to name of item_info         try             set theExtension to the name extension of item_info         on error             set theExtension to ""         end try          if theName contains "thumb" then             tell application "VLC"                 activate                 open this_item             end tell         else if theExtension contains "jpeg" then             tell application "Preview"                 activate                 open this_item             end tell         else             -- open with system default app             tell application "Finder" to open this_item         end if     end repeat end open /code/pre
