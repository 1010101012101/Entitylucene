How can I make Snapchat's Push Notification dialog go away? <body> A screen keeps popping up whle i'm trying to use Snapchat that says "Snapchat Push notifications may include alerts, sounds and icon badges." And it doesn't matter how many times I click OK it won't go away. I have already turned Snapchat push notifications completly off, yet the dialog keeps appearing. What else can I do here?  <comment87191> Uninstall the App and wait a bit for the servers to clear up? Also - edit in the version of the program in case it's just a bug in that app.
