Easily pretty print XML <body> Is there a way to quickly pretty print large XML files without needing an app? Online solutions don't allow for massive files and I'd like to do this without install more junk on my computer.  <answer96235> Macs come with codelibxml2/code which inclues a tool called codexmllint/code. You can use this to format your xml with ease. The tool does not have a graphical interface, so you'll need to fire up terminal.  Example 1. Format a file  precodexmllint --format - &lt; file_to_format.xml &gt; formatted_output.xml /code/pre  Example 2. Format xml from clipboard  precodepbpaste | xmllint --format - &gt; formatted_output.xml /code/pre  This information came from this blog http://richardlog.com/post/12743073497/pretty-printing-json-and-xml-on-mac-osx
