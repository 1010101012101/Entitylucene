Mail on Yosemite 10.10.5 Can't stop Mail from downloading attachments <body> Simply trying to disable Mail from downloading attachments automatically.  strongSo I went to Mail  Preferences  Accounts  Advanced tab and turned off the "Automatically download all attachments" option./strong I did this for every email account on my system. I restarted Mail. It still downloads attachments from shady senders, many of which are being caught by Avira. Most of the time I right click and delete the message if it looks like junkmail, sometimes I'm quickly reading emails and forget, allowing the preview to start the attachment download. I suppose I could turn off the preview window, but I'd rather not if possible.  Any advice is appreciated. Thanks.  <answer247552> Fixed this issue finally. I had to go to Preferences  Viewing and unchecked "Load remote content in messages."
