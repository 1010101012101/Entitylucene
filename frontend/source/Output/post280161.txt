Snipping Tool produces 2x larger images but not using Retina display <body> I'm using the Snipping tool (Cmd + Shift + 4) to snip images.  Whilst I'm snipping a 200×200 image - evident by the snipping tool measurement metrics, the image produced states that it's 400×400 px in size (double).  What could be causing this?  h3Notes:/h3  ul liI'm not on a Retina screen/li liDesktop scaling is off/li liThis happens on my MacBook but not on my iMac/li /ul  <comment352356> What MacBook are you using? What version of macOS?
