Safari is very slow <body> I have been noticing that Safari has gotten very slow lately. Has anyone else had this issue recently?  It must have been after some update, could have been some time ago so I won't know which, maybe Sierra, Safari has become very slow when loading pages. It is not a connection issue as I have tried it at different places, also it can't be a issue with the settings, as I ran into the problem again even with a brand new MacBook Pro.  I could use chrome but I don't want to :)  <answer272060> Tested your network connection speed?  I recently had a similar performance hit with Safari. Not sure what caused it, but I did this and it hasn't come back:  ol liOpen the Activity Monitorbr (it's an an application available in the code/Applications/Utilities//code folderbr kbdCmdâŒ˜/kbd+kbdShift/kbd+kbdu/kbd from the Finder.)/li liSee if there is a process called "Safari Networking" hogging the CPU%./li liKill it./li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4SUFN.png" alt="enter image description here"  Possibly related to Gmail?  This recent article also has some good suggestions regarding slow page loading in Safari:  ol liChange DNS settings of your Mac/li liDisable DNS prefetching/li liChange IPv6 settings/li liCleanup Safari preferences file/li liClear browsing history/li liDisable autofilling form data/li liCheck installed plugins/li liCheck browser extensions/li liCleanup your memory/li liChrome Vs Safari (remove non-Safari browsers)/li liCheck Your Network Settings/li /ol  Also check out this recent article from LifeWire and please report back if you find a solution which works for you.  <comment341951> Safari Networking is only taking max 20% CPU when I open multiple sites this seems normal, but I will keep an eye on it <comment341956> @john see the suggestions in the article <comment341963> thanks, but I know how to use google ;). Non of the suggested fixes helped. <comment341964> @john that contradicts your profile description ;)
