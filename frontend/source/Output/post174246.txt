Different programs in the same Xcode C++ project <body> I am trying to use XCode as my training environment for simple C++ programs. If I create a new project, I can successfully complete everything (compile, run) but If I add one more file, it can't compile as a separate one. That means that I need to have a main2() and a main3() etc. because having 2 files with two main() in the same folder lead to an error.  In simple words, I want to write code for 30 C++ examples, each one in its own .cpp file and compile every one of them separately and not as a whole project (all files together that If there are two functions of the same name, it will crash).  <answer174252> In order to compile multiple separate files (separate binaries as a result) You would need to create separate targets for every file.  To add new target please choose: strongFile/strong - strongNew/strong - strongTarget../strong, select for example strongCommand Line Tool/strong. Make sure it's properly added to Your project. Here's example: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/R0W4v.png" alt="enter image description here"  My codemain.cpp/code is added to target codemultiple_targets/code like this: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/k5ryt.png" alt="enter image description here"  My codemain-kopia.cpp/code file is added to codetarget2/code like this: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/EBmCR.png" alt="enter image description here"  to be sure check the build phases for every target, here's example of my codetarget2/code Build Phase: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7U138.png" alt="enter image description here"  With this I am able to compile both codemain.cpp/code and codemain-kopia.cpp/code. Notice that they both have codemain()/code inside them.  <comment205152> You would need to create separate target for each file. Here's more info on Apple Pages: https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/recipes/xcode_help-scheme_editor/Articles/SchemeBuild.html <comment205154> I don't believe it would do because I need to setup a new schema for each file. We're talking about helloworld.cpp, factorial.cpp etc. - totally different programs from a book. <comment205158> Uh, You have to wait a bit until I get more screenshots. You have to make separate targets in order to be able to compile separate programs. <comment205162> I don't want to compile 30 programs each time I make a letter change in one of them. In case that XCode supports this type of use. <comment205165> See my answer. You'll compile only one file, just change the target You'd like to compile. <comment205167> I can't create new targets because when I am trying to create one, only the first one appears to be selected. <comment205168> Let us [continue this discussion in chat](http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/21408/discussion-between-mateusz-szlosek-and-robdel). <comment205169> not much flexible, but at least works.
