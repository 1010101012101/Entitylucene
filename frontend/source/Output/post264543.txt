Can't see old time machine backups after fresh install <body> So I done a complete clean install on my MBP with a recovery usb and had planned to use migration assistant afterwards to install over one of my time machine backups. But when I enter migration assistant I can only see the option to restore from 10am this morning. At which time of course there were no time machine backups because...fresh install.  So I essentially can't access my files with migration assistant. I had planned to install from a backup around mid last week. And I can still see the files on the backup HDD in finder so they aren't gone. What are my options here? I'm completely lost.
