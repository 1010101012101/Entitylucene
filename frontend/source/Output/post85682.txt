What techniques work to handle errors in AppleScript so I can place a dialog? <body> I'm new to programming and AppleScript and I have lots of problems with error handling.  Could anybody share their error handling for file operations like move/trash files? Here is my code so far:  precodetry tell application "Finder" to open file file_path on error e number n if e contains "Canâ€™t get file" then say "mount external drive" --file not found, maybe this hard drive is not mounted if e is x then something end try /code/pre  <answer85687> In general it's advisable to handle errors based on the error number and not on the text (which is language dependent and much more difficult to handle than some numbers). In addition start with just displaying the error number/messages to understand what really went wrong:  precodetry tell application "Finder" to open file file_path  on error error_message number error_number display dialog "Error: " &amp; the error_number &amp; ": " &amp; the error_message buttons {"OK"} default button 1 end try /code/pre  Once you know the potential error codes you want to handle specifically you can extend this to  precodetry tell application "Finder" to open file file_path  on error error_message number error_number     if error_number = -1728 then         display dialog "Can't read file."     else         display dialog "Error: " &amp; the error_number &amp; ": " &amp; the error_message buttons {"OK"} default button 1     end if end try /code/pre
