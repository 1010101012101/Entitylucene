How can I use Wireshark on a MacBook Air? <body> I have a new MacBook Air. I would like to run Wireshark on it. But when I choose capture in Wireshark there is no interfaces to capture from. Doesn't Wireshark have support for the MacBook Air WiFi nic?  How can I use Wireshark on a MacBook Air?  <answer7915> You need to set the right permissions.  Go into Terminal and enter the following commands:  precodecd /Library/StartupItems   sudo chown -R root:wheel ChmodBPF /code/pre  You might need to restart the computer to take effect.  You also need to be admin (a sudoer) to perform these commands  I should mention that you need to have copied codeChmodBPF/code from the .dmg file for Wireshark into the code/Library/StartupItems/code folder as described in the 'Read me first' document.  codeChmodBPF/code is a file located in the Utilities folder in the .dmg  <answer7918> I just run it by doing  precodesudo open /Applications/Wireshark.app/ /code/pre
