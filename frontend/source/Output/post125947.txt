Is there an RSS reader app that can download full articles instead of abstracts? <body> One of the main blogs I'm reading has recently transitioned from publishing the full posts in its RSS feed, to publishing just the first few sentences with a "read more" link. This drastically slows me down when reading, as it requires an extra tap and a good number of seconds to load the full, heavy web page instead of the previously light article.  Is there any app that can automatically fetch the full articles from a blog when reading the feed, or - better yet - store all of them in advance so that it can be read offline?  <answer125969> Readkit for Mac has the ability to fetch the whole article via Readability. Reeder for iOS does the same.  <answer126307> It's not an app, but I've had good luck using Full-Text RSS, which is a site that can convert most RSS feeds into full text. You can either host it yourself or use their hosted version.  <answer168992> Edit- Newsflow does exactly this with the ability to save article to pocket for offline reading  Also this can be done with Feedly with a simple tweak. Adding a user script called 'full feed' that you can plugin with tampermonkey or stylish that expands the entire article inside Feedly. This also can be saved to pocket for offline view.  <comment147544> Seems like Readability only handles one article at a time, when I specifically enter its URL... I'm looking for an automatic solution to pre-fetch all posts in a blog. (E.g. from the past 30 days) <comment198425> It seems that Feedly was not mentioned in the question. Are you assuming that the OP is having the problem described while using this app? <comment199292> He asked for a recommendation for an app that provides the entire feed without having to leave the app to the browser to "read more". I provided a specific solution to give him just that. <comment199435> After your edit, my previous comment is no longer needed. Thanks for improving your answer!
