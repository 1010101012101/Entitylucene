How to make a Mac mini and Macbook pro work together (one keyboard for two Macs)? <body> I have one Macbook pro and two monitors (one monitor and one TV I am using both of them with my Macbook pro with cables).  I use this Macbook for business and development work. I would like to simultaneously use this Macbook for dev work and one Mac mini I do not have yet for business work.   I want to be able to use the keyboard + the trackpad of my macbook pro for my Macbook and my Mac mini. I also want to display the Mac mini output on one of my two monitors (not on my Macbook pro).   Any idea how I could set this up?   <answer111002> I think you could use something like teleport or alike.  <answer111009> Synergy is amazing! You can check it out at http://synergy-foss.org/ it's pretty great software! I use it in my office to use one Keyboard and Mouse for a bunch of machines I have. Even works between OSX, Linux and PCs.  Check out the site... http://synergy-foss.org/ It is a free download! It's pretty awesome stuff. Hope this helps!   <comment130763> to Nixem and bdecaf   Thanks for your answers. I upvoted both of them as they are potential solutions to my question but can't accept both of them as the answer to my question.
