How do I get my address to appear at the top of contacts? <body> The scenario is that I've moved six times in the last six years, and can never remember my home number. (Let alone the postcode of my PO Box.) So I have to look it up all the time.   In one of the iOS updates (9.0.1?) - my address was displayed at the top of the Contacts - so I could jump straight to it. Then it went away again.   I'd like this feature back. I'm sure there must be a setting.   My question is: strongHow do I get my address to appear at the top of contacts?/strong  <answer234409> You'll need to create a contact for yourself with the home address, phone number, etc. To do this, create a contact with your information like any other contact. Then, go to Settings - Mail, Contacts, &amp; Calendars. Scroll down to "My Info," and select the contact you just created. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NIKb1.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Then, your contact card will appear at the top of the Contacts list every time.
