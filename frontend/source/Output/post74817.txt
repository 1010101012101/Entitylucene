Can't sync iPod Touch 5G with iPhoto, Lightroom <body> I have a 5th-gen iPod Touch with a little more than 1000 photos.  I connected it to Lightroom, and it only shows 159 photos.  I tried to import those, and it said the photos couldn't be read.  I thought it was a bug in Lightroom, so I tried iPhoto, but the result was the same.  The photos all display fine on the iPod itself.  Is there any way to get these pictures off the device?  <comment86926> You took all the photos on the device - correct? <comment87089> Correct.  After I posted this, I connected the device to my only Windows laptop, and all the photos showed up and transferred fine.  I'm still baffled what could have gone wrong, and what I could have done to fix it if I hadn't owned any Windows boxen....
