Yosemite update problem <body> Trying to update to Yosemite. Unfortunately I'm encountering the Verify File System and Repair Fail. Ive got no backup whatsoever prior to updating to the new OS. I have Windows and I can boot on that just fine. How do I solve this problem and how do I recover my files on OS via Windows.  <answer152335> Paragon HFS for Windows (or similar) might be your only hope, plus some good disk recovery software on the PC - there is a whole slew of freebies for Windows, but I don't know how good they are.

My data is still available on the HD, but I can't boot into mavericks anymore. Is there a way, maybe, to fix the bootloader to point to the mavericks partition istead of the Yosemite one. Still trying.
