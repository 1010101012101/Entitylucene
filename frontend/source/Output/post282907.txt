iMovie Change Green Screen focus <body> I have a green curtain that I'd like to use as a green screen. The movie I'm making requires me to wear blue, so iMovie becomes confused and replaces ME with a background image and leaves my background green.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NiPp1.png" alt="One"img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qhxJe.png" alt="Two"  How can I change the focus so that the background is replaced and not myself?  <comment356579> How green is green? The pictures are so colour-skewed the hoodie looks purple & the curtain some kind of beige. Green-screen really needs to be 'only the G of RGB' [You probably also need to be further from the screen, so shadows don't fall on it] <comment356580> Is there a way to increase contrast to change the appearance of the colors? <comment356581> I'm not sure how that would help. Colour-accurate pictures for us to see would be a start. It really can't be a green screen unless it's green... <comment356583> OK. I think more light helped, but my body is still slightly transparent... <comment356585> Maybe keep a few seconds of just the screen at beginning of recording. It might allow for a more accurate meter before you come into the shot. <comment356605> @brett7600 I still remain mostly transparent... <comment356623> Can we see a picture without the colour-skew? Or are the colours in the top picture fairly accurate? If so, then you cannot use that backdrop as a green screen; it contains similar levels of all components & so the software cannot identify it as a key. You can get cheap green screen large enough to stand in front of for less than 10 £$€ <comment356685> I bought a new backdrop, that one didn't work. However, that doesn't answer my question. <comment356727> I've given up asking for a picture with accurate calibration. Did you get a clean frame at the end to subtract?
