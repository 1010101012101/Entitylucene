MBP failing at shutdown/restart with shutdown cause -62 <body> My MacBook Pro (Mid 2012, 13in) fails to shutdown/restart sometimes. When I initiate shutdown/restart process from the Apple menu, sometimes it stronggets stuck at a black screen with a mouse pointer that can be moved/strong. And I have to do kbdctrl/kbd + kbdcommand/kbd ( + kbdoption/kbd ) + kbdPower/kbd.    I tried verbose boot right after that when this happened:  ol liMBP boots, goes into verbose mode/li liEchoes "journal replay" something/li liThen before this journal replaying gets done, it emrestarts/em.  ul liI hold Cmd+V here./li /ul/li liOn the next verbose boot (which was successful,) I learned that the "previous shutdown cause" was strong-62/strong./li /ol  I want to ask 2 questions about troubleshooting the problem.  h11st question/h1  There's already an AskDifferent question about what -62 actually is.     Watchdog timer detected unresponsive application, strongrestarting the system./strong   Troubleshoot for stuck application, startup item and any loading preferences.   This is where I got confused with strong"restarting the system."/strong strongDoes this mean:/strong  ul liMe force restarted MBP, or/li liMBP booted twice (as in step 3. above)?/li /ul  hr  h12nd question/h1  This question will change depending on the answer for the previous question.  h2If it's former/h2  I can tell the freeze is occurring during graceful shutdowns, because it seems that no process is freezing before initiating failed shutdowns (I checked this through Activity Monitor.).br In this case, strongThe second question is "is there any ways I can identify stuck processes during the shutdown?"/strong  h2If it's latter/h2  I can't tell what caused the stuck shutdown in the first place, because that -62 isn't the reason for it!br I checked this post about fixing shutdown problem, tried what was there , but didn't find things that's too interesting. I couldn't even tell "if the only stray process at shutdown is WindowServer" or not, because Activity Monitor is killed already.  In this case, I want to ask strongwhat could be the cause of this failed shutdowns./strong
