Extract individual audio tracks from an audio DVD <body> I would like to extract the audio from a concert DVD to audio files, e.g. emmp3/em or emaac/em. How can I do this using emfree/em tools - I know there are a couple of pay options available, but I would like to use free tools if possible.  Please note that I don't want to playback/record the audio, but extract it directly from the DVD. The DVD has a stereo PCM track.  Ideally, I want to end up with one audio file per chapter/track.  I know how to use the command line, so scripts are welcome as well. Homebrew is installed as well.  Update: I've read the following two guides for using VLC, but they seem to be outdated, the screens seem to have changed in recent versions of VLC. Especially the emConvert/Save/em menu item is now named emConvert/Stream/em and the screen seems to have changed considerably.  ul lihttps://wiki.videolan.org/Extract_audio/li lihttp://www.wikihow.com/Rip-DVD-Audio-to-MP3-Using-VLC-Media-Player/li /ul  <answer116875> You can use VLC:  ol liOpen VLC./li liPress âŒ˜D and insert disc or select VIDEO_TS folder./li liSelect the box for Streaming/Saving./li liClick Settings./li liIn Streaming and Transcoding Options, select File and browse to a location to save the file./li liIn Transcoding Options, uncheck Video and check Audio, then select a format (mp3) and bitrate./li liClick OK, then Open.

In some cases, I ended up with static in the file, and the command line instructions from some of the guides I posted in the question failed, since the commands seem to have changed.  I also tried tools like codeffmpeg/code, but didn't get any usable output from that either.  What finally worked were the instructions found here: http://www.essl.de/wp/2008/01/28/rip-audio-from-a-dvd/  First, I installed the following tools using emHomebrew/em:  precode$ brew install lame $ brew install mplayer /code/pre  Secondly, to get a list of the chapters of the DVD, I used this with the DVD in the drive of my MacBook Pro:  precode$ mplayer -identify -frames 0 dvd://1 | grep "_CHAPTERS" /code/pre  This will print the number of chapters per title, in my case, I noticed that there are 13  tracks in the first title.  To get the available audio channels listed, I used a similar command:  precode$ mplayer -identify -frames 0 dvd://1 | grep "aid" /code/pre  This showed that the channel with the emaid/em value of em160/em had the DVD's stereo track (emlpcm/em).  To extract the audio and convert it to MP3, I wrote the following reusable script (coderipaudio.sh/code), which extracts and converts one chapter:  precode#!/bin/bash  CHAPTER=$1 AID=$2  mplayer -benchmark -vc null -vo null dvd://1 -chapter $CHAPTER-$CHAPTER -aid $AID -ao pcm:fast:file=$CHAPTER.wav &amp;&amp; lame --preset standard $CHAPTER.wav $CHAPTER.mp3 &amp;&amp; rm $CHAPTER.wav /code/pre  Make the script executable using  precode$ chmod +x ripaudio.sh /code/pre  Call it to extract the first chapter using  precode$ ./ripaudio 1 160 /code/pre  What this basically does is this:  ul liMPlayer extracts the audio track with id em160/em of the first track and saves it to a file called code1.wav/code. The video part of the track is ignored/li liThe emLame/em encoder is used to encode the code.wav/code file into an MP3 file called code1.mp3/code. Lame's emstandard/em preset is used./li liThe file code1.wav/code is deleted./li liThe commands are chained using the code&amp;&amp;/code operator to make sure they only run when the previous one succeeds. The whole codemplayer etc./code command needs to be on a single line./li /ul  To convert all of the chapters, the following codefor/code loop can be used:  precodefor i in {1..13}; do ./ripaudio.sh $i 160 ; done /code/pre  This will take a while, but once it's done, you'll end up with one MP3 file per chapter in the current directory.  The script can easily be adapted to use something like emflac/em instead of emlame/em for the encoding. Place the script in your user's code~/bin/code folder to call it from any location.  While this took a while to research and doesn't have a fancy UI, it was the best method I've found.  <comment136654> How can I automate this for extracting all tracks, with every DVD chapter into its own file? From what I can see, the above will output a single file. <comment136658> See http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/77031/what-software-can-rip-high-quality-audio-from-a-dvd-losslessly-if-possible for more options... <comment146695> On a DVD Audio, there should be no VIDEO_TS but AUDIO_TS. <comment151658> great answer, thanks! also, unless you are waiting for other answers, please mark this as accepted
