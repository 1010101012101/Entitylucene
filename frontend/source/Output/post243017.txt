Bought new iPhone 6s. Asking for different apple id. Why? <body> My girlfriend's brother just ordered a new iPhone 6s and he tried setting up his phone but the store I believe keeps asking for a password for a Japanese registered email address. Assuming that's not meant to happen. Any reason this is happening? Is the phone refurbished or stolen and not new? Thanks for any info  <answer243020> It sounds like he has encountered Activation Lock. He can check that theory here:   https://www.icloud.com/activationlock/  The information provided would seem to indicate the device has been used before.  <comment299122> Where is he buying the iPhone? <comment299125> @fbara mobiles.co.uk it said the phone was new when he ordered <comment299140> I would agree with @TMHahn's answer in that he either bought a refurb without realizing it or was misled in the purchase. <comment299224> Is he able to use the phone at all?
