Preview.app and creating PDFs - Three methods - How do they differ? <body> Preview.app has three options for turning an image into a PDF:  ol liFile  Export..., Format = PDF/li liFile  Export as PDF.../li liFile  Print..., Save as PDF/li /ol  The first method yields a PDF that looks exactly like the image - no borders, not rotated.  The second and third methods yield a PDF that has borders and is rotated.  I have two questions:  ol liWhat is fundamentally different about these methods that they yield such results?/li liIs there an Automator action that will perform, essentially, the first method with any files I pass to it?/li /ol
