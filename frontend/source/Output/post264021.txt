How do I remove an installed .pkg file <body> I recently installed this "CH341 Driver" so that I could connect my new chinese Arduino.   But when I plug the USB cable, connected to the Arduino, into my computer it crashes immediately. A few moments later a message pops up that tells me that, because of a problem, the computer had to restart.   Now I want to delete this installed driver and download another driver or another version of it. But in order to do so I need to delete the old software (which makes my computer crash).   I looked around on the internet about how to do so, but most of the googled suggestions tell me that I can simply remove it from the "Applications" folder. It isn't a program so that won't help. I also found a few results that tell me to open terminal, enter the command "pkgutil --pkgs", search for the package and enter the command "sudo pkgutil --forget the-package-name.pkg".   But I can't find the package name in the list. So I went to "About this Mac" - "System Report..." - "Software" - "Installations" and there I can see the names of the packages, but unfortunately I can't remove them from there.  So is there anybody who can tell me where I can remove them?   <answer264027> You can check what was installed and remove it manually. Copy the code*.pkg/code file to some empty tmp folder. Then:  precodexar -xf YOUPACKAGE.pkg /code/pre  Then print the content of the codeBom/code file with:  precode lsbom $(find . -name Bom) /code/pre  You'll have the list of files like: (Here's the part for Cisco AnyConnect)  precode./opt/cisco/vpn 40755   0/0 ./opt/cisco/vpn/bin 40755   0/0 /code/pre  All file path start with code./code but they are installed relative to the root folder (code//code). In my example I have to remove code/opt/cisco/code folder.  <comment330866> You could also use [Pacifist](https://www.charlessoft.com) to visually show you the contents of package and receipt files, and scan for receipt files for particular applications... though unfortunately it has no uninstall capability, which I always thought would be useful. <comment368031> Just an fyi... The output of my lsbom command seemed to reference ~/Library. Not sure why - I was trying to uninstall the Skype Web Plugin on OSX 10.11.6
