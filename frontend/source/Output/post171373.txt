How to open Resolution Center for an app version rejection after the app is approved? <body> Something very strange happened to me. My company application was rejected in first place because App Review Team reported that it crashed in iPad Air 2. We bought a new iPad Air 2 and I faced no issues there.. However I did some small fixes here and there and uploaded a new bundle of the app. Even in this case the app was rejected with the same excuse. I had a long conversation in the Resolution Center with the App Review Team with me explaining that the app never crashed even with the new device we bought. As last thing I requested to have a video/screenrecord of the crashing moment.. After some hours surprisingly I got the application approved and ready for sale. My problem now is that I can't access the resolution center anymore. I need to have this conversation documented because my chiefs have it hard to believe that the application was accepted just at surprise :) Can anyone help please ?  <answer290562> Found this floating around on Reddit.  I've also had the same issue and was able to find the Resolution Center from this:   https://itunesconnect.apple.com/WebObjects/iTunesConnect.woa/ra/ng/app/[your-app-id]/platform/ios/resolutioncenter  Update it with your AppID.  This ID is for iTC, not the bundle_id from the developer portal.  You can find it in iTC and it will be a series of numbers.  <comment302196> Have you found a solution? <comment367346> Thank you for your response. I don't work anymore at that company and I don't remember the app-id to check it however I am marking your response as the correct one.
