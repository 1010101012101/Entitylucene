Old iPhones unable to find wifi nework <body> My Dad has an iPhone 3g.   I have an original iPhone (2g)  Neither of them have the ability to find a wifi network anymore.  They have SIM cards in the, but the SIM cards are disabled (not activated by a carrier). Technically that should be unrelated, as they are different antennaes.  I am concerned Apple does this to all old phones to incentivise people to upgrade.  I've tried removing the SIM card as well, doesn't work.  <answer174153> presumably, they both only can see 802.11b 2.4GHz &amp; 20MHz bandwidth.   Can you check those are available on the network you're trying to connect to?   My old 3G [occasional iPod these days] can see my wifi if I don't trap it out with 'modern' tech.  <comment205453> Yes, those are the bandwidths I'm broadcasting at home =/ The 5Ghz signal I know it can't find
