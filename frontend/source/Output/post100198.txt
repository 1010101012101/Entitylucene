Sharing screen with Messages.app on Mountain Lion <body> Both computers are running OS X 10.8.4  When trying to initiate the screen sharing feature, the other computer gets the request, then clicks "Accept" but thats as far as we get.  Then we see this: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GrlzN.png" alt="enter image description here"  I have posted the contents of the "Details" section:  http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=yWYYCbgv  I am thinking we may need to open some ports on the firewall. Anyone know which ports need to be open? Or if this is even the issue.  <answer100202> Try opening up port 5222 (for iChat/Messages).  <comment117961> This does not provide an answer to the question. To critique or request clarification from an author, leave a comment below their post. <comment118001> @Thecafremo The question is "Anyone know which ports need to be open" and the answer listed here (albeit not really in an authoritative manner) is port 5222. I don't see how that doesn't answer the question. <comment118006> Edited for more authoritativeness. :-) <comment118053> @tubedogg That edit makes quite a difference. :)
