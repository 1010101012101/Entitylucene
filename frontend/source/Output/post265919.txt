Macbook pro not getting past boot screen <body> Haven't been able to get my MacBook past the book screen for a day now. Started with multiple kernel panics, now it's just stuck on a grey screen with the apple logo. I tried opening disk utility, recovery HD isn't there. My MacBook should have it and I have accessed it before. Tried various other keyboard shortcuts, when I try them a prohibition sign appears.  It is a late 2011 model, I have removed the disk drive and added a secondary hard drive which is running the operating system.  I have also added 4gb of ram to the existing 4gb.
