Why does my cursor on Mac OS X get "stuck" sometimes? <body> In Mac OS X, sometimes when the cursor should change to a text cursor or hand cursor, it is still displayed as an arrow cursor. This gets annoying sometimes because although it still works, it makes me think that something is wrong. In my CSS I put codecursor: pointer !important/code and stuff for links and other elements but this still happens sometimes, and not just on my sites.   Sometimes when I hover over a link, the cursor stays as an arrow when it should be a hand and I have to click on another window and then come back to Google Chrome and then it finally changes. It's as if it gets "stuck" or "frozen" even though it still moves, clicks, etc.  Why does it do this? It gets annoying and is there a way to fix it? I am using the trackpad on my MacBook Air if that makes any difference (maybe it's a trackpad issue?) and I am running Mac OS X Snow Leopard (10.6.8).  Thanks in advance for any help/solutions.  <comment64920> possible duplicate of [Why does my mouse cursor stick as the default arrow instead of a text selector?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/28595/why-does-my-mouse-cursor-stick-as-the-default-arrow-instead-of-a-text-selector)
