Change screenshot destination on Touch Bar Mac (macOS Sierra) <body> I have a late 2016 MacBook Pro with Touch Bar, and when taking a screenshot, I get the option to choose the location on the Touch Bar.   However since I'm using my computer in clamshell mode, I can't see the Touch Bar, and always want to save my screenshots in a specific folder.  The Touch Bar behaviour seems to override the screenshot location that I have set in strongcom.apple.screencapture/strong:  code~$ defaults read com.apple.screencapture {     location = "/Users/[my_username]/Pictures/screenshots/"; } /code  Even if the above is set, it always saves to Documents, which I chose on the Touchbar once.  Also if I choose Desktop as the location on the Touch Bar, it's ignored, and it saves in Documents. So it seems to malfunction even when using the Touch Bar.  So is there a "defaults key" (?) that stores the location since the above is ignored, or is there a conflict between the Touch Bar and the default setting that can be fixed?  <answer295393> I canâ€™t figure out how to edit the save locations either, so this is not a full answer to your question.  But you did ask in your comment how to reset it so that you can choose location on the Touch Bar again. Run the command codedefaults delete com.apple.screencapture/code. It appears that setting is no longer needed with Touch Bar, but overrides Touch Bar save location if it it is set.  <comment362922> I have the same problem. Although I changed the location via [Onyx](https://www.titanium-software.fr/en/onyx.html) to the same as your location, it can be buggy as my screenshots just disappear when it returns to Desktop selection. Seeing as this is 3 months old, did you find a workaround? <comment363081> No they still get saved in Documents, no matter what I do. I'd just like to hardcode it to save to Downloads, cause I take a lot of screenshots, and my Documents folder gets so messy. I don't even use the touchbar anymore to take screenshots, would be interesting to reset it somehow, so I can choose location again. I might have a look at onyx, thanks, buggy doesn't sound very good though:) <comment371980> GAH this bugs me SO MUCH, I have to open my computer just to use the touch bar to change the screenshot preferences for where it saves...
