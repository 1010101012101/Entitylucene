We are going to need a lot more detail to answer this question.  Can you clarify what you mean by "stay continuously lit"?  Also, it is very helpful to post what model iPhone you have, what version of iOS etc.  Remember, we're not there to look over your shoulder.  Also, be sure to post any details to the **original question** so it's easier for others to find and read it. <comment308103> Any app can override it, many have in-app options.
