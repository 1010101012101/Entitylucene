How to hide sidebar preview (on the right) in Finder on El Capitan <body> I don't know since when, but I believe from some update of El Capitan, this annoying sidebar preview on the right comes up everytime I open a new Finder window.  If I hide it using the mouse, it stays hidden in the current window but re-appears when I open a new window.  The sidebar on the left is all fine, showing items as it does normally.  Logically speaking, when I have switched to the preview window option and I already see items at the top, why would I need a second one at the right?  I couldn't find anything on the internet, people are just talking about how to hide sidebar preview in the Preview app. So any help would be greatly appreciated.

Type kbdShift/kbd+kbdCommand/kbd+kbdp/kbd to turn it either on or off.  Alternatively open Finder's strongView/strong menu and select strongHide Preview/strong / strongShow Preview/strong.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Obula.png" alt="Finder Hide Preview"
