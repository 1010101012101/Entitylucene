An iPhone with an ICCID printed at the box is carrier locked? <body> I am trying to buy an iPhone 7, but when the seller sent me photos of the box, it had a ICCID (SIM card number) number printed on it, along with IMEI, Serial number and part number.  All other iPhones I ever saw have no ICCID on the box.  Does this mean this iPhone is tied to a carrier?
