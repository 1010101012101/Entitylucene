Watch live news on AppleTV <body> Is there any way to watch live news on an AppleTV? This is the only thing that's preventing me from cutting my cable.  <answer5672> The Apple TV wasn't designed for that sort of thing; it's for all intents and purposes a closed system (i.e., iTunes-stored content only).   At the same time, if you have a flat screen TV, then chances are you can hook up a PC or Mac to it using it as a monitor and grab newscasts off the web (a friend does this and it works great). Also some of the higher-end flat screens offer links to content distributed by the manufacturer (Sony's Bravia line comes to mind here).  <comment5849> that's terrible usability though. Thanks for your help. <comment5865> there is speculation that Apple will establish an App Store for the Apple TV like it has for their other iOS devices and even OS X now.  With Apps comes the possibility of streaming live content. <comment5866> @Ryan: It's all talk until the media event. <comment5871> it's also highly likely considering the path all other iOS devices have taken and the amazing source of revenue its created for Apple and developers. <comment5872> @Ryan: I'm not disagreeing that it could happen, I'm just saying that until that happens, it really doesn't help us out here and now.
