After enabling File Vault, OS X doesn't mount disk automatically anymore <body> I have an external 2 TB LaCie drive connected via FireWire 800 to my MacBook Pro (8,2 – early 2011 model), which runs OS X 10.8.5. It has one big partition which is a Time Machine target, and the backup is encrypted. My Macintosh HD itself is also encrypted.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WXjGy.png" alt=""  Before, I could just plug in the drive and it would automatically mount all the volumes on it, but ever since I've enabled encryption and started a new Time Machine backup, the disk is not mounted automatically anymore – I have to go into Disk Utility and manually emunlock/em it:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FPxO7.png" alt=""  Sometimes I even have to enter my master password for that drive.  Of course, that's not really practical: it's a backup drive and therefore should be mounted automatically every time it's plugged in.  I have not changed my code/etc/fstab/code to prevent it from mounting, nor have I changed any configuration regarding mounting or Time Machine. Here's the codediskutil list/code output for the sake of completeness:  precode/dev/disk0    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *121.3 GB   disk0    1:                        EFI                         209.7 MB   disk0s1    2:          Apple_CoreStorage                         120.5 GB   disk0s2    3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s3 /dev/disk1    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:                  Apple_HFS Macintosh HD           *120.1 GB   disk1 /dev/disk2    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *2.0 TB     disk2    1:                        EFI                         209.7 MB   disk2s1    2:          Apple_CoreStorage                         2.0 TB     disk2s2    3:                 Apple_Boot Boot OS X               134.2 MB   disk2s3 /dev/disk3    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:                  Apple_HFS Data                   *2.0 TB     disk3 /code/pre  How do I get OS X to mount my volume automatically again?  subNB: I also noticed that as soon as I eject the drive, it doesn't spin down anymore. It used to do that before though – now I have to shut it down with the hardware switch./sub  <answer121093> I have had the same issue.  If you have an entry for the drive in your Keychain, delete it and try again.    To do so, open emApplications » Utilities » Keychain Access.app/em and look for the Encrypted Volume password. Delete it from the list.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZQUio.png" alt=""  Eject and plug in the drive again. When it asks for the master password check the 'remember' button.  <comment141133> That seems to have worked – thank you! <comment200502> I've had a similar problem (still unresolved, despite a completely new computer, keychain wipe, etc) with drives not mounting automatically when plugged in shortly before/after waking the computer up: http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/121655/1587
