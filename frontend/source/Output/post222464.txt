Can ffmpeg merge multiple m4a files into one ~chapterized~ file? <body> Given a folder full of 'm4a' files, I can merge them all into one big m4a file using codeffmpeg/code like so:  precodeffmpeg -f concat -i &lt;(for f in ./*.m4a; do echo "file '$PWD/$f'"; done) \ -c copy ../OUTPUT.m4a /code/pre  However, what I would like to do is have codeOUTPUT.m4a/code contain emchapters/em for each one of the original input files (each chapter just needs a number, not a name).  I have tried googling for this, but everything I have found seems to be about merging emvideo/em files and MKVs, not m4a files.  Ideally, I would like to be able to do this via the command line, as I have 60+ folders, and would like to be able to script this rather than loading it into an app of some sort.  Any help would be appreciated.
