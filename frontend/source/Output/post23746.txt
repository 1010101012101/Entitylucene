QuickTime Player > Share > YouTube never finishes the upload <body> I've created a Screen Recording in QT Player and I'm trying to use the Share function to upload it to YouTube. QT goes through the whole process of uploading (takes ~10m), then the progress window says "Waiting for YouTube to process video..."  ...and that's it. That's as far as it will go. I've been staring at this message for over an hour, and this is the second time I've tried.  Anyone have a clue what's going wrong here?  BTW, I've also tried uploading the video emat/em YouTube.com, and when I do that, it takes 15-20m to upload the 10m video, but when it's done, the resulting YouTube video is 1:24, and what little there is shown, the audio is badly out of sync.  Any suggestions would be appreciated.  <comment26540> Figured it out. Was using full email address instead of just YouTube username in the credentials. <comment26551> Answer your question and accept it instead of just adding a comment.
