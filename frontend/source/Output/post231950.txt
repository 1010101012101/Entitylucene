default application to open folders with <body> Back in the days I used to run Path Finder for a while, but then removed it from the system and went back to regular finder. Now when entering i.e. codeopen Desktop//code in the terminal, it opens up Finder showing the Desktop directory.  Today I mounted a drive that holds backups, including a copy of an old codePath Finder.app/code which obviously had been detected by the system immediately, because when running codeopen Desktop//code it then tried to use this copy of Path Finder to open up the folder. When the drive was unmounted, it just went back to using Finder.  I assume, this is some fallback, and deep in the system there is still a setting to open folders in Path Finder. When opening the cmd+i window on a folder in Finder, there is no such thing as "open withâ€¦" like it is for a file.  So I am wondering, where I can unset Path Finder completely?  This might be useful:  precodemcnesium@mcobst:~$ rgrep "Path Finder.app" Library/ Binary file Library/Application Support/com.apple.sharedfilelist/com.apple.LSSharedFileList.RecentApplications.sfl matches Binary file Library/Application Support/Dock/F1ABBC0A-23A3-4B6A-BAC7-849CDA1F021A.db matches Library/Application Support/Quicksilver/Mnemonics.plist:            &lt;string&gt;/Applications/Path Finder.app&lt;/string&gt; Library/Application Support/Quicksilver/Mnemonics.plist:        &lt;key&gt;/Applications/Path Finder.app&lt;/key&gt; Binary file Library/Caches/com.apple.nsservicescache.plist matches Binary file Library/Preferences/com.apple.ServicesMenu.Services.plist matches Binary file Library/Preferences/loginwindow.plist matches /code/pre  <answer233321> The correct search should be:  precodegrep -r "com.cocoatech.PathFinder" ~/Library/Preferences /code/pre  codeLauchServices/code use bundle identifier to look up an app.  You will likely to find it here, in El Capitan:  precodedefaults read ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.LaunchServices/com.apple.launchservices.secure.plist /code/pre  <comment283335> If for some reason you what to keep that copy of Path Finder, first I'd archive to a zip file the copy of Path Finder.app and then delete the app.  Have a look at: [How do I completely uninstall Path Finder?](http://support.cocoatech.com/kb/installation-and-compatibility/how-do-i-completely-uninstall-path-finder)
