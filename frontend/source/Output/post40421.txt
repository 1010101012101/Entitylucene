Which processes / services need to be running to perform a local sync with an iPod Touch iOS5 with Windows 7? <body> I'm running strongWindows 7 Ultimate 64-bit/strong and the wifi sync used to work properly, but due to lack of memory, I shut down some of the emprocesses / services/em that would run automatically to make my computer run a bit faster.  Now I'd like to sync my strongiPod Touch/strong with strongiOS5/strong again but I don't know which services need to be turned on to sync again.  When I go to my iPod to sync, the button for wireless syncing in Settings isn't tappable.   <answer40528> Okay so here are the prerequisites for making this work over wifi:  h1Prerequisites:/h1  h2Programs Running:/h2  ul liiTunes/li /ul  h2Services Running:/h2  em(Located in Start-Control Panel-Administrative Tools-Services)/em  ul liBonjour Service /li liApple Mobile Device Service/li /ul  h2wifi:/h2  ul liiPod connected to wifi and so is your computer/li /ul  h1iTunes Issues:/h1  If you have all of the emprerequisites/em above set, and on your iPod you enter em(Setting-General-iTunes Wi-Fi Sync)/em and you find the strongSync Now/strong button is still disabled do the following:  ol liIn iTunes click emedit-preferences/em/li liClick the strongDevices/strong tab./li liClick the strongReset History/strong button./li /ol  Now if you look at your iPod Touch again the strongSync Now/strong button should now be enabled.  (found in the apple documentation)  <answer40550> I would add that simply downloading the latest iTunes installer, running it and choosing "Repair Installation" should re-enable whatever services you have disabled.  <comment45826> Bonjour Serivce... <comment45828> Apple Mobile Device Service... <comment45834> Those seem to be it...for syncing over the wire...is there a specific port that it needs to run on, or do I need to have NetBIOS enabled or something?
