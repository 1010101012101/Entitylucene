AirPlay video with audio on iOS device <body> Is it possible to send video through AirPlay and have the audio on the iOS device?  I want to watch a movie on the Apple TV but have the audio in my EarPods connected to my iPhone.  The Apple TV can send audio through AirPlay but I can't find an app for iOS that can receive audio without jailbreak.  <answer152156> That is currently not possible.  You can make it a feature request to Apple  here  http://www.apple.com/feedback/appletv.html  or here  http://www.apple.com/feedback/iphone.html  You can come up with your description but here is a draft:  *     Feature request: I'd love it you could activate "private listening"   with Apple TV. Pop headphones into your iPhone or iPad and listen to   the audio from the Apple TV it's connected to without bothering other   people in your living space.   *
