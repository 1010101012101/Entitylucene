Network printing problems on Sierra <body> I recently had to retire my ancient print server because of hardware issues. It was running CentOS 7. I was printing to a Brother MFC-7220. I replaced it with a server running Debian Jessie. I am trying to set up the print queues on my iMac and two MacBook pro laptops, all running Sierra 10.12.6. When I try to print, CUPS on the Debian server reports  precodeCommand Line Error: Wrong page range given: the first page (1) can not be after the last page (0). /code/pre  This happens on all of the Macs. I would blame this on the Debian server, but I haven't printed to it since I did my last macOS update. Also, the printer works fine locally through CUPS, and my Windows laptop still works fine with it. I have downloaded the latest drivers from Brother. This sounds like there is some problem with how CUPS on my Macs is talking to the Debian server.
