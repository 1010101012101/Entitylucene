Troubleshoot faulty USB port on a MacBook Pro <body> I have a emMacBook Pro/em from 2011 that has one faulty USB port.  The USB port can power up devices such as emiPods/em or emiPhones/em just fine, but fails at communicating data between the emMacbook Pro/em and devices that are plugged in the port. I tried plugging in a mouse, iPods, iPhones and hard drives without success.  I am wondering if there is a way for me to troubleshoot and eventually repair this - either software based, hardware based, or by observing the device.  The fact that the USB port transmits power gave me hope...  I hesitated posting this on the hardware S.E., but since a program might help finding out what's wrong, I think it's more related to the Apple world.  <comment268849> Try using a Q-tip dipped in isopropyl alcohol to clean the port out. Donâ€™t jam it in harshly or oversaturate it. Be gentle and methodical.
