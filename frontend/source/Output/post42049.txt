Tap to click keeps disabling <body> Recently the tap to click on my trackpad will disable itself after a restart and I have to go into System Preferences to enable it. Has anyone experienced this and know of a solution?   I'm running Snow Leopard on a white MacBook (Mid 2010).  <answer46961> Open Terminal.app and enter the following to (re-)enable tap to click on the Trackpad:  precodedefaults write com.apple.driver.AppleBluetoothMultitouch.trackpad Clicking -bool true /code/pre  Then, log out and log back in again.  <comment47779> It probably won't help, but you could try deleting `~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.driver.AppleBluetoothMultitouch.trackpad.plist`. Missing preference files are recreated automatically, so that should be harmless.
