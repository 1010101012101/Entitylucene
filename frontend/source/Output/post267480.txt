Is there a way to flip the functionality of the green full screen / maximize button? <body> As we all know, clicking the green traffic light button on the windows in mac osx enter the app into fullscreen mode.  Doing an Option + Click makes the window usually resizes to the to the maximum possible size.  I rarely use fullscreen, only for iTunes I think, and sometimes mail.  I use Option + Click all of the time.  My question is - is there a way to flip the functionality of the green button, so Click does the Option+Click function, and vice versa.  I'm on the latest Sierra.  Thanks.
