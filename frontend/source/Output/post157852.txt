Managing WiFi on IOS 8 <body> As for testing purposes I'd like to get into WiFi settings much more deeper and want to use some WiFi managing app like Airport on OSX which I recently did use on OS X and wonder what's the counter part on iOS, if there's any.  Get an idea here: https://superuser.com/questions/286457/connect-to-wifi-network-using-mac-terminal  Am keen on any feedback, as you can imagine.  <answer157923> There is Airport Utility by Apple which allows you to review and change the configuration of any Apple WiFi device in the current network.  <comment185632> You want to know how to connect to WiFi via command line on an iOS device? Presumably your device is jailbroken then?
