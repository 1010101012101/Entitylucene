Change symbols with alt modifer <body> so this has probably been asked, but I have not exactly been able to figure it out. I was just wondering if it is possible to change what the alternate characters are on my keyboard. I have osx 10.9 and use the keyboard on a 15" macbook retina.  For example I never use the ¢ or £ symbols, but frequently use greek letters like η, or λ. It would be nice if I could have all of my frequently used symbols to be mapped to what I want.   I have googled this and not really found out anything useful.   <answer124589> Not exactly what you're asking for, but I use   precodeSystem Preferences - Keyboard - Input Sources /code/pre  to add Greek &amp; other layouts, and tick the 'Show Input menu in menu bar' option. This results in a pretty menu with keyboard layouts marked by national flag. And, a ctrl-cmd-space shortcut to cycle between them.  Also:  precodeSystem Preferences - Keyboards - Show Keyboard and Character Viewers in menu bar /code/pre  for all other typographical symbols  <answer124593> A tool for making a custom keyboard layout is Ukelele:  http://scripts.sil.org/ukelele  <answer124595> there is alternative way to reassign the alt keys  You will have to find the one you want to replace and replace its alt+?+? to what you used for it.  In this example it is the alt+shift+2 creates the €  that can be changed to λ by  doig following:  precodeCreate ~/Library/KeyBindings/DefaultKeyBinding.dict and enter  { "$~2" = (insertText:, "λ"); } /code/pre  This rebinds ⇧⌥2 to insert λ  $ = ⇧, ~ = ⌥  Quit and reopen applications for the change to take effect  *Credit to @grgarside  <comment145746> Ah yes, it has been asked before; on superuser: http://superuser.com/questions/48461/customize-mac-os-x-keyboard-layout
