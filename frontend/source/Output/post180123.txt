OSX 10.10.3 Update - App Store icon image missing <body> After installing the 10.10.3 update I noticed my App Store no longer has an icon image, it's just a blank space now in the Applications folder and dock. This persists after a reboot and I'd like my icon back.  Clicking on the App Store text loads it just fine, just missing the icon, anyone else come across this or know how I workaround this other than a Time machine restore?  <answer180126> https://discussions.apple.com/thread/6983727  Resolved it from this workaround:  ol liClick informations on the blank icon./li liClick on the library icon in the left corner of the informations window and copy it./li liOpen Preview./li liPaste the copied icon and save it on desktop./li liNow, just drag and drop the new icon to the old icon of the informations window of the broken Library icon./li /ol  <comment213903> Very cool!
