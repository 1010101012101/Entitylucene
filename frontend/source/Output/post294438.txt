Mission Control behaves unpredictably <body> When switching applications using strongMission Control/strong, the application I select moves to the foreground as expected.  However on occasion, it will then strongimmediately jump back into the background/strong. This is very annoying. I closed all my other applications but that did not help. Please see this gif for a demo:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/eha3T.gif" alt="Mission Control Unpredictable Behavior"  Does anybody have any idea what might be causing this?  <answer294608> Solution:  ol liRight click the strongTerminal/strong icon on the strongDock/strong./li liClick emOptions/em./li liAssigns it to emNone/em rather than emAll Desktops/em./li /ol  This solves all my problems after I assign all applications to emNone/em. It is a bug of strongMission Control/strong.
