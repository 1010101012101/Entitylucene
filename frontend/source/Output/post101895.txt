How do I create a blank desktop (on OS 10.7.5) <body> I realize that this isn't a new feature but I've never needed to use different workspaces on my computer until now and I'm having a bit of trouble.  I'm able to add a new desktop by entering Mission Control and hovering over the translucent code+/code that appears and clicking on it. My problem is that when I go to that newly-created space, it's a copy of the existing cluttered original desktop. How do I create a blank desktop?  <answer101900> You can't do this via Mission Control - your desktop files are available on ALL desktops. The different desktops may only contain different open applications.   If you want a clean desktop, move the individual files where they make sense (or into the trash), or put them all in a folder.  <answer101902> The point of spaces is that they allow for different collections and configurations of application windows, and they do not allow for having different desktops; the desktop is not a window.  The desktop icons shown are simply file and folder items at a file system level that are displayed without requiring to be viewed through an application window. There is only a single desktop folder per user.  Taking both of these into account, what you want can't work for a number of reasons  <answer170037> Hover over the icon/program at the bottom of your screen that continues to reappear even when you change desktops.  Next, select options, then select "none" under assign to.  This will solve your problem
