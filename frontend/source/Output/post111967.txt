Recent Photo Booth photos no longer upload to Facebook <body> When I take new photos on Photo Booth they show up on the little photo strip on the bottom of the application.  When I click upload-photos--Photo Booth library it shows me photos only up to a couple weeks ago, and none of the new ones.   When I right click Photo Booth Library and click "show package contents" it doesn't show the new photos there either. I know that I can just export them all from now on, but that's a hassle.   Is there a way to fix this problem?
