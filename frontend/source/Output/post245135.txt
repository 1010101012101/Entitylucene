Why do I keep jumping between items when scrolling in reading list? <body> Why do I keep jumping between items when scrolling when reading an item in reading list on iOS?  <answer245145> When you scroll further than the end or beginning of an item in your Reading List, it switches to the next or previous item respectively. This only occurs if you scroll embeyond/em the end, but this seems to be what you're doing.
