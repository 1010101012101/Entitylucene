OS X: Mac stuck installing - can I install via Terminal? <body> I am stuck installing El Capitan on an MBPro for a while now. Installation never finishes, I can only enter the Mac in safe mode, but without any of my data. I can access Terminal in recovery mode and was wondering wether I can a) just exchange the InstallESD.dmg which I can access with the MBPro in Target Disk Mode to exchange it with the one from 10.8 or b) if I can handle the installation of 10.8 via Terminal if I use the disk image from an external hard drive. As you can imagine, I am desperate for help. So don't slay me if a) or b) are stupid ideas. strongEDIT:/strong I verified the HD with disk utility and there are no problems with it. Checking with Terminal for the Data on HD reveals, that all my data is still on HD.   <comment344527> Up until now, how have you been trying to install El Capitan? Also, when you say _Installation never finishes_, what actually happens? Finally, it'd be good if you could add details of your exact model of MBP. <comment344782> Hi. Its an A1286. I had to erase my HD on the MB in Target Mode, then installed a bootable Maverick on an USB. Just for info: Installation of ElCap stopped at about 13 min to installation finish and revealed the log file. only options were similar to recovery mode. Installation from Base System also stopped at the same point. My guess: HD space was not enough and no warning about this. Sth must have become corrupted during 1. trial. I tried 3 different OS in Recovery Mode but all failed. So: Complete erase, repair HD, boot up from Maverick USB and restore HD from USB did it in the end.
