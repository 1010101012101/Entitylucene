Trouble changing default search engine in Safari <body> I'm trying to change my default engine in Safari (running Yosemite) from Google to DuckDuckGo and I'm not successful. I changed the default engine in "Safari→Preferences→Search". When I type into the address bar I see "DuckDuckGo search" in the suggestions, but then the search goes straight to google.  I checked the output of "defaults" and didn't see anything system-wide either. Did anyone encounter this problem?  <answer164549> PEBKAC, sorry.  My problem was caused by the SafariKeyboardSearch extension. Disabling it helped.  <comment371514> You know you can mark your own answer as correct, right?
