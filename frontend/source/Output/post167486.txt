All my Folder and Application icons disappeared in Finder <body> I've been using Yosemite happily since it was released, but yesterday all my icons disappeared. See the attached screenshots. My dock only shows the icon for the Finder, and within Finder itself none of the icons for applications or folders show up. The only thing that seems to work is thumbnail previews for things like Word documents, PDFs and image files.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dQ6A9.png" alt="enter image description here" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LFVeO.png" alt="enter image description here"  These are some things I tried already:  ul lirm -rf ~/Library/Caches/* and sudo rm -rf /Library/Caches/*/li lirm ~/Library/Application\ Support/Dock/*.db &amp;&amp; killall -HUP Finder Dock/li lirm ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.finder.plist/li liI tried booting in Safe Mode, the problem persists there./li liI even tried strongreinstalling the OS/strong and for some reason the problem still exists./li liUnfortunately I can't log in as a different user, this is a company mac and my login is our network login./li /ul  I'm at a total loss. What can I do? The only thing I can think of that I changed recently was uninstalling an app called Bitcasa by manually removing some of its application files, including /Applications/Bitcasa.app, ~/Library/Preferences/com.bitcasa, ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.bitcasa.Bitcasa.plist, ~/Library/ScriptingAdditions/BitcasaIntegration.osax, ~/Library/Caches/com.bitcasa.Bitcasa, and ~/Library/Application Support/com.bitcasa.Bitcasa.  <answer167533> The icon caches in OS X are stored under code/private/var/folders/code. To clear them try the following commands in a Terminal window.  precodesudo rm /private/var/folders/*/*/C/com.apple.dock.iconcache sudo rm -rf /private/var/folders/*/*/C/com.apple.iconservices killall Dock killall Finder /code/pre  Hopefully you should then find your icons restored.  <answer183249> I was having a similar problem--not with icons in the dock--but Illustrator icons in Finder list view would just display as blank white icons instead of the Illustrator CC icons.  Using the info in this thread, I showed all hidden files.  This can be done using the XtraFinder app.  Once all hidden files were shown, I went to the path below and moved the store.index file to the desktop and logged out and logged back in.  The store.index file re-created itself and all of my Illustrator icons were back.  You can delete the one on the desktop and empty the trash before once again hiding all the hidden files through XtraFinder.  Solved!  codeHD/private/var/folders/*/*/C/com.apple.iconservices/store.index/code  The asterisks represent random folder names that are different for each computer.  The last asterisk may have more than one folder.  Find the C folder that is not locked.  <comment196352> If after reinstalling the OS the problem persist, then it is usually your preferences settings, since those do not get changed when reinstalling. <comment196368> Is there a way to reset preferences to default? <comment196371> for what is worth, run disk permission repair for now. and try to log in as different user to check that. <comment196372> I just checked the instructions for Bitcasa removal here https://support.bitcasa.com/hc/en-us/articles/202216558-How-to-Uninstall-Bitcasa-Mac- and assume you did to? <comment196418> It's unadvisable to remove the folders for all users (including root and other system files) in that manner. <comment196419> What would you recommend instead? I know one person's anecdotal evidence isn't worth much, but I've done this a few times over the years without any ill effects. The system seems to quite happily regenerate the files/folders as it needs them. <comment196420> This was one of the things I tried yesterday as well, didn't have any affect. <comment196421> Unfortunately I can't log in as a different user, this is a company mac and my login is our network login. <comment196422> @AlistairMcMillan, I would first do "ls -lFad /var/folders/*/*" in order to isolate the one directory that is owned by the user experiencing trouble.  Removing the contents of just that folder is less harmful.  I would also recommend to do this while logged in as a different user.  As you said, the folders are usually regenerated as required, but it's better to not tempt fate by removing system files, and not to remove another user's files.  For a single-user system this is not an issue, but, for multi-user systems, it would be rude to remove person B's files to solve person A's trouble. <comment196423> Interesting, but I assume you are aware that the 'C' in the paths above signifies "Cache". The folder actually used to be called "-Caches-" in previous versions. Surely something very strange would have to happen for anything irreplaceable to end up in one of these folders? <comment196424> Yes -- I actually missed that the first time.  My head gets queasy whenever I see "sudo", "rm" and "*" on the same line anywhere.  :-) <comment196432> I know that feeling. I'm normally the one advising caution. Telling people to never delete thing; just rename them. <comment233497> Your solution has resolved my problem. Thank you :).
