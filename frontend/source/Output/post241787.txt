Can iPhones play Opus files? <body> Can iPhone play Opus music files? Nothing found on the web or here.  https://duckduckgo.com/?q=can+iphone+play+opus&amp;ia=web  https://apple.stackexchange.com/search?q=opus  <answer241788> Judging by this conversation on the Apple forums, it seems unlikely an iPhone can use the format directly.     Since Opus is not compatible with most popular players and devices so far, it's absolutely impracticable, no matter directly play Opus files on Windows Media Player, Android, PS3, Xbox 360 and iTunes or sync Opus to iPhone, iPod, iPad via iTunes, or edit these Opus in iMovie and QuickTime.      Under the circumstances, the best solution is to convert Opus to MP3 and other more compatible audio formats in order to play or edit Opus in the above popular players and devices.   One of the posters mentioned that Adapter (freeware) can convert then to a playable format, MP3, AAC etc.  <comment297271> Thanks. I'll be using `ffmpeg`. <comment339628> This rather sounds like an excuse of proprietary software to not play open standard sound codecs. Sophisticated players/tools like vlc and ffmpeg can handle it. Android supports it since 2014 (5.0) too. <comment339629> Android supports Flash too... & all the issues that has caused over the years. What is it you're trying to say, & have you considered whether this is the best place to say it? <comment371811> He's saying Apple is too proud to use an open file format. Flash is a scripted language while Opus is just data so it's not a valid comparison. It's more like Apple refusing to support JPG or GIF. <comment371813> There's a clear distinction between refusing & not bothering. Refusing to support jpg would be folly, not bothering to support some barely-used codec is just saving on support costs.
