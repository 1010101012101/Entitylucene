Enable HiDPI at 1080p60 for external monitor <body> I have a ThinkVision Pro 2840M which is a 4K capable display. I have attached a Mac Mini running on Sierra to it, and it is connected via HDMI. I would like to view at 1080P (minimum) at HDPI at 60Hz.   I have used SwitchResX and as per the settings offered, to be brief, it is showing:  code1080p30 at HDPi 1080p60 without HDPi/code  So, how should I enabled HDPi on 1080p60  Thank you  <comment326804> Basically, to provide more clarity, Mac Mini supports output at 1080p60, all I want is to enable HDPI at this specific settings  - 1080p60 <comment326860> Your Mac mini needs to be able to run at the specified HDPI resolution, as well as be able to push it out through the output (HDMI or Thunderbolt). <comment326987> That is a bit vague....
