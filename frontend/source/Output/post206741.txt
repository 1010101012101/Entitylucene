Fix behaviour of «* wants to use your * keychain» <body> I have my keychain set to lock when sleeping. So when I unlock my computer after not using it for some time, I get a bunch of password prompts like «* wants to use your * keychain» for Mail, CalendarAgent and others, 3-5 in total. As I understand it is expected when I set the keychain to lock when sleeping or when not used for some time.  In OS X 10.8, Mountain Lion, and previously those dialogs were in focus one after another so it was possible to just type password and press Enter multiple times, but in OS X 10.10, Yosemite, (or OS X 10.9, Mavericks) after typing and pressing Enter, some application gets focus and I need to use track pad or mouse to focus all other prompts one by one. Is it possible to fix this behaviour?  <comment269854> It's like you read my mind!
