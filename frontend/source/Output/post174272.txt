Numbers: VALUE function does not recognize empty string <body> I am using Apple Numbers and find it frustrating that cell arguments containing empty text (and sometimes contain numbers from other sheets) are not converted to a number of value 0, when referenced by a function that expects a numeric value.  For example, a function in cell:  precode=MAX(I5,0.5×J5) /code/pre  with J5 being empty, yields an error message  precodeThe operator “*” expects a number but found “.” /code/pre  So I tried to encase J5 with VALUE(J5), and got another message:  precodeVALUE requires a string specifying a number, but found “” instead. /code/pre  Is there an efficient way to treat all spaces as 0 for the countless cells that may have that situation?  <answer174279> precodeIFERROR(VALUE(&lt;cell&gt;),0)  /code/pre  would return 0 for an empty cell (or any string that can not be converted into a value). I tried something like:  precode= MAX (I5, (0.5 x (IFERROR(VALUE(J5),0)))  /code/pre  and my initial tests were working.  Hope this helps  <answer189701> A further suggestion: Select the entire table and set the cell strongData Format/strong to strong"Automatic"/strong.  Numbers will then determine the data type which may reduce import errors due to cell formatting.  You can also force formatting in the same manner.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Kmjqj.png" alt="Cell Format Setting in Inspector"  I pasted your formula with these settings and got the following result:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0xu72.png" alt="Formula result"  If you are uncomfortable/don't like/prefer, you can change the formula to text.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/W717o.png" alt="Formula editing"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/XTdlQ.png" alt="Text only formula"  <comment205251> Although this may work, it is a rather long solution for every argument of a function in every cell that may have the empty string (not entered value) as a parameter. Still looking for a more global solution.
