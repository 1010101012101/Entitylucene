Emails are automatically marked as read after a few seconds <body> I have a problem that potentially causes me to miss important email: An incoming message is automatically marked as read after a few seconds. One can watch how a new email is at first unread in the inbox and then turns to read. This problem seems to occur only for one of several IMAP accounts.   My settings are: In the viewing tab a selection "Mark all messages as read when opening a conversation" check box is unset.  What could cause this? How can I diagnose if the problem is on the server side or if Mail.app is malfunctioning?  <answer114589> Look at Preferences in the Mail.app    In the viewing tab there is a selection "Mark all messages as read when opening a conversation" make the check box unset.  <answer139888> I've been able to fix the issue: In fact, it was the fault of OS X Server.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uWOGI.png" alt="enter image description here"  In the server app, under the calendar tab, there is a checkbox "activate invitations via e-mail". The problem disappeared when I unchecked it!   <answer157796> Uncheck (Mail-Preferences-Viewing) 'Use classic layout'.  <answer175795> When setting up your email account, make sure to choose POP3 instead of IMAP. It worked for me, and I had the exact same issue.  <comment134288> It is already unset. <comment164672> Did you get a solution to this issue? I'm facing the exact same problem <comment164833> @scanales Yes, see my answer below. Really annoying problem. <comment164911> Oh, ok, I'm not running an OS X Server. I'll keep digging. Thank you. <comment207429> This is a _very_ bad idea of you want to access your mail from multiple devices, as they're not synchronized _with_ the server any more, but fetched _from_ (and usually deleted afterwards). <comment207431> You can't actually *do* that unless your mail server supports both methods. <comment312652> did you find a solution to this? I am having the same problem on my iPhone. only with one IMAP account. I also have already unselected the box next to "mark all messages as read when opening a conversation" and can't find any other settings anywhere that seem to impact this. It is not my mail server as the account is working fine on my Laptop. I deleted the account and recreated it several times hoping it would resolve itself, but no luck. That was when I sent myself a test and realized that the Laptop was functioning correctly when the account did not exist on my iPhone so I am quite confiden
