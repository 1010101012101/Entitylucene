What is the process for restoring iPhone from a backup that is NOT in iTunes? <body> I would like to restore my iPhone from a backup that is not listed in iTunes. How can I do that? The backup file is saved on my computer hard drive. Thx.  <answer267288> Is the backup folder in the right location on the hard drive? iTunes only lists backups in the MobileSync/Backup folder. If you need to move the folder there, here's instructions for Mac and Windows for getting to that folder: https://deciphertools.com/blog/where-are-iphone-backups/  If it's in the right place, let's make sure it's not a version issue. iTunes won't show backups as a restore choice if they are incompatible with the version of iOS you're restoring to.  ol liOpen the iTunes Preferences (iTunes menu on Mac, and Edit menu on Windows)/li liChange to the "Devices" tab./li /ol  If you see the backup listed in Devices, iTunes recognizes the backup, and the issue is that the device you're restoring to is running a lower version of iOS than the device that made the backup.  <comment335273> Look at [this answer](http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/77793/88313).  It tells you how to restore using iTunes and navigating to the backup on your hard drive. <comment335355> Thx for the response. It was not a version issue. It was a matter of finding the backup on my drive...the long story is that I backed up the phone on new MacBook Pro...and reset to factory settings. Backup was encrypted...and I had no idea what password was!!! I moved the backup to my iMac where the password was in my keychain...but then I finally figured out the password after many attempts, so I was able to restore from the MacBook. Thx for your answer! <comment335369> @Sizzle If you were able to resolve your problem, please post that as an answer and accept it.  That will help others in the future who might have a similar problem.  See [answer]. <comment335603> Thx for your help with this...in all seriousness, should I post "I finally remembered my password" as my answer? I don't think that will be much help to someone else. Please advise. Thx.
