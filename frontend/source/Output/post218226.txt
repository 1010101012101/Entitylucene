Entering in recovery system trouble <body> When I'm trying to enter in recovery system through pressing cmd+R I'm getting OS X Internet Recovery instead of Utilites window. How to avoid it?   <answer218227> The machine will automatically use Internet Recovery on holding kbd Cmd âŒ˜ /kbd kbd R /kbd if it can find no suitable Recovery Partition.  Extrapolation of that is that your hard drive may have had a failure &amp; cannot currently be read by the machine - or simply that there is a bootable drive, but no additional Recovery Partition.   Once Internet Recovery has booted, you may be able to investigate further.
