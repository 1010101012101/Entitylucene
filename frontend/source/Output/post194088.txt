Beats One turns off Airplay? <body> Anyone experiences the problem when swapping to the Radio (iTunes OSX), the Airplay function is switched off? Any fix?     You can use Airplay when you set your "Output Device" to Airplay. But its a bit cumbersome.   <answer195303> It seems to be either a bug or a rights issue with Beats One. There is no fix at the moment.  A workaround is to choose your Airplay device as the system output. Option + click the sound icon in the taskbar and choose your Airplay device, or select it in Sound settings.

I will add where exactly, later. (On mobile now)
