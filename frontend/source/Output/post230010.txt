Boot problem on dual-boot MacBook Pro <body> Can anyone help me restore the original boot 'order' on my Mac, using command-line?   I wanted to install Ubuntu on my Macbook Pro Retina (early 2013), so I could run some specific software I needed for my work. I followed the instructions from this site: http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/install-linux-macbook-pro/  I managed to install Ubuntu on a small partition on my HD, and then I performed 'efiboot fix', as suggested, so I could boot Ubuntu after restarting my Mac. I ran the following commands in Ubuntu:   precodesudo apt-get install efibootmgr sudo efibootmgr sudo efibootmgr -o 0,80 /code/pre  Then I restarted my Mac, but neither Ubuntu nor OS X could boot normally. Basically, I got a blank screen. I restarted again, holding the alt key, and then I was able to choose to boot OS X.   Can I revert the boot order somehow, using Terminal commands in OS X? Really don't feel like experimenting again with Ubuntu. And can I remove this disk partition with Ubuntu now? I tried to do it through Disk Utility, but it's not possible. Any help will be greatly appreciated.  <answer230025> Since you can boot into OS X by holding down the kbdOption/kbd key and selecting your OS X partition, you just need to set the Startup Partition in System Preferences.  How do I set OS X to boot by default?  This will be persistent across reboots.  <comment280681> Please issue the command `sudo efibootmgr` and past the output to the question. <comment280686> If you prefer, I could post how to boot Ubuntu by holding down the alt/option key at startup. <comment286041> Thanks @Allan. However, recently my computer crashed, and I had to use internet recovery to install new OS. The new OS was installed on a smaller partition of my SDD, and the main partition (macintosh HD, now disk0s2) was not available. Later, in Disk Utility, I saw that it was  'not mounted'.  Do you have any advice on how to fix this, to mount this partition?  If not, can I at least recover some files?
