Transferring Mountain Lion <body> i bought a new macbook pro with mountain lion preinstalled and i dont know how to put it on my older 10.6.8 Imac. There is no file for it on the macbook and says i havent bought it in the app store.  <answer93704> You can only share it if you bought it from the App Store.  Pre-installed versions are single-copy licenses:      A. Preinstalled and Single-Copy Apple Software License. Subject to the   terms and conditions of this License, unless you obtained the Apple   Software from the Mac App Store or under a volume license, maintenance   or other written agreement from Apple, you are granted a limited, non-   exclusive license to install, use and run one (1) copy of the Apple   Software on a single Apple- branded computer at any one time. For   example, these single-copy license terms apply to you if you obtained   the Apple Software preinstalled on Apple-branded hardware.   https://discussions.apple.com/thread/4971852?start=0&amp;tstart=0
