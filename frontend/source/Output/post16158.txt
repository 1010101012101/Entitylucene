Is there a black&white option for color printer when using air print? <body> airprint is pretty cool. On my Mac and PC I could setup a separate profile to use my color printer in black&amp;white mode. Is it possible to do the same when using air print from iphone/ipad?  <answer23071> The built-in AirPrint doesn't allow this sort of functionality as of iOS 4, but if you get the HP ePrint app, you should be able to do B&amp;W printing and manage other settings. This of course only works if you have an AirPrint/ePrint HP printer, it won't work with any other printer that you've hacked to set up with AirPrint.  <answer94189> Printopia for Mac will let you configure what settings the printer will use when you AirPrint. For example, you can select to use B&amp;W only.  <comment293486> I don't know how it worked in 2011. Today however, if the AirPrint device supports color, the iOS client will see an additional option to ask for Black+White printing (default is color). Once selected, the client will preview and send black+white PDF data to the AirPrinter.
