Pipe sound output to file? <body> Is there a way to either pipe the sound output of the computer to a file or record what the computer puts out? I know I could use a headphone to microphone cord, but I was hoping for a more elegant solution. Google doesn't give very good results.  <answer48763> You might want to take a look at Audio Hijack Pro which can record any audio you can hear on your computer. Free to try.  There's also the cheaper, simpler Piezo from the same company.  <comment55832> Thanks! That is exactly what I was looking for. <comment55833> @CoffeeRain Glad I could help! =) <comment55838> There is now a cheaper version of Audio Hijack with simpler features that you can buy for US $10. It is called Piezo. http://goo.gl/kzGWD <comment55929> @WheatWilliams: Thanks, I've edited in your suggestion in my answer.
