I cannot connect to my workplace VPN <body> My workplace has VPN and it works great for me in Parallels Windows XP and Bootcamp Windows Vista. However, with the same config, I can't get it to work in Snow Leopard. I don't know what type of server they are using, but PPTP works for Windows. Any ideas why it may work for Windows and not OS X?  Update: I should also mention that at one point it did work. I couldn't tell you if anything changed at the server between when it did work and when it stopped.  More information: I can connect just fine, but I can't access any resources. I try to ping a known internal IP address and the destination can't be reached.  <answer8424> In my experience, this is usually due to authentication or encryption.  Double-check your settings.  Also I wonder if the server may be on an encryption scheme unsupported by OS X.  <answer8425> I've had trouble with VPN before on my setup. I fixed my problem, but I had to do a couple of weird things first. Could you tell me more about your settings?  Under System  Preferences  Advanced...   ol liUnder (tab) DNS  DNS Servers: Do you have your DNS servers set?  a. If so, are they something like 192.168.0.2 and 192.168.0.4?    You may need to change your home router's IP address if so./li liUnder (tab) DNS  Search Domains: do you have a search domain set? ie. domain.local/li /ol  I hope changing those settings helps. If not let me know and I'll try to help. VPN has been enormously frustrating for me in the past.  <answer9055> @Am1rr3zA Had the answer in this case, though I have tried this in the past and have had it fail.   <comment9036> did you check on "send all traffic over VPN"? <comment9040> @Am1rr3zA Yes, I have tried both ways, but I know that I have to send all traffic for the work VPN. I know because I played with that in Windows. <comment9076> That could be. At which point I assume I am screwed. <comment9077> I was going to suggest the same thing. Change your home router's base IP to something like 192.168.2.xxx -- everyone seems to be using 192.168.0.xxx these days and conflicts abound. Had the exact same problem with my home network and a client's VPN'ed network a few months back. <comment9136> What exactly is failing (i.e. does it get a connection error, or connect but not pass traffic)?  Also, what does the [PPP log](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/7876/how-can-i-read-the-log-when-i-fail-with-vpn/) show when you try to connect? <comment9147> @Gordon I'll look then report on it tonight. <comment9584> Now it works. I know I switched back and forth on the route all traffic, but now it works. Thanks for the help.
