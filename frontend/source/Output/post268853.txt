First of all, there are apps on the iTunes Store that clear up junk on your disk. I used one of these and it opened up 4GB without deleting anything that I noticed. You can also delete browsing data by going into Settings  Safari  Advanced  Website Data. Scroll down to the bottom and click 'Remove all Website Data'. You can also just delete data. There are some others, but there are just a few.  I know this doesn't answer all of your questions but hopefully, it helps some.  <comment337643> This site works best when you focus on 1 question at time.
