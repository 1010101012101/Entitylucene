Boot Android from USB on Mac. Has anyone tried it yet? <body> I'm interested in creating a bootable usb working on Mac, with Android x86 on it. I tried a couple of methods without any results. Well, maybe a bad one as I said in my other question (if you could be of some help even here, I'll really appreciate that).  Except that, I found a topic who redirect me to this method.  Now I think it this one could work fine (it was similar to the one I tried, in fact it even warns about the error I encountered) but I want to be veeeery sure this time.  Has any of you tried this one yet or have the proper knowledge to asure me this works without complications on my MacBook mid 2010 (still with OS X 10.6.8)?  <comment222141> Once you have a bootable drive, holding alt/option during startup gives you the option to select it. I run Ubuntu from an external USB/FW drive this way. <comment222152> In one of my former tries, I think the second one, after I "burned" the iso on my system instead of the usb (as I said on my other question), I saw the entry Boot EFI at the boot menu but didn't work.  Don't know if this was cause by my alteration of the system (the android USB worked fine on a windows) or because it wasn't a hybrid Iso (which I think is creatable in 10.6.8 with a little shell operation I found, not in Disk Utility)
