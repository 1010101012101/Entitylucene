Authenticate against aliases from an OD for VPN Service <body> I'm looking for a way to authenticate using aliases or Full Names from OpenDirectory against our VPN server using 10.9.2 / Server.app 3.1.1.   Under 10.5.8 Server, the VPN Server would authenticate any username entry, however this appears to have changed in 10.6+   Apple has a single KB article that describes the behaviour, their only solution being to authenticate using the shortname:  ul lihttp://support.apple.com/kb/TS4269/li /ul  I've reviewed the Remote Access Servers plist(listed below) with no luck.  precode/Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/com.apple.RemoteAccessServers.plist /code/pre  Anyway, if anyone has found a way to do this, your help would be greatly appreciated.
