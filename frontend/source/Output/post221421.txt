iPad - erase data completely <body> I am selling my old iPad 4, in which I stored some private data. I have done erasing my iPad data and settings, is it true that all my data is really gone and completely unrecoverable?  If not, what else should I do to make sure my data is unseen by the buyer?  <answer221424> While wiping the iPad using iOS's Factory Default settings is decent, the buyer could possibly recover some data.  I suggest you use SafeWipe's iPad Data Eraser. This software will "write a set of random digits to iPadâ€™s local disk to overwrite existing content stored on the device." In this way you can be 100% sure that your data no longer exists on your iPad.  <answer221561> Data on an iOS device [3GS &amp; later] is protected by hardware encryption.  Wiping the device using Apple's guide at What to do before selling or giving away your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch is quite sufficient.

The point is that the OP wants to make sure that the data can **_not_** be recovered. Ever. <comment268093> Question edited. <comment268118> The data is encrypted. Erasing it by the method on Apple's site is sufficient. Once the encryption key is gone, any surviving data is indecipherable. The linked tool is just scareware. See https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT201351 <comment268122> Nowhere on the link you specified does Apple confirm the data is encrypted. Can you provide evidence that erased data is encrypted? Encrypting the data would take much longer than a typical reset (lasting about 5-10 minutes). <comment268281> https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT202064 [on recent iOS it's now under Touch ID & Passcode.] <comment268288> If the iPad is encrypted (which it actually should be unless the user deliberately turned it off), using any kind of wiping software is just a waste of money.
