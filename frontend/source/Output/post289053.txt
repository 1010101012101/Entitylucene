Why does Chrome switch my keyboard input language when I focus on a password field? <body> I realize this is a duplicate of this post, and this post, but unfortunately none of the proposed answers are working for me.  I'm running macOS Sierra (10.12.15) and Chrome v59. In my system preferences, I have English and Italian as keyboard inputs. Whenever I focus on a password field in Chrome, my system switches to the Italian keyboard and doesn't allow me to change it:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HhQNz.png" alt="enter image description here"  Things to note:  ul liThis does not happen with Firefox or Safari./li liThe "Automatically switch to a document's input source" is unchecked, as suggested by this answer./li liI see no option for "Select the previous input source", as suggested by this answer./li liThe same thing happens in incognito mode./li liThis only happens with password input fields./li liIt appears to be linked to Sierra, as I have the same setup on a computer running Yosemite and this does not happen./li /ul  This is seriously driving me crazy. Is there any solution other than removing the Italian keyboard?
