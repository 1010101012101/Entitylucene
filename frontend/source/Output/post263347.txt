Scripting Terminal Command with Automator <body> I am trying to automate a set of terminal commands. I was given the below instructions and manually doing it works just fine, but I wanted to know if there was a way to use the Mac "Automator" on my Mac to make a script/batch so all I have to do is click on it to apply all of these no matter what computer I want to run it on. Is that possible? (see below)  hr  If the error persists, please try running these commands at the terminal to see if that corrects the issue:   precode&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt; &lt;!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"&gt; &lt;plist version="1.0"&gt; &lt;dict&gt;     &lt;key&gt;Label&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;string&gt;eicar&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;key&gt;ProgramArguments&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;array&gt;         &lt;string&gt;/bin/launchctl&lt;/string&gt;         &lt;string&gt;limit&lt;/string&gt;         &lt;string&gt;maxfiles&lt;/string&gt;         &lt;string&gt;16384&lt;/string&gt;         &lt;string&gt;16384&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;/array&gt;     &lt;key&gt;RunAtLoad&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;true/&gt;     &lt;key&gt;ServiceIPC&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;false/&gt;  &lt;/dict&gt;  &lt;/plist&gt; /code/pre  ul liLaunch Terminal/li liType codesudo su/code then enter your password to log in as root/li liType codevi /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.launchd.limit.plist/code/li liWhen in the vi editor, press kbdi/kbd to enter insert mode then paste the exact code content above (kbdCmd-V/kbd).

You need just create a file with name `com.apple.launchd.limit.plist` and copy and paste to `/Library/LaunchDaemons/` folder in `finder`. Anyway I'll show how to create this in `Automator`.
