Disabling automatic en dash when editing files in TextEdit <body> I've noticed that typying kbd-/kbdkbd-/kbd in text edit results in those signs being converted to emen dash/em: code–/code. This is highly undesirable behaviour. For example correct formatting for the strongSRT/strong files is (related problem):     time strong--/strong time   automatic emen dash/em insertion is unnecessary here. Hence my question, how to disable it in TextEdit (the problem does not occur in Atom or TextWrangler)?  <answer225712> Open TextEdit Preferences (⌘,) and uncheck strongSmart dashes/strong.  You will need to close and re-open your documents for the change to take effect.
