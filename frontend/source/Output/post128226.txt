How do I create a shortcut to IPython's interactive shell on the dock? <body> I have successfully installed IPython. I can open the interactive shell by typing this from the Terminal:  precodeipython qtconsole &amp; /code/pre  Is there a way to create a shortcut on the dock that executes the command above?  <answer128233> Open AppleScript Editor (/Applications/Utilities) and type this:  precodedo shell script "open 'ipython qtconsole &amp;'" /code/pre  Save it as an application and add it to the dock.
