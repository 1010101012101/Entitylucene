Convert an already recorded stereo track to mono in Garageband <body> I have a guitar track that I accidentally recorded in stereo.  I can't find anywhere in garageband to change it to mono after the fact.  Is this possible?    Panning the guitar track to the right silences the track, but if it's panned all the way to the left it's full.  Any ideas?  <answer119981> Found the answer here     Pan the GarageBand track to one side, and export to iTunes via the Share menu. Next, in iTunes, set iTunes' importing preference to the format you want, and mono, Select the song in iTunes and choose the "Create [format] Version" menuItem from the advanced menu. Repeat the steps panning the other way if you want the other channel as a mono file as well.   <answer131097> There's a command line approach to this that, once you get it all set up, is a little more straightforward.  First you need to install Homebrew, the best package manager for OS X out there. Open up Terminal and type:  precoderuby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)" /code/pre  With Homebrew installed you can install all kinds of cool command line tools using the codebrew/code command. We're going to use it to install sox, "the Swiss Army knife of sound processing programs":  precodebrew install sox /code/pre  With codesox/code installed we can split our audio file in to two mono tracks with one simple command call. First, from GarageBand, export your stereo track to disk as a wav file. With the file on disk, open up a Terminal program and change to the location:  precodecd ~/Music/GarageBand/bounces/ /code/pre  And then run this codesox/code to command to split the file in to two mono tracks, one for the left channel and another for the right channel:  precodesox My\ Song.wav My\ Song.L.wav remix 1 sox My\ Song.wav My\ Song.R.wav remix 2 /code/pre  codesox/code will keep the codeWAV/code settings the same as the source material so you should be able to, quite easily, drag and drop these split files back in to GarageBand as mono tracks.  <answer157954> I found an easy way,    ol liRecord your stereo track (the one that can only can pan to one side)./li liRecord another track but set all the controls to the minimum levels (Gain, track volume, etc.) the track can be recorded with silence./li liSelect both passages and join them  (kbdâŒ˜/kbd + kbdJ/kbd) GB will show and option to join the tracks in mono!/li /ol  <answer175672> download Tipard All Music Converter and when exporting the original stereo file select settings and choose mono. This will blend whatever is on the R &amp; L sides into the same output on each sides of the new file.  <answer187590> Select the track. Go to edit (click the i in the bottom right to open all the effects and such). On the bottom where it says "Input Source" change to Mono.  <answer252546> This was driving me mad, but I now use an very smooth way based on JHerran's answer. It has the virtue of only requiring Garageband and is quick.  N.B. I assume your track has a single region: if not you will have to shift-click to select all the regions in the track that you want to convert.  ol liClick on the track that you want to convert. The single region should automatically be highlighted./li listrongCommand-D/strong or TrackNew Track with duplicate settings to create a new track/li listrongCommand-V/strong to paste the original regions to the new track/li listrongShift-Click/strong on the original region(s) to highlight it again/li listrongCommand-J/strong to join the regions, select "Mono" for the mix-down/li liThe mix-down will replace the original stereo track - you can now click on the temporary track and strongDelete/strong it./li /ol  <comment185786> +1 for the uber geeky solution. But seriously, wouldn't it be infinitely simpler (and less fun) for 99% of computer users to just open the stereo file in QuickTime or iTunes or any simple sound app and export it as a mono file instead? I guess then they wouldn't *learn anything* though... <comment185802> @BenjaminR but think of all they learn this way. :) `sox` is a super useful tool if you're in to audio production. <comment360555> It sounds like you're describing how to record a new track in mono, but the OP was asking about how to convert an existing stereo track to mono.
