How to mimic Home Key of Centos or windows in terminal of OSx? <body> I just miss the ability to go to first position of the shell with just 1 keyboard stroke, which I use it often at my office on CentOS ?  I know I can go by Option + left key or Option + Right key to jump word to word but that doesnt help much .  <answer188971> Have you tried fn+left? I'm no CentOS expert, but this works for me exactly as the Home key does when I'm using an external keyboard.  <answer189066> Ctrl-A and Ctrl-E go to the beginning and end of the command line; this is a Bash thing, not tied to any OS or terminal.   <comment223802> Its Fn + Shift + Left or right, thanks
