Remove local admin in favor of network admin? <body> We have a number of reasons for not wanting local admins on our macs anymore (password rotation and user accountability are the biggest)  We still want to maintain admin accounts but have them be strictly network admins only (domain admins etc). This way when a technician logs in remotely to administer a client, we have full audit of who/where/when.  That being said, is there a method for running a mac client with no local admins and operating strictly network based?  <comment322323> Interesting question... Are you bound to AD? If so you can specify which groups get admin access in Directory Utility. Will there be any local users? I haven't tried this before but I can imagine bad things happening when the network goes down or something else that prevents authentication. What about using Mobile accounts instead?  https://support.apple.com/kb/PH18885?locale=en_US <comment323466> Yes we are bound to AD, and we have mobile accounts turned on. We were just looking for an option to remove local admin accounts entirely and relying solely on network admins.
