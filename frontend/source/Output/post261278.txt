iPhone locked when calling with headphones <body> When calling I use my iPhone 5S with headphones on and it always gets locked during the call. This doesnt happen when calling phone to ear. Is there a way how to prevent iPhone to lock when having a call with headphones?  <answer261297> When you're on a call whilst wearing earphones the iPhone is designed to AutoLock, this happens with all iPhones not just yours.   You can disable that feature from SettingsâžœDisplay&amp;Brightness and set it to never.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/llpzY.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment327231> note that this setting is a global setting meaning that this obviously will also disable auto lock in every other app. :) <comment327307> Thank you, but this is not what I meant. I definitely want to keep using auto-lock for all other reasons, I just dont want the phone to be auto-locked during the active call. <comment327918> You're asking for something that doesn't exist mate
