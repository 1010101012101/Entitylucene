Use Boot Camp drivers from DVD or download? <body> I have an iMac mid-2010. It came with Snow Leopard when I bought it. Now, I'd like to install Windows 7 64-bit on my iMac. Should I install the Boot Camp drivers from the DVDs that came with my computer, or download the drivers using the Boot Camp Assistant that I have now in Mountain Lion?  <answer82329> As you have upgraded your operating system to Mountain Lion, I would recommend getting the latest drivers from the internet.   While I can't say that they are definitely updated, Wikipedia notes that Mountain Lion runs Boot Camp 5 wheres Snow Leopard was version 3.
