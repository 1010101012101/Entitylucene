How to delete synced photos from an iPad? <body> How can I delete photos from photos on my iPad.  They were copied when I did a sync with the computer. I'm talking about 1650 photos and I don't want all of them.    <answer37986> Sync again with the computer, this time when it is plugged in, click on the iPad, and navigate to syncing options, and Photos, uncheck, Sync Photos. Then sync  <comment43047> Are you talking about photos in the Photostream or just regulars on your iPad? <comment43059> Photos synced to an iDevice from a computer do not enter the Photostream, only photos taken on the device and saved to the camera roll will automatically push to the cloud.  @Michiel <comment43060> He's asking to delete photos of his iPad, no? <comment43133> thanks for your reply...I am new...how do i navigate to sync options where I can uncheck? <comment43134> the downloaded pictures got deleted..all of them.
