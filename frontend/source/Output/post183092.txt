In general terms what is CoreRAID?  Thank you in advance  <answer183120> CoreRAID is a Framework to manipulate RAID devices.  The emcom.apple.CoreRAID.plist/em file in code/System/Library/LaunchDaemons//code is used to start the CoreRAIDServer used in managing RAID devices.  Although I do have RAID Attached Storage Devices even if I didn't I would not disable the emcom.apple.CoreRAID.plist/em so as to be able to work with RAID devices as/when necessary.
