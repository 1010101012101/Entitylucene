How do keep auto-correct from making one particular change <body> An email address I frequently type into web forms is codesrs@.../code. Yesterday auto-correct started changing the codesrs/code to codesis/code as soon as I typed code@/code. While keeping the rest of auto-correct working I would really like it to leave codesrs/code alone.  In my searching for an answer I found emIs it possible (and how do I do it) to change what word Auto-Correct chooses when I make a typo?/em But I'm not making a typo.  I found a variety of answers for both OS X and iOS, but none seemed to the point. The worst was decrypting a substitution file maintained by Safari to edit?!   <answer219789> Add a text replacement for codesrs/code to codesrs/code. This appears to preempt autocomplete from changing it. The technique is the similar to this answer for how to choose the correction to a typo.  To suppress a specific auto-correction:  ol liOpen emSystem Preferences/em/li liOpen emKeyboard/em/li liChoose the emText/em tab./li liClick the em+/em below the replacement list./li liAdd the same word to the emReplace/em and emWith/em columns/li liClose System Preferences./li /ol
