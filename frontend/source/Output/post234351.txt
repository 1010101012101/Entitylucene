iMac randomly wakes up from sleep <body> My iMac (27-inch, Late 2012) randomly wakes up, up to 9 times a day. I'm using codeEl Capitan 10.11.3 (15D21)/code.  A codesyslog | grep -i "Wake reason"/code shows the following many times:  precodeApr  5 00:02:50 Nikolajs-iMac kernel[0] &lt;Notice&gt;: Wake reason: EC.SleepTimer (SleepTimer) Apr  5 00:02:52 Nikolajs-iMac kernel[0] &lt;Notice&gt;: [HID] [ATC] AppleDeviceManagementHIDEventService::processWakeReason Wake reason: Host (0x01) Apr  6 18:55:24 Nikolajs-iMac kernel[0] &lt;Notice&gt;: Wake reason: EC.PME (User) Apr  6 18:55:28 Nikolajs-iMac kernel[0] &lt;Notice&gt;: [HID] [ATC] AppleDeviceManagementHIDEventService::processWakeReason Wake reason: Host (0x01) Apr  6 20:37:16 Nikolajs-iMac kernel[0] &lt;Notice&gt;: Wake reason: EC.SleepTimer (SleepTimer) Apr  6 20:37:19 Nikolajs-iMac kernel[0] &lt;Notice&gt;: [HID] [ATC] AppleDeviceManagementHIDEventService::processWakeReason Wake reason: Host (0x01) Apr  6 21:20:03 Nikolajs-iMac kernel[0] &lt;Notice&gt;: Wake reason: EHC1 Apr  6 21:20:04 Nikolajs-iMac kernel[0] &lt;Notice&gt;: [HID] [ATC] AppleDeviceManagementHIDEventService::processWakeReason Wake reason: Button (0x03) Apr  6 22:31:19 Nikolajs-iMac kernel[0] &lt;Notice&gt;: Wake reason: EC.SleepTimer (SleepTimer) Apr  6 22:31:21 Nikolajs-iMac kernel[0] &lt;Notice&gt;: [HID] [ATC] AppleDeviceManagementHIDEventService::processWakeReason Wake reason: Host (0x01) /code/pre  There aren't any usb devices connected, nor any bluetooth devices, except the keyboard and mouse.  The most obvious reasons, codepower nap/code and codewake on lan/code, aren't turned on. I've already tried to toggle them but it didn't help. What else could this be?   I've googled for answers for a long time, many times, already, but I couldn't find any solution to this. The problem already persists for at least two major OSX versions.  Thanks a lot!

It doesn't take much to wake up the mouse, and thereby wake up your computer.  <answer234698> Try checking your Energy Saving settings in System Preferences. You can tell your Mac to wake up at a certain time from here.   If that does not solve the issue, you may benefit from resetting the System Management Controller.   To reset the SMC:  Turn off and unplug the mac. Then, after waiting 15 seconds (the times are important), plug the mac back in. Finally, wait 5 seconds and power on the computer. The procedure may seem silly because it seems to only be a reboot, but this is how the SMC is reset. Good luck!  Also, here is Apple's support article on resetting the SMC: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201295  <answer235425> A good first step towards debugging power management-related issues on OS X is:  precodepmset -g assertions /code/pre  It can take a little practice to read the output, but it can lead to finding processes that are erroneously making power management assertions against the kernel.  It can also be an iterative process — keep running it at appropriate times, ad see what crops up!  The codepmset/code command can do a whole lot more to control OS X power management;  see the codepmset(1)/code man page.  hr  emEdit:/em  I have since found a way to determine if there are any processes keeping a Mac awake using only GUI tools.  (Tested only on OS X 10.11):  ul liFirst, open emActivity Monitor/em (in code/Applications/Utilities/code)./li liOn its menu, select emView → Columns → Preventing Sleep/em in order to display this column (which is not displayed by default)./li liYou can now click on the header of the emPreventing Sleep/em column to re-order the list of processes so that those preventing sleep are at the top./li /ul  This works in any of emActivity Monitor/em’s five tabs, but you have to enable the emPreventing Sleep/em column individually for each tab.  <comment286539> Do you have _Wake for network access_ enabled in Energy Saver? How about _Allow Bluetooth Devices to wake this computer_ in Bluetooth  Advanced? <comment286564> `network access ` isn't enabled. `Allow Bluetooth Devices to wake this computer ` is enabled as I need my keyboard and mouse to wake up the imac from sleep (if I'm not mistaken here). <comment286843> Have you tried a `pmset -g assertions` to see whether there’s any obvious process making power management assertions? <comment286885> No I haven't yet, thanks for the suggestion. Is it important that I run this command right after the mac woke up? @wjv <comment286886> It *might* give you more information if you could run it immediately after a wake event, as it will show you which processes are interacting with power management _at that moment_.  That said, just run it in general, from time to time, and see if there’s anything obviously fishy in the output.  I’m afraid you’re faced with a difficult issue to debug. <comment286888> I see. I'll try this and give an update here then. Thanks again. <comment286906> @wjv I've updated the question with the current output of the command you suggested. I'll run it again as soon as the problem reappears. Maybe there is still something useful in this current output? <comment286982> @Linus Well, at the moment you ran that, `storedownloadd` (the daemon that downloads from the App Store) was keeping your Mac from idle sleep. Re-run from time to time and see if that’s *always* the case. If so, disable automatic updates from System Preferences → App Store and see if it makes a difference. <comment287758> Good idea, but no. <comment287924> @wjv could you please add your initial comment as an answer - I'd like to accept it as the solution and give you the bounty as it directly led me to a failing contact's sync. <comment287925> Glad to hear your problem has been solved!  OK, I’ll add it for the benefit of others…  Thanks! <comment287926> Thank you so much for your hint - it led me to new google searches which ultimately let me find this thread / post: https://discussions.apple.com/message/24817110#24817110 in which step 1 solved my problem (which bugged me for years). <comment287927> Glad it helped!  It has also aided me in sorting out some similar issues in the past;  it’s a good one to keep in your mental toolbox. <comment287928> Absolutely! I'll add it to my toolbox right away.
