Mac wouldn't start up after I tried to fix a Mac App Store issue <body> I have a MacBook Pro (13 Inch, End 2010) running OS X El Capitan.  I had a bug with the Mac App Store, searched on the Apple forum, and got advice to remove a folder codevar/folders/zz/code.  I moved it to the Trash and then the Mac was blocked on the start-up loading bar.    <answer273466> I used Time Machine from Recovery HD to solve my problem, it perfectly reinstalled everything.  <comment343698> Have you already tried to boot your Mac in [safe mode](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201262)? <comment343699> @JohnnyDrama I can't, I have rEFInd <comment343700> I'm trying to reinstall OS X right now, just to let you guys informed ;) <comment343712> Well, after reinstalling OS X, it still doesn't startup <comment343762> When booting your Mac, hold down ESC, that should override any automatic boot selection you may have set in rEFInd. Then select your Mac partition, but instead of pressing enter, press fn+F2, that should give you some advanced options. Try to see if you can boot into either Safe Mode, or Single User Mode. <comment343803> @Siguza I finally found a way to disable rEFInd, so, I booted my Mac, but it is blocked at the end of the loading bar <comment343805> Does anyone knows how to move the folder from the Trash to its original location with Recovery HD? <comment343844> Would you like to accept your answer as suggested in http://apple.stackexchange.com/help/accepted-answer? <comment343845> Yes, it's just a bug @DAVincent It tells me that I have to wait until tomorrow <comment343921> Sorry, I didn't check the times on the answer.  Thanks.
