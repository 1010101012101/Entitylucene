How do you turn on "show pre-release updates" in yosemite? <body> I accidentally turn off "Show Pre-Release Updates" settings in the system preferences. Change option does not appear in the relevant section.  What is your suggestion?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/d8niw.png" alt="screenshot of my system prefereces"  <answer153887> The option you are referring to was listed as "Your computer is set to receive pre-release Software Update seeds" with a button labeled Change next to it. By clicking Change, you could opt into or out of the OS X Public Beta Program.  However, Yosemite is no longer in beta, and therefore the option was removed from the final release.  Edit: This information is out of date as it seems the OS X Yosemite Public Beta has been reopened.  <answer154977> The download file can be found here. brYou'll have to log in via your Apple-ID.br  <answer154994> @Markbrsorry I can't comment your question directly, since I'd need 50 reputation to do so.brbrFor your question: Wen you quit your subscription for the seeds you basically uninstall a program on your Mac. You can re-download that program directly from Apple and install it. Since the Beta-Progamm is linked to your Apple-ID you have to log in with it. Once you downloaded that file (YosemiteBetaAccessUtility.dmg) you simply install it and you have access for the Pre-Release Updates again. Just open Appstore and install the updates.brbrI found the file with the following steps:  ol liGo to appleseed.apple.com/li liClick "first steps with OS X Yosemite Beta"/li liScroll down the site till you find the button where you can download the Beta Access Utility./li liDownload and install/li liRestart if needed and it's finished/li /ol  <comment181314> Hi @tubedogg Did you mean: "You can't see this option because Yosemite is the stable version." So what can I do to get pre-release updates for the next beta software? <comment182329> Could you explain what this does <comment201640> I received beta updates through the AppleSeed program (I'm not a developer) for the (already released) version 10.10.2. But I am no longer receiving them since the beta release of 10.10.3 http://iphone.appleinsider.com/articles/15/02/05/apple-releases-first-beta-of-os-x-10103-with-debut-of-yosemites-new-photos-app
