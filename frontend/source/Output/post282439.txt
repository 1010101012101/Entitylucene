Can I use an iPod nano 8g as a flash drive for windows, and still use it to play the music I paste in that drive? <body> I know I can use an iPod nano as a flash drive by connecting the iPod to the computer and selecting the iTunes option "Enable disk use". (as stated here https://discussions.apple.com/thread/3091809?tstart=0)  My question is, after doing that, if I paste an mp3 song from the windows folder explorer (I mean, without using iTunes). Will I be able to play that song on the go with the iPod?  My goal is to make an iPod nano behave just like any other mp4 player, play any song I copy from my PC without using iTunes, and also use it to take other files with me.
