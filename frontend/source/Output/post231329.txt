OS X keeps switching Spaces <body> I am running Mac OS X 10.11.3 with 4 Spaces on an iMac 27 inch.  Switching Spaces works fine but it seems to unintentionally switch from Desktop 2 to Desktop 1.  For example (reproducible, also with Magic Mouse):  I start at Space 4.  Pressing Command–Left Arrow, it switches to Desktop 3.  Pressing Command–Left Arrow, it switches to Desktop 2, and a fraction of a second after that it switches to Desktop 1 (without any key press).  It also occasionally switches to Desktop 1 when I am just doing work in Desktop 2 without switch between Spaces.  I understand there are a couple of these threads out there, non of their solutions seems to be related to my issue. Also, I guess this is not enough information to fix this problem. How do I debug a thing like that? What information is relevant?  The only thing that is special about my set up is that I am running NoMachine. The issue only happens from Space 2 to Space 1. It doesn't matter whether NoMachine runs or where it runs.
