iPhone tap indicator <body> h2Is there a way to indicate on the screen where the user has tapped?/h2  Use case, I'm presenting a web application on the screen and want the user to see where I've clicked (since I'm mirroring my display) emon my iPhone 6./em  I want to say I've seen this used in Apple presentations before, but can't find out how to do this. Ideas?  I've looked around the accessibility tab, but haven't had any luck...
