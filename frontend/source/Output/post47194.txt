How can I export PDFs from a PC to a new iPad? <body> I want to load some of the PDFs I bought from the internet to my iPad from my PC (Windows 7). How can I do this?  I've never bothered about tablets before, but somehow I got an iPad. I did some research in Stack Exchange, but all I could find was information regarding the sending of PDFs from an iPad to a PC; not the other way.  <answer47198> To copy pdfs to your device you should use iTunes like in this video  (just use iTunes for Windows). You can use iBooks to read pdfs on your device.  Here is related question here.
