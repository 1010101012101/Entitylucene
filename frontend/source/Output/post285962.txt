What are these ports on a 20th anniversary Mac? <body> Yesterday I found a Twentieth Anniversary Mac in my Nonna's basement. Apparently it's been there since 2002. I was very curious about this and I Googled it and found that it was a special edition.  On the rear and side are some ports I'm not familiar with. I wonder if anyone can explain them?   The rear has 6 ports and I don't know what ports 3, 4, and 5 are for? There's also a large port on the left hand side that I'm not familiar with.  Can anyone help?  <answer285964> Wow, that's a find!  Actually, there are more than six ports on the rear, there's also a cover you can open to reveal a whole heap of other ports (e.g. Serial ports, ADB port, etc).  However, to explain the ports in your question:  ul liPort 3 is a SCSI port/li liPort 4 is a TV Tuner port/li liPort 5 is a FM radio port/li lithe port on the left side you refer to is a PCI slot (Note there's actually a comm slot above this as well)./li /ul  Below are some images I've taken from the Twentieth Anniversary Mac Service Source:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gi4lB.png" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GpgVt.png" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mtpCv.png" alt="enter image description here"  strongIMPORTANT NOTE/strong  This model actually has a switch to select the appropriate voltage for your country (see below), so make sure you have the correct voltage selected for your location.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/aTB4c.png" alt="enter image description here"  If your location is not listed, then select whichever is appropriate (e.g. if you're in Australia then select 230v).  strong[EDIT]/strong  Finally, as per IconDaemon's comment below, you can access the service documentation directly for yourself.  <comment360749> You probably should add a picture of these ports <comment360751> Google it yet?? <comment360752> Here are the specs: http://www.everymac.com/systems/apple/20th_mac/specs/20th-anniversary-mac.html#macspecs2 <comment360768> Mac Service Source document (from which the illustrations above were sourced) can be found [at this link](http://tim.id.au/laptops/apple/legacy/twentieth_anniversary_mac.pdf). Easily found on the Googles. <comment360829> @IconDaemon Nice find! You can even [access service manuals](http://www.tim.id.au/blog/tims-laptop-service-manuals/) for a whole heap of other laptops too! - But I'm guessing you already knew that! I'll update my answer to include a direct link to the Twentieth Anniversary Mac doc. Thanks for the heads up! :) <comment360891> Thankyou @IconDaemon for finding the link. :) <comment361021> It may help if you add a photo of the ports
