How to write a script that runs whenever a new file is added to a specific directory? <body> I've never written a script for OS X, and I don't really know which scripting tool i'll use for this task.  Here's a pseudo code for the script I want to build :   precodewhenever a new file X is added to the directory D do: copy X  paste X to the directory B /code/pre  I don't want someone to code this for me, I want to know what tool (language maybe) should I use to write this script, and how to make OS X runs it whenever the event occurs.  I don't know what to tag this. Please contribute. Please redirect if this isn't the right forum for this question.  <answer232244> I can only think of two ways that require (free) third party packages:  1st. A package called watchdog por monitoring file system events and triggering actions. It's actually a python package, but it also includes a shell utility so you can create scripts from the terminal without actually coding.  2nd. use a small program called fswatch which uses Mac OS's File System Events API to monitor your files and folders, and can trigger scripts.   They both require you installing the package/program, and seem to do what you require. Hope this at least points you in the right direction.  <answer232280> Very simple using Automator &amp; Folder Actions.  ul liMake a new Folder Action, then set the source to Folder A  /li liselect a Finder action from the left column,  /li lidrag 'Copy Finder Items' from the centre to the right  /li liset the destination to Folder B./li liGive it a name &amp; save./li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KRX1k.png" alt="enter image description here"  Every time anything is added to A it will automatically copy to B.  <comment283705> I'd say try using AppleScript first <comment283708> Folder actions? <comment283772> And if you want to do something more complicated, Automator has a 'Run Shell Script' action which you can use with a number of shell script variations, Ruby, Perl, and Python. If you go down this route, I'd advocate sticking with sh/bash or whichever language with which you are most comfortable. <comment283947> I've found there to be a bug in this simple Automator Action in that if a file already exists in A and you answer Replace, it doesn't get copied to B.  This was tested under OS X 10.8.5 and might not be an issue in other versions of OS X.
