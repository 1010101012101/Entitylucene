Getting a text file with list of installed apps on iPhone or iPad? <body> Is there any simple way to get a list of all of the installed apps on my iPhone or iPad, that I can save to a text file?  I'm guessing it needs to be done from iTunes or an external app that manages iDevices. Any tips?  <answer199990> If your device is not jailbroken, there isn't much you can do to get a list, without doing some writing. That being said, there are many iDevice managers (such as iFunbox) that provide an easy interface.  strongTo see all of the apps on your phone with iFunbox:/strong  ol liOpen iFunbox.  img src="https://i.imgur.com/kztcBFc.png" width="100"//li liConnect your iOS device to your computer with a USB cable./li liSelect "Managing App Data" from the toolbar along the top of the window.  img src="https://i.imgur.com/ilZ1i8h.png" width="300"//li liScroll down to the "All My Apps" section.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zZnyN.png" width="300"//li /ol  Here. you find a nice grid of all the installed apps on your device.
