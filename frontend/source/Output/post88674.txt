How can I share an external hard drive with another Mac? <body> I have file sharing working between my iMac (10.8.3) and MacBook Pro (also 10.8.3), and I have an external "My BooK" drive (USB, MS DOS format) that I want to share. The iMac (where the external drive is connected) reads it just fine, but the Mac Book Pro doesn't see it. I have "shared" the external drive, but it doesn't show up on the other computer.  Do I need to reformat the file system on the external drive, and if so, how do I do that without losing all my photos? (it is used for storage of older photos).  I'm open to doing some work, but I don't know how to troubleshoot file sharing from one Mac to another to know what's failing...  <comment103907> It's very hard to support troubleshooting here - but I'll try nonetheless. What does the connecting Mac see when you connect to the sharing Mac? What folders are visible in the initial mount point? Can you describe the exact steps you uses to "share" the external? Can you access files on the internal drive and not the external drive? <comment103915> The MacBook sees the shared folders on the iMac, but not the external hard drive connected to the iMac. I have file sharing turned on in System Preferences/Sharing, and in Finder, under My Book (external drive name), I have checkmarked the "Share this as a Folder" option. <comment103920> Excellent - you might need to remove all the shares and set up a test share of the external drive and one folder in the sharing Mac by following this set of steps. http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1549
