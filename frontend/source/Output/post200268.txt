Losing alpha when exporting raster graphics in Preview 8.0 <body> In preparing various documents, I often convert images from one format to another via Preview.  Since my last upgrade of Preview, however, it seems that when saving as a raster format (e.g., PNG), there is no longer an alpha channel option and the transparency is discarded on export.  Has Apple simply removed this functionality, or am I missing something?  I'm not asking how to make the conversion---I can do that easily enough with GIMP or other tools, it just adds an annoying extra stage to my workflow.  hr  Example showing the lack of an Alpha checkbox in Preview 8.0:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/f1nnF.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment241294> I can confirm that when I open a PNG with Alpha/transparency in Preview 8.0 that I have the option to File  Export… with Alpha. You seem pretty knowledgeable but it's impossible tot ell from the screenshot you've provided if the image actually includes transparency. <comment241301> @samh The grey checkerboard pattern is the standard Preview indication of transparency when "Show Document Background" is selected.  If the document is saved as PDF (which *does* preserve transparency) and opened elsewhere, the transparency is clear. <comment241345> Sorry, I got thrown seeing it at 2x (and I keep Show Image Background off usually). Can you post the exact build number from Preview  About Preview… <comment241351> @samh I am using Preview 8.0, build 859.21
