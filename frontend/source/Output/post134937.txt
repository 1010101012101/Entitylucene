Can not connect mac mini to a 17inch screen <body> I am trying to connect my mac mini MD387D/A to a 17 inch Samsung screen Sync Master 730 which has around 9 years and supports up to 1280*1024.   I have a VGA adapter from my mac mini which worked before with two other screens of 24 and 27 inches.   The monitor behaves as follows: when I start my mac mini, the apple starting screen appears with the apple in the middle and the load icon beneath it, after a couple of second, the monitor goes black and says that there is no signal.   Could someone guide me towards a solution, or do I need a new monitor?   EDIT: I found this specs that says: emScreen Resolution  1920x1200/em does this imply that it is what I should at least have?  <answer134940> There are few places you need to look  ul liAbout this Mac- displays (to see if it shows there under correct name)/li liIn sys pref -displays- does it show there as correct monitor  ul liSelect Mirroring in here/li /ul/li liA console report from the time stamp when you plug it in/li /ul  <comment159918> How can I get that info if I do not have a screen? <comment159920> sorry, I assumed that was the second screen you are talking about.-- in that case try starting in safe mode with minimal display demand.
