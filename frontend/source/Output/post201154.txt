How can I make Apple Mail show the URL (in mails) when I hover over a link? <body> There is a related question for Safari but I am interested in a solution for Mail. The âŒ˜View menu.   I am using OS X 10.10.5, and I would really like to see the real full link I would follow, especially with potential phishing mails.   <answer201159> Just hover the cursor over the link for a few seconds. The full URL will spring up underneath.  The down arrow that will also appear next to the link will open it in a Quick Look window rather than a browser - but if you want to check the link is safe first, don't use that until you're sure.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xRVwx.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment242474> Ah, I was to impatient. Thanks. Is there a way to reduce the time of showing this textbox? <comment243008> Not that I can find, sorry [doesn't mean there may not be one, just my Google-Fu wasn't strong enough ;)
