Remove "AM" and "PM" Suffix on screenshots <body> When I take a screenshot I have the default file format as "Screen Shot 2014-05-29 at 4.24.34 pm". Is there anyway to remove the AM and PM from the end? For what I do it is very annoying to have this sort the screenshots out of order  I'm going to guess no since it's just grabbing the system time but if anyone could help that'd be appreciated.  <answer132235> Open your System Preferences  ul liLanguage &amp; Region/li liCheck the 24 hr box/li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/RC0sI.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer221267> For OSX 10.10.5 Yosemite  Please note there are two different locations in your time settings.  The one that is located on the 3rd tab "Clock" does NOT change the format of your screen shots:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MgDGu.png" alt="enter image description here" Select the 1st tab "Date &amp; Time", then select the "Open Language &amp; Region" button on this page. Then, check the "Time Format [checkbox] 24-Hour Time"  This should fix your problem.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZivmF.png" alt="enter image description here"
