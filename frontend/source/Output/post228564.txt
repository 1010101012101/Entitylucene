Connecting a keyboard and trackpad to iPad Pro <body> This might look like a weird question so let me explain properly first.  I have built a special desk with a stand to hold an strongiPad Pro/strong. My problem is that when the iPad is inside the stand, it is at a perfect angle for the user to watch the content on the screen but it is not really in a good position be reached anymore.  emSo I want to use a strongwireless device/strong to use as keyboard and trackpad (mouse) from where I am sitting in order to interact with the iPad Pro./em  ul liI started by looking at the strongMagic Keyboard + Magic Trackpad 2/strong but putting these two devices next to each other is unfortunately longer than the free space I have available on the desk. I tried to find a combined version of the Keyboard and Trackpad but I have not been able to find one that works wireless. (I am also not 100% sure that iPad Pro iOS is compatible to be used with Magic Keyboard and Trackpad)/li liI have also tried to find out if another (smaller) iPad such as iPad mini or an iPhone can be used as a keyboard/trackpad to control the iPad Pro but I can not seem to find any answer online. Is this possible? or can a Apple TV2 remote be used to control an iPad Pro?/li /ul  Does anyone know of a device that I could use to control the iPad Pro from a distance? (I need a device that does not stick out and goes well with the rest of the design, so please don't suggest an ugly Logitech keyboard)  strongemEDIT:/em/strong  I have now done some testing:  ul listrongMagic Keyboard/strong could successfully be connected and used as a keyboard with the iPad Pro./li listrongTrackpad 2/strong on the other hand would not connect to the iPad Pro. It would just not show up as a bluetooth device on the iPad Pro./li /ul  So I am still looking for a solution to control the iPad wirelessly.
