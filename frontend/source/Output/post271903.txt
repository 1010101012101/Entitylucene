Daily agenda notification in calendar? <body> I want to receive notification every morning with list of things (daily agenda) for the day in my Macbook. I could not find a way to set that up in Calendar, so is there another option or can I use AppleScript to accomplish this?  <answer271920> Maybe not exactly what you are looking for, but have a look at the "Today" view of the macOS Notification Center.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/szWoR.png" alt="enter image description here"  Personally, I use the calendar in iStat Menus.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QUblW.png" alt="enter image description here"  You find further calendar options in this question.  <answer272002> It's pretty simple actually. Create a text document and name it daily agenda or whatever. Add your daily agenda items into that new text document.  ol liOpen calendar app and create a new event and name it "daily agenda" or whatever/li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/O096R.png" alt="enter image description here"  ol start="2" liThen on the right side of the calendar app click where you see the information and other items of that event/li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/XWwaQ.png" alt="enter image description here"  ol start="3" liEdit the starts and ends times to what you would like them To be/li liThen click "repeats" and edit those values/li liThen click "alerts" and choose custom and select "Open file at time of event" and select that new text document you created with your itemized daily agenda items/li liAdd multiple alerts if you would like/li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/K4hrm.png" alt="enter image description here"  Now every time that calendar event runs, it will launch your daily agenda text document and any other alerts you have set up  <comment341761> Calendar doesn't support this, but it should be possible to script something like that using AppleScript or similar. Are you open for such a solution? <comment341764> @patrix, yes if it works I am open to the solution but I do not know how to do this in AppleScript. <comment341972> hey, but i want the daily agenda to be the events of that specific day as a summary of things that are up ahead that day. I do not think this method makes it possible, does it?
