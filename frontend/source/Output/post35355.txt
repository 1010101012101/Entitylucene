Partitions in Mac <body> Recently I got a Mac mini with OS X 10.7 installed. Right now it has one 500GB hard disk.   What I want to know is wheather we can partition the hard disk like on Windows. I would like to save my working files in a separate partition so that if I need to re-install (clean install) the operating system on the Mac, my working files stay intact.   <answer35356> Disks can be partitioned without any problem: just open Disk Utility, select the disk and choose "Partition" on the right.  You will be able to resize your partition and create an additional one.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lKqEZ.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment40253> No need to capitalize Mac: is not an acronym <comment40261> You can reinstall the Mac OS without having the need to restore your installed applications and home folder. If you're new to Mac, you should really check out [Time Machine](http://www.apple.com/findouthow/mac/#timemachinebasics) for backups. <comment40280> You can't use Disk Utility to non-destructively partition/resize the partitions of the drive you're booted from. You'll need to boot from a backup or a Lion install disk before you can resize your system's main drive. <comment40308> On the contrary, i do it all the time, as long as u have space at the end of a partition. <comment40309> Really good advice ^ don't bother going through the hassle of 2 partitions <comment40313> Wow, you're right. I've been wasting time booting from a startup disk. Seeing all the other options grayed out made me think resizing wasn't available. Thanks.
