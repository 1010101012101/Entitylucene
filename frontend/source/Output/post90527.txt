Auto open 4 terminal sessions and SSH them to a given host <body> I'm doing Rails development on a MacBook via a VirtualBox setup that's somewhat similar to Vagrant. My inconvenience is that I like to have at least 3 terminal tabs connected to the VM via SSH (one for running the Rails server, one for the Rails console and the third to run general command, possibly others for running tail, etc) and I have to open these connections every time I start developing.   Is there a way to automate this?  <answer90532> You could try creating a profile for each tab (changing Shell  Run command), opening tabs for each profile in some window, and then saving the window as a window group. See this answer.  Or use an AppleScript like this:  precodetell application "Terminal"     activate     do script "echo 1" -- this always opens a new window     tell application "System Events"         keystroke "t" using command down     end tell     do script "echo 2" in window 1 end tell /code/pre  Other related questions:  ul liHow can I write a script to open multiple terminal tabs and execute code in them?/li liHow can I open multiple customized terminal shells?/li liIs it possible to script opening terminal with 3 tabs?/li liTrying to use applescript to launch cmd line 3 scripts in new tabs/li /ul  <answer90541> This Applescript should work for you, just replace the values on the first two lines to your liking. It opens a new window with the number of tabs specified (on line 2), and runs a given command in each of them (set on line 1).  Use AppleScript Editor or Automator to turn it into an application you can run like any other app, or you can use something like FastScripts or Keyboard Maestro to run it from a hotkey.  precodeset mycommand to "echo test" set number_of_tabs to 3  tell application "Terminal"     activate     -- open new window     tell application "System Events"         keystroke "n" using command down     end tell     do script mycommand in front window     repeat number_of_tabs - 1 times         my create_tab()         do script mycommand in front window     end repeat end tell  on create_tab()     tell application "System Events"         keystroke "t" using command down     end tell end create_tab /code/pre  <comment106271> I'll have a look at the resources you mentioned. I'll probably figure something out. Thank you.
