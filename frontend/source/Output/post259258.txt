iPhone backup gets stuck at the very end <body> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/SPNsp.png" alt="enter image description here"  Using Mac OS X El Capitan.  I already tried removing the backup (which could be corrupted) and tried it again. Same result. (and removing the backup took like 15 mins...)  What's going on here?   I already repaired permisions.   <comment324314> What version is your iPhone running? <comment324321> Are you using iTunes to backup? <comment324509> It just took more than 3 hours. But it was extremely slow at the end. It seemed it was stopped but it eventually moved every half hour or so.  iPhone 7. Yeah, iTunes.
