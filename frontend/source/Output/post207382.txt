How do I temporarily enable package installation without any permission prompt <body> Whenever I need to install an app using the package installer, there will be a prompt asking for admin user's name and password. How do I temporarily turn this feature off, so that any package can be installed automatically?  <answer207385> You'll want to go into your System Preferences, and into Security &amp; Privacy  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/m9CK5.png" alt="enter image description here"  Then unlock - if needed - the lock on bottom left, and select "Anywhere". The computer might ask you for your password.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/eY4B6.png" alt="enter image description here"  When you're done, you should be able to open and install many .DMG installers without being prompted for a password.  When you are done, you can revert these settings as they are a good security to prevent third party apps from installing automatically on your computer.  <comment250101> Strangely, everything in the general tab is greyed out even after i unlock it. Any idea why and how to fix it? <comment250105> Could you try repairing your permissions in Disk Utility, and restarting (while leaving the lock open), and trying again, see if you still run into this greyed out problem?
