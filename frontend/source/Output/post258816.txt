How to completely disable Siri on Sierra? <body> I have answered 'No' to Siri initial prompt, but I can still see it in my process list. I've tried to kill it, but it loads again immediately. How can I unload and remove Siri from my Mac?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2uU9a.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer258819> Der Flounder post Blocking Siri on macOS Sierra contains plist files that keeps her from running and suppresses her from the menu bar:  h3com.apple.assistant.support.plist/h3  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt; &lt;!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"&gt; &lt;plist version="1.0"&gt; &lt;dict&gt;     &lt;key&gt;Assistant Enabled&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;false/&gt; &lt;/dict&gt; &lt;/plist&gt; /code/pre  h3com.apple.Siri.plist/h3  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt; &lt;!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"&gt; &lt;plist version="1.0"&gt; &lt;dict&gt;     &lt;key&gt;StatusMenuVisible&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;false/&gt;     &lt;key&gt;UserHasDeclinedEnable&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;true/&gt; &lt;/dict&gt; &lt;/plist&gt; /code/pre  There are also mobileconfig files to have it automatically disabled by the scripts linked there too.  hr  Notes:   ul liyou might have to fiddle your way around the SIP (System Integrity Protection mode) before you can actually modify these files./li lithe referenced files are copied over from the equivalent settings for iOS, and may not necessarily work as expected on Sierra. Use with care! /li /ul  <answer258981> Ok, I found out the whole procedure by myself, thanks to @blueberryfields and @bret7600.  First of all you need to disable System Integrity Check to be able to edit codecom.apple.Siri.plist/code file.  ol liReboot in Recovery mode by restarting your Mac and holding kbdCommand/kbd+kbdR/kbd. It can take more time to boot as usual, that's OK, just be patient./li liIn top menu go to strongUtilities/strong and open Terminal./li liType codecsrutil disable/code and press kbdEnter/kbd/li liType codereboot/code and press kbdEnter/kbd to reboot again./li /ol  Now you should edit codecom.apple.Siri.plist/code file.  ol liOpen Terminal.app/li liType codesudo nano /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.Siri.plist/code to open the file in nano editor with root privileges./li liFind the following lines code &lt;key&gt;Disabled&lt;/key&gt; &lt;false/&gt; /code and change them to code &lt;key&gt;Disabled&lt;/key&gt; &lt;true/&gt; /code/li liPress kbdControl/kbd+kbdX/kbd then kbdy/kbd and then kbdEnter/kbd to save the file and exit nano./li /ol  Now you should enable System Integrity Check back. It is there for a reason.  ol liReboot in Recovery mode by restarting your Mac and holding kbdCommand/kbd+kbdR/kbd  ol start="2" liIn top menu go to strongUtilities  Terminal/strong/li liType codecsrutil enable/code and press kbdEnter/kbd/li liType codereboot/code and press kbdEnter/kbd to reboot again./li /ol/li /ol  Now if you check Activity Monitor - you should see no traces of Siri there. You can repeat this procedure with code/System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.assistantd.plist/code to disable it either.  <comment323624> Under **System Preferences**  **Siri**, have you unchecked the **[] Enable Siri** checkbox? As to removing Siri, in the voice of HAL 9000 from 2001: A Space Oddesy, I'm sorry Anton, I cannot allow you to do that. :) <comment323783> those instructions are incomplete at best - the plist files appear to be dated mobile versions, and there are other problems with the process, including sierra prevents editing of the files in /System/Library/LaunchDaemon directory <comment358268> Mhm, okaaay, I will definitely not going to install Sierra... <comment370515> i didn't need to restart in recovery mode, just restart at the end of the instructions.
