Settings to help see the certificate from "Profiles & Device Management" in the Mail->Account->Advanced->S/MIME settings? <body> Have installed a .crt S/MIME file from COMODO into the General-Profiles &amp; Device Management (shows it contains a "certificate").  However when I go into Mail, Contacts, Calendars and select the relevant Mail account. When I check the Advanced-S/MIME-Sign it only shows my Crashalytic certificates and NOT the freshly installed Comodo S/Mime one.  Are their certain settings that may need to be changed to allow it to be seen?  <comment308910> Did you try restarting your phone? It sound silly, but sometimes a restart is all you need. <comment309337> @RushilSrivastava yes I have, unfortunately still not working. I was wondering if it may be related to the fact it was the free comodo version, so was not verified by Apple? (However I have setup an unverified Comodo certificate on another Apple device in the same way)
