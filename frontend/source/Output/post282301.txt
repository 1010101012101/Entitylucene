Not able to remote desktop from my mac to windows from iphone hotspot <body> Okay, first off - here are the components:  ol liiPhone 6 as my Personal Hotspot/li liMacBook Pro which's connected to the Personal Hotspot/li liWindows Machine which's also connected to the Personal Hotspot/li /ol  Hence, both MacBook &amp; Windows machine should be on the same network as they're both connected to the emPersonal Hotspot/em. However, when I try using emMicrosoft Remote Desktop/em on my MacBook to connect to the Windows Machine, it says strongConnection Refused/strong.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bL8pa.png" alt="enter image description here"  Here's my configuration on emMRD/em if any of you were wondering:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/VCaGN.png" alt="enter image description here"  Below is the emGW/em settings as my Wifi Router (Personal Hotspot) seemed to be using that address:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0hdkj.png" alt="enter image description here"  How Do I resolve this?  <answer282303> I solved this. It seemed emFQDN/em is no more a thing. I tried putting the direct IP Address to the connection &amp; used no gateway. It worked.   However, I am a little curious to know why MRD won't recon emComputer Name/em while being on the same Network? That's what made me click to do more research. Not able to still digest a suitable answer.   In contrary to having used the personal hotspot, I started experimenting with a local vendor ISP &amp; were assigned a static IP. I used the emComputer Name/em &amp; that worked but with personal hotspot - it didn't, I had to always use the direct IP.  <comment355488> Not sure what you're talking about? <comment355490> Sorry.
