Hide globally specific files <body> I ran in the terminal:  codedefaults write com.apple.Finder AppleShowAllFiles YES/code  and I wonder how to hide some files like: strong.localized/strong and strongDS_Store/strong as they are messing around on desktop and other directories. Is there any way to do so? or at least do not show hidden files on specific directory  <comment138773> Here is a very similar question and answers:  http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/26886/can-you-hide-hidden-files-in-specific-folders-like-the-desktop-while-keeping-t <comment138778> You might want to consider the opposite way. Only unhide the files you want to see, not all system files. <comment138782> @viperking you do understand what those files are and do right? <comment138784> I wasn't concerned much about them, is there anything I should know? <comment138791> Messing around with system files? There is a very reason they are hidden. Use Open then press (cmd+shift+.)
