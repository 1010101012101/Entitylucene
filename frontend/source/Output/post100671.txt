Computer keeps crashing after I replaced the RAM <body> I have an early 2010 MacBook Pro. I just upgraded the RAM to 8GB because I was constantly using more than 4GB. I have upgraded to flash storage as well so I didn't want my system constantly using swap. My MacBook keeps crashing constantly. Here is my error log:  precodeInterval Since Last Panic Report:  26019 sec Panics Since Last Report:          1 Anonymous UUID:                    372A45EB-F401-8CF5-4375-11E86EC6A531  Sun Sep  1

Should I just revert back to the original 4GB RAM?  hr  Update:  I tested the RAM several times and I couldn't find the problem. I think that the RAM must have been bad near the beginning of the sequence so it was hard to find, but I'm not really sure. I just went to the store and bought new RAM and now my Mac never crashes. Thank you everyone for all of the help.  If you are having the same problem that I was having, just get new RAM, it is a lot less trouble and it will save you hours of testing your RAM (which is not fun).  <answer100674> Your system identifies the RAM correctly:     Memory Module: BANK 0/DIMM0, 4 GB, DDR3, 1333 MHz, 0x01BA,   0x202020202020202020202020202020202020 Memory Module: BANK 1/DIMM0, 4   GB, DDR3, 1333 MHz, 0x01BA, 0x202020202020202020202020202020202020   However, there is another problem with your      AppleIDAuthAgent   Try fixing it with this:  ol liRestart system in safe mode./li liIf that does not work restart in repair mode kbdâŒ˜/kbd + kbdR/kbd./li /ol  <answer100731> There are many reasons your Mac could crash.  To rule out memory, try running a memory test:   http://osxdaily.com/2011/05/03/memtest-mac-ram-test/  Additionally, you should double check that the ram you purchased runs at a supported latency. Use MacTracker or go to the website of the ram manufacture for a list of tested computers.   If you put the old ram back and the crashing stops, then that is as close to a smoking gun as you will find.   If the Memory test passes and putting the old memory back in don't fix it, the next place to look would be a corrupted OS  Try:  ul liRepair permissions, verify disk/li liBoot into safemode (hold shift key while booting up your mac)/li liDisable all startup items and enable them a few at a time until the crashing returns/li liCreate a new user account/li liIf you have a spare hard drive, install a clean OS to it and boot from it temporarily. /li /ul  <comment118449> Your RAM is fine, it is showing up correctly. <comment118450> Just because the ram shows up correctly, doesn't mean the ram isn't bad! Run a memory test to know for sure. http://osxdaily.com/2011/05/03/memtest-mac-ram-test/ <comment118451> That is a useful test for those who can get they computer operational at all. <comment118453> Once I have it in safe mode, then what do I do? <comment118454> So is the RAM test a good idea? <comment118456> I think Buscar meant that just starting up in Safe Mode and then rebooting normally fixes the problem. However, Buscar should clarify. <comment118458> Yes, it cant hurt -- not a bad idea anytime you install new ram.  After you fix  the authagent problem run a memtest like in the link above.  Let it do its thing and come back in a half hour and check if any errors came up.  Sometimes ram can be defective and most manufacturers will ship you a replacement right away if anything is wrong. <comment118460> I rebooted in safe mode and it was super slow, it took about 2 mins to boot when it usually only takes about 7 seconds. I logged in and waited a while and then rebooted. It hasn't crashed yet, I will accept this answer if it doesn't crash by tomorrow. <comment118483> Restarting in Safe mode allows os to get sorted out in the start up sequence (on the shutdown). Yours got stuck on the AppleIDAuthAgent (a keychain passwords -reason unknown). As for the RAM test, now you can actually do that since your computer is up and running. :) Enjoy your 8 gig. <comment118541> It crashed again today, i will try the RAM test. <comment118543> Waiting for the results :) <comment118545> @spuder please put your comment as an answer so if it works I can accept it. <comment118563> There is an official hardware test on the installation media (or in ROM).  Run that to see if everything is fine. <comment118564> Note that the crash may be due to the crashing program being placed in faulty RAM.  Safe mode uses memory differently and hence not trigger the same crash. <comment118584> Wasting your time testing the new RAM. Simplest way is to reinsert the old RAM. If the machines runs fine, then you have ruled out that the new memory is faulty. It could be that your Mac doesn't like it (some models are notoriously finicky about memory) or that  it is indeed just a bad stick(s). In any case, it isn't working for you so I'm not sure there is much of a point trying to isolate exactly why. A hardware fault can't be "fixed." <comment118636> I did the RAM test about 3 or 4 times, it always says everything is good but my system keeps crashing once in a while. I don't think the RAM tester is testing the RAM where it is defective. I think that there might be some dead registers somewhere near the start of the RAM and it seems like the RAM tester only tests the available RAM. Any other ideas? <comment118638> I ran the RAM tester, it always says that my RAM is good but I don't think so. I think that there is a bad register somewhere near the beginning of the sequence, is there any way to use the RAM checker to check all of the RAM, not just the available RAM? <comment118641> I almost said "I told you so" :)...your report shows a problem with the AppleIDAuthAgent!, but if you must run the Apple Hardware test just to make sure.
