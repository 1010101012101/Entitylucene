Is there a way to sync snoozed/dismissed alerts between PC, Mac and iOS using either Exchange server or iCloud? <body> I've been trying for months to find a proper way of syncing snoozed and dismissed alerts between my work PC, home Mac and iPhone.  I have both an Exchange server account (Office 365) and an iCloud account and have tried using both Outlook tasks through Exchange and Apple's Reminders app through iCloud.   In all combinations/scenarios, something doesn't work as I'd expect. For example, if I use the Reminders app and iCloud, when an alert pops up and I snooze it from the Mac, it's synced to the iPhone. It doesn't work the other way around.  Has anyone found some consistent way of snoozing and/or dismissing a task alert (preferably using Exchange server) and getting this action synced across all devices?
