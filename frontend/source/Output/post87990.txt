iPhone 4 disabled after several failed password attempts? <body> My friend has an iPhone 4. Yesterday it got disabled after several failed passcode attempts. When you press the turn on/off switch or the home screen button, the following message appears:     iPhone disabled. Connect to iTunes.   The problem is that it was synced with a computer she doesn't own anymore. And she doesn't want to lose any of her data. I wonder if it could be recovered without any data loss.   <answer87994> The only way if you don't have a backup (on pc/mac or iCloud) is to recover data with a third-party software before you attempt to restore with iTunes.br This one is well reviewed (but not cheap).
