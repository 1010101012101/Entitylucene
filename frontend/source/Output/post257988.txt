Why does the right-hand USB 3 port on my MacBook Pro (mid-2015) periodically lose USB 3 connectivity? <body> MacBook Pro (mid-2015), 2.8GHz, 1TB SSD. The circumstances that cause this are obscure, but here are the facts:  ol liNeither USB 3 external hard drive (2 different enclosures and 2 different cables) from OWC using the ASMedia 1053e chipset) will mount on right USB port (will however mount when connected to left USB port)/li liWhen this happens, "System Information" app shows no new device on USB bus/li liHowever, I can connect an iPhone 6S to the right port and it will show up in “System Information”/li liIf I create a new user account and connect the external hard drive to the right port, no change (won’t mount)/li liRestarting and/or resetting SMC fixes the problem/li /ol  This problem occurred under El Capitan and currently occurs under Sierra.  Bug or hardware problem?
