How can I allow a specific client through the firewall? <body> I am running a VM on the Mac, and I'd like to be able to share a directory with the VM. The firewall blocks rpc so the mount command hangs on the VM. It works fine when I turn the firewall off.   But I don't want the firewall off. Nor do I want the specific app to be able to receive incoming connections in general - from the whole world. I want it to just receive connections from a specific IP. Is that doable?   <comment372464> It's been a while since I configured a mac Firewall on a host but you can use `pf` and create two rules - the first one allowing the traffic from the allowed IP and the next one blocking all traffic.  `pf` if a BSD technology and there's excellent documentation [here](https://www.freebsd.org/doc/handbook/firewalls-pf.html)  In fact the fw I use is [pfSense](https://www.pfsense.org/) but I run it on a dedicated machine and use the web gui now to configure it.
