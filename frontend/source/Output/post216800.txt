How can I change the behavior of alt-return and return in Numbers 3.6? <body> According to https://discussions.apple.com/thread/2448952?start=0&amp;tstart=0, there's a box at the bottom of the table inspector:     There are at least two ways to make multiple lines in a cell. One is to use the Option-Return (Alt-Return on some keyboards) instead of a normal Return. Another way is to select your table and then View the Inspector, Table tab. Down at the bottom of the Table Inspector pane is a checkbox that controls what happens by default when you hit the Return key as you are entering text in a cell. That box is checked in the basic template, so hitting Return takes you out of the cell. Un-checking that box will cause Return to give you a new line rather than moving the focus to a different cell.   That was from 2010, and I don't see it in my up to date numbers thing, so I don't really know how to go about adjusting the setting.  Does anyone know?  <comment262087> Please make your question self-sustaining and with no need for people to jump off-site to understand what you are actually asking. <comment262655> Thanks for the reminder, @patrix . How does that look?
