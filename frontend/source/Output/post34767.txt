How can you search in the trash, and sort deleted files by date of deletion? <body> In Snow-Leopard: Is it possible to search in the Trash, and sort deleted files by date of deletion?  <answer34778> If you open up your trashcan into a Finder window. Then right click on empty space in that window go to "arrange by" and then down to date added. This is at least true in Lion I don't know what you are running or if it is true with other versions. Good luck!  <answer34945> You can use terminal to browse to the trash directory for your user  precodecd ~/.Trash/ /code/pre  then you can use  precodels -la /code/pre  to see all the files and you can search also using grep.  EDITED  to see in date order try  precodels -lt /code/pre  <comment39686> Nope, it's not there in Snow Leopard. I guess they fixed it in Lion. <comment39687> Oh, sorry. I can't help if it isn't in Lion. All I can do is recommend the Apple support pages. Most are really nice and through. <comment39700> That just sorts items by name on my 10.7.2. (If I choose to display the Date Added column, it's empty for all items). <comment39702> hmmm very strange it works on my 10.7.1 iMac. Are you sure your choosing the correct options? <comment39839> Same here. All entries for date added contain ``--``. <comment39852> Put your Finder in icon view mode. <comment83267> I tried this and unfortunately it doesn't seem to order the files by date deleted. In fact they seem to be listed in alphabetical order.
