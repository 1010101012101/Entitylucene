Merge all partitions back to single volume <body> I was trying to install windows 10 on my Retina Mid 2015 MBP using bootcamp, and ran into a few problems during the installation. Without going into too much of detail, this is what i have right now, and I am unable to codemerge all my partitions back to single volume/code and restarted again with Boot Camp Assistant installing windows.  The Disk Util in El Captian doesn't allow me to merge those partitions and I am not very familiar with DiskUtil command to do it.  here is what i have right now img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QH0y1.png" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2hP1r.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment255099> Usually if Boot Camp Assistant refuses to merge partitions, there's corruption in the primary GPT table, and the backup is used. I'd recommend taking a Time Machine backup and repartitioning the entire disk from recovery. <comment255827> yup that's what i ended up doing. just a note, one need to reformat the bootcamp partition in windows installer and wipe out the temp EFI drive before they can install windows 10 on El Captian via boot camp assistant.
