How can I control the default save location for PDFs in Microsoft Word for Mac? <body> In Microsoft Word for Mac 2011, I often need to save a copy of a document as a PDF. To do this, I open the print dialog, and then choose "Save as PDF" from the dropdown menu at the bottom:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4Ddda.png" alt="Save as PDF"  However, this seems to, by default, open the last location I've saved a PDF in. It would be far preferable for it to default to the location of the .docx file I'm working with. Is there a way to achieve this result?  <answer100618> The save as PDF option in the Print window is controlled by the system, not Word. It will default to the last place you saved a PDF because that's all it knows about. It is completely separate from (and unaware of) the Open and Save dialog boxes. That said, you can save a Word document as a PDF from File  Save As, and that will respect your last working directory related to the docx file.  <comment118132> Default directories for both open (GetFile) and save (PutFile) are defined in the com.microsoft.word.plist file in the ~/Library/Preferences folder. However, the value is not tied to your working directory, but the last value invoked by the user (i.e., the last place you opened or saved a document). <comment118134> So in theory, it should default to the location of the .docx file, if I had just saved that file, correct? Unfortunately, that's not the behavior I observe.
