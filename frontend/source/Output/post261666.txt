make cmd-tab switch between spaces (with a preview) <body> i'm a bit of a rogue and full-screen all my apps into spaces. as a result, i find cmd-tab a bit useless.  instead, i'd like to make cmd-tab (or a different shortcut) show a preview of all the spaces and let me choose one. basically something similar to view at the top of mission control:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pVw0X.png" alt="for example"  is this possible?
