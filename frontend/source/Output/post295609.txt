Relation between CPU usage and number of cores <body> I'm using codeMacBookPro13,2/code that have a processor with two cores.  When I run a software that consume a lot of CPU, codeActivity Monitor/code shows the software using more than 200% of CPU.  I thought CPU maximum usage is 100% for each core. Why the CPU usage became over 200%? How much is the max CPU usage in my environment?
