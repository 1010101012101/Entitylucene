Can't Access Windows 7 Partition From Boot Menu After Updating To Mountain Lion <body> I recently updated my OS to mountain lion, since I have lost the ability to access my Windows 7 partition from the boot menu.  Can anyone explain if and how I might go about getting back in to it?    <comment97411> Have you checked bootcamp utility? <comment97430> Yeh, says its un-bootable. <comment97433> has it fixed your issue? <comment97444> No it hasn't, as I said above, its unbootable.  I'm trying testdisk now <comment97446> You can try to use [rEFIt](http://refit.sourceforge.net/) or [migrate w7 installation](http://superuser.com/questions/367059/migrate-unbootable-windows-7-installation) <comment97580> Thanks for the advise, I will try it over the weekend.  Much appreciated.
