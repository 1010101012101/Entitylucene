Why does CMD+1 work if using my top row numkeys, but not my right-side NumPad? Mac <body> I use a lot of keyboard shortcuts, like codeCMDkey + 1/code. However, that code1/code has to be from my top row numeric keys. If I try using codeCMDkey/code plus a number from the NumPad on the right side of my keyboard - this fails. Even though when I plainly type numbers, my NumPad will type the number just like my top row numeric keys.  Why does codeCMD+1/code work if using my top row numkeys, but not my right-side NumPad?  <answer170974> I'm the kind of person who loves numberpads, but after transitioning to Macbook pro, there's a emthing/em.  You see, we all know that Macbooks are made simplistic and adaptable, but it's also similar to Windows keyboard emin/em a way. Do you ever use a Ctrl+1 emfrom/em a numberpad? no. You use it on the number row. You might've saw my mistake here. Normally there is no Ctrl+1 on Windows unless programmed to do so.   But imagine it like Ctrl+emF1/em -  F1 is on the top. So as Macbook keyboards do. But Macs hardly use the F keys unless codefn/code is held. Imagine holding that everytime you need to do an action. Fussy fussy. So they use the numbers in the number row instead of the F keys.  So the default emand/em easier way is to use the number row instead of the number pad, so that it acts like the F keys on Windows.  - strongThat's the way of the Apple, easy to use and beautiful looking!/strong  hr  I guess you could program the Mac to use a different shortcut, as mentioned here in Lifehacker or iDownloadblog  <comment201072> In what context? An app? Any app? The key codes are not the same, some apps differentiate, others don't. <comment201073> yes, in-app. Specifically, on Google Web Apps and IntelliJ <comment201074> Finder is the same. Ctrl/[numpad]1 & Ctrl/1 are not equivalent. Unless the app has slots for more than one shortcut, & also differentiates, you may be stuck with an either/or situation. <comment201075> That's very frustrating. A `1` is the same number however I type it. <comment201076> same number, but not same key. Sometimes the difference is very useful, other times irritating. I don't think there's a system-wide sitting to en[dis]able that <comment201078> It's not even consistent in Adobe CC apps: Illustrator recognizes the keypad but InDesign doesn't when changing the display zoom ratio. <comment201081> Is there any way I can have MacOS say a `1` is a `1` regardless of the key that entered it? <comment201132> One of the first things I did was set the F keys to be F1/F2/etc by default. <comment201156> Then you may have to manually change the shortcuts to the one on the number pad somehow. The tutorials I provided should do this.
