Then clean install MS Office IN ENGLISH. It worked for me anyway - I've encountered the same weird behaviour on 2 machines with Russian MS Office, while the 3rd (with English one) was running fine. Guess this is just Microsoft's way of saying "learn friggin English, dudes!" :)  <comment141864> It is a known problem already, without solution, other than try reinstalling ms office bundle. <comment141876> Thanks for your reply. I presume that by "trying to reinstall" you mean that it's not 100% sure that the problem won't occur again?
