How to force Apple Watch to update "Reminders" app? <body> I have an Apple Watch that doesn't want to sync.  When I update Reminders via iCloud.com or my iPhone 6, or my iPad 2, they sync well with each other via wifi.  I try to keep Bluetooth off generally. When I turn Bluetooth on, in my Watch and iPhone, Reminders seems to take an age to sync.  The only partial solution I've found is to turn Bluetooth on for the Watch and iPhone, then check off a task in Reminders on the Watch, then wait for it to tell the iPhone about the updated task.  Is there a good way to prompt my Watch to sync after turning on Bluetooth?
