How can I install hundreds of pkg files? <body> I have a directory full of pkg files that I need to install.  I tried "installer -packages *.pkg" , but that didn't work.  Any ideas on how to do this?  Do I need to make a metapackage?    <answer287972> Use cycle for this. You can type next in your terminal command line:   precodefor f in *.pkg; do installer -packages "$f"; done /code/pre  <comment363599> Quote the variable: `installer -packages "$f"` will help avoid things failing or possibly going horribly awry should any of the package files have spaces in their names. <comment363601> @thrig right, thanx!
