Why does a iPhone better than Galaxy? <body> I have a Samsung Galaxy S4 and I consider to buy iPhone 5S. What are the advantages of iPhone relatively to Galaxy?  <answer114108> iPhone combines software and hardware that both designed by Apple which drives to better performance.  iPhone's body is aluminum compared to plastic of the Galaxy s4.  iPhone running iOS, personally I think it's a better OS.  <answer114110> I'm not sure an Android vs. iPhone argument is really appropriate hereâ€¦ but what do I know? :D  It seems the majority of the best apps come to iOS first, others second, if at all. Also, this is a pretty good reason: http://www.tomsguide.com/us/android-flaw-trifecta,news-17976.html emAndroid Security-Flaw Trifecta Threatens Smartphones, Tablets/em. Apple's ecosystem may be more locked-down and restricted, but it certainly appears to have better security.  <comment133784> This is *subjective*. There are many great things about the iPhone 5/iOS, but there are as many great things about the Samsung Galaxy/Android. <comment133785> This question appears to be off-topic because it is subjective and has no canonical answer. Personal preference plays too large a role in answering this.
