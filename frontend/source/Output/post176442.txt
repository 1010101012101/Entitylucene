Can't find my apache error_log folder <body> new Mac (Yosemite) and setting up a new dev environment. At the moment cannot find any codeerror_log/code folder at the following paths:  precode/var/log/apache2/error_log /private/var/log/apache2/error_log /var/log/httpd/error_log /code/pre  Any thoughts on where that folder may be?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vP87N.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer176444> The location of codeerror_log/code is defined in code/etc/apache2/httpd.conf/code. Run  precodegrep '^ErrorLog' /etc/apache2/httpd.conf /code/pre  to see the definition.   <comment208329> Is apache running at all? <comment208331> @patrix I did `sudo apachectl restart` and didn't see anything come up, so tried to check the `sudo tail -f /var/log/apache2/error_log` and that's where I went down this path of trying to figure out if it's running or not <comment208334> Thanks! yeah it says `/private/var/log/apache2/error_log` which I checked, and there was no error_log folder in there. So I went ahead and made one... fingers crossed <comment208335> Try to connect to the websever at `localhost` and/or run `ps aux|grep http` to see whether apache is running at all. <comment208336> It's a file, not a folder! Creating a folder with the same name may cause problems, and apache should definitively create the file itself if needed. <comment208337> Nothing is running at `localhost` or `localhost/app` and this is what I see after running ps: leongaban      10849   0.0  0.0  2432772    672 s006  S+    2:56PM   0:00.00 grep --color=auto --exclude-dir=.bzr --exclude-dir=.cvs --exclude-dir=.git --exclude-dir=.hg --exclude-dir=.svn http <comment208338> Thx, ok so I removed that folder I made, still no error_log, I guess I have to post a new question about how to run Apache on OSX <comment208339> No running apache, no error log :-/ <comment272526> Found the location but no error log in here.
