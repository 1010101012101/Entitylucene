Notes format Mavericks (v2) to El Captain (v6) how to? <body> Here is the thing. I upgraded my Mac from Mavericks to Sierra and then deleted a note by mistake.  I have another computer with El Capitan. However, I have a Mavericks Time Machine backup. I tried to restore the notes from Mavericks to El Capitan by moving the files to ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.Notes/Data/Library/Notes  but it its not working because Notes app seems to be stored in a different format.  And I see these files:  Mavericks Notes folder  NotesV2.storedata NotesV2.storedata-shm NotesV2.storedata-wal   In my new computer, in Mavericks, I see the notes in the same path, but the files are:  El Capitan Notes folder  NotesV6.storedata NotesV6.storedata-shm NotesV6.storedata-wal   I have tried renaming these files from V2 to V6 but it's not working.  Any solution? I have been searching everywhere. This is for a book project so this note is very important. Thank you so much   <comment327672> Have you tried going to recently deleted in notes? (If you have iCloud notes turned on)
