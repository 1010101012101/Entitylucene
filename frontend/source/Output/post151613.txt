iPhone hotspot prioritized over ethernet <body> In Yosemite, when I connect my iPhone to my Macbook Air through USB the iPhone becomes a internet hotspot for my Mac, even though I've connected the MBA via ethernet. If I enable Wifi, then Wifi is prioritized.  Can I change so that ethernet is prioritized over the iPhone?  <answer151614> ol liOpen System Preferences/li liSelect Network preferences pane/li liClick gear menu in lower-left corner of Network pane and choose "Select Service Order..."/li liDrag the services into whichever order you want/li liClick OK/li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GknXc.png" alt="Screenshot of Network pane with Service Order panel open"
