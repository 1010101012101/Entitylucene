Issues when entering password finishing with '^' character <body> I am using a password that has been generated by the organization where I work, and that specific password terminates with the code^/code character. This password cannot be changed so I must keep it for the rest of my life.  The problem is that on a Mac, I can't enter this password properly (I am essentially talking about webpageswith input forms, when logging to my account). When writing into an HTML input box using a PC or on any Linux distribution, if I wan't to write the code^/code character, I simply have to press the kbd^/kbd key followed by a kbdspace/kbd. But using a mac, this process doesn't work, pressing kbdspace/kbd right after won't write the code^/code character.  What I need to do every time I enter my password, is to write the code^/code into a place I can see it, copy it, and paste it at the end of the input box. This way it works...  I have no idea where this can be fixed up...  <comment269660> What exacty happens if you press the kbd^/kbd followed by kbdspace/kbd? It works fine for me as we speak:  http://up.frd.mn/FbUEmvpNGd.gif <comment269665> It works everywhere, except into Password fields. In this particular case, the character isn't written... <comment269666> By the way, how did you generated that .gif ? <comment269670> What language keyboard? ^ is Shift/6 on an English keyboard. <comment269680> I am using a Azerty (French) keyboard, using the apple mapping. So the '^' key is right next to the 'p' key. <comment269688> My guess is that key is not mapping correctly on a Mac. On phone, can't test at the moment. <comment269689> I think it has something to do specifically with web pages, and as I said, with html intputs with attribute type=password. <comment269860> @MalteseFalcon You are totally right, I can confirm the same behaviour on password inputs. The first character that is recognized by the input is the "Space" key, even you i've hit "^" before.  Edit: I use the OS X' Quicktime application to record a screen video and then turn it into a gif using [gifify](https://github.com/jclem/gifify) <comment269865> That's really annoying ... And I don't know if it could be fixed... I could write some JS code to deal with it... Thanks for the tip :)
