You want to first disable MERP, then you would get a better error description for the actual cause of the problem.  You can disable MERP like this:  ol liUsing Finder, browse to the folder: /Library/Application Support/Microsoft/MERP2.0/li liDouble-click Microsoft Error Reporting/li liIn Preferences: Uncheck "Enable Microsoft Error Reporting"/li /ol  <answer262478> I had this issue and no one at Apple or Microsoft could resolve it. I stumbled upon a patch from Microsoft after various Google searches:  https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3187505  The file is under manual updates:  https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3187505  A similar answer is provided on the SuperUser exchange here:  <comment305732> ask me for any extra information if needed <comment305745> Well that didn't changed the error but right now I'm updating excel from auto update and I'll report you tomorrow for any news. <comment305798> update solved it
