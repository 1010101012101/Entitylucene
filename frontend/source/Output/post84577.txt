Install Xcode 4.2 on OS X 10.8 <body> Is there a way to install Xcode 4.2 on OS X 10.8?  I need to compile some Firemonkey projects on my MBP (latest without retina) and I have OS X 10.8 installed and through normal means it's not possible to install Xcode 4.2.  <answer84597> No, strongyou can't run Xcode 4.2 on OS X 10.8 (Mountain Lion)./strong  Xcode 4.2 is available as a download from the developer site at Apple:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/92wJQ.png" alt="enter image description here"  but it needs Lion.  On Mountain Lion, Xcode 4.2.x will show an error message similar to this, as mentioned here or here:  precodeThis installation of Xcode 4.2.x requires Mac OS X 10.7 Lion. /code/pre  If you need Xcode 4.2 you will need to install Lion, preferably on an external harddrive to avoid overwriting your current Mountain Lion installation.  <answer84602> There's answer on Apple discussions groups to install Mac OS X Lion into virtual machine to use previous FM-ios.  PS: You're allowed to install Mac OS X in virtual machine on Apple hardware which meets requirements.  <comment97357> Which are those *normal means*? <comment97362> Why can't you use the more modern Xcode 4.6 ? <comment97366> If the reason is that you need the 10.6 SDK take a look at this question: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11989007/where-to-get-sdk-10-6-for-xcode <comment97394> 1- without destroying my current setup, preferable legal since I actually "own" a "license" for both osx 10.7 and 10.8 2-firemonkey only works with 4.2, I have the 4.6 3-no, that's not the reason. <comment97409> Is Firemonkey this [dev environment](http://stackoverflow.com/tags/firemonkey/info)? If so what exactly does it need? <comment97554> As a side note: According to Apple's licensing policies, only OS X 10.8 (Mountain Lion) client or server, 10.7 (Lion) client or server, 10.6 (Snow Leopard) server and 10.5 (Leopard) server can be virtualized (see http://kb.vmware.com/selfservice/microsites/search.do?language=en_US&cmd=displayKC&externalId=1000131). Fortunately, the OP needs Lion, which can be virtualized in its client and server versions. There's a related question, also asked by the OP, here: http://superuser.com/questions/562238/recover-osx-lion-install/562268 <comment98416> @JakeArmstrong, I added an answer explaining why Xcode 4.2 can't be installed on OS X 10.8. Now that your issue is solved (http://superuser.com/questions/562238/on-a-mac-that-was-originally-shipped-with-lion-how-can-i-replace-mountain-lion), could you take a look at my answer below and if you feel it answers your question mark your question as answered? <comment209304> yes, but **how** did you get those results? <comment209382> @Thufir Honestly, I don't remember, my post is 2 years old. Why do you ask?
