Macbook pro keeps returning to login window <body> No matter what settings I apply within System Preferences, after a time of inactivity the login screen pops up. I'm attempting to backup to an external hard drive and create a time machine backup, but both stop once the login screen appears.  What setting am I missing that will prevent this from happening?  <answer126323> Are you sure it's the full login screen or is it just asking for your password?  If so, you can turn off "Require Password ______ after sleep or screen saver begins" in the "Security and Privacy" system preference.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kYqGX.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer126328> Actually it can be fixed by unlocking the lock on the Security &amp; Privacy settings and unchecking or adjusting the "Log out after XX minutes of inactivity" option within the Advanced... section.
