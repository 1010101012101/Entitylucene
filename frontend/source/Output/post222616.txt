Photos app no longer sees my phone <body> I have an android phone connected using PTP over USB. (A Fairphone FP1)  OSX used to launch Photo's every single time I plugged in the phone to charge, which was very annoying, so I unticked the box that said "Open Photos for this device"  Now Photo's cannot see the device. Not at all. Not ever.  If I open Photo's manually, the device is not shown at all in the sidebar or anywhere else.  I also checked this question and the phone doesn't appear in the devices on Image Capture either.  Any suggestions how I can get photos of this device again?  <comment279528> I'm experiencing exactly the same issue with an HTC First.  Any luck with a resolution?  Have you tried a different USB cable? <comment286604> Its not a connectivity issue, I can still use other apps to access it. No resolution found :-(
