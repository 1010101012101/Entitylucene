OS X: Change sharing-only account to 'normal' account <body> Somehow, OS X changed my main user account to sharing-only. This means that all data in the user folder is still existent on the disk, I can't login to that user. Is there a way to revert a sharing-only user to a normal account.  <answer212519> ul liOpen the Users panel in Preferences/li liUnlock the panel (if necessary)/li liRight-click on your changed account, select "Advanced Options..."/li liReassign a login shell and a home directory to the user if necessary/li liClick on your changed account/li liEnable Administrator option/li liWait for the user type changing to Admin in the user list/li liDisable Administrator option again/li /ul
