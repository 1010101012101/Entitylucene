Windows shares keep dropping from OS X <body> I have a Windows Server 2012 machine providing shares for multiple workstations.  I have 2 Mac users that connect to this server and use the shared folders. They report that this share keeps dropping. Everytime they report it, I check from my Windows workstation and the shares appear to be online -- there seems to be no issue.  Is there anything I can do to make the mounted share consistent and not disappear? The issue is only on the Macs.  Both are running OS X v10.9.3  <answer133058> I have similar problems with users on my network using Mavericks, where no such issue existed with Mountain Lion. Most users can live with it, and they simply re-mount the disk. Apparently, the SMB implementation on Mavericks is different than it was in prior OS releases. What I have found is that if I connect to drives using strongcifs://servername/strong rather than strongsmb://servername/strong, this pretty much mitigates the issue. This has been true for NAS, MFDs with Windows shares, and Windows servers alike.  <comment157604> Are the devices connected via WiFi, or Ethernet? <comment157605> Ethernet. Thanks. <comment157628> Thanks Dave I'll give it a go and let you know how it goes.
