Artists' pictures on my phone aren't the same in iTunes <body> I've transferred my favorite songs from my PC to iTunes. I wanted to edit them 'cause it was a real mess. I edited them perfectly good by iTunes and got them together. They were perfectly good and then I realized a problem when I was listening to music.  Everything is correct in iTunes. Album arts are correct on iPhone but when I click to ''Artists'' on iPhone. It shows different picture and I get crazy every time I see!  I've tried everything. It's not being JPG or PNG. It's not about size too. I've found a solution but it wasn't good enough  I've changed Artists' name in iTunes and checked my phone after synced it. It shows correct picture I've chosen but I have to change every artist's name for that. Does anyone know how to get a perfect solution? I've deleted all songs 'cause I get obsessed with everything easily.  <comment274842> Really? Isn't there anyone who has same problem?
