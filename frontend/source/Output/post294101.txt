Disable hiding windows <body> I am a switcher from Ubuntu Gnome and I find the hiding of programs pretty annoying. I prefer all windows to be visible so I can rearrange them in different spaces.  Is there a way to totally disable this behaviour in the OS so all windows are always in the foreground? No hiding/minimizing.  ------------- Clarification ------------  As @Monomeeth mentioned, the currect way of doing things may seem to work. However there are corner cases where with this enabled globally, things keep running in the background without noticing.  Such as examples include:  ol liClosing a terminal - it turns out it's still there running!/li liHolding ALT + Clicking on a window, hides the window in front of the clicked window./li liAccidentally pressing a shortcut for hiding a window or the click combination like in 2./li /ol  <comment371167> Welcome to Ask Different! :) Just to clarify, you're wanting *all* windows *always* in the foreground so that none of them are hidden? From my initial reading of your question it seems you've already found one solution (i.e. open an app and move it to a new space, open another app, move that to another space, and so on). If this doesn't achieve what you want, you may need to [edit](https://apple.stackexchange.com/posts/294101/edit) your question to clarify why this process doesn't meet your needs? Otherwise it's not clear how it's possible for *all* windows to *always* be in the foreground? <comment371170> @Monomeeth thanks. I have updated the question. Clearly there are many cases where this is just annoying. <comment371171> For what it's worth, there is some method behind the macOS madness: multi-window applications (like Terminal) stay running when you close the last window, so you can still open other windows. Single-window applications (like System Preferences) just quit.
