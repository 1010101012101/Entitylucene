Is there anyway you can track the call history to someone who keeps on cancelling your calls? <body> Is there any way to track the call history to someone who keeps on canceling your calls? I like to see how many times they've been called already. I'm using a iPhone 5.  <answer214185> Yes:  ul liOpen the Phone app and tap Recents. /li liTap the "i" icon next to the desired number. /li liA list of calls will appear with information about them./li /ul  If the call was outbound and displays no duration, it would be reasonable to assume that they didn't answer.   <comment258751> Thank you for this @bassplayer7. My phone only stores about a month history, would you know if there's anyway you can obtain more history?
