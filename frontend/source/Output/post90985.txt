File-Specific Bookmarks <body> Is there a feature in Preview that will let me maintain a collection of file-specific bookmarks? For example, I often place bookmarks at the beginning of various chapters in books. I might decide to label a bookmark as "Chapter 1: Introduction".  Unfortunately, the "Bookmarks" menu displays all of the bookmarks that I ever made. This has various problems:  ul liI can't give two bookmarks the same label./li liThe menu becomes cluttered as I accumulate more bookmarks./li /ul  <comment106855> You labeled it pdf, for that I would use adobe reader. <comment106857> @Buscarì›ƒ I prefer Preview to Adobe's Reader program. <comment106864> Good luck then since Preview is just what it says--a Preview, not a bookmarking tool with options you want.
