Is Java for OSX 2013-005 from apple a JDK6, or just a JRE? <body> I'm setting up my android development environment, and could run all my configurations (eclipse + android sdk) with either jdk from oracle,or java for osx 2013-005 from apple.  when I installed Java for OSX, I can run all jdk command line tools,like javac, jstat, jmap, etc.  I am confusing what Java for OSX 2013-005 is. Is it a JDK6 customized by apple, or just a JRE6 with removed applet and webstart?  <answer117090> It is the JDK as noted in the path /System/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/1.6.0.jdk it installs into , and also seeing what files are installed there.  As far as I understand the removal does not change Java but removes plugins from browsers  However I would use the later JDK for Java 7 from Oracle as there are some improvements in the environment and language as per Oracle's release notes
