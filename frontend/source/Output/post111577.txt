Can I use an iTunes gift card to sign up for the developer program? <body> I want to develop apps for Apple devices but I can't get them there as I do not have a credit card. So, can I use an iTunes gift card to sign up for the developer program or, do I really need to use credit card?  <answer111674> No,  you can't use a gift card. You might want to try a prepaid credit card. You can get them at most places that sell gift cards.   <answer216259> here's one who got through developers procedure with a visa gift card. https://discussions.apple.com/message/17063878#17063878  <answer262452> I always use iTunes gift cards to pay for the developer fees. Usually manage to get them with some rebate (20% often) which makes the developer account 20% cheaper.   The long version: Your developer account is connected to an AppleID, and the developer fees are charged to the iTunes account for your AppleID. If you added a giftcard or giftcards to your iTunes account, the money is taken out of your account. If you have a credit or debit card connected to your account, it is taken off that credit card. Just like any app purchases or music / video / book purchases.   <comment261297> Cool. If Visa cards are accepted on the App Store, I don't see why a visa gift card wouldn't work. Different than an iTunes gift card, but cool option. <comment328790> Good that Apple didn't realise when I paid with a gift card. <comment328965> Lies.I bought a $100 gift card and now I can't pay with it.
