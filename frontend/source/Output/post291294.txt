How to stop MacOS from trying to run parity ethereum in the background <body> I've read through several threads asking similar questions.. followed all instructions, but no luck.  I installed ethereum's parity wallet a while back, but have since uninstalled.. still trying to run in the background though. I've deleted everything from the Library/Launch--- folders, and all traces that I can find. Here is a small exerpt my log if anyone can help:  precodeJul 18 16:48:34 Phillips-MacBook-Pro-2 com.apple.xpc.launchd[1] (io.parity.ethereum[20061]): Service could not initialize: 15G1510: xpcproxy + 12676 [1462][AC88755B-71A4-3A7A-B371-81044CF79DFE]: 0xd Jul 18 16:48:34 Phillips-MacBook-Pro-2 com.apple.xpc.launchd[1] (io.parity.ethereum): Service only ran for 0 seconds.
