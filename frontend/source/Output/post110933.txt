iMessage with shared Apple ID <body> I was recently notified that my ex boyfriend signed into iMessage on his laptop using my email address. I have since then changed my Apple ID password and was immediately asked to enter my new password into iCloud. If I changed the password, will it automatically sign out on his computer as well? And, if so, is he still able to use my email for iMessage?  <answer110963> If you change the password, he will can't login iMessages with your Apple ID. When he open it and want to launch iMessage, it will tell him the password is not correct. He can't use  it any more.
