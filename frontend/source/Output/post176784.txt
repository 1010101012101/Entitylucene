Code to fix: WindowServer[250]: _CGXGLDisplayContextForDisplayDevice: No matching context for device (0x7fcfcaf18220) - disabling OpenGL <body> I need help implementing the answer to WindowServer[250]: _CGXGLDisplayContextForDisplayDevice: No matching context for device (0x7fcfcaf18220) - disabling OpenGL by inserting the following into wherever it goes:  precode? [= Sender WindowServer] [= Level Warning] [A= Message _CGXGLDisplayContextForDisplayDevice] claim only /code/pre  I'm not a coder but I can get to Terminal and past in code and press enter.  That's the extent of my ability.  So, if there's something to do before putting this statement in Terminal I would need to know what, where, and how, etc.  Thank you.  <answer176804> From the original answer:  Type the following into your terminal: codesudo nano /etc/asl.conf/code. Now, use the arrow key to go to the bottom. When you are at the bottom, paste it the following:  precode? [= Sender WindowServer] [= Level Warning] [A= Message _CGXGLDisplayContextForDisplayDevice] claim only /code/pre  (There is nothing special, just command+v).  Now, hit control+x and hit y. Now, type codesudo kill -hup syslog/code.  Sudo means super user grant, so you are giving the command access to all of your machine.  <comment208858> Could I encourage you to edit the original answer directly with the above, more detailed description on how to change `asl.conf`? We probably don't need to questions for the same topic, I would then close this one here as a duplicate. <comment208859> @patrix Okay. I'll pull it up. <comment208860> @patrix According to it, my answer changes too much. <comment208861> Hmm, ok. I'll try myself then :-) <comment208862> @patrix Could you mention http://www.displaylink.org/forum/showthread.php?t=62987&page=4? I forgot to mention it. <comment208863> The original answer has been edited, should be more obvious now how you can change the file. <comment208869> Didn't exactly work the way it was described but I tried my best. Let's see if I get more kernel panics. Thanks.
