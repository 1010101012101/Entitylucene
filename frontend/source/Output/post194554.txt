Can't get launchd task to run <body> I've done this once and I'm trying to do it on a new computer and I can't see what I'm doing wrong.  I have a ruby script in my user folder named forecast.rb. I have set it to executable (a+x). It writes a line out to another file called .weather.txt.   I want to run forecast.rb every 5 minutes.  I have a plist file named com.jwhite.forecast_tmux.plist. That file looks like:  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt; &lt;!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"&gt; &lt;plist version="1.0"&gt; &lt;dict&gt;     &lt;key&gt;Label&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;string&gt;com.jwhite.forecast_tmux&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;key&gt;ProgramArguments&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;array&gt;         &lt;string&gt;/Users/jwhite/forecast.rb&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;/array&gt;     &lt;key&gt;StartInterval&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;integer&gt;300&lt;/integer&gt; &lt;/dict&gt; &lt;/plist&gt; /code/pre  This file is located in ~/Library/LaunchAgents. And after moving it there I ran Launchctl load -w ~/Library/Launchagents/com.jwhite.forecast_tmux.plist.  If I run forecast.rb (./forecast.rb) it runs fine. But my launchd is not executing.  What am I missing?  EDIT:  I've started using LaunchControl and got the error.  precode/Users/jwhite/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.2.1/lib/ruby/site_ruby/2.2.0/rubygems/core_ext/kernel_require.rb:54:in `require': cannot load such file -- geocoder (LoadError) from /Users/jwhite/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.2.1/lib/ruby/site_ruby/2.2.0/rubygems/core_ext/kernel_require.rb:54:in `require' from /Users/jwhite/forecast.rb:3:in `&lt;main&gt;' /code/pre  But when I run this from the terminal everything executes fine. So launchctl can't read in Ruby Gems?  <answer212678> I had the same issue, trying to run a script on an interval using LaunchControl (great app, check it out). Will copy and paste straight from the source that helped me:     For GUI programs the default shell environment scripts are ignored, and therefore   RVM managed ruby versions.      The workaround is to define them via launchctl. Those values are gone   though after a reboot, so I put them in .bash_profile since I open a shell anyhow all the time, see below.      launchctl setenv GEM_HOME ~/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.2.1   launchctl setenv GEM_PATH ~/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.2.1:/Users/markus/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.2.1@global      All more permanent solutions (e.g. launchd.conf) don't work anymore in 10.10.   Hope that helps anyone who ran into a similar issue.   In my case I just set it up the correct GEM_HOME and PATH in LaunchControl.  <comment232093> What is the first line of the rb script? <comment232094> The label must match the file name without the .plist. <comment232098> @fd0 It does actually. That was a bad copy/paste from when I did this previously. I've edited the description to show what I really am doing. <comment232099> @Mark the first line is `#!/Users/jwhite/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.2.1/bin/ruby` <comment232101> Is your username jhwhite or jwhite ? Look over what you have presented. <comment232102> @fd0 Yeah, I'm making this too confusing. I copy and pasted my gist of where I did this previously instead of what I did this time. Everything is updated accordingly now. <comment232129> what envitonment  variables have you set and where did you set them <comment232135> I am not sure but IMHO you do not tell launchd when to start the job. You say do it every 5 Minutes but not `RunAtLoad` or `launchctl start ...` Maybe check that out? <comment232137> Checkout the last section: [Loading vs Starting](http://launchd.info/)
