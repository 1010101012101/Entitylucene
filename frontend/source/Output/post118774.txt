Is the logo on the back of the iPhone 5S a mirror like on the iPhone 4S? <body> I have my iPhone 4S, and the logo on the back is like a mirror. (I like it because if I get an eyelash stuck in my eye, I can use it to look into my eye up close and get it out.) Is the logo on the back of the (silver) iPhone 5S a mirror as well?  <answer118775> As you can see in this video : Yes it's the case on all 3 models.   With the iPhone 5, it's was only the case with the white model.   <answer118776> Another tip to add. Slightly less convenient tho. You can always open the camera from the lockscreen, and use the front facing camera as a mirror.   <comment138513> I have to agree it's a possibility. But I find it really lacks of sharpness.
