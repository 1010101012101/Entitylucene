How do I browse /tmp in Finder? <body> I can use the command line to :-  precodecd /tmp ls -al /code/pre  What is the equivalent to do so in finder?br I can't seems find a way to browse to that folder using finder,br (my intention is to view images which I created in /tmp)  Or is there any image browser tools can do the same?  <answer32378> One possible way I just find out is to use browser (chrome, firefox),br and in the URL bar :-  precodefile:///tmp/ /code/pre  This work like apache index directory,br is usable, but is far from ideal  <answer32381> You can use the menu Go - Go to folder and enter the path of the folder you wish to see in the resulting dialog.   You can also use the keyboard shortcut kbdShift/kbd + kbdCmd/kbd + kbdG/kbd to summon the dialog.  <answer32393> Writing codeopen /tmp/code in Terminal will open the code/tmp/code folder in Finder.  <comment37098> Too good to be true :) <comment37100> Glad I could help! =) <comment37199> This only works that nice when you're using the **system language** English. It does not work in German. Here is why: In the **terminal** all directories have English names no matter what the system settings. However, using the **go to folder** option you need to use system language directory names. ``~/Bilder`` instead of ``~/Pictures``. That can get really confusing. Can I change that? I don't know all the German directory names... <comment37201> If you do this a lot, you might want to make a link from /tmp to somewhere more convenient , i.e. "ln -s /tmp ~/Desktop/tmp" so you don't have to use Go menu every time.
