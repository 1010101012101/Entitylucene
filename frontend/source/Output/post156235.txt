How to check is Chrome is running in incognito mode using Applescript? <body> Is it possible to find out if the Chrome is running in incognito mode?   precodeif application "Google Chrome" is running then     tell application "Finder" to display dialog "Chrome is running"     // --&gt; some condition here to check if it is in incognito ?        tell application "Finder" to display dialog "Chrome is running in INCOGNITO mode" end if /code/pre  Also, I want this script to keep running. That means as soon as user opens Chrome in incognito mode I will show alert. Like this:  precodeset chromeRunning to false repeat until application "Google Chrome" is running      if not chromeRunning then         tell application "Finder" to display dialog "Chrome is started in INCOGNITO mode"         set chromeRunning to true         #may be quit the script now..     end if     delay 10 end repeat /code/pre  If this the correct approach?
