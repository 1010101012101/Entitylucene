Edit hostnames on Airport Time Capsule <body> I run a web server on my MacBook Pro for work, and I configured the hostnames on it so as to access my site locally via codemysite.dev/code. (i.e.:code/private/etc/hosts/code to include a line code127.0.0.1   mysite.dev/code.) I've been working this way for years, and I love it!  I'd like to achieve the same thing for other devices connected to the local network via Wifi, in particular phones. In that regard:  ul liBy default, computers on the network can be accessed by their network name, i.e.: codemycomputername.local/code. Indeed, I can access my local webserver from any device on the network via http://mycomputername.local/li liBy setting a static IP locally, I can do something similar, access the webserver via a static IP. e.g.: 10.0.1.137/li /ul  The missing piece of the puzzle is now stronghow to edit the hostnames on the router itselfÂ ?/strong  As far as I remember, I was able to do so on various routers in the past, simply by specifying a domain name in the router configuration to always direct to a static IP of my choosing.  I now use an strongAirport Time Capsule/strong, with strongfirmware version 7.7.8/strong. I didn't find any option for it there.  Assuming this is not possible:  ul liIs it maybe a possibility on older versions of the firmware?/li liIs there maybe an alternative to AirPort Utility that would let me configure that?/li liWould directing all the traffic through a mini-computer such as a Raspberry Pi be a sensible choice? Or would it slow down all of my Internet traffic?/li /ul  I want to stick to strongrouter-side solutions only/strong. (I'm aware of the possibility of using SquidMan + a proxy configuration on iPhone, but I'd like a solution that works out of the box for anyone connected to the local Wifi network.)  (The benefit to using codemysite.dev/code instead of codemycomputername.local/code or some IP address (in addition to being more memorable) is that I can use it in my code to test whether I'm in dev mode or in production; also, this also makes creating link inside the code more comfortable.)
