How to transfer iMessages to the computer for archival? <body> My iPhone storage space is almost all used up, mostly because of my messages. I don't want to just delete all my conversations.  Is there a way I can transfer my messages onto my PC?  <answer122753> You can create a PDF archive of your messages on your iOS device using strongPhoneView/strong:  img src="https://www.ecamm.com/images/phoneview-on-mac.jpg" alt=""     Export messages as beautiful PDF files. PhoneView also automatically backs up your messages whenever your iPhone is connected.   <comment143277> I would love to find out the same thing! I am selling my iPod and I have a MacBook, and I have over 100 contacts and messages and need to save them on my laptop.
