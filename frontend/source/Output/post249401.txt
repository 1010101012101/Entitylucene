Numeric keypad/software to have keys be recognized as numpad numbers? <body> I've assigned a long list of keyboard shortcuts for my Wacom graphics tablet. I would like to get a numeric keypad to be able to enter numbers for certain functions in Photoshop, but I would also like to use it to assign other keyboard shortcuts (this is for my work, so it would be awesome to find a way to integrate this into my setup).  To do this, I would like to have the different numeric keypad keys be recognized as numpad numbers, rather than normal numbers in the letter area (I have almost or have run out of single keys to assign). For example, 'num1' instead of of '1' (I am almost certain this can be done, since I have seen a number of screenshots of OS X software that recognize and manage numpad input). What way/how do you make this work, either by...  ul liA specific brand and/or model of numeric keypads/li liA piece of software/li liA function in OS X/li /ul  Kind regards.   <comment309359> Photoshop doesn't appear to distinguish between 'qwerty' & num-pad keys; also the system keyboard shortcut method cannot be applied to Photoshop, so I think you're out of luck. I think the functionality must need to be coded into the app itself, I have apps where that will work & apps it won't. <comment309360> As long as it is possible that OS X recognizes numpad numbers of an external numeric keypad, then it is possible to redirect shortcut keys with software. The most important part is the the computer can recognize them. Now all I need is someone to help me out with a resource or a piece of software to make this work. Regards.
