Recoreding the screen as seen by the user with Zoom enabled <body> Because of my impairment, I usually use the Zoom feature built into OS X, and I'm giving a presentation in which I'd like to show a video of how I use the web. To do so, I'd like to make a screen recording that shows the screen as seen with zoom enabled. Is there a way to do this, preferably with QuickTime or ScreenFlow?  <comment247949> You mean the zoom feature with ctrl+mwheel? My screenflow records the screen as I see it, with zoom. Does it not for you? <comment247955> No, it doesn't. Could it be because I hae an old version of screenflow? 2.1.9 <comment247980> I guess so, I'm using 4.5 which I thought is old :D
