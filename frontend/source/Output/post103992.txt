JavaScript problem while installing NetBeans and JDK in OS X 10.5.8 - Leopard <body> I downloaded the newest version of NetBeans and JDK and wanted to install it on my MacBook that runs on OS X 10.5.8 but I couldn't. This is the screenshot I made : img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2Qiza.png" alt="enter image description here"  Maybe since the this OS X version is quite old I will be pushed to install some older version of NetBeans...  Anyway, why does it say I have a problem with JavaScript?  <answer103995> I just found out I want to install the 64 bit version of NetBeans but I have 32 bit OS X....  So, that can be the reason...
