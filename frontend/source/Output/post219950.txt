VLC shows up in all desktops <body> I have VLC media player installed in my MBP (EL Capitan). Recently when I play a video file in the VLC media player it shows up in all the desktops.  I mean I have multiple desktops in the display and the vlc plays the movie in all the desktops excepts for the ones where I have an application in fullscreen.   Can anyone tell me how I can revert to original settings so that I can only view the VLC window in one desktop?   <answer219954> Right click the VLC icon in the Dock, select Options &amp; select something other than All Desktops  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/VGLj0.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment266032> Yup. That did the trick
