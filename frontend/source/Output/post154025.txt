I've upgraded to Yosemite. Now my Screensaver is goofy! <body> Why does my screensaver continually revert to the default when I've changed it several times, to use My Photos? This is very frustrating!  <answer154026> Try to delete the preference files:  precode/Users/[home folder]/Library/Preferences/ByHost/com.apple.screensaver*.plist /code/pre  Open a Finder window, and then open the codeGo/code menu. When displayed press the kbd&#x2325;/kbd key and appears an option called codeLibrary/code. Go to this option and your finder must be on codeLibrary/code folder. Then open codePreferences/code, then codeByHost/code and delete files starting with codecom.apple.screensaver/code and extension codeplist/code.  Then restart.  <comment181271> Guess I'm not computer literate enough to understand where you're directing me. In System Preferences, I don't see Library. I've re-set my preferences, once again, in System Preferences/Screensaver and will Restart now. And hope for the best. Thanks for your help. <comment181274> Ok, more details on how to do it in my previous answer. <comment181276> copy this in the Finders GO- Go to Folder- /Users/borderline/Library/Preferences/ByHost -then find 3 files com.apple.screensaver
