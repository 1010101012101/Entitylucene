iPhone iOS crash <body> Today my iPhone shut off instantly as I pressed the sleep/wake button to wake its screen; the phone was on. There was no spinning animation as it shut down. I briefly saw the screen flash to the "locked" view before it went black.  When I restarted the phone it indicated that I had 42% battery remaining.  At the time of the "crash", I was near the finish of a 2.5 mile run, and I was running a development build of iMapMyFitness. It was relatively cold outside -- probably between 30 and 40 degrees F.  I downloaded an app called System Log, and it shows the following two diagnostics with timestamps just before the crash. The next diagnostic is approximately 8 minutes later after I restarted the phone.  precodeMessage     Exiting...

This is absolutely a software development question. The premise of the question is: could my app be causing the OS crash I observed, and if so, how could I isolate the cause so that I can fix it? <comment40829> This log doesn't give you any hints on what the problem is, it is just a list of what did send messages to the console. And the messages basically say "shutting down". Is there are crash report available? <comment40830> I would love to know how to get a kernel crash report from my iPhone. Is there a way? How? <comment40831> @MattMcClure - Connect your device to Xcode, go to the Organizer, and find it in your Devices tab. There should be a listing of crash logs for various applications under Device Logs, and you should be able to see output from any system-level errors in the Console there. <comment40832> The most recent crash log in Xcode  Organizer is from 12/31. The crash logs visible there don't seem to include kernel crashes. <comment40847> Do you know where I can find a kernel log with more information? <comment40917> You might be able to find something with a jailbreak, but other than that, I don't think so.
