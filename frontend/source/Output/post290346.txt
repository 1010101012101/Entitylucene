Is there an easy way to list CLI tools installed on macOS? <body> So I have various command line tools like node, stats, etc which help me with day to day tasks, however I've noticed they don't show up in storage manager under applications and am unsure if there's a way to list all of those tools and completely remove all the files of the ones I don't use any more. It'll show as extra system memory use. It's not a big deal however I don't want to waste space. Is there a tool to manage all of this?  <answer290347> As with many Unix style operating system, file locations for software can become confusing at times. I've found that a lot of the packages I'm looking for are listed in "/usr/local/bin". If you would like to remove them all I recommend a Google search for each package and how to remove ALL of it's files in a safe manner. The directory I listed above (/usr/local/bin) is a good starting point. I am unaware of any tools to easily do this for you.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/A5SsX.png" alt="screenshot of terminal"  <answer290348> Basically every directory listed in codePATH/code besides the standard ones (code/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin/code) contains user-installed, so running codels/code on these directories gives you the list for them and you can use the usual Unix tools like codedu/code to calculate sizes.   To make managing user-installed tools easier you can rely on a package manager. Homebrew is the package manager of choice for many users.  <answer290350> You should also look at the manual page for codehier/code, as it provides a historical sketch of the filesystem hierarchy, which you might find informational in reference to your question. You can run codels/code in Terminal on any of directories listed, to get a listing, or look at them through Finder  Go  Go to Folder... and type in the path, e.g.: code/usr/bin/code  <comment366513> Don't forget /usr/local/bin. <comment366514> /usr/local/bin is empty on base macoS - you must have installed them separately <comment366516> @Mark Technicalt applications I use did, node - Virtualbox - atom - etc.
