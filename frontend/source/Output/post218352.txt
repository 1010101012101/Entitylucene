EL Capitan and 3-finger selection <body> After updating to el capitan I've noticed one annoying problem.  When I select something using 3-fingers gesture I should wait about a second until codecmd + c/code copy operation actually copies something to the buffer. If I press codecmd + c/code right after I complete selection and release fingers of a trackpad nothing goes to the buffer.  Is it a bug or it's a tweakable behaviour?
