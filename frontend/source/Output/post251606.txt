Photos deleted on iPhone got deleted in Google Photos - Recovery? <body> I synced all photos and videos from my iPhone 6 to Google Photos. I then turned off "Back up &amp; sync" in Google Photos, deleted all photos and videos on my phone, and discovered this also deleted everything in Google Photos.  I've already deleted everything from "Recently Deleted" on my phone. Is there any way to recover my photo and videos?
