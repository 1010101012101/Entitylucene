How to install AMD Crimson video drivers on iMac 5K (Late 2014) in Bootcamp? <body> I installed Windows 10 using Bootcamp on my iMac.  Bootcamp installed a bunch of drivers including one that allows proper 5K rendering on Windows.   However when I play a recent game Rainbow Six Siege, I see a ton of flickering of textures. The more I move around and shoot, the more they flick around.  Googling leads me to the solution of installing the new AMD Crimson driver's however, it seems I cannot install it on a Bootcamp Windows 10 version.  Is there a way around this?  hr  My specs:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/sJow3.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer221447> http://www.remkoweijnen.nl/blog/2015/09/21/update-amd-display-driver-under-bootcamp/  it worked out for me I have the same config as you and I had the same problems with Rainbow Six Siege  good luck trying
