iTunes is not syncing my phone <body> I cannot pull up the summary tab or view info on my phone via iTunes, and I also cannot sync my phone with my computer.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/cMEwg.png" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Meknj.png" alt="How can I solve this?"  <comment363191> What's shown on your device screen? Looks like the device is in recovery mode. <comment363199> there is nothing shown on device screen... <comment363214> Please try unlocking the phone and pressing 'trust this computer' on the popup. <comment363215> Go to menu Account - Authorize and authorize this computer. You need to enter your Apple ID password. Check if the sync still greyed out on your devices. <comment363234> @Jackson1442,  I already did this but not working. <comment363235> @dante12, I tried this but still it shows gray out the sync option. <comment363283> Have you ever synced this phone with a different computer? <comment363536> @Jackson1442, May be yes because I purchase second hand iPhone :) <comment363630> @nirav did you have to complete the setup assistant when you got the phone? (high white "hello" screen)
