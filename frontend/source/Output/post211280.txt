Mucked up disablement of Notifications Center <body> Tried to disable Notifications Center and remove it from the menu bar, unfortunately didn't copy the whole command:  precodelaunchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchAgents /code/pre  Now I'm presented with a completely black screen when I login, and  precodelaunchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchAgents /code/pre  doesn't seem to help. What should I do now?  Rebuilding the user account didn't work.  <answer211373> From the launchtl man page, it looks like it might need the -F parameter to force loading.  codelaunchctl load -wF /System/Library/LaunchAgents/code  I can't tell if it needs codesudo/code too, though it might, as the LaunchAgents folder is coderoot:wheel rwxr-xr-x/code
