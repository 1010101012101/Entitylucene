How to go back to list view of songs in playlists on iTunes 12.6 <body> How do I get the old Songs list view within playlists on iTunes 12.6? Some of my playlists (whether old or new) are now showing up in the stupid huge list that shows the album cover and all kinds of extra crap, and I only have about 8 songs per screen that I can see at once without scrolling. How do I go back to just the text-only list view emwithin individual playlists/em (not just the main library) in iTunes 12.6?  <answer281645> View menu  View as.  Pick your favourite.br Playlist has 'mini covers' Songs is most minimal, text only.  Unfortunately, it's not a global setting, it's per playlist.
