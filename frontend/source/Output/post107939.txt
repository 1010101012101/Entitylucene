Here is a screenshot:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2F8H0.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer108569> Restart the App Store app by double-clicking the Home button.   If that doesn't cut it, restart the iPhone and try again.   <comment126607> Could you post a screenshot? <comment126614> Did you try all the usual solutions? Hard reset etc?
