Scanning a ton of pictures <body> I'm rather disappointed that iPhoto has no direct ability to import from a scanner. I'm reduced to scanning in Preview, which has a less awful UI for scanning than the program that came with my HP scanner, and dragging the resulting files into iPhoto.  Is there some better scheme that I've missed?  <answer2615> Send the photos to a scanning service, especially if you have "tons".  <comment2355> Just a little bit better: put all your scans in a single folder and drag the folder itself into iPhoto.
