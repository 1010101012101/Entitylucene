Pop-up notification (or notification center notification) for battery in OS X Mountain Lion <body> I don't have the battery/AC icon turned on because, for the most part, there's no reason for it to be there - I typically get cord-free 5 or so hours at a time, so it seems redundant.  Still, occasionally my laptop will just turn off due to the battery having been depleted.  So, I was wondering if it's possible to have some sort of "Warning, battery is at 1%!" notification in, say, notification center or via Growl?  Currently I just type "pmset -g batt" in the terminal, which I generally have open anyway, to get my estimation. But I would like a more automatic method of doing this, if at all possible.  <comment77022> What's wrong with the default system alerts which appear on low battery? <comment77025> I didn't know there was an alert. Right now the only "alert" I get is that my laptop goes to sleep, no warning before hand. <comment77026> @Zrb0529 There's an alert that says "The computer will go to sleep soon to preserve the contents of memory. Please plug in." or some such; for me, it shows up when I get to about 7%. <comment77028> Huh. I suppose I somehow turned it off? Any idea where I can turn it back on? <comment77042> Is your battery in bad condition? Does it go to suddenly go to sleep with still some percentages left?

It just doesn't give me any warning before hand :-( <comment77063> That's odd. It should. <comment77118> Huh. Stranger and stranger...
