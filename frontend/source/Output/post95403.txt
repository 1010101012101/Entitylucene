Compiz-like effects on OS X <body> I recently moved from Linux to OS X.   So far nothing has disappointed me but I miss the compiz desktop effects I used to have on my Debian (on Ubuntu before I moved to Debian) with xfce and compiz like 3D effects, desktop workspaces in 3D view and many more:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rUKMG.png" alt="enter image description here" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QJhJd.png" alt="enter image description here" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NYlee.jpg" alt="enter image description here" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QVcB3.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  I tried searching for equivalent or similar stuff for OS X but no luck.  Looking forward to making my OS X desktop experience like (or even better than) compiz.  <answer136222> Yes, check out Deskovery:     Efficient and fun window management.      Stop wasting time to find, align, place and resize your windows. Manage your windows efficiently with fun and simplicity in the pure Mac style !   It has some of the features of Compiz, such as wobbly windows and window shading.  <comment111882> Could you elaborate which compiz desktop effects you miss on OS X? Could you provide links or screenshots? Compiz has lots of features and your description "those 3-d effects, desktop workspaces in 3d view and many more" lacks detail. <comment224010> it says purchase. Ain't there anything for free?
