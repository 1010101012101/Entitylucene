My MacBook Pro, High Sierra downloaded 13G last night while asleep <body> The system was presumably closed at my workplace.  How can I find why ? Some light on those 13Gb ? How Activity Monitor finds those numbers ? I will be glad to provide more information while the computer is not yet shut down. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/l3R7D.png" alt="enter image description here"  I have no automatic updates, last one was on 27 June, more than a week ago.  system.log is full of entries like:  precodeAug  4 11:59:23 MacBook-Pro-de-... com.apple.xpc.launchd[1] (com.apple.touristd): Service only ran for 0 seconds.

I suggest you install Little Snitch https://www.obdev.at/ and monitor the stats from there. You can see which app or process is generating so much data transfer. <comment371242> That’s painful. Excellent analysis and steps to disable sip and disable spthat daemon. I wonder if I need to file a bug to get an mom profile to disable that for work. Clearly an error condition and it won’t download that data once High Sierra ships. <comment371624> @Liviu Might have been easier blocking it completely with Little Snitch <comment371636> Little Snitch demands money after just 3 hours and it is hard to stop. Why use a gun when a knife suffice?
