Finder bug - wrong drop zone highlight <body> Sometimes I experience strange behaviour within the Finder. When I drag files to another Finder window the highlighted drop zones are incorrect and if I attempt to edit a file name the location of the edit-textfield is wrong as well.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qYhPa.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  The highlight zone seems to be connected to the Finder windows previous location. I noticed other users had this problem (https://discussions.apple.com/thread/6663266?start=0&amp;tstart=0) but no answer was ever supplied.  Has anybody experienced similar issues and found a (preferably permanent) solution to this problem?  <answer219719> Reboot the computer works in a limited time but several days later the bug comes back.  <comment265732> So - that's an important tidbit. The reboot just cleans up the mess but doesn't prevent whatever bug or thing is causing this from happening again.
