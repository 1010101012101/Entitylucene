List of GNU packages for homebrew <body> My team is working with Mountain Lion MacBook Pros, and we're using the GNU CLI tools, like codewget/code and codewatch/code, intensively.  Whenever a new team member joins us, we tell the new hire to install homebrew and get the whichever CLI tool required by codebrew install/code.  We would like to automate the process, and prepare a list of GNU CLI tools which will be installed on every new machine.   Is there any list of classic GNU/Linux CLI tools available in homebrew?  <answer92906> find, tar, awk, and sed are not included in coreutils:  precodebrew install coreutils findutils gnu-tar gawk gnu-sed /code/pre  You can use codebrew search gnu/code to search for other formulas where the name contains codegnu/code.
