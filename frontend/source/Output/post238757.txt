How do I find the application name to open a file using AppleScript? <body> I find the AppleScript method of opening a file convenient but often cannot guess at the application name to use when I do not want the default options.    As an example, I have installed Foxit PDF Reader to directly annotate a PDF.  I have not been able to guess what to use in the codeopen -a ??? my.pdf/code command.    How could I find this for any general application?  Perhaps there is some way to get a list of all available options?  <answer238758> You can use code-b/code option and use Bundle Identifier instead of using Application name. For example, to get Bundle Identifier from strongSafari/strong:  precodeplutil -p /Applications/Safari.app/Contents/Info.plist | grep BundleIdentifier /code/pre  as a result You'll get code"CFBundleIdentifier" =&gt; "com.apple.Safari"/code  Then You use it like this:  precodeopen -b com.apple.Safari /path/to/file /code/pre  Generally, You'll need to get Bundle Indentifier from codeInfo.plist/code file located inside codeApplication.app/Contents//code directory.  Or if You want, You can get the app name with this:  precodeplutil -p /Applications/PaintCode\ Trial.app/Contents/Info.plist | grep BundleName /code/pre  output:  precode"CFBundleName" =&gt; "PaintCode Trial" /code/pre  <comment292866> This does seem a viable alternative.  These Bundle Identifiers will be more difficult to remember and longer to type.  For Foxit, the Bundle Identifier is `com.foxitsoftware.FoxitReaderLite`.  If there is not a way to get the shorter application name, a bash alias for this would probably be the next best option, i.e., `alias foxit="open -b com.foxitsoftware.FoxitReaderLite"`. <comment292867> @stvn66 I've added the info about getting the app name in my answer. <comment292871> It's simply: `open -a "Foxit Reader" /path/to/file.pdf` <comment292872> Why go through so much rigamarole when simply `open -a "Foxit Reader" /path/to/file.pdf` does what the OP is asking!? <comment292873> Because some apps have different display name than bundle name. For example it could be Localized. <comment292876> Good point! +1 :) <comment292878> @user3439894, this resolves my example case but Mateusz's answer identifies how to apply this to the general case.  There are many applications I want to do this with and I do not want to ask a new question for each one. <comment292900> As I never have to worry about Localization, I personally have no need to get the BundleIdentifier as I can plainly see the name of the Apps and all work of me as in the example I previously presented. Anyway, building on what Mateusz Szlosek presented, if you want to get all of the app names and BundleIdentifier in a nice list, just use the following command line. Copy and paste it into Terminal: `for f in /Applications/*.app; do echo "${f##*/} =" "$(plutil -p "$f/Contents/Info.plist" | awk -F'[""]' '/BundleIdentifier/ {print $4}')"; done`
