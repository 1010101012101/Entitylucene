Highlights done on PDF "shifts" <body> I'm not sure whether this can be solved, but here goes.  I use Preview application a lot to view and annotate PDF files and I have been having this problem where in some of the PDF files, the highlights I add get shifted. This does not happen right away but only when I close it an open it again. This issue popped up occasionally on not all PDF files but only some (couldn't find a common pattern in the files that this issue is associated with). I have attached a screenshot to better show what I meant.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nr2tT.png" alt="enter image description here"  Also, I don't think I have this problem with other PDF applications but I'm not entirely sure. Any ideas on what is going on? Thank you.
