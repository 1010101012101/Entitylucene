How do check that uninstalling Macports won't break things? <body> Its been over a year since I installed Macports for Ruby. I want to uninstall but I can't remember if I was using for anything crucial. Can I get a nice list of ports that was directly installed?  <answer194746> Macports documents how to uninstall it  Uninstall the ports by  precodesudo port -fp uninstall installed /code/pre  Then remove all the files  precodesudo rm -rf \     /opt/local \     /Applications/DarwinPorts \     /Applications/MacPorts \     /Library/LaunchDaemons/org.macports.* \     /Library/Receipts/DarwinPorts*.pkg \     /Library/Receipts/MacPorts*.pkg \     /Library/StartupItems/DarwinPortsStartup \     /Library/Tcl/darwinports1.0 \     /Library/Tcl/macports1.0 \     ~/.macports /code/pre  <comment232353> Do you mean what did macports install - or do you want to also find the executables/scripts you built using macports? <comment232362> I guess, "what did macports install?"
