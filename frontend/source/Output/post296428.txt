Can iTunes be set to auto-update iPhone apps? <body> macOS 10.12.6, iTunes 12.6.2.20, iOS 10.3.3  I synch my iPhone to the Mac via USB. I prefer to update iPhone Apps via iTunes rather than on the iPhone, but it's wearying to remember to check for App  Updates. It'd be easier if iTunes could be set to automatically download available iPhone app updates.   Is there a way to do this?  <comment374381> Not as far as I know - I've got very used to 'Update Apps, Sync, Backup' every time I connect.
