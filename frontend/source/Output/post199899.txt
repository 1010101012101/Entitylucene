Backup/sync Mac photo to external hard drive <body> It's already making me crazy - as a newbie with Mac. I have problem with backup/sync of my pictures. I would like to backup pictures from emPhoto/em library (Photo app) to external emHDD/em but more like sync.   ul liAll the strongnew pictures/strong in my Mac should be strongcopied to external HDD/strong./li listrongPictures that are already on external HDD/strong should strongNOT be copied there twice/strong (not classic backup of whole library)./li liPictures strongI erased from Mac/strong should strongNOT be erased from external HDD/strong (not classic sync)./li liIf import of new pictures would be strongautomatic/strong when external emHDD/em is connected it would be great (not manually copying new pictures)./li /ul  Is that possible with Mac? With Windows I used to do just strongimport new pictures to external HDD library/strong. It never deletes any picture from external emHDD/em even I delete it from my emPC/em library.  <answer200738> Have you tried a sync/backup tool like ChronoSync (which I highly recommend)? It can be scheduled to sync to when your external drive is mounted. It also does a great job of handling package files (which is what your iPhoto library is). It's from Econ Technologies and can be trialed for 30 days.  <comment240916> Have you thought about putting your Photo library on the external HDD? <comment240963> I don't have external HDD all the time connected to my Mac. Also if I just copy Photo library to External HDD, than I don't know what to do with new pictures. If I would copy Photo library again (with some pitures deleted and some new pictures) and replaced that old copy than I would  loose that erased pictures even on external HDD. If I would keep even that old library, than I would have a lot of pictures on external HDD twice. So, that doesn't solve my problem. <comment240967> I'm not suggesting that you copy it over an over, I suggest you may have a permanent external library where you put your pictures, just as you describe you did before on Windows.
