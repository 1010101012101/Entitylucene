Yosemite Finder spins endlessly when browsing NFS mounted folders <body> I have an NFS export on my Ubuntu 14.04 machine.  I can mount it just fine from the command line in Yosemite:  precodemount -t nfs -o rw server:/home/gbell2/iOS_apps /Users/Devel/iOS_apps /code/pre  And immediately I can codels/code it.  No problem.  Problem is, when I go into Finder and browse it, the little gray wheel at the bottom spins forever.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/oXE5O.png" alt="enter image description here"  I cannot browse or open files in that folder from Xcode either.  I do not have icon preview enabled. My automount config just has Apple-generated stuff in it and while I know what automount is, these answers seem confused.  Another answer fingering automount isn't really clear either.  I've tried the mount options like coderw,bg,hard,intr,noac,nfc,tcp/code with no change in behavior.  There aren't a large amount of files in the root folder of that share.  I'm not mounting in /Volumes because one of the above references indicates that doesn't work any more.  Mounting with SMB doesn't have this issue, though I'd like to avoid the permissions issues that I usually see when tying *nix systems together with SMB.  Any ideas or how to debug?  <answer166872> Oh my... turns out it was one of the .* files in the share.  A simple rm of them all (excluding .git and/or .svn) and I was golden.  What a pain.  Hours gone.  I was unable to narrow down which file it was - a binary search failed so it may have been more than one.  Here's hoping lots of other people can be saved the time wastage.  <answer194436> I had a similar problem, and adding codelocallocks/code to the mount options fixed it for me.  (Alternatively, adding codenfsvers=4/code fixed it as well, but I ended up getting kernel panics on the Mac client, so I went back to the default NFSv3.)
