How to get a complete list of all applications installed? <body> Using OSX 10.8.4., I am having a hard time finding a complete list of all software applications installed on my Mac.  Of course, the codeLaunchpad/code only shows the list of those that have an app shortcut created, excluding those that do not.  I also tried holding down the codeOption/code key while in the Apple Menu to change codeAbout This Mac/code to codeSystem Information/code, then codeSoftware--&gt;Installations/code but that still was not a complete list.  How do I get a complete list of all applications installed?  <answer98829> The application folder.. Just go in to the appplication folder  <answer98837> ol liLaunchPad should show all apps in /Applications; they don't have to have a "shortcut" created to appear there./li liYou can look directly in /Applications and /Applications/Utilities./li liSystem Information has a Software  Applications section in the sidebar that'll show an even more complete list, including apps stored in unexpected locations (I think it's using Spotlight to find them)./li /ol  <answer98838> Try: About This Mac  More Info  System Report  Software  .  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/P8QtS.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Not only "Installations" ... but the others may give you some info, too.  <answer98865> It is unclear from the OP question whether he/she is looking for the easy answer or the hard answer. The way to get almost all the apps into a convenient list would be:  ol liOpen Terminal/li liEnter codels /Applications/code for a simple alphabetic list, or codels -l /Applications/code for more information:  precodeEwans-Retina-MacBook-Pro:Applications ewan$ ls /Applications /code/pre    precode1000 OpenType Fonts.app        Garmin MapInstall.app    ScreenFlow.app 1Password.app                  Garmin MapManager.app    Sequel Pro.app A Better Finder Rename 8.app   Garmin WebUpdater.app    Server.app /code/pre/li /ol  <answer98962> If you're just looking for a list of applications with a .app extension then starting the Terminal and running  precode   find / -iname *.app &gt; ~/applications.txt /code/pre  will (eventually) give you a pretty comprehensive list of applications, written to a text file called "applications.txt" in your Home folder.  <answer121394> Use "List My Apps". This Little App Show all Apps from the iTunes AppStore. https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/list-my-apps/id756968964?l=de&amp;ls=1&amp;mt=12  <answer121407> Open the terminal, and write the following commande codesudo find / -iname *.app/code It's the same answser than "binarybob" but with the sudo you can access and list some folders you can't do without administrator rights. Your password will be asked and you get the benefits of the sudo "rights" if your account is an admin account.  For example, with codefind / -iname *.app/code I get 430 lines, and with codesudo find / -iname *.app/code I get 432 lines. It's an example on my computer and maybe the result will be the same whatever the commande for you.  <answer129854> From the command line, try system_profiler(8):  precode&gt; system_profiler SPApplicationsDataType /code/pre  Here is a snipet showing Safari:  precodeSafari:    Version: 7.0.2   Obtained from: Apple   Last Modified: 2/25/14, 3:44 PM   Kind: Intel   64-Bit (Intel): Yes   Signed by: Software Signing, Apple Code Signing Certification Authority, Apple Root CA   Location: /Applications/Safari.app   Get Info String: 7.0.2, Copyright © 2003-2014 Apple Inc. /code/pre  codesystem_profiler/code can also output to XML (plist(5) format) that can be easily parsed.

Most apps are just things you download in a ZIP or DMG file and drag/drop to your Applications folder.  That Applications folder is where apps are almost always located and would be as complete of a list as you'll get. <comment116135> Applications can be installed outside of the Applications folder. <comment116136> There's a subtle complexity to what you're asking here and that is: what is an "application"? Are you looking for all `.app` bundles on your system? Or do you want a list of *anything* a user can execute? <comment117437> If you were to add what you plan to do with this list of Applications once you have it, I'm curious to see if the answers would better target your needs since the idea of an App is quite fuzzy and open to interpretation. <comment141498> This only shows apps purchased from the Mac App Store though. <comment152022> However this will also get backups if those disks are mounted e.g. TimeMachine disks <comment183450> For me, the "Applications" tab had a better list, which took a second to appear. <comment199609> Applications can be installed outside the /Applications folder. <comment235560> So simple that it misses any applications *not* installed in `/Applications`... <comment237933> Why the down vote? <comment264025> I'm not OP, but my definition would be a list of everything that will work as an argument to `open -a`. <comment359119> How to run it?
