Can't get rid of twitter from iOS7 lock screen <body> Since upgrading to iOS7 on my iPhone the lock screen is bombarded with Tweets. I want to turn this off as I am sure it kills the battery and is annoying. I turned off twitter in the notification center but it had no effect.  How can I turn this off?  <answer104976> You will have to disable notifications for the specific client that you are using by going to strongSettings/strong → strongNotification Center/strong and tapping on your Twitter client, then disabling strongShow on Lock Screen/strong.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nPeMX.png" alt="Show on Lock Screen"  hr  If you are using the official Twitter app, you can change notification settings by opening the app and going to strongMe/strong → strongSettings/strong button → strongSettings/strong → strongNotifications/strong.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/AXTyC.png" height="400" title="Twitter Notification Settings"  <comment123460> Are you using a specific twitter client? If so you may have to go into that client's settings. <comment123462> Try deleting the app and redownloading it. <comment149039> I can't see this notification screen in the official Twitter app. I'm getting crappy "recommended" style notifications. Or notifications that three people I know shared the same tweet. How do I turn off only those?
