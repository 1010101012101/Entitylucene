Why do I have to install CLT when Xcode is installed? <body> On a fresh Mavericks, I installed Xcode via the App store (accepted license agreement and enabled developer mode). After that, Command Line Tools (CLT) are found (codechecked via xcode-select -p/code). Installing Homebrew as explained on their webpage (coderuby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/go/install)"/code) will result in the request to install the CLT. Why do I have to install them? I thought they are installed together with Xcode.  <answer120574> The command line tools are not installed as part of Xcode. codexcode-select/code does not prove the existence of the command line tools. You have to install them separately.  <answer120619> You have to install them because, starting with version 4.3, Xcode is released as a sandboxed, strongsingle app bundle/strong.  Before that, Xcode was distributed as an installer called emInstall Xcode.app/em. The installer had access to the whole filesystem and created a code/Developer/code directory, where frameworks and additional tools where placed, and installed the command line tools in code/usr/bin/code.  This is no longer the case. Apple chose to make XCode a strongstandard/strong Mac App Store app that installs in code/Applications/code and requires user intervention to install any additional components outside the bundle container.  <comment140626> I also checked if `gcc --version` responds. It did.
