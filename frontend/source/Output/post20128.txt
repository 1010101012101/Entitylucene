How can I share a Cisco VPN connection? <body> I am using ICS on my Early 2011 MBP (latest version of Snow Leopard) to share a connection to various devices, e.g. XBOX.  Normally this is by manually configuring the network settings on the client, and connecting to the MBP via Ethernet.  I can share the Airport connection wifi fine, but when I connect to a VPN using Cisco client it does not work. The Cisco adapter seems to be hidden when trying to select it as a source option for ICS.  Any possibility to recreate the Cisco connection using Native mac client?  <answer20148> I don't know if this option was also available in Snow Leopard, but if you are on Lion you could try the following:  ol liSet up the native cisco client - if you don't know how, you can use this handy guide I created a few days back/li liOnce you have tried and confirmed that everything works, your VPN connection should show up as one of the options in the emInternet Sharing/em part of Preferences Sharing./li liselect the connection, choose on which network connection you'd like to share it and you're done./li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pj8e2.jpg" alt="share vpn connection"  <comment22574> Thanks! It is available in SL, and after a day of faffing, I found out the Apple built in support is not for UDP, only TCP. Not sure if Lion changes that?
