Why won't my iPad miniâ€™s gyroscope work? <body> Ever since I updated my iPad mini to iOS 7.0.6 when I twist it around from vertical to horizontal, the picture won't turn with it. Is this a bug or is my iPad mini broken?  <answer123789> try switching the button above the volume rocker, if it shows a rotation lock/unlock icon that should fix it. If it shows an mute unmute icon swipe up from the bottom to reveal the quick-acces menu, in there there should be an icon for locking and unlocking the rotation of your iPad. Let me know if this fixed it.  <answer280237> Try checking the button on top of the volume button  <comment352445> How does this improve over the answer given 3 years ago?
