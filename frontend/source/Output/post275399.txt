How can I change keyboard layout in password field in Safari? <body> I've macbook pro with macOS Sierra 10.12.3 and Safari 10.0.3.  I just need to change input language (eg. to Russian) for password input field, but it's disabled.   I've 2 keyboard layouts/languages enabled system-wide: English and Russian and I can write with this layouts everywhere except password fields in browsers.  So, how can I enable non-english layouts for this fields?   <comment346432> Try other browsers like Firefox and Chrome.  Do you have the same problem there?
