How would I get Apple to list a calendar for people to subscribe at apple.com? <body> Apple lists about 140 Calendars you can subscribe to - some quite obscure looking, others quite obvious like federal holidays for large countries with large Apple customer bases. I don't see any way to alert Apple to a calendar and wondered if there were any sort of mechanism to provide a format for Apple to evaluate and possible publish.   http://www.apple.com/downloads/macosx/calendars/index_abc.html  Are downloads something registered developers can seed or how would I publish a calendar and get it listed by Apple on their downloads site?  <answer121302> strongIt appears that this functionality has been removed./strong  There used to be a sidebar box with the ability to contact Apple regarding adding your work to any of the download lists on Apple.com. However, this box no longer appears on the page.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8DSOU.png" width="205"  Also, the linked page from the old submit link in the box above no longer appears to be functional:  ul lihttps://adcweb.apple.com/downloads//li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NP8yk.png"  This seems to match the fact that no new calendars have been uploaded for years.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/BarOy.png" width="205"  <comment141375> Cool - a non answer that gives context and confirms the issue is always welcome. Thanks.
