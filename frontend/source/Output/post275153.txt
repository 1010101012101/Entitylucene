Can I change Calendar Event details with AppleScript? <body> I am a seasoned developer, but very new to AppleScript.  I would like to change some of the details of an event in a calendar.  I have found the Library in the Script Editor, and made my way to the Calendar section. I’m not at all sure where to go from here.  In particular, I would like to change a detail which is emnot/em listed in the Library, so I’m not altogether optimistic. That detail is the strongtime zone/strong, in particular for the start and finish times. This information is in the codeical/code codevevent/code data which is in the raw data.  So far I am still experimenting with reading what is there:  precodeset calendarName to "Work Travel" set now to date "Wednesday, 1 March 2017 at 12:00:00 am"  tell application "Calendar" to tell calendar calendarName     set currentEvents to get every event where its start date ≥ now     repeat with e in currentEvents         set start to start date of e     end repeat end tell /code/pre  My current system is MacOS 10.12 Sierra.  <comment346097> Can you please include the part of the code you've already got (e.g. the part navigating to/selecting a specific calendar entry for modification)? <comment346102> Nothing really. I have included it in my edited question. <comment346442> Nigel at MacScripter is the authority on this... http://macscripter.net/viewtopic.php?pid=119606#p119606
