How can I clear the kernel extension caches while using FileVault 2? <body> I have the same problem as this user, Air + Lion : plug in USB, keyboard/pad stop working , where the built-in keyboard and trackpad on my MacBook Pro stop working (and drop out of the USB devices listed) periodically when I plug in a USB hard drive.  The solution provided was to boot into safe-mode and clear the kernel extension caches, however I use FileVault 2 full-disk encryption which seems to disable booting into safe-mode.  Is there any way to clear the kernel extension caches in OS X 10.9 Mavericks without disabling FileVault 2 to get to safe-mode? I really don't want to de-encrypt and later re-encrypt the entire 750GB drive.  Alternatively, can codekextcache/code be safely run on a system that isn't booted into safe-mode?  <answer162382> If you can plug a FireWire or USB external drive (lest's name it codeext_disk/code), I would suggest the following used receipe:  ol liMake a clone of your FileVault disk (let's name it codeFV2/code) on codeext_disk/code with Carbon Copy Cloner/li liBoot from codeext_disk/code/li liOpen codeDisk Utility/code and unlock codeFV2/code/li liOpen codeTerminal/code or an codexterm/code window to enter the following commands:  precodecd /Volumes/FV2/System/Library /usr/bin/sudo touch Extensions tail -f /var/log/system.log /code/pre/li liWait to see that codekextcache/code is correctly upgraded on… codeFV2/code (you don't risk anything since codeFV2/code isn't bearing the cache in use by your running kernel) and terminate your codetail/code with a kbd⌃/kbd+kbdC/kbd, close your terminal window/li liReboot from codeFV2/code/li liCheck if all your misbehaving extensions are working correctly/li liSafely erase codeext_disk/code/li /ol  <answer215451> Holding down kbdcmd/kbdkbdS/kbd at boot time, for a boot drive that's FileVault 2 encrypted, presents the password dialog, then continues into Safe Mode.
