Unlock iphone 4s <body> My iphone 4s was orignally with orange, latterly with virgin. I'd like to unlock to give it to my granddaughter to use wth o2. I no longer have the original sim. Is this possible ?  I do have a virgin pay-as-you-go sim available if that would help.  <comment266332> Which country? I guess UK - but then aren't the phones unlocked so just put a new SIM in
