How to use Testdisk under OS X recovery mode? <body> I accidentally broke the GUID, I suppose, when I was trying to solve the incorrect EFI partition problem. What I have now is:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HfzBs.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Disk1 is a 4 GB thumb drive with a recovery partition (disk1s2) I booted to.  I found a tutorial here: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/7056781 , says that by using Testdisk I will be able to know which partition starts where so I can fix the problem.  <comment251321> Did you have one partition only on your main disk? And what's your operating system? <comment251322> @klanomath In the second picture, I remember there were 2 index there. I think one was EFI one was OS X, and I tried to delete and rebuild EFI but I messed up. <comment251323> I meant one visible partition (e.g on your desktop) like "Macintosh HD" or did you install Windows 7+ with Boot Camp or did you partition your disk with two volumes like "Macintosh HD" and "Data" previously? <comment251324> And what is disk1 with 4 GB? A thumb drive? <comment251325> Yes I only have one partition. My EFI went wrong in the first place was because of Ubuntu duel boot, I formatted that partition and merged it into my Macintosh HD. <comment251326> @klanomath yes that is a thumb drive. And I mentioned Testdisk was because that it tells me "Killed: 9" when I tried to run it in recovery mode terminal. <comment251327> Let us [continue this discussion in chat](http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/29752/discussion-between-ex-and-klanomath).
