Can't access Amazon S3 bucket after mounting using s3fs <body> I have been trying to mount an Amazon S3 bucket as a OSX volume using the s3fs command line tool (installed from Homebrew). The issue is that although I run the s3fs command as per the instructions (here, for Mac-specific, or here more generally), and it returns no errors, when I attempt to cd to the mounted volume the I get the following error:  precodemkdir /Volumes/s3  sudo /usr/local/bin/s3fs mybucket /Volumes/s3 Password:  cd /Volumes/s3 cd: error retrieving current directory: getcwd: cannot access parent directories:  No such file or directory /code/pre  The install went off without a hitch, and all dependencies appeared to have installed correctly, so I don't think that that's an issue (obviously, I could be wrong). I also know that I can't simply mount the volume, as it is not in a file system native to OSX.   I know that s3fs isn't terribly well-documented for Mac users, but perhaps somebody here has some experience getting this to work. Thank you in advance.  I am using OSX Lion 10.7.4.  <answer56291> You may not have permission to see that folder. Use codesudo -i/code to become root and then try again.
