Port 9000 apache returns access forbidden <body> I am using native PHP and native Apache. PHP version is 5.5. codeuserdir/code module in Apache is enabled, and I have my PHP codes under code~/Sites/code. Localhost URL is codelocalhost/~username/code. I have installed XDebug and I am configured it with Vdebug plugin. In codephpinfo()/code it says the extension is enabled.  I am not able to access codelocalhost/code from port 9000. When I visit this URL codehttp://localhost/~subhojit:9000/code it returns access forbidden. Not just 9000 port, even if I am entering port 80 like this codehttp://localhost/~subhojit:80/code, it returns access forbidden. But I am able to access PHP websites using virtual hosts or from localhost URLs like this codehttp://localhost/~subhojit/phpwebsite/code.  I am not sure what I am doing wrong. Please help.  <answer219735> To get vdebug (or any php debugger client) to work, you don't visit port 9000 in your browser. That's the port that vdebug and xdebug use to talk to each other. You just need to visit the URL as normal.  The process is this:  ol liStart vdebug with F5 (default)/li liVisit the URL that you want to debug, but add the query parameter XDEBUG_SESSION_START=1 (e.g. http://localhost/~subhojit/phpwebsite?XDEBUG_SESSION_START=1)/li liGo back to vim - a connection will have been made if both xdebug and vdebug were configured correctly/li /ol  Hope this helps.
