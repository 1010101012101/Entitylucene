iPad Mini internet connection (No WiFi) <body> I'm planning to buy an iPad mini + cellular but not on my country. I would buy itt on the United States and someone is going to bring it to me. I have some questions:  ul liThe person who is going to buy the ipad Mini would need to choose a data service from AT&amp;T or any of the other services? /li liIf it is necessary and the person picks AT&amp;T... would i need to unblock it or something like that? The person would need to suscribe to some kind of data plan?/li liIn my country there isn't LTE cellular network yet... The 3G will work?/li /ul  <answer80644> In the US - all iPads (including the mini) are unlocked, pay as you please, no contract devices. The two models of mini are A1454 and A1455 with similar GSM 3G coverage:  ul liModel A1454  ul liGSM/EDGE (850, 900, 1800, 1900 MHz)/li liUMTS/HSPA+/DC-HSDPA (850, 900, 1900, 2100 MHz)/li liLTE (Bands 4 and 17)/li /ul/li liModel A1455  ul liCDMA EV-DO Rev. A and Rev. B (800, 1900, 2100 MHz)/li liGSM/EDGE (850, 900, 1800, 1900 MHz)/li liUMTS/HSPA+/DC-HSDPA (850, 900, 1900, 2100 MHz) /li liLTE (Bands 1, 3, 5, 13, 25)/li /ul/li /ul  http://www.apple.com/ipad-mini/specs/  Accordingly, you can pick whether want to optimize your LTE future bands (or travel bands) or choose a CDMA+GSM model or the GSM only model. Since there are very few countries with CDMA coverage out side the USA, most people end up shopping the AT&amp;T model 1454 - but curiously, the CDMA model 1455 matches many foreign LTE deployments and plans, so it's a bit of a tradeoff which any one person might prefer world wide.  <comment104875> Be very careful.  There is no guarantee that US phones work in another country.
