Keeping Finder in sync with changes made in Terminal? <body> Until Yosemite, I could work in the Terminal and file system changes would be immediately updated in Finder. Now, however, Finder seems to be out of sync with the filesystem. Finder shows files I have moved or deleted as still being in the original folder.  I am at a loss to restore Finder's old behaviour. Things I have tried, to no avail:  ul licoderm .DS_Store; open ./code/li liSeeing that my whole Documents folder had become infected with the emcom.apple.quarantine/em attribute, removing it with codexattr -drv com.apple.quarantine ./code/li liChecking the filesystem with Disk Utility; no errors reported./li /ul  It's not the problem described in Moving folder to Trash in Finder is not synchronized with Terminal, as any files I delete, I delete with coderm/code.   strongUpdate/strong: what does work is emForce Quit.../em → emRestart Finder/em, which is a bit drastic.  <answer158177> Not necessarily a fix, but I use this to refresh Finder windows - works after changing file visibility too, rather than killing the Finder.  precodetell application "Finder"     set theWindows to every window     repeat with i from 1 to number of items in theWindows         set this_item to item i of theWindows         set theView to current view of this_item         if theView is list view then             set current view of this_item to icon view         else             set current view of this_item to list view                       end if         set current view of this_item to theView     end repeat   end tell /code/pre  <comment186009> Thanks; I will try this (if I knew what it was … automater? Looks like tcl, but wordy). Not hopeful of it working, though — I can have no finder windows open, then open a new one, and it shows me the file state from several hours ago. It has only started happening in Yosemite. <comment186011> It's Applescript. Make it an app or launch it from a key command in Automator etc [I don't use Automator personally so I'm no use on that front] <comment186025> Thanks - just as an update, the script doesn't do anything. New files aren't showing unless I restart Finder <comment186061> ah, ok; thanks for the heads up. There's something deeper to it then, I guess. it works fine for hiding/showing dot files etc - though the Finder already knows they're there.
