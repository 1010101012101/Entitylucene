Safari search bar doesn't lose focus on enter <body> When I'm searching something using Safari's search bar, the search bar doesn't lose the focus when I hit enter, so the suggestions shows up again.  Has someone else had this problem? Is there a way to remove this? I'm using Safari 10 on macOS Sierra.  <comment354542> Which version of macOS Sierra? <comment354583> macOS Sierra 10.12.4
