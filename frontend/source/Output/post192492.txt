Macbook pro late 2011 can support 16GB 1600Mhz RAM <body> I want to upgrade my MacBook Pro to 16GB 1600Mhz of RAM. I want to know if it is possible before buying something incorrectly. My macbook model is MD322LL/A A1286.   <answer192507> Apple MacBook Pro "Core i7" 2.4 15" Late 2011  Standard RAM:   4 GB    Maximum RAM:    16 GB*  Details:    4 GB of RAM is installed as two 2 GB modules, no slots free.  *Apple officially supports a maximum of 8 GB of RAM, but third-parties have determined that this model actually is capable of using up to 16 GB of RAM with two 8 GB memory modules.  Speed:  1333 MHz  Details:    Supports 1333 MHz PC3-10600 DDR3 SDRAM.  So buying 1600Mhz wont do much, just waist of money.
