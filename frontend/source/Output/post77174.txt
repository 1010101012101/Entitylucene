Safari wants to access my keychain doesn't offer "always deny"... How can I implement this? <body> The only choice Safari asks me w.r.t keychain access is "deny" or "allow" or "always allow".  Why doesn't Safari offer me an "always deny" option in Safari?  How can I make the system "always deny"?  Will the "always allow" or always deny apply to the computer or to a specific website?  <answer77176> There is not an always deny functionality in keychain. Put another way, there is a white list but not a black list.   A somewhat elegant workaround is to turn off AutoFill of passwords in Safari's preferences and you won't even get the request to access the keychain in the first place.  <answer77178> If you don't need the keychain items, you can also delete them from Keychain Access.  Always allow adds Safari to this list:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mwZNz.png" alt=""  <comment219302> Similar: [OSX is repeatedly asking for login keychain password](http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/124591/22781)
