Language switcher lag <body> When I am changing the language layout (English &lt;- Bulgarian) most of the times I have huge lag or even buggy behavior. The language indicator says one thing, but when I type it is in the other language.  This actually happens on every OSX version I've used the last years (Mountain Lion - Sierra).br Here is a gif of the problem:     img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wd5fp.gif" alt="enter image description here"  Now I'm totally pissed off and I cannot stand it anymore. Any clues of how to fix it?  <comment322272> Interesting you say you have had this for a long time.  I have seen various complaints about it in Sierra, but not earlier.
