Trusting my computer with my iPhone no longer unlocks it for access (iPhone 5 w/iOS10, and Mac OSX 10.7.5) <body> Ever since I upgraded to iOS10 my computer doesn't recognize when my iPhone "trusts" my computer. My computer recognizes the device, but it's not allowed to access it.  In Image Capture: codePlease unlock iPhone/code  In iTunes: codeiTunes could not connect to the iPhone because an invalid response was received from the device./code  In XCode: codeReceived an unexpected response from the device. Please check your setup and try again. (0xE8000013)./code  strongHow do I get my computer to recognize my iPhone is unlocked and trusts the computer?/strong  I am using Mac OSX 10.7.5, and I have an iPhone 5 with iOS10. I refuse to upgrade my OS to fix this problem, because if upgrading my old iPhone hardware to new software was any indication, all it will do is slow it down. My computer is a 2011 MacBook Air.  <answer295226> It appears the contents of  precode/var/db/lockdown /code/pre  a folder on your mac, are corrupt.  First, unplug your iPhone or iPad.  Quit any apps that try to communicate with the iDevice e.g. Photos, Image Capture, iTunes, PhoneView, iMazing, iFunbox or Dropbox.  Delete the files within /var/db/lockdown/ (not the folder).  Plug your iDevice back in.  The “Trust this computer?” dialog box should appear. Tap emTrust/em on your iDevice.  The operating system should create new .plist files in the lockdown folder. Try reopening one of the apps that had the error.  <comment317916> I'd be prepared to stick my neck out & say that's your issue, current iOS trying to communicate with long-abandoned OS X. Your phone is using an iOS your Mac was never prepared for, & never considered or tested for compatibility. <comment317985> What version of iTunes? <comment319359> Just as an FYI, I found that older Macs performed better under El Capitan than 10.8 or 10.9. Your experience may differ. But I agree with Tetsujin, you're unlikely to be able to fix this in an unsupported OS. <comment319362> @dr.nixon Hmm, that's good to know. I've just been skeptical because iOS 10 has slowed down my older phone, and many of the new features of the latest OSX updates aren't even available for the older machines (2012). I also can't find good reviews for how these newer Mac OS's work on my old machine. I would be much less skeptical if I could read the review of a trailblazer with my conditions. I am also very short on drive space (4GB free space, constantly have to delete things), and it's unclear exactly what net storage space I'll lose in the update. <comment337602> A relative has this same problem: 2011 iMac on 10.7.5 cannot recognize an unlocked iPhone 5 on iOS 10.
