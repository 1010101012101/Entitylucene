"Could not load Vox Preferences preference pane." Solutions? <body> I'm trying to install the Vox prefs pane so I can have it use the play/pause next and previous media keys rather than iTunes. However after installing, I get the error "Could not load Vox Preferences preference pane". I think the first time I installed it (I tried several times) it told me something about it needing an intel mac to run, which, of course, I have.  [Edit: The first warning after opening system preferences and trying to load the Vox pref pane is: "You can’t open Vox Preferences preferences because it emdoesn’t/em work on an Intel-based Mac." Curious. Vox is quite recent. Why would they distribute a prefs pane extension that only works on PPC macs?]  Anyone got any ideas as to what's wrong with this pref pane?  Running 10.7.5.  <answer167104> Yes, please try as me  Step 1: Menu bar Apple  Preferences  Users &amp; Group  Choose your account  select tab "Login items".
