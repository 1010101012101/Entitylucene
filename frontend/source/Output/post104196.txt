Latest OS X update causes Finder crash (SIGSEGV) <body> Does any one know how to fix an error like this?  precodeException Type:  EXC_BAD_ACCESS (SIGSEGV) Exception Codes: KERN_INVALID_ADDRESS at 0x0000000102e50cf2 /code/pre  My Finder keeps crashing after updating my Mac this morning. I've tried TotalFinder but this also crashed as if it was Finder.  Any ideas?  The tickets shows OS X 10.8.3… but my Terminal shows this:  precodejycr753:~ hakunamatata$ sw_vers -productVersion 10.8.5  jycr753:~ hakunamatata$ system_profiler SPSoftwareDataType Software:      System Software Overview:        System Version: OS X 10.8.5 (12F45)       Kernel Version: Darwin 12.5.0       Boot Volume: hakunamatata       Boot Mode: Normal       Computer Name: jycr753       User Name: jycr753 (hakunamatata)       Secure Virtual Memory: Enabled       Time since boot: 2:01 /code/pre  I've also tried looking at codekextstat/code to make sure that I dont have any kernel extensions, and it all looks fine…  Log error  <answer104507> The solution for this was actually google drive, its kernel extension was creating conflicts with finder if the icon was showing in the status bar.  <comment122660> I would be helpful to see the full error log. but try this if you find the "External Modification Warnings:" Thread creation by external task. Are you using DropBox or a Finder extension like TotalFinder? Remove them. <comment122661> Im using Dropbox, I dont have TotalFinder or PathFinder either... <comment122662> Do you have the following in the log "External Modification Warnings" "Thread creation by External task" ? Also you said you did use the TotalFinder ? <comment122664> @Buscar웃 I have added a link to the log, but I do have that in the log, `External Modification Warnings: Thread creation by external task.` And I dont use Totalfinder I just installed to see if it will work, but once I crashed I removed <comment122666> Thank you. I downloaded your log and you do have the External Modification Warnings .... in it (at the top) <comment122667> and this report and the bottom:                      External Modification Summary:   Calls made by other processes targeting this process:     task_for_pid: 20     thread_create: 1     thread_set_state: 0   Calls made by this process:     task_for_pid: 0     thread_create: 0     thread_set_state: 0   Calls made by all processes on this machine:     task_for_pid: 7888     thread_create: 136     thread_set_state: 0 <comment122668> @Buscar웃 I don't what it means... :( <comment122670> Just try to remove the Dropbox (for now) and restart without it. Sorry I have to leave, be back in 2 hours, good luck! <comment122671> @Buscar웃 thanks for the help mate, i really appreciated <comment122676> @Buscar웃 Still the same, even totally removing DP... It is really annoying..
