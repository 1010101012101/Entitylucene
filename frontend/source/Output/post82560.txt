Installing Mountain Lion on multiple macs with one application install <body> If I have downloaded strongInstall OSX Mountain Lion/strong application file from the Appstore, I can use it as an installer on multiple machines.   Any idea for how many machines will this be valid? How apple verifies a valid install?  <answer82564> h3Five./h3  I wish I could give better answer, but I can't fully resolve the problem of Apple's differentiation between strongiTunes Store/strong, strongMac App Store/strong, strongApp Store/strong and strongiBook Store/strong.  If you read the following official document, Apple only talks about the strongiTunes Store/strong when it comes to licensing and emiTunes-authorized computers/em.  My understanding is that the same rules apply to all purchases made in any of these stores because the receipt via Email is always from strongdo_not_reply@itunes.com/strong - no matter if the purchase is an iOS App, a Mac App, or a a song...     subhttp://www.apple.com/legal/itunes/us/terms.html#APPS/sub      USAGE RULES      (ii) You shall be authorized to use iTunes Products on strongfive iTunes-authorized devices/strong at any time, except for Content Rentals (see below).   Since you purchased Mountain Lion in the Mac App Store, it's an iTunes product which you can install on up to five Macs at the same time. I've installed Mountain Lion using the same self-made USB installer on three different Macs without problems.  <answer82573> You can install Mountain Lion on any Mac you own:     If you've purchased OS X Lion or Mountain Lion from the Mac App Store,   you're allowed to install it on all of your personal authorized Macs.   "Authorized" just means that you have to sign into the Mac App Store with the Apple ID you used to purchase Mountain Lion.  The instructions actually tell you to re-download the installer on each machine, but it works fine if you simply copy the installer from one machine to another (which makes sense since it's the same file either way). Maybe they want you to re-download it on each machine so they can track how many times you download/install it on your account? But they clearly state that you can install it on "all" of your machines, which implies there's no limit.  <comment95242> I don't think that this clearly states that there is no limit. Apple uses the word "authorization" usually in relation to iTunes or the Apple ID. You can also take a look at the Apple knowledge-base article: **[iTunes Store: About authorization and deauthorization](http://support.apple.com/kb/ht1420)** <comment95274> Hm, you might be right: it's all *authorized* Macs, but maybe you can't authorize more than five (so effectively the limit is five). <comment95316> Thanks :) I will mark this correct and see how it goes.
