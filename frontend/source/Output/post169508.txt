Brief graphic glitch right before screensaver <body> I have a 2013 iMac running OS 10.8.5. Lately I've noticed that, whenever I manually initiate the screensaver (one of the included ones, "Shell"), there is a momentary graphical glitch before the screen saver begins. This happens when I move the mouse cursor into the hot corner and when I preview the screen saver within the system settings. My question is: is this cause for alarm; is it heralding a major issue?  <comment199131> could you go back in the Console log to the time stamp of interest and look what is going on. <comment199237> It says "WindowServer: MPAccessSurfaceForDisplayDevice: Set up page flip mode on display 0x04280480 device: 0x101c2e110   isBackBuffered: 1 numComp:  3 numDisp:  3". Hope this helps!
