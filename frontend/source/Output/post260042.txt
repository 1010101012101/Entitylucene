How do I prevent Terminal from catching my keyboard shortcuts? <body> I'm using a PC keyboard on a Mac with a specific PC-like keyboard layout. The ctrl key works as command. When I open a ssh session to a Linux machine in terminal and want to use nano editor, I can't use ctrl-o to save the edited file, because ctrl-o is already used by terminal for "import". It works fine with a standard Mac keyboard, because it uses the command key instead of ctrl key for shortcuts.  Is there a way to prevent terminal from catching any shortcut when the terminal window is focused?
