Parenthesis don't show in built-in iPhone calculator app <body> When you open the iOS's built in calculator app and rotate iPhone you get the scientific calculator.  I am trying to use parenthesis code(/code code)/code to write something like code(2+2)/4/code but the parenthesis don't appear!  How do I enter that expression?  <answer42027> The built-in calculator doesn't offer any visual clues to let you know you've opened a sub-group operation in an expression. The only thing that tips you off is you'll get a sub-result after you close the group show up in the display. For example, enter the following:  precode5 + ( 3 + 3 ) /code/pre  After you type the opening code(/code you don't see anything on the display. But when you press the closing code)/code the display shows you code6/code to tip you off to the fact that the code3 + 3/code operation was performed.  I prefer the TouchCalc app myself. It will show a small code(/code in the lower left corner of the display when you open a sub-expression grouping so you know you're actually perserving your order of operations as intended.  <answer266743> It does not function correctly depending on the equation.  I type in:  600/(ยน3)=        and I get 200  The correct answer is 346.41016......  The calculator does not follow the order of operations for parenthesis in a consistent manner.  <comment47719> Apple can really negativtely suriprise me
