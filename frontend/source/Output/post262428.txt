How can you set the iTunes 'use work and movement' script with Applescript <body> Since iTunes 12.5.3 there are new strongwork/strong/strongmovement no/strong/strongmovement total/strong/strongmovement/strong fields and it is possible to set these fields with Applescript or by having the correct metadata in the file so I now have all this data set for my songs within iTunes without having to manually edit it.   But when you view an album it still uses the song title rather than the work/movement fields because I have not set the emuse work and movement/em checkbox. I know how to do this manually by selecting a group of songs, selecting strongGet Info/strong and checking the box but its not practical for me to do this for thousands of songs.  Is there any way to enable the emuse work and movement/em checkbox programatically so it actually uses the work/movement info when displaying an album in iTunes, I opened the iTunes dictionary in Script Editor but couldn't see any reference to this option (there are references to the work and movement fields)
