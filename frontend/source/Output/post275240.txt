Move game center accounts between apple ID accounts <body> Question:  can I create a game center account to save game data that is currently associated with ONLY ONE iphone device on an apple id, we'll call it ID A, and then use that same game center account with a different apple id, we'll call it ID B, on the same device?    Context: The device's OS needs to be updated and I do not wish to lose game data. I'm currently on a family account and wish to move to my own apple id. There is no game center accounts on my phone, nor has there even been. The email I would use to create the game center account and the new apple id would be the same, but different from the family account. For the apps to be saved, itunes is telling me I need to authenticate the operation with an apple id.    <comment346211> Your phone will not lose game data if you update the OS, so long as you do not delete the app.
