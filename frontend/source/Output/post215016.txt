Messages App conversation screen doesn't refresh OSX 10.10.5 <body> The actual conversation transcript screen doesn't refresh regardless of which conversation I select from the previews on the left.  strongThe actual conversation transcript does not update/strong regardless of new messages or selecting a different conversation.   I still see new chats come in on the left side preview bar.  I can still send messages out. Even the contacts involved in a message will change in the "to: " field.  I have tried restarting messages, and restarting the mac.  Any other suggestions?
