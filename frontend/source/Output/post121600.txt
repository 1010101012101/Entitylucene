Is it possible to define a timeout on dead keys on OSX Mavericks? <body> When you press a dead key such as an accentuation key, OSX will wait indefinitely until you press another key. I want that, instead, if you don't press the second key fast enough, it will just ignore the accentuation keypress.  Is that possible?  <comment141745> What keyboard layout are you talking about? <comment141747> It is a personalized keylayout that I made using ukelele, @Tomg.
