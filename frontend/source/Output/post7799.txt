QuickLook for files with no extension or an unknown extension <body> I'm a programmer, and I find Mac's QuickLook a really great feature for quickly becoming familiar with a particular code base.  Basically, I open up a Finder window in the directory where my code files are, I push the spacebar (to evoke QuickLook), and then I arrow key up/down/left/right through all the files and scroll within QuickLook as needed.  The problem that I run into are files with no extension and files with unknown extension.  How can I convince the Mac to attempt to QuickLook these files as text files (which they usually are).  Also, it's really nice how QuickLook automatically colors the code based upon the type of code it thinks it is.  How can I extend the types of code files that the Mac recognizes?  For instance, I want to be able to QuickLook the code in a *.html.erb file or a *.js.erb file.  <answer7800> Take a look at the QuickLook Stephen plugin referenced in this thread:  https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/1142/great-quick-look-plugins  It opens almost everything I throw at it (as long as they are text based).  <comment8445> I think this plugins didn't work in snow-leopard at least didn't work for me :( <comment8456> Works in Snow Leopard for me... <comment8464> Hey, great advice.  I wish it had syntax highlighting for *.html.erb files, but at least I can read them now.  Cool! <comment23602> For link purposes, a question that mentions QLStephen: [Choose a default app for opening files with no extension?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/13557/8546) <comment123208> Since all links are broken, here's updated link to QLStephen plugin [QLStephen](http://whomwah.github.io/qlstephen/)
