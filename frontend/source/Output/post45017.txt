How do you access the content of the iPhoto bundle from Time Machine? <body> I would like to access the files of the iPhoto library bundle to retrieve just some of the files to help solving this question about corrupted iPhoto db files properly.  In time machine mode there is no way to show the content of the bundle.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/42Ipf.png" alt="No option to show the content of the bundle"  All I can get is a time machine view of the iPhoto application.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0yjQt.png" alt="Only option is to open iPhoto"  <answer45023> ol liOpen the iPhoto bundle strongembefore/em/strong your enter Time Machine./li liWhen you start Time Machine, the whole folder looks empty (plain white) - which is probably a bug that still needs a fix (I'm on 10.7.3).  You can get to show the contents by toggling the view options./li /ol  BTW: It's also possible to use strongGo to Folder.../strong via kbd&#x2318;/kbd+kbd&#x21E7;/kbd+kbdG/kbd in Time Machine. But this will not help you to enter the iPhoto bundle - whatever the reason is :(  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lIfVA.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <comment51226> :D Both you and Coyote are Europeans? <comment51256> You know what?
