How can I troubleshoot R and tk on macOS? <body> I am getting warnings and empty popup boxes when compiling and loading R packages that depend on tk. They say that tk was not installed correctly.  I am using homebrew, but I can't tell which package might provide a correct install of tk, or if it would conflict with the existing (but broken) installation.  What is the recommended way to install enough of tk on OSX so that an R package with tk as a dependency (e.g. RNCEP) R will compile without giving this warning?  strongUpdate/strong  Here is the warning that I get when trying to load an R package that depends on tk.tcl:   precodeWarning message: In fun(libname, pkgname) :   Can't find a usable tk.tcl in the following directories:      /System/Library/Frameworks/Tcl.framework/Versions/8.5/Resources/Scripts/tk8.5 /code/pre      /System/Library/Frameworks/Tcl.framework/Versions/8.5/Resources/Scripts/tk8.5/Resources/Scripts   /System/Library/Frameworks/Tcl.framework/Versions/8.5/Resources/tk8.5   /System/Library/Frameworks/Tcl.framework/Versions/8.5/Resources/tk8.5/Resources/Scripts   ./lib/tk8.5 ./lib/tk8.5/Resources/Scripts ~/Library/Tcl/tk8.5   ~/Library/Tcl/tk8.5/Resources/Scripts /Library/Tcl/tk8.5   /Library/Tcl/tk8.5/Resources/Scripts /System/Library/Tcl/tk8.5   /System/Library/Tcl/tk8.5/Resources/Scripts   /System/Library/Tcl/8.5/tk8.5   /System/Library/Tcl/8.5/tk8.5/Resources/Scripts   ~/Library/Frameworks/tk8.5   ~/Library/Frameworks/tk8.5/Resources/Scripts /Library/Frameworks/tk8.5   /Library/Frameworks/tk8.5/Resources/Scripts   /System/Library/Frameworks/tk8.5   /System/Library/Frameworks/tk8.5/Resources/Scripts ./library   <answer116568> Try installing tk from the ActiveState ActiveTcl binaries. If you're on Mavericks, make sure that you install ActiveTcl 8.5.15.0 or greater, as there are some problems with earlier versions on Mavericks. Also, please note that ActiveTcl is not open-source software.  <comment99706> Are you using a specific version of R? Does [this article](https://www.nesono.com/node/355) yield a workable R install? Are you [asking an XY](http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/66377/what-is-the-xy-problem) problem and really just looking to get R installed by bypassing a tk error or is getting a full tk part of the main goal? <comment99712> @bmike I've got a workable R install (installed as a .dmg downloaded from [Rstudio](www.rstudio.com), this is just giving me warnings and empty tk boxes). It started when I used brew to install inkscape and ghostscript (both of which require X11). <comment99744> Try installing R from homebrew - as the package writers should have sorted out issue <comment99746> @Abe does your comment mean that you had a working R before you installed inkscape and ghostscript? <comment99748> @Mark yes, it did work. Would it be a problem to overwrite the existing installation of R? Do I need to uninstall? <comment99750> How are you starting R? <comment99757> @Mark Either with Rstudio, R, or Rscript. <comment99807> I meant form the command line or as an app <comment100284> @mark both command line (R, Rscript) and app (Rstudio). <comment366679> Did you check if Tk was already loaded.
