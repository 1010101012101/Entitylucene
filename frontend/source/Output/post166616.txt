How to turn off date links in OSX? <body> In Messages and other apps, the date linking is sometimes a little unnecessary: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/01Q4F.png" alt="enter image description here"  Is there a way to turn off data detectors on Yosemite across the board?  I know you can turn off Mail data detectors with this command codedefaults write com.apple.mail DisableDataDetectors YES/code and then restarting the Mail.app but I'm looking for a broader elimination of them from my system.  <comment195288> Great question - I hope my edit is what you wanted. The data detectors in Mail is easy to kill, but I don't know if you can just kill time detectors or if you can kill things system wide (messages, etc...) so I'm hoping for an answer here that helps us both. <comment195362> Thx a lot, looks good! It feels like there should be an option in Sys.Prefs somewhere, similar to what is given under Sys.Prefs → Keyboard → Text
