Extend second partition from Sierra partition without losing data <body> I have two partition, every one is 250GB, one for macOS Sierra and second one for general purpose.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ydqe1.png" alt="Current State"  I want to shrink 50GB from Sierra partition and add it to the second one without loosing data.  I tried to cut 50 GB using "Disk Utility" from Sierra partition, then click (-) while selecting the second one, but it creates a new partition with "untitled" name, so I am afraid to proceed in order to not to lose second partition data.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KQkJK.png" alt="What I did"  Any suggestions?  <comment342070> With on-board tools you can't easily "forward-expand" a partition. "Forward" here means: move the beginning of a partition to lower block numbers. <comment342071> @klanomath So; is there's any third-party applications that could do that? <comment342073> I think [iPartition](https://coriolis-systems.com/iPartition/) and [Paragon Hard Disk Manager](https://www.paragon-software.com/home/hdm-mac/) are capable of doing this. <comment342091> @klanomath But isn't that what the Bootcamp assistant does when you delete your windows partition? <comment342092> It used to be simple in previous versions of OS X. However, I never tried it in Sierra. [This article](https://www.lifewire.com/resize-mac-disk-utility-volume-os-x-el-capital-later-3573395) claims it is possible with the Disk Utility. <comment342112> @n1000 No it isn't: BCA shrinks the main partition and moves the Recovery HD. Then a **new** partition is created in the then unallocated disk space. The linked article shrinks the 3rd partition and enlarges the second partition (1st one is EFI).
