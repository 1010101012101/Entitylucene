Do MacBooks support NVMe SSD drives via the use of a Sintech adapter? <body> strongMy question:/strong   Can anyone confirm or disprove the support of NVMe drives (like the Samsung 960) by the Sintech M.2 PCIe SSD MacBook adapters for macOS Sierra and High Sierra, or would you have any information that could help me confirm or disprove this support?  Below are the results of my research so far.  hr  h1SSDs comparison/h1  h3"Official" MacBook SSDs/h3  Officially supported MacBook SSDs are really expensive. For example, with the Macbook Air/Pro 2013, 2014 and 2015 models:  ul liOWC Aura: $299 for 240GB, $399 for 480GB, $649 for 1TB/li liIFIXIT: $524 for 256GB, $649 for 512GB, $949 for 1TB./li /ul  h3Equivalent PC SSDs/h3  Globally, an officially supported MacBook SSD (PCIe M.2 AHCI with a proprietary 12+16pin connector) cost from about strong$1 to $2 per GB/strong, while equivalent PC SSD (PCIe M.2 AHCI and NVMe with a keyÂ M connector) cost from about strong$0.4 to $1 per GB/strong.  NVMe:  ul liIntel 600p: $196 for 512GB (low quality)/li liSamsung SSD 960 EVO: $219 for 500GB/li liCorsair Force Series MP500: $316 for 480GB/li /ul  AHCI:  ul liKingston Digital HyperX Predator: $300 for 480GB/li liSamsung SM951: $450 for 512GB/li /ul  So standard PCIe M.2 devices seems to be strongup to 3x cheaper/strong than the MacBook PCIe M.2 SSD. Plus, NVMe SSD are globally way faster.  hr  h1NVMe SSD compatibility?/h1  h3Connector adapter/h3  At first for the connector, I often seen the  Sintech adapter recommended to use the AHCI SSD above in a MacBook Air/Pro. The product page clearly stipules only compatible with a limited set of AHCI SSDs, but I do not see any reason for these "incompatibilities", as there is no other software/hardware standards for the PCIe M.2 AHCI models. It seems they simply give as compatible the list of the AHCI SSDs they've tested, and as incompatible the most known NVMe SSD models.  h3Interface compatibility/h3  Then for the interface, what I understand from AHCI/NVMe is that it is only a controller interface, depending on the system drivers on the MacBook and not on the hardware itself.  Which seems to be consistant with:     I emailed the store which sell that adapter and problem is that macOS doesn't support 3rd party NVMe SSDs, but Windows 10 and Linux do.      -- From a Youtube comment on a upgrade video with a AHCI SSD and the Sintech adapter.   So Sintech may have given these NVMe SSD as incompatible not because of the adapter incompatibility, but because of the destination OS incompatibility.  h3System support/h3  Finally for the system, macOS now support NVMe SSDs, from unofficially OSX El Capitan (with a patch to boot) and natively macOS High Sierra (even as boot, see an article about the NVME support and a confirmation from the Hackintosh community).  I sent an email to Sintech to get more informations on their adapter. I got a reply with some references (added to this post), but no answer since.  Edit (23/06):     Unfortunately, we are busy in other projects, and still can't get new system to test it.   hr  h1Similar researches/h1  After I created this post, I seen there is some people with the same question in other communities, waiting at the same step. I share the links there in case of some of them got a return from a test with the Sintech adapter or an other one.  On IFIXIT - MBP early 2015 SSD can upgrade with Samsung 950 pro?  ul liPor Chumjan (02/27/2016):     I think about to upgrade. Samsung 950 pro is interesting. But i'm not sure it can use for this model. /li litrumanhw (12/21/2016):     You can buy an adapter from M.2 to MBPr or Air for about $20... (...) The REAL question is if the NVMe protocol will be a hiccup (as in, I don't personally know that answer) ... and if it'll get the full speed of the 950. In principle, I don't see why it wouldn't. And I WILL be testing this out. /li liFabio (06/10/2017):     [ About the patch ]. It is meant to be used on hackintosh but I think it might work on a macbook pro from 2015 with the adapter and a nvme ssd like the samsung 960/950 evo/pro. If someone tries or has tried it please let me know. /li /ul  <answer290241> The short answer is strongYes and No/strong, it depends on the Mac model.  Thanks to @gillesaurejac who made the tests with the Sintech adapter and a lot of Mac models running macOS High Sierra.  His results are:     So, as for strongAHCI PCIe/strong drives, (like the lite-on LGT-512B1P), strongthey work/strong in every 2013-2014-2015-2017 mac, but sleep is a concern with the 2014-2015 macs.      As for strongApple NVMe/strong drives, (like the Apple SSD SM2024L as found in the 2017 iMacs, or the 24GB fusion drive of the 2015 iMacs), to this date the tests I have done are :      ul   liMac Pro late 2013 : doesn't work/li   liMacBook Air early 2014 : doesn't work/li   liMacmini Late 2014 : strongworks/strong/li   liMacBook Air early 2015 : strongworks/strong/li   liMacBook Pro 15" early 2015 : strongworks/strong/li   /ul      As for strongnon-Apple NVMe/strong drives, (Samsung), to this date the tests I have done are:      ul   liMac Pro late 2013 : doesn't work/li   liMacBook Air early 2014 : doesn't work/li   liMacBook Air early 2015 : strongworks/strong/li   liMacBook Pro 15" early 2015 : doesn't work/li   /ul   <comment363264> My pleasure. :) I hope you get a definitive answer - I think this is a great question! There's a couple of guys around the community that I *think* may be able to help, so hopefully they chime in. <comment363265> At least 2x cheaper (and faster) SSDs : I hope someone we be able to test it. This will put the prices down if it is confirmed.
