Accessing App Store using USB wireless card instead of AirPort <body> I'm having trouble accessing my App Store account on my MacBook Air.  First of all, my AirPort chip was broken, so I bought a USB wireless card. Then my App Store account stopped working.  My question is: can I use my App Store account without having the card?  <answer294155> Yes. You can have dozens of network connections and the App Store supports them all. Youâ€™ll want to troubleshoot the store process normally without worrying about network adapter.

Can you clarify how exactly you are having trouble accessing the App Store?  On a side note, replacement [AirPort cards for the MBA](http://amzn.to/2wPRUj0) are super cheap and very easy to replace - probably around the same price as the USB wireless.
