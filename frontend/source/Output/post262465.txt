Zoom the screen with mouse gesture <body> Since upgrading to macOS Sierra version recently, the zoom feature does not seem to work properly anymore.  In previous OS version, using a mouse scroll with modifier key would zoom the display.    emNote/em: zooming using the keyboard shortcuts still works fine.  It's only the scroll gesture zoom which seems broken.    Is it a known bug? Does anyone know how to get this useful feature working again?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1hcQW.png" alt="settings"
