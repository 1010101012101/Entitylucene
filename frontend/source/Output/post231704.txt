How do I reduce the size of my iPhone's projected iCloud backup? <body> Early in 2016, I (and some others I know) started to get messages about our basic iCloud Storage being nearly full, despite not having changed any of our normal practices (photo usage the same, app usage the same, etc.) I have already turned off the photos and apps that together compose the largest part of the iCloud backup, but the estimated space needed for the phone is still between 4.7 and 4.9 GB. What gives? What else can I do to reduce the backup's size? Delete messages? (I use Photo Stream and not Photo Library, for what that's worthâ€”the photos are not supposed to count against the storage space.) iPhone 6, iOS 9.2.1
