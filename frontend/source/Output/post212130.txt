Auto hide bluetooth icon <body> I've set the system to not show the bluetooth icon in the menu bar. When the magic mouse's battery is low, the mac displays a warning and the bluetooth icon shows up in the menu bar. After replacing the battery, the icon does not go away. I know how to get rid of that manually: cmd drag or via system preferences, but is there a way to automate this task?
