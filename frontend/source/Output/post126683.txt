Downgrading from iMovie 10 to 9; what's safe to delete? <body> I have decided that iMovie 10 is not meeting my needs and I would like to go back to using iMovie 9.0.9, which I still have a copy of (fortunately!). Having already run iMovie 10 and allowed it to upgrade my events, etc., I now have several iMovie-related folders on my hard drive. What can I delete safely, emassuming I don't want to save anything that I had created or imported in iMovie 10/em? I currently see the following folders in my Movies folder (Mac OS X 10.9.2):  ul liiMovie Events/li liiMovie Library.imovielibrary/li liiMovie Original Movies/li liiMovie projects/li liiMovie Theater.theater/li /ul  My gut says it's okay to delete iMovie Library.imovielibrary and the Theater one, since I think those are the ones that appeared after launching iMovie 10. Is this correct?  Update: Knowing I had a recent backup of my entire system on a Time Machine drive, I went ahead and deleted the "iMovie Library.imovielibrary" and "iMovie Theater.theater" directories. So far, iMovie 9.0.9 runs with no problems, and I have access to all of the projects and events I had before. So, the evidence so far suggests that these directories are safe to delete if you want to use iMovie 9.0.9 and NOT iMovie 10. "So far" is an important caveat though; I'll update this again if I run into issues.
