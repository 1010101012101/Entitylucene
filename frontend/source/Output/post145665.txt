My AppStore Updater wants to install the latest RAW update over and over again <body> Somehow my OS X AppStore is caught in a loop. It wants to install the RAW updates for Aperture and iPhoto over and over again. What should I do?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/asbon.png" alt="AppStore installs RAW update over and over again"  <answer145738> It indeed seems to have been a load problem. After one night, the update and the notification for the update have gone. Seems the iOS8 downloads have pretty much irritated the AppStore.  <comment171686> Is ignoring it for 24 hours to let the avalanche of iOS 8 download clear the queue a viable next step for you? <comment171687> I guess so. Will try again tomorrow and report back. <comment171688> It might not be related, but I'd hate to have you do a lot of troubleshooting if it's just a capacity issue on the CDN Apple uses to stage and report updates.
