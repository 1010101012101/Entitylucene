How to hide favourites bar in mac os using bash script? <body> I'm trying to disable and enable the favourite bar in mac os "Yosemite" using bash script, I used the following command in terminal but it didn't work even after I restarted Safari, so am I doing something wrong?  precodedefaults write com.apple.Safari ShowFavoritesBar -bool false /code/pre  <answer193929> You need to add a -v2 for Yosemite.  See below:  precodedefaults write com.apple.Safari ShowFavoritesBar-v2 -bool false /code/pre  Restart Safari.  <comment231204> even after relaunching the app? Otherwise, I'd guess there's nothing to prompt it to read the new setting <comment231206> I restarted the app :( <comment231207> defaults read says it doesn't exist. I tested defaults read com.apple.Safari ShowStatusBar for comparison, which does exist
