MagSafe blinks orange, off, green, orange, off, green, orange <body> While charging my MagSafe blinks orange, then turns off for a second, turns green, and then goes orange, then turns off, and then green, and then orange again. While going off, my MacBook Pro doesn't charge, as if unplugged.  It's not an issue with the power socket. I can't tell if the problem is the MagSafe, the battery, or its components.  Any advice?  <comment247743> From other posts I've read on the Internet in the past, it's indicative of a battery issue.  In some cases the battery was part of a recall and replaced for free and in others it had just reach its end of life in the number of charges it can take.  In any case I'd check directly with Apple. <comment248209> will do so, thanks for the tip.
