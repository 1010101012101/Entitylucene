Where can I find El Capitan's default and beachball/busy cursors? <body> I saw from this answer how I can get emmost/em of the cursors, but the busy and default cursors aren't there. Why is that?  <answer238535> The default cursor is available here:     /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/EFILogin.framework/Versions/A/Resources/EFIResourceBuilder.bundle/Contents/Resources/loginui_cursor@2x.png   I can't seem to find the busy cursor, but I did find an older-seeming version of it here:     /System/Library/Frameworks/GLUT.framework/Versions/A/Resources/waitCursor.tiff   <comment292603> Oh nice! I remember finding the default cursor on Yosemite. Interesting that the beachball is so hard to find.
