Webcam not working on Macbook Pro 13" <body> At some point this year I noticed that my camera was not working. (Skype, Google, Facetime)   I tried this https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT2090  But under devices for Camera it says no devices found.   Mac OS 10.10.4  <answer216056> It might be some VDCAssistant programs using it.  Try this ,Open a terminal window and type the command below.  precodesudo killall VDCAssistant /code/pre  This will kill all other programs and you will be able to use your camera again.  <comment237461> You mean in the About this Mac it does not show it ? FaceTime HD Camera (Built-in): <comment237480> Probably it's broken or internally disconnected. <comment237499> @Buscarì›ƒ yes this is correct, it does not show any hardware. It is a 2012 Macbook Pro 13" <comment237502> Open system profiler/system information form the utilities folder (in the applications folder). Under hardware there should be a category "camera". Does it show you anything there? <comment237754> Hi Kevin, it shows no camera right now. <comment330440> Just run the command and it works in Skype again :). Thanks.
