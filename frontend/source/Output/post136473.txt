How can I change the default behaviour when selecting images from iPhoto form another application? <body> I use iPhoto to store all my photos. If I'm in another application or using a browser based app and want to upload or select an image, I select Media  Photos from the sidebar in the Open/Select dialog box.  This brings up a view that shows me iPhoto and Photo Booth in the top pane, with PhotoBooth selected by default. How can I change this default so that iPhoto is selected instead?  When I change the selection manually to iPhoto it takes a few moments and then shows me thumbnails of all the images in my iPhoto library, starting (strangely) with the oldest at the top. This strikes me as very odd default behaviour. Wouldn't it be sensible to show the newest images first? Or better yet, to show the lists of iPhoto events with the most recent first.  How can I change these defaults?
