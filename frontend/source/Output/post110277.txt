How to enable Three Finger Drag from command line <body> I'm trying to write a shell script that will automatically set the trackpad to use the three-finger-drag option that you can find in the system preferences. I've tried a number of different things, but none of them seem to work. Here's what I've got right now:  precodedefaults write com.apple.AppleMultitouchTrackpad TrackpadThreeFingerDrag -bool true defaults write com.apple.driver.AppleBluetoothMultitouch.trackpad TrackpadThreeFingerDrag -bool true /code/pre  I've scoured all the settings I could find from the output of codedefaults read/code, but I've found nothing else useful. These are the settings that system-prefs changes when I manually change the settings. Is this a bug?  I'm running Mavericks on a 13-inch mid 2012 MacBook Air. The three-finger-drag works fine when I enable it manually.  EDIT: I restart my machine each time I run this.  <answer130252> It took a lot of trial and error, but I figured it out:  precode defaults -currentHost write NSGlobalDomain com.apple.trackpad.threeFingerSwipeGesture -int 1 /code/pre  You don't need to restart your machine after you enter this command for the setting to apply. Logging out of your account and logging back in again is sufficient.  <comment187939> It doesn't work on Yosemite! <comment260089> On El Capitan, the original code (from the question) is working now..  Maybe Apple switched drivers <comment318338> What about Sierra
