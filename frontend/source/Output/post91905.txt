Is TimeMachine Apple's System Restore? <body> I have recently moved to Mac from Windows. Rarely I find that I may have to use System Restore to fix an issue that the OS has incurred. What I would like to know is whether Time Machine is the Mac equivalent to this feature?  I do not need Time Machine file backups itself as I already make regular backups using rsync. But if Time Machine can also backup the OS will use it.  <answer91912> Yes, TimeMachine is Apple's way of doing backups (both user, and whole system, as long as you aren't excluding system files).  http://support.apple.com/kb/ht1427
