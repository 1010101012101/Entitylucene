Can't Save to Users Folder After SymLinks <body> I previously had copied my personal user account on my mac to another hard drive and then symlinked just that folder which was named Craig.  It worked ok.  But then my Admin folder was taking too much space so I did the following:  ol liCopied my entire Users folder over to my other hard drive./li liMoved the Craig folder that was already on that hard drive into the new Users folder that I just copied to the other hard drive so now I have a Users folder on a non-root hard drive with everything I need in it./li liI renamed the primary Users folder to Users-Backup. /li liI symlinked to the Users folder on my other hard drive./li /ol  Since doing this, I have some issues notably, when I am in Illustrator and I got to "Save for Web" it won't do it.  I am wondering if it could be a permissions issue?  Not sure how to figure it out.
