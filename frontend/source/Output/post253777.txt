What are the privileges associated with /Groups/_developer? <body> We are looking to add a non-admin user to /Groups/_developer to allow them to work on xcode, following the instructions in this thread.   But there is concern that a non-admin person in the developer group would be able to wreak as much havoc as if the person were in the admin group. What are the privileges/risks associated with putting the user in the developer group as opposed to the admin group? And is there documentation for that?
