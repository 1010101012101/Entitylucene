Image is not cached in safari - An error occurred trying to load the resource <body> The version of safari is 9.1.2 (11601.7.7)  I am using OSX El Capitan 10.11.6  I have a web page which contains a lot of images. I find that some images seem to be not cached by safari. Here is an screenshot of an example  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/IGrge.png" alt="enter image description here"  If I try to load this particular image in a new tab, the image can be loaded without issue. The initial loading of the image file took some time to complete. It indicates safari tried to fetch the file from the server.  In the resource tab you can see the return code is 200 and cached is set to NO.  If I refreshed the tab, the image appeared relatively quickly (comparing with the first load). However the return code is still 200 and cached is set to NO in the resource tab.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rue8K.png" alt="enter image description here"  My question:  ul liIs it conclusive that safari does not alway cache image? /li liIs there anyway I can force safari to cache image files?/li /ul  Any resource/explanation that can help me to understand the safari caching mechanism is appreciated.  <comment339758> I have the same problem... did you solve this by yourself? On the attached image one can see that one of the lines are not cached have response 200 which means that it will not be shown. The picture tag is fetched like this. And never a problem in Chrome. img src="http://pics.objektdata.se/pic/pic.dll/image?url=17365/SFD427A34F928924BCC94011116ED331285.jpg&sizex=1000" [![network](https://i.stack.imgur.com/hN2K5.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/hN2K5.jpg) // Mattias
