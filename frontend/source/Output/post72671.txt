Remove email integration from calendar in mountain lion? <body> I've just got a new laptop with Mountain Lion. The calendar has the old color coded options of 'Work', 'Home' etc, however it also has my email address as an option. If I select 'Work' and create a new event it automatically changes to the email account, meaning that I get email alerts for events,  which I dont want.   How can I change this behaviour?   UPDATE - Actually I want to completely remove Google Calendar from my mac calendar so i dont get email alerts either. Thanks   <answer74081> To Remove the Calendar completely.   Go to the Mail, Contacts &amp; Calendars Preference in System Preferences select the google mail account and uncheck the Calendars &amp; Reminders  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/VkAVY.png" alt="Contacts &amp; Calendars Preference"  To Set the default Calendar for new events.  In Calendar the default calendar for new events is controlled in the Preferences.  You can set it to strongemSelected Calender/em/strong to make new events appear for the calendar you have selected   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uoX9H.png" alt="enter image description here"  or choose a  particular calendar  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4enOO.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer74591> You just need to remove Google account from your Calendar, nothing else. Just go to Calendar preferences codecmd+,/code then in accounts tab, you can select which account to keep and which to remove. Click on Google/Gmail account and click on the negative sign code-/code at the bottom to remove it.  PS: You just reminded me that I need to remove my google calendar too and I just did it. It worked fine, no more google calendar. So it verified the solution too.
