Copy video file to iCloud of my friend <body> Can I copy a video file to the iCloud of my friend from my MacBook ? Suppose I know the AppleId and the password.  <answer163304> When your freind has a mac or iOS device with airdrop, you can send it to him without any wires.  On your macbook you can use the share-button (square with arrow in it) to share the file. There should be numerious ways to share a video.  I think it is notossible to import a video directly to someones icloud unless it is enabled on your mac.  <comment190883> Could you expand on what you mean by 'to the iCloud'? iCloud Drive? Shared Photo Stream? iCloud Photo Library? <comment190886> The "iCloud" AppleTV has access to. I want my friend to play my video file in her AppleTV.
