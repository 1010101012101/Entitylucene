How can I get Xcode to support tabs over the jump bar? <body> I selected View - Tab Bar to enable tabs in Xcode.  However, when I open a new file, it appears in the jump bar below the single existing tab and not as a new tab.  How do I get new files to appear as new tabs in Xcode? I've been spending some time trying different things out.  <answer42420> Double clicking your source files in the Navigator pane should make them appear in new tabs.  <answer42606> Use kbdCommand/kbd+kbdT/kbd to create new tabs. Then on whatever tab is active a single click on source files sets its context.
