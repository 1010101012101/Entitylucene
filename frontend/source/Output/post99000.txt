When do I need to create Apple Developer Account? <body> Say I want to start working on some app X which I want to submit to App Store.  Is it necessary to have a developer account, embefore/em I can start working on this app?  <answer99002> A free Apple Developer Program membership now allows you to develop apps and test them on your devices. A paid membership allows distribution.  strikeA developer account is emnot/em required to start developing apps, however not having a developer account whilst developing the app can have the following downsides:  ul liYou will strongnot/strong be able to build the app on a strongreal device/strong (unless you jailbreak)./li liYou will strongnot/strong have access to the stronglatest/strong developer builds of iOS and Xcode, or their strongdocumentation/strong (a free account will only allow access to the latest empublic/em builds and their documentation)./li liYou will strongnot/strong have full access to the Apple Developer Forums (a free account will allow this for certain sections)./li liYou will strongnot/strong be able to create strongprovisioning profiles/strong for services such as PhoneGap Build./li /ul  As per above, certain features are accessible with a free Apple Developer Account./strike You can sign up at Apple Developer Registration.  <comment116324> Note that a free developer account will allow the first and third (I am not certain about the last) <comment116325> @Mark When I log in to my free developer account, and I change the Scheme to iOS Device, it tells me that it's unable to build & run to that device because I need a provisioning profile, which I can't get... Is this just because I have two accounts or something else?... <comment116327> @Mark: Does the `Organizagion/Company` enrollment (https://developer.apple.com/programs/start/standard/) type also have this free account? <comment116330> @user2054339 AFAIK it wouldn't matter since the difference between Personal and Company is only for features that you'd not be able to access anyway... (i.e. iTunes Connect) <comment116333> and then how does one create this free account? <comment116334> @user2054339 [Apple Developer Free Registration](https://developer.apple.com/register/index.action) <comment116335> hey grgarside, that's what I was interested in, if I register for this free account now, can I upgrade later to the Organization/Company enrollment type? <comment116336> @user2054339 Yes you can - when signing up for the full paid account, it will ask you which account type you would like. <comment116418> To add to @mark's first comment, the free developer account will not allow you to create provisioning profiles, therefore you will not be able to run your application on a device, only in the simulator <comment228871> This is no longer true as of Xcode 7. See http://9to5mac.com/2015/06/10/xcode-7-allows-anyone-to-download-build-and-sideload-ios-apps-for-free/ <comment228872> @Keith Thanks for the note, updated answer.
