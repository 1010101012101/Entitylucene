How to debug HDMI I2C? <body> I'm checking some issues on a monitor that does not work with some minidisplay port to HDMI adapters.  The same issues occurs with a macbook pro mid 2012 and also with a macbook air 2013.  I've verified that the same adapter works on other monitors and TVs.  I've seen this repository that uses DDC to transfer commands from the mac to the screen: https://github.com/kfix/ddcctl  I would like to know if there's a way to debug or check the data exchange from the mac and monitor via I2C.
