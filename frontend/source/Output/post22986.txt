How do I change back from MacPorts Python to system default version? <body> I used MacPorts to install a newer version of Python on my system (10.5.8 PPC), and then used the MacPorts select command to change the default invoked version of Python to the MP version. Now I want to change it back to the system version of Python, but I can't find a command to do so in the documentation.  I know all the MacPorts command did was to change a bunch of links to point at the MP version instead of the system version. Unfortunately I don't know what all the affected files are.  Does anyone know the command to reverse the setting or know the list of affected links that I would have to change?  <answer22992> Macports select can change it back.  The current macports does it using the port select command - older versions had python_select  To see the possible pythons run  precodeport select --list python /code/pre  From that list choose the one you want and change to it e.g.  precodesudo port select --set python python25-apple /code/pre  <comment25666> I ran `sudo port select --set python25-apple`  and got `Error: The 'set' command expects two arguments: group, version` <comment25669> Sorry - I have edited to I think the correct command - I missed the group <comment25751> It works!  `Selecting 'python25-apple' for 'python' succeeded. 'python25-apple' is now active.`
