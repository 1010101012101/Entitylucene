External monitors show blank screen until restart <body> MacBook Pro (15-inch, 2016) with 2 USB-C to HDMI adapters. The setup works great emif I start up in that configuration/em.   If I connect the adapters while the machine is running or simply sleeping, one of the monitors will never get a signal and stay in low power mode. The OS sees the monitor, it shows in the display arrangement settings and I can move the mouse into it, but until I restart, I can't see anything on it.  Once I have restarted I can let the machine sleep or whatever, and the display still works unless I disconnect the adapter. As soon as I do that a restart is required to use it again.

I am not a fan of converting signals because it's flaky at best.  If you emmust/em connect to HDMI, try an strongactive/strongsup1/sup adapter like the TRENDnet USB-C to HDMI 4K.  They have two versions - one that does 30Hz and another that does 60Hz (it's the Power Delivery version).  What is preferable, is to go from USB-C to Display Port which is actually Display Port to Display Port, so no there's conversion involved.  No conversion means less points of failure.      jksoegaard's comments provides more evidence of this:     Just to add a real-life experience: I'm using 2 USB-C to DisplayPort adapters (which are basically similar to the HDMI adapters) - and this works without any problems in that regard. Several times a week I plugin in both monitors after the MacBook Pro is booted (basically I never turn it off) - removing the cables again also never give problems   hr sup1/sup I wrote an answer on this very topic:  Passive vs. Active Adapter  <answer283961> Update to latest OSX version (10.12.5 (16F73)) fixed the problem.  <comment354321> Are you using Apple's adapter or a third party one? If it's third party, which brand and model? <comment354324> In addition to answering @NoahL 's questions, can you clarify which exact model of 2016 MBP you have? <comment354330> Just to add a real-life experience: I'm using 2 USB-C to DisplayPort adapters (which are basically similar to the HDMI adapters) - and this works without any problems in that regard.

Does it have ports *other* than HDMI?
