How do I use gnuradio installed using Macports? <body> I have used gnuradio companion in Linus.  I am trying to migrate to macOS Sierra.  I used Macports to install and it completed without error.    How do I run gnuradio now?  When I type "gnuradio-companion" in /opt/local/bin I get the following errors:     (process:37834): WARNING **: Trying to register gtype 'GMountMountFlags' as enum when in fact it is of type 'GFlags'      (process:37834): WARNING **: Trying to register gtype 'GDriveStartFlags' as enum when in fact it is of type 'GFlags'      (process:37834): WARNING **: Trying to register gtype 'GSocketMsgFlags' as enum when in fact it is of type 'GFlags'   Traceback (most recent call last):     File "/opt/local/bin/gnuradio-companion", line 97, in        check_gtk()     File "/opt/local/bin/gnuradio-companion", line 64, in check_gtk       die(err, "Failed to initialize GTK.
