Mosaic effects on iMac screen <body> emnot sure if this is a SuperUser question or AskDifferent question/em  When I start up my iMac 21.5" (Mid 2011 model) this morning, my screen looks like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lXZtf.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Then the computer is completely frozen. Is the display card going to die?   using Mac OS X 10.10.3, Graphics: AMD Radeon HD 6770M 512 MB  <answer189911> If you were looking to test the video card status I believe you could restart your iMac, hold the Option key right before the chime, and choose the Recovery disk. From there you can run system diagnostics.  <comment225346> Do you still have hardware-warranty? <comment225349> I'm afraid the warranty expired 3 years ago ( I have 1 year warranty only ) <comment225353> haven't tried yet. will try if I have time later. (p.s. is there any software that I can test the display card status?) <comment225372> why downvote ? please provide reasons, thanks <comment225373> As my Mac is mid-2011, I should use Apple Hardware Test (AHT) instead. Will try tonight <comment289499> Could you tell me what ended up happening? Same 2011 iMac problem here.
