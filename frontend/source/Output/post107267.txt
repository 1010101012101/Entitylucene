Automator: How can I monitor a folder, make items process in a specific app? <body> I will be feeding images into a folder from my camera as they are taken. When those items enter the folder, I need for them to be opened and processed by an app.   How would I go about monitoring the folder and then making new items open in a specific app? (In this case, the app will be a Photoshop "droplet" app).  I have never used Automator, and I do not know Javascript or anything like that.
