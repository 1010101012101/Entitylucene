How can I build an installer for a single data file? <body> I need to install a single file in code~/Library/Spelling/voikko//code, and I want to use Apple's software for it, to get signing and all that stuff correct.  Problem is, so far I have found no way of installing a single file. All options and solutions assume you are installing a bundle.  I need an installer since the code~/Library//code dir is hidden - it is too much to ask regular users to open that dir, find the correct subdir, and then create another dir manually.  Any help appreciated :)  <comment315754> What happens if you add another unnecessary file? Or even just a 'read me' file or 'release notes' file? <comment315757> @Monomeeth: This is the command I tried: `pkgbuild --component sma.zhfst --install-location ~/Library/Spelling/`. And the error message I got was: `pkgbuild: error: Path "/Users/xxx/sma.zhfst" is not a valid bundle component (using destination path "/Users/xxx/")` <comment315760> I don't think adding another file will help, as long as they are not organised in a bundle structure.
