`ssh-add -K` has stopped working <body> I have ended up with 2 versions of codessh-add/code:  ul licode/usr/bin/ssh-add/code – Apple version (non-standard but default on OS X)/li licode/opt/local/bin/ssh-add/code – Macports version/li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/aUegp.png" alt="screenshot of terminal showing two versions of ssh-add"  The Apple version adds a new switch (code-K/code, that's a capital K) which adds keys to OS X's Keychain. That option's obviously not relevant to non-OS X operating systems.  I have a couple of questions about this:  ul liHow can I keep the version within Macports but strongalways/strong use the Apple version by default?/li liHow can I find out which Macport requires the installation of codessh-add/code? (That's the only way I can think that it would end up in the Macports codebin/code directory)/li /ul  <comment324029> Possible duplicate of [macOS Sierra doesn’t seem to remember SSH keys between reboots](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/254468/macos-sierra-doesn-t-seem-to-remember-ssh-keys-between-reboots)
