MacBook not turning on (fan loop) <body> I'm in a very frustrating situation of having my MacBook Pro 15' Retina (A1398) stuck in a boot loop. Well, not exactly boot loop: when I connect my MagSafe charger, it goes in a constant cycle of starting up fans and turning off, with a period as long as 1 second (or even less). I tried resetting SMC and NVRAM so far, but had no result apart from having my charger's led turn green from amber (temporary; only when I hold emShift-Control-Option/em combination). What could be the possible issues?  emI'll be getting it to a diagnostics facility (non-Apple) in a few days, it would help clarifying whether I could be lied to or not (considering the fact it's unofficial)./em  <answer208685> How is your backup Situation?, if you've got everything backed up, I recommend that you simply format your Drive and reinstall OS X. if you know how, and have the original Disk.
