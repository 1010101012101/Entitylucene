osascript display notification does not work on thunderbolt display <body> The command   precodeosascript -e 'display notification "Heres an alert" with title "Title"' /code/pre  works on my MacBook Pro, except when it's attached to my Thunderbolt display and the displays are mirrored, when nothing happens. When I disconnect the display, the notifications appear on the screen of the MacBook Pro. It also works if the screens are not mirrored.   How can I get the notifications to work with the screens mirrored?
