SysPref > Keyboard > Text auto-spell-correct is OFF but persists in Numbers <body> I switched off spell-correct in SysPref  Keyboard  Text, but Numbers 3.2 continues not only to suggest corrections, but - when I decline the suggestion by hitting ESC - to replace my text with its suggestion.  How utterly annoying of it!  Any idea how to shut it up?  <answer138621> Have you unchecked "Show suggestions when editing table cells" in the Numbers Preferences panel?
