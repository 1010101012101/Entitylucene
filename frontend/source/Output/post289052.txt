On a mac, how can I force-close a window of an app (NOT the app itself)? <body> I'm looking for a keyboard shortcut to close a window of an app, skipping the "Would you like to save" pester dialog, while leaving the app, itself, and other windows, still open.  If there's no way to do that, is there a keyboard shortcut for hitting a certain button in a window/dialog?  In Windows, this would typically be ALT+[emfirst letter of the button text/em].  <answer289059> To press a button in a dialog using a keyboard shortcut, press kbdCommand/kbd, followed by the first letter of the action you wish to trigger. The exception to this rule is if the action you wish to activate will delete a file or changes thereto, in which case the shortcut is kbdCommand/kbd-kbddelete/kbd.  To force-close a window, you'd need to automate the correct series of key presses using AppleScript or something similar. The first key combination would likely be kbdCommand/kbd-kbdW/kbd (though not even this is entirely universal). However, the dialog shortcuts vary by applicationâ€”older versions of Microsoft Word don't comply with the kbdCommand/kbd-kbddelete/kbd behavior (they use kbdCommand/kbd-kbdD/kbd), while Automator's save sheets can often only be closed through mouse input. You would have to tailor this behavior to the specific applications in which you're interested. Such an AppleScript might look something like this (though be warned, triggering kbdCommand/kbd-kbddelete/kbd without knowing the context is an easy way to accidentally delete files and large swathes of text):  precodetell application "System Events"     keystroke "w" using {command down} -- Command-W     delay 0.5 -- Wait for the dialog to appear     key code 51 using {command down} -- Command-delete end tell /code/pre  To tie an AppleScript to a keyboard shortcut:  ul liOpen Automator (Applications  Utilities  Automator) and create a new Service (optionally, configure it just to run in the applications you want)./li liAdd a "Run AppleScript" block in which you write your AppleScript./li liOpen System Preferences  Keyboard  Shortcuts./li liCreate a new shortcut, where the "Menu Title" is the title you gave your Service (again, you can tie this shortcut just to the applications to which your Service applies). The keyboard shortcut you enter here is the one you can use to trigger your "force close" behavior./li /ul  You could create multiple services, each one with the same keyboard shortcut but in different applications, corresponding to the unique behavior of each.  <comment365085> I don't know about force-closing a window, but on Mac the pop-up dialog keyboard shortcuts are the same as Windows', only using Command instead of Alt. Also, when a dialog option is "destructive of a file" (e.g., "Delete," "Don't Save"), the key combination is Command-Delete. <comment365086> Thanks! `Command-Delete` is the keyboard shortcut I was looking for (for the second part of my question).  You should post that as an answer, rather than as a comment (it deserves an upvote).
