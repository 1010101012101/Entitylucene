iOS Video Wall App <body> Looking for an iOS videowall type app that allows multiple iOS devices (no PC/Mac) connect over wifi or bluetooth and for one to act as a host/configure and the others to display sections on images or videos and act as a video wall.  There was an app that did something similar many years ago but is not available now. https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/the-matrix/id411537032?mt=8  Does anyone have any suggestions or pointers? A lot of the apps out there mirror or connect to a PC/Mac but not to each other and do not have video wall type functionality.
