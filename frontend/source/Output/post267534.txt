Manually entering activities into Apple Watch <body> I know this question has been asked online a few times, but most questions are over a year old and so maybe something changed.  I kickbox and swim regularly, but never wear my watch when I do those activities. I can enter those activities in the Health app, but they don't add to the infamous three rings that report back on my day.   Is there any work-around?  ul liMaybe entering data into a 3rd party app will influence the rings/li /ul  Or  ul liMaybe if I keep the watch in my pocket (but not on my wrist) when I kickbox will do the trick?/li /ul  I'm trying to get a perfect year! Thanks a lot.  <comment335705> If there's already questions here that address your issues, the best thing to do is to open a bounty for updates on one of those questions.  Opening a new question risks this being closed as a duplicate.
