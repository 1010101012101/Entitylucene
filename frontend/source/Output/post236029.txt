How to add a Japanese name that does not appear in the Kotoeri registry? (OS X 10.11) <body> On OS X 10.11 El Capitan, I am trying to add a word to the Kotoeri lookup dictionary. It is a name that does not come up when you type the Hiragana. The way to do it pre-10.10 no longer works. How can I add the word?  <answer236030> Edit and use your user dictionaries (For OS X 10.11 El Capitan (and 10.10?))     ol   liWhile using a Japanese input mode, choose Edit Text Substitutions from the Input menu in the menu bar./li   liIn the Text pane of Keyboard preferences, click the Add button ./li   liIn the Replace field, type the hiragana reading of the word (up to 32 characters).      ul   liIf you add an adjective, enter the reading in its dictionary form. The ending must be 〜い (~i). For example, あたらしい (atarashii) or たかい (takai)./li   liIf you add an adverb, don’t include inflective endings, such as 〜な (-na) or 〜だ (-da)./li   /ul/li   liClick the With column, then type the replacement word (up to 64 characters)./li   /ol   See the question mentioned as duplicate for methods for older versions of OS X.  <comment288726> Not duplicate.  that answer is for pre 10.10 OSX.  Apple changed this so that answer no longer works.  Please remove duplicate tag. <comment288727> I tried to add a name using this method and it does not show up.  Is this a bug or does it take time to show up in suggestions? <comment288728> It should begin to work immediately. Make sure you entered the correct hiragana for your kanji. Perhaps try restarting.
