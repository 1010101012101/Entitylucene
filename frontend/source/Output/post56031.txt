How to distinguish multiple OS X installations from each other in the bootloader? <body> I read with interest this post about setting up a flash drive with multiple OS X installers.  It confirms what I've suspected by my tests with just one OS (Lion).  However, a question occurred to me: How do you avoid multiple instances of "Mac OS X" appearing as possible boot choices?  In other words, how do you know which one is which?  EDIT:  I am referring to the situation when booting with the "Option" key held down, showing all available boot sources.  ul liDoes the boot loader distinguish between them somehow?/li liIf not, can I (safely) rename the string in the "SystemVersion.plist" file on each partition?/li /ul  <answer56102> Haven't tried it for a long time, but it didn't distinguish them in any way.   If you want an easy way of clearly setting them apart, you could just change the default emMacintosh HD/em name of the HD (just by hitting kbdEnter/kbd, no need to change any em.plist/em).  <answer56123> ul liGet a 16gb or 32gb usb stick/li liPartition it with GPT (to have EFI partition on it) if you trying to install os x on non apple hardware = hackintosh use MBR and manually add an EFI partition (EFI specification says it can live with mbr as well)/li lirestore InstallESD.dmg with Disk Utility to a partition for each Installer Image you wish. Just make sure your partitions have at least 5gb space. /li /ul  Your partition table on your USB stick could look like this  /dev/diskX1 - EFI  /dev/diskX2 - Osx Lion  /dev/diskX3 - Osx Mountain Lion  /dev/diskX4 - Osx Snow Leopard  /dev/diskX5 - Osx Whatever  install rEFIt on the usb sticks EFI Partiotion to have a boot loader. EFI Partitions are 200mb, named EFI, filesystem type is FAT to check if you got one on your usb stick enter in terminal  codediskutil list/code and look for EFI in the lists, shoud be '/dev/diskX*ems1/em*' since it's the first partition on GPT based tables   if trying to use install OS x on non Apple Hardware (==osx86) use Clover V2 instead of Refit. Put your Usb into your computer and boot from it. If you don't see a boot menu on Mac after installing refit - read the readme file and bless the disk from terminal.  Be happy with your uber usb installer  <comment64431> How does that change the names in the boot loader screen?  I agree that renaming the volumes would make a difference if I were to use the System Prefs to choose the startup volume.  The problem there is that assumes the system is even bootable. <comment64432> Well, it will work if each bootable source is in a different partition. <comment64434> They are in different partitions, in fact they have to be, given the recommended method of creating them in the first place.  I asked about the .plist file because I found the ID string used to name the things and figured that it might be the only way of forcing them to be different.  I'll give your suggestion a try when I get a key large enough to hold 10.6, 10.7 and the upcoming 10.8. <comment68270> Similar: [How can I change the title of a boot image?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/2350/8546) – whilst the question is oriented to Snow Leopard, the accepted answer may be good for you.
