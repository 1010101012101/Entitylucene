Recover my lost data <body> I wanted to delete my Linux partition, but I don't know why my OS X partition was also deleted.   So, I then reformatted the partition and installed a new OS X (Yosemite) on that partition.   I am trying to recover my lost data, I tried many applications such as Disk Drill, EaseUs, etc. But none of them was able to recover a single file from my 300 GB SSD!  <answer213746> If you hadn't written to it, you might have had a chance.  No chance, now.  Restore from your backup.  <comment257807> No Time Machine backup? <comment257809> You might have been OK up to the 'installed new OS X' That was probably your downfall, unfortunately. <comment257983> There is no way to recover the data :-(
