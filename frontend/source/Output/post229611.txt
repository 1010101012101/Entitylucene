Move some images from managed into referenced library (opposite of colsolidate) wit Photos.app <body> I am using Photos.app under El Capitan and would like to move most of my images out of the photo library, i.e. convert them from managed to referenced.  Under Aperture, I have the Relocate command to do exactly this - but I don't find anything like that under Photos.  My question:  How can I convert managed images (in the photo library) to referenced images (outside the photo library and strongnot/strong synched to icloud)?
