Block port on all interfaces using PF <body> Trying to block incoming traffic on all interfaces to a specific local port on Mac OS X 10.11.15, including loopback.  This is my /etc/pf.conf:  precodescrub-anchor "com.apple/*" nat-anchor "com.apple/*" rdr-anchor "com.apple/*" dummynet-anchor "com.apple/*" anchor "com.apple/*" load anchor "com.apple" from "/etc/pf.anchors/com.apple"  block in quick to any port 63342 /code/pre  However, when attempting to apply this rule, I get an error (line 29 is the one with the block rule):  precodeâœ— sudo pfctl -f /etc/pf.conf pfctl: Use of -f option, could result in flushing of rules present in the main ruleset added by the system at startup. See /etc/pf.conf for further details.  No ALTQ support in kernel ALTQ related functions disabled /etc/pf.conf:29: port only applies to tcp/udp /etc/pf.conf:29: skipping rule due to errors /etc/pf.conf:29: rule expands to no valid combination pfctl: Syntax error in config file: pf rules not loaded /code/pre  What would be the correct syntax in this case?  <answer249689> The proper rule is:  precodeblock in quick inet proto { tcp, udp } from any to any port 63342 /code/pre  Some parts may be omitted (e.g. eminet/em or emfrom any/em) with a slightly different meaning.
