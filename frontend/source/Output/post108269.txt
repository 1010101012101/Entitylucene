How can I configure OS X Mavericks to use a UK PC keyboard layout? <body> I'm using a non-mac USB UK keyboard with Mavericks.  Because Apple's idea of a UK keyboard is different to a non-apple UK keyboard, some symbols are wrong, e.g. " and @ are swapped.  How can I get set my keyboard layout to match a non-mac UK keyboard?  <answer108272> If the British PC layout from apple is not right, some alternatives can be found at  http://liyang.hu/osx-british.xhtml  <answer108276> After downloading alternatives from the link suggested in Tomg's answer, I realised while making them active that there is already a "British - PC" layout installed by default.  To activate it was Settings-Keyboard-Input Sources-Plus sign &amp; find it from the list, and then click the input source icon in the menu bar to select it.  <answer123592> I agree with the previous answers. Alternatively there is a software called Ukelele with which you can remap your keyboard as you like. I didn't find this answer before when I was looking for the "proper" British-PC layout. With the app it takes 5-10 minutes to redo your keyboard - there are ready-made samples inside which you can use as a templates.  I hope it helps.  <answer240378> To get this working correctly (without downloading anything extra) I had to go to System Preferences - Keyboard - Input Sources.  British was the only option I had there, but clicking the + icon brought up a list which included British - PC. Simply add that one, THEN remove the original British option using the - icon.  My keyboard was correctly mapped to the British default after that. It didn't work until after I removed the original British option, so only British - PC was in Input Sources.  <comment126920> Have you tried the one provided by apple called "British PC"? <comment137546> These can also go in ~/Library/Keyboard layouts if you don't want to pollute /Library. Also didn't need to logout/in doing this. <comment137547> British PC doesn't alway work, \ and ` were swapped for me, this new layout fixed that. <comment137548> British PC doesn't alway get everything right, for example \ and ` swapped. This one does. <comment137565> What is the "this new layout" you are referring to? <comment137568> Do you really find that Apple's British PC does not put ` on the topmost leftmost key on an ISO keyboard as used in Europe?  What is "this one"? <comment154839> This also worked for me, with a Logitech K400 keyboard.  It's still a cheap/nasty keyboard, but at least the key mapping is correct... <comment198896> Just using "British PC" layout worked for me, as per @kdt's email below. Look what I can type correctly now: @`\# :) <comment306091> for the lacking in observation (like me, it took me 10 mins to see),  you need to click on 'other' at the top to get access to these new maps.
