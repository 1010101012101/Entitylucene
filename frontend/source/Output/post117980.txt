Adding Manufacture ID/Product ID to the Mac OS <body> I can not deploy my application to the smart phone watch, based on the fact that, through Eclipse, the Mac does not know there is a device connected to the Mac. However, if I go through 'About my Mac', I can see that it recognises the device connected to its USB port, as I can see productID/ManufacturerID.    I checked the Android's developer page, and they assume the Mac machine should detect it right away:   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dvM2i.png" alt=""  I checked for this problem and found a solution for Linux-based machines. Basically I need to add the IDs to some sort of meta file; so the Eclipse on Mac gets the device. Where can I add these IDs?  <comment137714> Shouldn't you be able to use the driver provided with your watch to access it? Just adding an ID to an OS table doesn't magically allow OSX to access the watch. Specificing the model of the watch might also make things easier here, maybe somebody else is already using it successfully with a Mac. <comment137715> @patrix updated with more information.
