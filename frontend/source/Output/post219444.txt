Store files in a directory in custom order <body> I am using youtube-dl terminal utility to download a  playlist from youtube . I want the videos in the folder to be in the same order as in the playlist (The playlist is huge consisting of more than 400  educational videos in a sequence).But after download, the videos are arranged lexicographically.How can i download them in same order.Any help is appreciated.  <comment265399> They are not "stored" in order. (The directory entries are in a b-tree.) The OS displays in order. There are limited options to set "order" in display, by date, name etc.
