My config:  ul liMacBook Pro 13" (early 2015)/li lieGPU connected via Thunderbolt (aikito like PCI-e = Thunderbolt thing)/li lieGPU is nVidia GTX 980 from EVGA/li liexternal disaply connected to eGPU using HDMI/li /ul  Everything works perfect with lid opened, but when i close laptop lid, its internal display keep working, e.g. i can move cursor away from main (external) screen or drag windows to internal display of my mac.
