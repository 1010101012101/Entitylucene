Is there a way to export my highlighted bookmarks in iBooks? <body> I don't see any native functionality to export highlighted notes made from within iBooks  Is there a third-party tool that will allow this?  <answer2601> Sorry, but (at least currently) there's no way to do this.  <answer39172> yes there is, if you have a mac.  Get iExplorer here http://www.macroplant.com/iexplorer/  plug in your iOS device and use iExplorer to look in the books file and drag the following files to your desktop. iBooks.plist  and iBooksData2.plist  and this app https://github.com/lgoss007/BookmarkExtractor  put the files in the appropriate spot and you can get your highlights  <answer83496> 3rd party app strongDigested/strong - does exactly what you need: "Quickly import bookmarks and notes from iBooks on iPhone, iPod, iPad, export to PDF and Evernote..."  <answer262643> You can do this on a per-book basis from within iBooks:  ol liOpen the book/li liPress the "list button" to bring up the Table of Contents/li liSwitch to the Notes tab/li liPress the Share button/li liSelect Edit Notes/li liSelect All/li liShare via email or some other app./li /ol  See this other question for how to do it on macOS.  <comment44318> sweet, i will check this out. thanks for the suggestion
