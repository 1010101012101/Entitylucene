Quickly change host for bluetooth keyboard <body> A while ago I stumbled upon an app that made it possible to change the device that a Bluetooth keyboard is connected to. This would allow me to quickly switch the keyboard between being connected to the iPad, or iMac or MacBook. Unfortunately, I forgot the name of this utility.   Does anyone know of a utility that would allow me to do this? In my case I'd want to switch between iPad and a MacBook.   <answer46796> Do you mean type2phone? It allows you to use the keyboard of your Mac on your iDevice...  <comment53543> nope not really. :/
