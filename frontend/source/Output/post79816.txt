How can I have Calendar use an audible alarm for alerts? <body> Today I missed an event alert because I stepped away from my desk for a few minutes. What settings would affect whether Calendar Alerts have an audible alarm?  Is there a way to force an audible alarm sound for specific items?  <answer79828> If you go to codeSettings/code - codeNotifications/code, then under codeIn Notification Center/code, select codeCalendar/code and scroll down to codeCalendar Alerts/code and choose it.  This will give you the screen to select an alert tone for your calendar alerts. You could select a ringtone for it even. To my knowledge there is no option to select a different tone for specific calendar items.  <comment92144> Does this apply for every Event which has an Alert? <comment92217> Yes, this is the alert for every calendar event <comment322376> Is it possible to make it sound even if the physical switch is set to silence?
