How can I run Terminal and Disk Utility at the same time when booted in Recovery Mode / off Recovery Partition in (Mac) OS X <body> In other words how can I run Disk Utility from Terminal when booted in Recovery Mode / off Recovery Partition in recent versions of (Mac) OS X  ?   This was once easy; I've remember I figured it out myself in an old version. (Lion?). There's a solution at How to open Disk Utility.app through Terminal? that fails since around 10.8.   Perhaps it's easier to tell Terminal to reopen after a delay and then open Disk Utility?br The executable open can be found on a bootable partition, so   precodels -al /Vol*/*/usr/bin/open /code/pre  should show copies.   Why do this?  It's handy to run other things, like codeiostat/code, codetop/code, codecp/code, codefind/code, codedf/code, etc.   <comment309851> Why don't you use a second Terminal window or a tab? Since Disk Utility.app is more or less a feature-reducing wrapper of `diskutil` with a horrible interface, you should be happy using the command line tool directly. <comment309855> Pretty good workaround, @klanomath!  Neither has a great UI.
