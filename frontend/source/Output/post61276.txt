Lacie external Thunderbolt drive not appearing in finder <body> I have an iMac running Mountain Lion and just bought an external Lacie Thunderbolt drive.  It seems to work, but does not appear in the Finder.  Does anyone know a fix for this?  <comment70711> Can you elaborate on what's happening? What do you mean by "it seems to work"? What appears in Disk Utility? <comment70714> +1 for "does it appear in Disk Utility". <comment70740> Have you set the Finder to Show External Disks on the desktop? Check the Finder's preferences dialog.
