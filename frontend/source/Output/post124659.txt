FireFox version of Safari "text only"? <body> I find the "text only" option in Safari - you know, those lines to the left of the URL bar - extremely useful on my iPhone and iPad. However on my Windows laptop for work, I use FireFox and would really, really like that feature. I know I could use third-party apps like Pocket and the like but frankly I would like something "built-in" which doesn't require bloatware.   On a side-note, does this feature have a particular name?  <answer124664> Firefox has no built-in reader feature. But you can install an extension to add this feature : Reader for Firefox  <comment145824> It's called Reading List <comment145826> @Robuust Isn't reading list the feature of "collecting articles" for later use rather than the feature of "transforming webpages to text only"? I don't want to store anything. <comment145827> Are you talking about the Reader ? <comment145831> @MatthieuRiegler Is that the thing which I am referring to? So... open webpage (usually an article), click "icon with four lines" on the left-hand side of the URL bar, webpage is turned into text only (text size dictated by OS text size setting). I would argue that it is related to Apple software so entirely relevant. <comment145832> Yes. that's the reader.
