Sleep mode on Mac OS X, don't wake up again <body> I have a MBP 13 (OSX El Capitan 10.11.2) with two external monitors. After a while when I do nothing my MBP switch to the sleep mode. The problem is that sometime it don't wake up again when I move the mouse or touch on the keyboard. I only get a black screen.  Anyone else have this type of issue?  What can I do?  Thanks in advance guys!  <comment291064> Have your tried resetting the SMC?
