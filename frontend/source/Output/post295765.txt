iPhone screen periodically unresponsive <body> My iPhone 6 had a problem where the screen stops responding to touch for a period of time. It always becomes responsive again after a while, although sometimes it requires a power button cycling.   For reasons I cannot explain, I feel this is a software issue. It happens in all apps, but it seems to have a sort of schedule.   Has anyone else an anything like this?  <answer295770> No, not as a general issue across all apps.  Some apps such as for example Safari may be "slow to scroll" (for example web pages that have Javascript scroll handlers that do not declare themselves as never calling preventDefault() can be slow to scroll).  However, if you see this as a general problem across all apps, and you have to powercycle the phone - it sounds that a hardware problem is likely.  If the phone is still under warranty - take the issue to Apple Support. If it is not, you could still try Apple Support.  <answer295772> If this has been happening ever since you have bought your phone, it may be a hardware problem with the touchscreen.  However, if has been happening recently, it may be because of the version of iOS that you are running. Make sure that you have updated to the latest stable or beta version of iOS. In addition, make sure that there are not too many background processes that are running.  <answer295776> My phone acts like this immediately after doing a big operation like removing my iCloud Library or adding or removing an Exchange Email Account. I think the sheer amount of work the phone has to major deletes, uploads &amp; downloads cause  the phone slow it down sometimes.
