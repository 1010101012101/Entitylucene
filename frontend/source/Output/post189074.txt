iPhone 5S, iOS 8.3, glitches when I try to delete text messages <body> I have an iPhone 5S running iOS 8.3, and the most recent carrier update settings as well. For some reason it doesn't like when I try to delete old messages.  I can delete an entire conversation or multiple ones. The next thing is that I exit the app, and kill it. When I open my messages app again, it freezes for a second, starts to compose a new message, and when I cancel the new message, my inbox is empty even if I only deleted one conversation. Also, when I try to type a name or number into the address bar to send a new text, nothing comes up to select. If I try to send a text directly from a person's contact info, it comes up as "No Name" in the address bar. When I hard reset my phone then my old messages all come back, including the ones that I meant to delete.  I've tried deleting and then syncing on my computer, and I even deleted all messages from my iPad and turned off my iPad messaging as well, but it always seems to glitch out like this. I haven't been able to find any solutions to this problem or any other threads with the same problem. Please help.  <comment224013> I've seen the freezing/sputtering app problem happen, especially when deleting long message threads, but I haven't seen it where the messages are still there after resetting the device.
