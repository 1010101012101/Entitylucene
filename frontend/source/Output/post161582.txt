iOS apps for sync data via sftp <body> Please give me advice with iOS apps for data sync via sftp. I've tried using google... But there is no result. I need to sync iOS 8.1 with debian via sftp in live mode.  <answer161635> I'm not sure what you meant with "sync via sftp", but if you just need an ftp client, you could use Transmit, that is available for iPhone and iPad and support the following protocols:  ul liFTP/li liFTP with TLS/SSL/li liFTP with implicit TLS/SSL/li liSFTP/li liWebDAV/li liWebDAV HTTPS/li liAmazon S3/li liDreamObjects/li /ul
