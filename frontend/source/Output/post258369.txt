ipod shuffle not playing all songs <body> I own an ipod shuffle 4th generation.  I set my Playlist to be like this: 1. Song A 2. Song B 3. Song C 4. Song D 5. Song B 5. Song C 7. Song D . . . 48. Song B 49. Song C 50. Song D  The whole playslist should last about 3 hours. But when I play the ipod as In Order, I would hear the 1st song (Song A) within few minutes, which should only happen after 3 hours. Why is this and how can I fix it?
