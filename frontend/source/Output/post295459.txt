Color code for vi on terminal on Mac? <body> I have been using my school's tux for a while. It was built with nice color code for each syntax for each programming languages. I want to do the same on the machine that I just purchased. When I invoke  precodevi filename /code/pre  The view was plain black and white. How do I customize so that when I view the script/code files on terminal, it will have nice color code? For example, if statement will be read, string will be purple, etc.  As far as I know, it may have something to do with .profile file?  <answer295471> Add the following to your code~/.vimrc/code:  precodefiletype plugin indent on set term=builtin_ansi syntax on /code/pre  If youâ€™re using iTerm, use this instead of line 2:  precodeset term=xterm-256color /code/pre  <answer295555> Use code:syn on/code to turn on syntax highlighting. Put this in your code~/.vimrc/code file to use it every time. (Vim should detect your terminal type automatically, no need to worry about that.)  To customize the colors, use the code:highlight/code command. Type code:help :hi/code in Vim for more information on this. For more help on syntax highlighting in general, type code:help :syntax-highlighting/code.  If you want to customize it a lot, you can even create a color scheme. This is basically a list of commands, like a .vimrc file, into which you put all the code:hi/code commands. Make sure to include codelet colors_name = "whatever"/code somewhere so it'll work correctly.  <comment373151> I don't see any vimrc file in my computer. I did ls -a.  do I just create one myself? <comment373152> @Fyr Yes, you'll need to create one if you've never needed one before. It will be read automatically when it exists. <comment373154> Thank you, it worked. How can I customize specific color? <comment373159> Also, after add these three lines. After I enter these 3 lines, when I exit from a file, the file is still remained on the screen. How do I get rid of that?
