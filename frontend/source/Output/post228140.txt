DNS fails over time. Reconnecting to wifi solves it momentarily <body> The DNS lookup fails after some time of being connected. I can get it back working if i reconnect to my wifi. However it seems to happen more frequently.  I enabled debugging in the mDNS responder to see what happens when the error occurs.  precode21/02/16 16:22:14,721 mDNSResponder[100]: -------------- 21/02/16 16:22:14,721 mDNSResponder[100]: -- Sent UDP DNS Query (flags 0100) RCODE: NoErr (0) RD ID: 10907 30 bytes from port 61929 to 8.8.4.4:53    -- 21/02/16 16:22:14,721 mDNSResponder[100]:  1 Questions 21/02/16 16:22:14,722 mDNSResponder[100]:  0 skydrive.wns.windows.com.

Edit: sometimes it just starts working again, without reconnecting to wifi.  Hardware: Macbook pro 2015, with dedicated gfx.  <comment278386> The time stamps on the logs you posted are within 22ms of each other (if I'm reading that right) are you sure you posted the right logs from before and after you reconnected? Does this happen everywhere or just at your home network? <comment278425> Your right, ill update the post next time it happens with correct output when the dns isn't working. It happens mostly when i'm home but it has happen other places. <comment278433> What happens when you try a different DNS server? <comment278438> It makes no difference. I have tried both my internet provider's and google's. It seems similar to this unsolved problem http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/216734/macbook-not-working-with-home-wifi?rq=1
