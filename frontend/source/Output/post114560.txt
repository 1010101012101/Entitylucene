Open Terminal to a Specific Directory <body> On Windows I can Shift Right-click in a folder and I am presented with the option to Open a Command Window Here. Is there a way I can do this on my MacBook Air? Or, do I need to open the terminal manually, and then cd to the destination folder?  <answer114561> You can do this on a Mac by typing codecd/code and then just dragging the folder from Finder into the terminal and typing kbdEnter/kbd.
