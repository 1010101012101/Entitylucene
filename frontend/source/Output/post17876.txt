Can I control the shutter speed of a photo from an iPod Touch 4th gen? <body> Is there a Camera app that will let me control the shutter speed of a 4th gen iPod Touch? Camera+ for some reason doesn't support this.   Edit: I mean shutter speed, not exposure.  <answer17877> Photoshop Express has this feature.  Photoshop express is also free.   http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/adobe-photoshop-express/id331975235?mt=8   <answer22622> You can tap on an area of the picture you are taking to adjust the image settings (including the exposure) to that area of the image.  <answer22631> Threads like this one suggest that direct control of the "shutter" speed is impossible, as Apple have not released such controls in their API.  (Obviously, there's no actual shutter on the iPhone)  <comment19582> Isn't this post-shot? The OP was asking for more fine control over exposure, and specifically didn't want post processing. Good to have the link tho. <comment19601> Oh, sorry about that. Didn't understand the question (My answer was before he said that).
