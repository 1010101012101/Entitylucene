WiFi problems in windows 7 boot camp <body> I have a mid-2012 retina 15" MBP.  WiFi works fine in OS X, but in boot camp (windows 7 x64):  ul liI can see, but cannot connect to my 5 GHz network (n only, 40 MHz channel)/li liI can connect to 2.4 GHz (BGN, 20 MHz channel), but the connection has latency spikes and frequently drops./li /ul  Wifi chip is Broadcom BCM43xx, router is Linksys E3200 running firmware 1.0.04. Signal strength does not seem to be a factor. I've also tried updating the boot camp drivers, device manager shows "Broadcomm 802.11n Wifi Adapter", driver version 6.30.223.215. Is there something I could tweak to improve compatibility?  <answer208615> I have the same problem too. I've solved this with updating the driver but with an old driver Broadcom version strong5.106.199.1/strong (11/13/2012). Here is the steps :  ol liLeft click on your wireless adapter in Device Manager/li liChoose "Update Driver Software.."/li liPick "Browse my computer for driver software"/li liPick "Let me pick from a list of device drivers on my computer"/li liChoose "Broadcom....Version: 5.106.199.1 [11/13/2012]"/li liNext.. Wait for installing.. Finish (no need for restart)/li /ol  <comment298146> Where can I find this old driver? <comment298200> it's already there, have u tried it? <comment298278> Oh! I've re-readed your comment, and I understood to auto-search from hard-drive ^^'
