How to replace function keys on MacBook Air AC06 <body> I have been cleaning the keys on my MacBook Air by removing them, cleaning them and the area beneath them, and replacing them.  (This all started out with my space bar being sticky on the right side...)  I had no issues until I started on the function keys.  Instead of the standard "picnic table" plastic pieces, it has a metal bar and 2 separate plastic pieces.  I can put the keys back on, but when I do the keys wobble.
