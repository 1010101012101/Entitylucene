It shows up in Disk Utility, but when I click "mount" it doesn't.   ul liI ran First Aid on it and it still doesn't mount./li liI tried it on an iMac with the same results, but other drives work fine./li liI tried to shut down, restart                - same outcome/li lion a different computer iMac - same outcome/li lidifferent drive solid state and normal - both worked fine  I ran First Aid in Disk Utility /li /ul  <answer244731> When there is not something wrong with the format, it is an hardware issue. Do you have any Seagate software installed?  If yes, completely uninstall it, then restart the mac, it is counterproductive.  If no: when there is not something wrong with the format, it is an hardware issue.  <answer244733> If you click "mount" is it still grayed out?   Are you sure that the OS X Finder setting checkbox for  external hard drives is enabled?  <comment301579> Sounds like a case of a faulty drive to me. Is the format drive option available?
