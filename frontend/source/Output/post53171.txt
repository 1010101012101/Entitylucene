How to set "Input Sources" for all users at the same time <body> In Lion OSX, changing the keyboard layout "Input Sources" setting in the "Language &amp; Text" only changes the setting for the current user. Is there a way to populate the setting to all existing, and also all future new users to the same set of language keyboard layouts?  <answer53365> The default input source is set in code~/Library/Preferences/ByHost/com.apple.HIToolbox.*.plist/code (where code*/code is codesystem_profiler | grep 'Hardware UUID'/code).  You could either copy the file to other acccounts: codesudo cp ~/Library/Preferences/ByHost/com.apple.HIToolbox.*.plist ~/Users/username/Library/Preferences/ByHost//code.  Or add it to the User Template directory so that it will be included by default on new accounts: coded=/System/Library/User\ Template/English.lproj/Library/Preferences/ByHost; sudo mkdir -p "$d"; sudo cp ~/Library/Preferences/ByHost/com.apple.HIToolbox.*.plist "$d"/code.  Note that the UUID will have to be changed if the file is copied to another computer.  You can view or edit the property list in a text editor by converting it from binary to XML: codef=~/Library/Preferences/ByHost/com.apple.HIToolbox.*.plist; plutil -convert xml1 $f; open $f -a TextEdit/code.
