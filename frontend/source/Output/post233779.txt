Hide files of single extension from command line in Python <body> My script is as follows (and used to work but no longer does):  precode#!/usr/bin/env python # encoding: utf-8  import os, subprocess  path = "/path/to/dir/" # write your own path here hide_files = True  for root, dirs, files in os.walk(path):     for i in files:         if i.endswith(".asd"):             abspath = root + "/" + i             print i             subprocess.call(['chflags', 'hidden' if hide_files else 'nohidden', abspath]) /code/pre  All subprocess calls complete with 0 and all files I wanted to find are found. The issue is solely that Finder continues to show me these files.   I tried running and relaunching finder, no success there either.   Any ideas on what's going wrong?  <comment285682> Even on SO you need to give more information like does it find the file or just fail to process it etc Basically is there enough here for us to reproduce your problem <comment285704> It completes just fine, all processing is done successfully, and the return calls for each subprocess (OS) call is 0, indicating no errors. I'm just wondering if there is some Finder override I may have set or somesuch such that the chflags aren't being respected properly. <comment285733> What does `ls -lO` show
