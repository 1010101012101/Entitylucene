Printing PDF from Preview.app: Editable fields print larger than on-screen <body> I'm trying to print a PDF from preview. The original looks like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/TYfct.png" alt="enter image description here"  All of the text on the page is in editable fields. When I print it out, it appears like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/REzIl.png" alt="enter image description here"  I've tried printing the original to PDF and just printing on the printer. Both ways I get enlarged text. For now I've taken a screenshot and printed it however I get very muddy text this way and would like it to print normally so I get sharp text (especially at the smaller sizes)  How can I ensure when I print a PDF with editable fields it prints the scaled text like the first image to fit in the boxes?  An additional edit: When I replace the text in the boxes with actual text fields from the editing menu the font stays the correct size. It appears the editable text boxes are resizing weird. I also can't set the font size on that text - it always stays the same.  macOS 10.12.4, Preview 9.0 (909.17).
