No emergency alerts on iPhone <body> I have "Emergency Alerts" enabled on my iPhone, but I do not receive alerts on it. Emergency alerts are enabled, but Amber alerts are off. I know that some alerts have gone out today because I have an older iPhone that doesn't have phone service but which does still receive emergency alerts. What do I need to do to get alerts on my regular phone? I tried turning them off and back on, but it didn't help.  The phone that doesn't get emergency alerts is an iPhone 6 using T-Mobile (USA) and running iOS 9.3.2. The one that does get alerts is an iPhone 4s running iOS 8.something, formerly used on AT&amp;T and T-Mobile, but which doesn't have any current mobile service. Both phones connect to wifi at my house, if that matters.  <answer251047> Apple support suggested the following:  ol liDisable emergency alerts/li liReboot the phone/li liRe-enable alerts./li /ol  This worked. I don't know why I wasn't getting them, but I get them now.  <comment301353> If both iPhones are signed-in with your Apple ID, could the 4S be responding in place if the 6?  I don't have emergency alerts turned on so I'm not sure how that works. <comment344818> This just worked for me!
