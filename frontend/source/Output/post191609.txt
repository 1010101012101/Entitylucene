How to create a .app folder from an executable .jar? <body> Just this. I have an executable jar that I'd like to create a .app folder for. Mainly just because I'd like it to be pinnable to the dock.   Is there any easy way to do this?  Edit: Really what I'm looking for, is a mac shortcut. But apparently on the .app folders can be pinned to a dock.  <answer191614> Do you have access to the source?  If so, you can try the codeappbundler/code.  https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/jweb/packagingAppsForMac.html  Or the Jar Bundler: https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Java/Conceptual/Java14Development/03-JavaDeployment/JavaDeployment.html  <answer191653> If you want an easy way without need of third-party apps:  ol liLaunch strongAppleScript editor/strong/li liWrite the following:  code--do shell script "java -jar /Contents/execute.jar"/code/li /ol  I commented that line out because we have yet to put the jar there. Save as application. Now Right click on produces strong.app/strong file - Show Package Contents, go to strongContents/strong and drag the strong.jar/strong file there. Now go to strongResources/strong - strongScripts/strong - strongmain.scpt/strong and open that. Now remove the double dash (code--/code), compile and save.  If it doesn't launch, try executing in terminal codechmod 777 &lt;path to jar file&gt;/code simply drag the jar into Terminal.  <answer191675> Take a look at Packr.  I think it does exactly what you need https://github.com/libgdx/packr.  <answer266726> How about Platypus?! It can pack "all" kinds of things, jar, py, script etc download from http://sveinbjorn.org/platypus, its GUI is relatively easy to follow. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6ljoN.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment227626> Thejar bundler was for Java 6 and earlier and is not,available now <comment227645> Someone please dit my question. do shell script didn't want to go to code blocks after quadruple space <comment227668> Question: how do I do this from the terminal? <comment227670> You launch the jar from terminal by writing `java -jar /path/to/jar.jar`. However this answer covers launching it as an app. Basically, making a script that executes shell that launches jar inside the app bundle. <comment227671> No I mean, how do I  run this applescript from the terminal? <comment227672> Wait, I think I figured it out. I add the line to a script called my_script.scpt. And run it from the terminal with osacript my_script.scpt . I'll mark this answer as correct once I test it out. Thanks! <comment227673> `open /path/to/java.app` Or simpler double click it. You can open any app with the open command. <comment227676> Well it turns out this doesn't solve my problems. .scns scripts aren't pinnable to the dock as applications, and you can't change their icons. They do no better than just double clicking the jar in the first place. <comment227678> Yep, this is unusable for me. <comment227679> I guess I will re-arrange my answer ince I am at my mac to better mach your needs. <comment227721> Note this also adds the ire to the bundle - which might or might not be wanted <comment332408> Pretty helpful answer, however I needed to place the full path from the root of my machine to get this to work for me. <comment334476> Welcome to Ask Different!
