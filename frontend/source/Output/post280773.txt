What is the right way to deploy Apps to Apple Store for other companies or organizations <body> So, I opted for Apple Developer Program last year and planned to make my first app for one of the X company. I thought it would be best to have all the Apps under one roof if I am developing them. So I can manage them with ease.   But when I tried to publish the app for the first time it went through. I was able to deploy X company app (version 1.0.0) using Apple Developer Program but then when I tried to deploy it again with some changes (version 1.0.1) I couldn't.   I was told, I cant deploy X company app with this program. X company can buy particular program and add me as a Developer to their account and I can work on it. But I have seen many IT companies deploying IOS App for other X companies under their name, they manage and maintain X companies apps.  I have been looking for that specific program. What is it called?  Also, one more Question  Can I deploy X list of companies App on my Account without owning an IT company?  <comment353167> You get 2 free Apple Developer Support requests with your Program membership so you should use one of them.  They will be able to tell you exactly what the problem is and how to fix it.  Have you contact them about this? <comment353168> @fsb No, I haven't used it. I would like to use it. How to use those? also, I found this page : https://developer.apple.com/support/compare-memberships/ I guess I fall under the category of Organizations?
