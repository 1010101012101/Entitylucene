How is the "Memory" column calculated in Activity Monitor? <body> How is the per-process "Memory" column calculated in Activity Monitor? The name is quite vague and I haven't found anyone say anything about it aside from stuff like, e.g., "Memory used in RAM." I can't quite tell the relation between it and real memory, shared memory, private memory, dirty memory, etc.  FYI, I'm talking about this column:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hrgdt.png" alt="Memory column"  <answer284466> The codeMemory/code column is overall memory consumption, excluding compression, etc. going on.  The codeCompressed Mem/code column is how much memory is being saved by the operating system's memory compression algorithm.  The codeReal Mem/code column essentially shows codeMemory/code - codeCompressed Mem/code to give you an idea of how much actual memory is being consumed by the process.  codePrivate Mem/code shows you how much memory is being consumed by this particular process that is not being shared by any other processes and of course then codeShared Mem/code would be what's being shared with other processes.  As far as actually tracking the memory consumption itself, I would have to dig a bit more into the developer documentation as I don't know off the top of my head how Xnu/Darwin tracks memory consumption on a per process basis to actually report such figures.  Please let me know if you're looking for any additional details or clarification as your previous question is slightly vague with regards to whether you're seeking specific acquisition details or just what the columns mean...  <comment358934> So, to be clear, I'm just interested in understanding what that column means / how those numbers in it are obtained. I already grok `Private Mem`, `Shared Mem`, `Compressed Mem` et al. Yet, I don't grok exactly what `Memory` represents since it is obviously distinct from `Real Mem`, which is supposed to be the de facto memory consumption of a process, according to my understanding. Could you be more specific as to what makes it distinct from `Real Mem` than simply: "The `Memory` column is overall memory consumption, excluding compression, etc. going on." ? <comment358935> Also, this point: "The `Real Mem` column essentially shows `Memory` - `Compressed Mem`" seems untrue since my `Compressed Mem` is almost always at 0, yet the `Real Mem` is always higher than `Memory`. <comment359269> Only Apple knows
