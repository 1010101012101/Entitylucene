Preview won't remember the last viewed page of PDF <body> When I open a PDF file that was viewed days ago, Preview will open the first page.  However, when I close it and open it again right now, it will open the right (last viewed) page.  The option codeStart on the last viewed page/code was checked.  <answer210205> Upgrade from Yosemite to El Captain could mess up the preference files. Delete the folder strong/Users/{user name}/Library/Containers/com.apple.Preview/strong to reset settings.  <comment247721> Can you (as user) and/or Preview.app write to the directory where your document resides? <comment247732> @MaxWyss Yes, I can edit the PDF file with Preview and save it in place.
