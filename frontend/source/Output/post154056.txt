Error: Could not symlink bin/dvipdf when installing Octave <body> Note: A question similar to this one was asked here about a week ago.  I am attempting to install Octave on OS X Mavericks.  I ran the following:  precodebrew install octave /code/pre  which resulted in this error:  precodeError: You must `brew link ghostscript' before octave can be installed /code/pre  So I followed this advice, which gave this output:  precodeLinking /usr/local/Cellar/ghostscript/9.15...  Error: Could not symlink bin/dvipdf Target /usr/local/bin/dvipdf already exists. You may want to remove it:   rm /usr/local/bin/dvipdf  To force the link and overwrite all conflicting files:   brew link --overwrite ghostscript  To list all files that would be deleted:   brew link --overwrite --dry-run ghostscript /code/pre  I ran the last option, which printed a really long list of files.  I think these files might be related to my recent install of emMacTeX/em, which worries me.  <comment221941> I have a similar issue (although not installing Octave, but have the brew conflict with ghostscript).  You're right that it has to do with MacTex, but I am not sure the best answer, as I stumbled across this question to also try to solve my own issue.
