Get my computer's current city and state from terminal <body> How can I get my computer's location to the granularity of codecity/code and  codecountry/code using the command-line?  I know I could get the IP of the correct network interface and do an IP lookup but I wonder if the system has a quicker way to access this. The system clock has the location so I am wondering if it's possible to get it that way.  <answer183233> h1Command line tool/h1  I've made quick modification to an excellent robmathers app strongWhereAmI/strong. You can find it on my github.  Once You compile it and run, that's the output:  precodeLatitude: 40.714232 Longitude: -73.9612889 Accuracy (m): 65.000000 Timestamp: 30.04.2015, 11:37:45 CEST Location: 277 Bedford Avenue, Brooklyn, NY 11211, United States /code/pre  If You want only the city and the country - changes in parsing json should be made (or codegrep/code the output). Sample json data can be found here.  subNote: This is very quick implementation, but there shouldn't be any errors/sub  h1Info from preferences/h1  You can get info from preferences by running:  precodedefaults read /Library/Preferences/.GlobalPreferences.plist com.apple.preferences.timezone.selected_city /code/pre  You'll need to parse the output, because it looks like:  precode{ CountryCode = PL; GeonameID = 3081368; Latitude = "51.1"; LocalizedNames =     {     pl = "Wroc\\U0142aw"; }; Longitude = "17.03333"; Name = "Wroc\\U0142aw"; Population = 634893; TimeZoneName = "Europe/Warsaw"; Version = 1; } /code/pre  <comment218381> Well, this is awesome, but requires the internet. If I use that, I figure I might as well do an old-fashioned IP lookup. This is more accurate, I take it? <comment218410> As far as I know, there's no offline database with locations assigned to lat/lon. The only thing I found is: `/System/Library/PreferencePanes/DateAndTime.prefPane/Contents/Resources/TimeZone.prefPane/Contents/Resources/all_cities_adj.plist` but that's only capital cities (?) list. <comment218412> My clock does already know it's locale in order to set a time zone. Usually it even has the correct city. It knows this with or without internet connectivity, it just won't update the location without the internet. <comment218422> @SimplGy the info is stored in `defaults`, updated the answer <comment218970> That is so awesome!
