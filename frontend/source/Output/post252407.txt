All Qt applications look horrible in OSX El Capitan with Retina Display <body> I have a retine display macbook, and a lot of applications that are based on Qt look horrible, with low resolution text, images, etc. Everything is blurred.  For instance, QGIS.  The applications I develop with Qt are also very blurred.  Why is this happening?  <comment314061> Take a look at [this question](http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/75882/88313) and see if the answer works for you.
