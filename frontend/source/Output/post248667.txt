Help with computer without mouse <body> I have a Mac computer I'm not sure exactly what type and it's not updated. All I have is one of the magic mouses or whatever and it won't connect without updating. In order to update I need to hit agree but I can click on it without a mouse. What do I do to hit agree and update it? (I have a keyboard)  <answer248668> Connect a USB mouse and you should be able to get online and accept any updates.   <answer248696> Try to access the Mac remotely. Better Touch Tool has an iPhone/iPad app that will let you control the mouse (a few dollars), or TeamViewer or another VNC client will let you control and see your Mac on a phone or other computer (free).  No guarantees you can install these without using the mouse, though.  <comment308187> Does tabbing do anything? <comment308188> Um idk I'm an idiot with computers. HAHAHA <comment308189> (By tabbing I mean pressing the `tab` key on the top left of your keyboard). <comment308191> Sorry I'm kinda stupid @ruddfawcett    Ha! <comment308192> Yeah no It's not doing anything <comment308193> This is the easiest way IMO (if you have a USB mouse, of course). <comment308194> Yeah I poked for one but can't find one. <comment308195> Looked*    God I can't type either <comment308197> Did you check the battery in your Magic Mouse?  Is it turned on? <comment308199> Yeah I followed exactly what the directions said but then it said I have to update it and now I'm stuck cause I can't hit the update button.  <comment308219> Try hitting the enter key when it asks you to agree. Also does your mac have a trackpad?
