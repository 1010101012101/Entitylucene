What are some useful keyboard language switchers that are designed to use with 3+ languages? <body> I've been using âŒ˜-Space for a long time, and it's been quite comfortable. However, recently I added third input language, and since then it's been a real pain to switch. What are some useful third-party OS X improvements that address this problem?  <comment106579> Could you describe in more detail what problem you are having? Having to type Cmd-Space several times by itself doesn't look like a huge issue at first sight. <comment106598> Right now, I have to remember which languages I've switched to before to understand how many times I have to press Cmd-Space, or hold it to view the menu. Either way is uncomfortable. It would be great to have separate shortcuts for each of the languages. <comment106600> This may have already been answered at http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/61250/bind-each-keyboard-layout-to-keys-combination <comment106646> You could also use [changeInput or KeyRemap4MacBook](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/80862/keyboard-shortcut-for-jumping-directly-to-a-specific-input-method).
