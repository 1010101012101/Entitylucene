This question is clearly about screen recording whilst the question you've mentioned is about "Airplay Mirror" for which answer is a free solution. <comment357010> I may have misjudged my duplicate flag. It's less that the question is duplicate and more so the accepted answer for both is a duplicate. Neither question is an *exact* duplicate, they're just fairly similar. <comment357011> In hindsight, it might be better if the other question is closed as a duplicate of this one. <comment357018> @StevenVascellaro Neither question is a duplicate of the other, screen recording and screen mirroring may have different solutions/answers.
