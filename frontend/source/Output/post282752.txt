Turning Power Chime Off <body> On new Macbook Pro, Power Chime runs. Whenever I delete from core services it comes right back. It makes a sound when plugging in your power cord even when the volume is at 0%.  The solution I have now to disable this annoying sound is an AppleScript application that runs on login to kill the process via terminal. Is there a better way?  <answer282761> You don't need to delete it, just switch it off.  From Terminal, type    precodedefaults write com.apple.PowerChime ChimeOnAllHardware -bool false; killall PowerChime /code/pre  To reverse that  precodedefaults write com.apple.PowerChime ChimeOnAllHardware -bool true; open /System/Library/CoreServices/PowerChime.app &amp; /code/pre  <answer282793> In case anyone wants my AppleScript I'm using to stop this:  precodetell application "System Events"     delay 3     set ProcessList to name of every process     if "PowerChime" is in ProcessList then         set ThePID to unix id of process "PowerChime"         do shell script "kill -KILL " &amp; ThePID     end if end tell /code/pre  But really looking for another way. Any help is appreciated. Thanks.  <answer282841> Here's another solution since the others provided don't seem to be working for you. You can create an empty AIFF file to replace the default chime. The  chime audio is located here:  precode/System/Library/CoreServices/PowerChime.app/Contents/Resources/connect_power.aif /code/pre  I created an empty AIFF file using Adobe Audition. With SIP disabled, I backed up the original chime and replaced it with my new audio file:  precodesudo mv /System/Library/CoreServices/PowerChime.app/Contents/Resources/connect_power.aif /System/Library/CoreServices/PowerChime.app/Contents/Resources/connect_power.aif_bak sudo mv ~/Desktop/null.aif /System/Library/CoreServices/PowerChime.app/Contents/Resources/connect_power.aif /code/pre  Be sure to fix the permissions on the file:  precodesudo chown root:wheel /System/Library/CoreServices/PowerChime.app/Contents/Resources/connect_power.aif sudo chmod 644 /System/Library/CoreServices/PowerChime.app/Contents/Resources/connect_power.aif /code/pre  No more audio when connecting your power source.  <comment356338> Apple Engineers: If I uncovered this, I feel like I should get a present from Apple. <comment356351> What's your address? I'll send you something. LOL Oh wait, maybe I should send it to Tetsujin? :) <comment356393> Negative. This did not work. Unless I'm doing something wrong. <comment356394> It also F'ed up my comp - setting the date to 2041 and then it fixed itself after stalling on a shutdown and manually rebooting...but thats beside the point. <comment356395> Also in my AppleScript, I'm not deleting it...im just killing process...is there another way? <comment356406> unfortunately idont think his solution works. <comment356412> https://www.howtogeek.com/274191/how-to-hear-a-chime-every-time-you-plug-in-your-macbook-pro-or-air/ and http://osxdaily.com/2015/04/15/play-chime-sound-effect-when-macbook-power-connects/ both seem to agree with me. I can't test as I'm on a Mac Pro .. i.e. no battery <comment356437> I'm not sure those articles apply here. They are somewhat dated (before new MBP came out) and they are talking about turning it on in a default off environment. Can anyone confirm that this works with the new MBP and that I'm just doing something wrong? Thanks. <comment356633> Confirmed the above does not work at all on new MBP. <comment356634> I'm going to leave the answer here until we get a second opinion, just in case it's an isolated occurrence.
