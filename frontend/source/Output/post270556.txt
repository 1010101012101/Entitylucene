How to "require an answer" in a dialog in AppleScript? <body> If one inserts an em"Ask for Text/em" action into their workflow in Automator, they will be presented with the option to em"Require an answer"/em of the user:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nujRF.png" alt="enter image description here"  If the user fails to provide an answer, the user cannot press the "OK" button. The computer will beep at the user if the "OK" button is pressed while the answer field is empty.  Is there a way to replicate this strongexact behavior/strong in AppleScript?   <answer270559> Yes, it can be accomplished like this:  precoderepeat   set myAnswer to the text returned of (display dialog "Your question goes here." default answer "")   if myAnswer is "" then     beep   else     exit repeat   end if end repeat /code/pre  Please let me know if this works for you.  hr  Second version that tells the user what the error is:  precoderepeat   set myAnswer to the text returned of (display dialog "Your question goes here." default answer "")   if myAnswer is "" then     beep     display alert "Please enter your answer to continue."   else     exit repeat   end if end repeat /code/pre  <comment340011> It's very close. The only difference is that I can press the "OK" button in your version; the dialog is refreshed if I press "OK". Is there no way to actually disable a button in AppleScript (like the _"Ask for Text"_ action disables "OK" when the field is empty)? <comment340012> It's not possible to disable a button in a dialog box created with AppleScript. You can accomplish that with Swift, though. <comment340017> Thank you. You can display an additional message using "display alert" to let your user know that an answer is required. <comment340019> Great idea. That way the user understands what was responsible for causing the refresh. <comment340029> See my second above.
