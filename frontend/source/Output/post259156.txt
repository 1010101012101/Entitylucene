How do I install macOS Sierra without additional languages (English only)? <body> I made a macOS Sierra USB installer using Install Disk Creator.app. I'm using MacBook Air (11-inch early 2014) with 120GB SSD, want to wipe &amp; install Sierra with OS using as little space as possible. also interested in this post about installing without Recovery partition: How do I uninstall the macOS Sierra Installer?  <comment324154> The recovery partition only takes ~650 MB and is an integral part of the OS and needed to perform some actions not able to be done while booted to the normal system startup disk. I would not remove it! As to language files, I have found from past experience that purging unused language files can cause issues that are not worth the space saved. If a 120 GB SSD is not enough, then consider replacing it with a larger one, if it's removable that it. <comment324167> On that model MBA, the SSD is replaceable (see OWC - www.macsales.com) for replacement SSDs or video tutorials
