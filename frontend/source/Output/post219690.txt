How to manually add ssh key to keychain? <body> In the past year I've been using codedsa/code keys to access several remote machines. On one of these machine, dsa keys have been deprecated so I simply switched to codersa/code. In doing so it seems that my key is not stored anymore in the codekeychain/code, so everytime I restart my computer I get asked for the passphrase.  To add the key I tried this:  precodessh-add -k .ssh/id_rsa /code/pre  But also this:  precode/usr/bin/ssh-add -k .ssh/id_rsa /code/pre  It works until the next reboot. If I open the keychain and look there for ssh I see the dsa key, the old one. Which would be the correct way to add the new one?  <answer219693> Try adding a new item in the keychain app by pressing the small + Button at the bottom. It should look like this.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YCxOG.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment266670> it didn't actually work. it keeps asking me for the passphrase <comment322098> Have you checked 1. That you entered the correct passphrase into keychain 2. The path to the key is correct
