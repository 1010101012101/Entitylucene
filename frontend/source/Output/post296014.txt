Unzip archive with WM97/Thus-Fam malware causing permissions error <body> I have an old zip file containing many Microsoft Word documents created in Word 2004. Recently, the Sophos antivirus software that my university requires for network access reported that this file was infected with the WM97/Thus-Fam malware. After determining from Wikipedia that this malware is only a risk to Windows computers running old versions of Office, I disconnected from the network and tried to unzip the file (my plan was to unzip, rescan the file to identify the specific word document that's infected, and then delete just that document).  I was unable to unzip the file with the built in archive utility, first due to "Error 1- Not permitted". Subsequently I changed the permissions to allow everyone to read and write, but now I get error 13-Permission denied.  I subsequently tried using terminal unzip -FF, and also tried a bunch of other "zip file repair" tools I found online. All of these have failed to extract the contents.  I read that there used to be a utility in usr/libexec called repair_permissions, but it no longer exists in Sierra. Is there anything else I could try to extract the files in this zip file? I'd also be interested if there are any security tips about preventing something like this from happening in the future (other than backups, which I now use, although sadly I did not at the time I made this archive).  In case it's useful, this archive was created on an older machine (I think a Macbook running Leopard if I remember correctly).  <comment373830> Two possibilities - either it's password protected or it's corrupt - you can try [The Unarchiver App](https://theunarchiver.com/) to see if you can open it. <comment373831> The Unarchiver says "The contents of [file] cannot be unarchived by The Unarchiver" <comment373832> It's most likely corrupt since Unarchiver  has much broader support for archives than what comes with macOS. <comment373834> I'm pretty sure it's a permissions issue (maybe that's included in "corrupt"), because all the error messages I've seen mention the permissions. Having said that I have made the permissions as permissive as possible and also tried running unzip and tar with Audi, and that didn't work. <comment373835> If it is corrupted, is there any way to recover it? <comment373837> I'm assuming the file was copied to your local device, correct?  What directory?  You also have admin level privileges to take ownership of the file?  That being the case, there are no more permissions to give it. <comment373871> Have you told Sophos to allow the file as an exception? Otherwise it may still have a hold of it.
