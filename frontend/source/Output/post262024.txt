After Changing Partition Type From FFFF I Can't Boot <body> I originally asked the following question: Partition Type: FFFFFFFF-FFFF-FFFF-FFFF-FFFFFFFFFFFF Macbook Pro about how to change my partition type from an unknown to a normal one, since it was unmountable.   I was able to and I can now view all of my files, however I cannot boot from it. When I tried verifying it with Disk Utility I received the error:Invalid Disk Label @ 4096: cksum mismatch, and when verifying the partition I get the same error.  After Googling, I found that this was most likely caused by a bad installation of the OS. So  I tried to reinstall the latest version of Mac OS Sierra, until the installer said "This disk cannot be used to start up your computer." Here is all of my info:   precodesh-3.2# cd /Volumes/Internal/ sh-3.2# ls -la total 72       2 drwxr-xr-x   35 root          wheel   1258 Nov  6 22:02 .   13744 drwxrwxrwt@   5 root          admin    170 Nov 22 11:55 .. 3976587 -rw-rw-r--    1 root          admin  15364 Nov 22 10:53 .DS_Store  448963 d--x--x--x   10 root          wheel    340 Nov 22 11:52 .DocumentRevisions-V100 4414129 -rw-r--r--    1 root          wheel    591 Nov  6 22:01 .OSInstallerMessages  458404 drwxr-xr-x@   2 root          wheel     68 Nov 20 16:57 .PKInstallSandboxManager-SystemSoftware      20 drwx------    5 root          admin    170 Oct  8 13:08 .Spotlight-V100  498780 d-wx-wx-wt    3 root          wheel    102 Oct  8 18:29 .TemporaryItems      26 d-wx-wx-wt@   2 root          wheel     68 Nov 22 11:52 .Trashes 3976588 ----------    1 root          admin      0 Jul 30 14:32 .file      24 drwx------   11 root          admin    374 Nov 22 11:52 .fseventsd 3976589 drwxr-xr-x@   2 root          wheel     68 Nov  6 21:57 .vol 3976590 drwxrwxr-x+ 141 root          admin   4794 Nov 20 18:44 Applications 2719236 drwxr-xr-x    4 root          wheel    136 Oct 29 12:18 EFI 4051944 drwxr-xr-x+  63 root          wheel   2142 Nov 12 12:19 Library 4082330 drwxr-xr-x@   2 root          wheel     68 Nov  6 21:57 Network 3976557 drwxr-xr-x@   4 root          wheel    136 Nov  6 21:53 System 1961160 drwxrwxrwx@  13 Thoughtyness  staff    442 Oct 16 01:28 Twixtor5 1962231 drwxrwxrwx@   9 Thoughtyness  staff    306 Oct 16 01:28 Twixtor5AEManual  412912 drwxr-xr-x    6 root          admin    204 Nov  6 22:02 Users  412916 drwxr-xr-x@   4 root          wheel    136 Nov 20 20:58 Volumes 4394376 drwxr-xr-x@  38 root          wheel   1292 Oct 21 04:07 bin 4394413 drwxrwxr-t@   2 root          admin     68 Nov  6 21:57 cores 4394414 dr-xr-xr-x@   2 root          wheel     68 Nov  6 21:57 dev 4394415 lrwxr-xr-x@   1 root          wheel     11 Nov  6 21:56 etc -&gt;

My only idea would be to create a second partition, install Mac OS Sierra on that, slowly start copying files and resizing the partition until all of my files would be on the new partition, qt which point I could delete the current one and just use the second one, however I'm sure there's got to be a better way.   <answer262037> Your CoreStorage Logical Volume Group or better: the comprised Logical Volume is missing a proper volume header. Usually the volume header starts at the 1024th Byte of a partition and has a length of 512 Bytes.   With other words:  your volume is missing a 3rd block with a content similar to this one:  precode0000400 48 2b 00 04 80 00 21 00 48 46 53 4a 00 00 01 ff 0000410 d1 98 a4 93 d4 33 8b d5 00 00 00 00 d1 98 88 73 0000420 00 06 07 53 00 01 82 39 00 00 10 00 00 fb 6a 00 0000430 00 c5 1c 55 00 25 73 c7 00 01 00 00 00 01 00 00 0000440 00 0d e2 65 00 3e a2 fb 00 00 00 00 02 20 00 fb 0000450 00 00 00 31 00 06 b9 ef 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 0000460 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 31 fb 48 1e a0 6c 47 a2 9f 0000470 00 00 00 00 00 1f e0 00 00 1f e0 00 00 00 01 fe 0000480 00 00 00 01 00 00 01 fe 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 0000490 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 * 00004c0 00 00 00 00 00 60 00 00 00 60 00 00 00 00 06 00 00004d0 00 00 0a 00 00 00 06 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00004e0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 * 0000510 00 00 00 00 0e 40 00 00 01 30 00 00 00 00 e4 00 0000520 00 00 10 00 00 00 e4 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 0000530 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 * 0000560 00 00 00 00 11 d0 00 00 01 30 00 00 00 01 1d 00 0000570 00 02 80 00 00 00 72 00 00 13 30 97 00 00 13 00 0000580 00 15 c5 aa 00 00 13 00 00 18 2d 23 00 00 13 00 0000590 00 19 d8 fb 00 00 13 00 00 1b 76 cb 00 00 13 00 00005a0 00 1c 34 70 00 00 13 00 00 1d 0e 4d 00 00 13 00 00005b0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 * 0000600 /code/pre  The volume header of your volume contains zeros only.  Without direct disk access I can guess the reasons only:  ul limaybe the volume was "repaired to bits" by codediskutil repairDisk disk0/code or  codediskutil repairVolume disk0s1/code (unlikely)/li lia wrong strongalternate/strong volume header filled with zeros replaced the proper volume header/li lithe partition map of the disk was manipulated accidentally (e.g. trying to delete the Debian partitions, you also deleted the macOS recovery partition or the macOS recovery partition and the CoreStorage container have been fused)./li /ul  hr  To further diagnose the disk it would require direct access (e.g. via TeamViewer) to check various invisible disk structures. It's too difficult and lengthy to answer all possible circumstances comprehensively without disk access.  Examples how lengthy solution processes are (these are strongno/strong answers to your question):  ul liBootCamp Partition Error!! Help. Deleted EFI Partition/li liMissing Mac partitions - unrecognized file system/li /ul  As an alternative you can try to rsync the content of the volume to an external disk. With the proper options set the external volume should be bootable afterwards.

How may I fix this problem? <comment328230> @Thoughtyness It depends on how you "deleted" the recovery partition. You can try to restore it by unmounting disk0: `diskutil umountDisk disk0` and add it with: `sudo gpt add -i 3 -b 879448768 -s 1269536 -t 426F6F74-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC disk0`. But I don't think the **missing** Recovery HD is the problem. <comment328233> I'm pretty sure I deleted it in Mac Os X Utilities, as for the commands I did them yet on the second one received this error:"gpt add: unable to open device 'disk0': Resource busy". I trust your judgment in thinking that isn't the cause, so I won't pursue that. I do however think it might have something to do with the fact that I have a 500gb ssd yet ~50gb si missing. In Disk Utility is says 49.87gb partition is "Free Space". Yet it's not part of the only partition and I can't create a partition in its place, nor can I delete it. Here's a screenshot: http://bit.ly/2gjyvPG <comment328236> @Thoughtyness Oh I forgot: first eject "Internal", then retry with `diskutil umountDisk disk0` and `sudo gpt ...`. The unallocated 50 GB are the deleted Recovery HD and the deleted 2-3 Kali partitions (swap, / etc). <comment328625> I have since tried to reinstall the OS from the Mac OS X Utilities, however since I have Mac OS Sierra installed on the partition and for some reason I have Mac OS X utilities  I can't do a reinstall from there. I checked, and between my two hard drives and 3 flash drives I don't have enough storage to back up all of my files and do a full reinstall. Also after delving deeper into my system files I found that a lot of them had the wrong permissions set to them. Is there a way I can, if you want me to, send you my TeamViewer info?
