Continuous Volume with different disk models <body> A) Can I retroactively add a disk to a continuous volume?  B) Is there a problem with using different kinds of disk models in a continuous volume? They are all SSDs. I am thinking since it is not RAID and that the same data isn't typically accessed concurrently from both disks (at least in what I'm doing, which is storing and retrieving photos) then the volume won't be slowed down by the marginally slowest disk, and again, they are SSDs on Sata2/USB3.0  <comment261859> Disk Utility breaks any kind of Raid or Span if you try to change it.  I think you will need to use the Terminal to accomplish. <comment261896> @ArchonOSX and how would I do this in terminal? <comment261909> I have no idea. I abandoned RAID, JBOD, and spanning since it is too complicated for what I need. I had a hardware RAID set that puked and took down 8TB of my video vault. So, now I run 6 volumes with 6 mirrored backups and don't worry about losing a disk since I always have a spare. If all you need is a data security then mirrored backups is the way to go.
