Are there any directories of the official icons used in macOS? <body> Things like the share sheet, the forwards and backwards glyphs, the magnifying glass, etc. are standard across macOS.  Is there any official repository of these glyphs? It would seem to be extremely useful.  <comment347045> A lot of these are in the Apple Symbols font, starting around glyph 3875, but I don't know if that is what you want, or how complete it is. <comment347076> You may also simply search all files ending in ".png" inside the /System folder. If you're using the latest alpha of `Find Any File`, you can then even see the results as images, browsing through them quickly. <comment347206> No need for any 3rd party software, Finder will show the results as images too, in Icons or Cover Flow mode.
