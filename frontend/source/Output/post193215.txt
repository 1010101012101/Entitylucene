Unable to tap on Apple ID in app store iphone 5s <body> I am using iPhone 5s. I checked on various site on how to sign out of apple id in app store, but I am unable to select the apple Id since it is coming in grey color (normally it is shown in blue). I also have my restriction off in general settings. Because of this error, I am also not able to download anything from app store in my iPhone. My apple Id account is already verified and I have checked it twice on net.  <answer193221> Trying to codereset all settings/code works.
