Unable to turn off Voice Control on ios 10.2/10.2.1 <body> I have followed the instructions to turn off Voice Control here:  http://appletoolbox.com/2016/12/disable-voice-control-for-good-on-your-iphone-how-to/     Tap on Settings  General Choose Accessibility followed by Home Button   Switch off the “Press and Hold to Speak Option” here   But Voice Control still comes up.  This is bad news: I can not make phone calls - they get cut off by this Voice Control that will not die.  This was happening on 10.2 . I upgraded to 10.2.1 to see if would make a difference: but no change in behavior.  Note I also tried the older workaround described here:     A popular workaround for those not on iOS 10.2 was to change the   language for Siri. Tap on Settings - Siri. Enable Siri and then   change the language to “Hebrew”. Turn off Siri. When you pressed the   Home button for a little too long, the Voice Dialing wouldn’t happen.   That also did not work:  Siri was trying to interpret all audible inputs as hebrew  - and I still did not have control of my phone back.  <comment343315> This seems like a great time to talk to Apple Support at https://getsupport.apple.com. If they don't help, report back here!
