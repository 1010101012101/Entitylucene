What are the differences between LaunchAgents and LaunchDaemons? <body> On macOS 10.12.5, I only see LaunchAgents in the Users Library directory. Are the agents only invoked if a user is logged in?  ul li/Library/LaunchAgents//li li/Library/LaunchDaemons//li li/System/Library/LaunchAgents//li li/System/Library/LaunchDaemons//li li/User/emusername/em/Library/LaunchAgents//li /ul  <answer290946> Yes, codeLaunchAgents/code are only invoked when the user logs into a graphical session.  codeLaunchDaemons/code are typically launched when the system boots and are run outside of a specific user session.
