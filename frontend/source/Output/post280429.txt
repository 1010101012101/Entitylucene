Google Authenticator on iPhone 7 can not edit/remove entries <body> I have been handed this phone from my workplace and have to use it. In the past I installed the Google Authenticator app on Android Nougat and it was working in all aspects.   Now I added some accounts on the iPhone side and removed them from Android to prevent confusion. But I accidentally moved one of my personal accounts to my work iPhone. I need to delete it from iPhone and relocate it back to Android instance.   For the life of me, I can not find a edit button or any other gesture that can help me edit/remove entries on the iPhone side. Can someone help ?
