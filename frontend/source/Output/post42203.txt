How can I batch convert image files and PDFs to TIFF? <body> I have a lot code.jpeg/code, code.png/code and code.pdf/code Files and I want to convert all of them to code.tiff/code all at once.  How can I do this?  <answer42208> h1Automator/h1  You can batch convert these files by:  ol liOpen strongAutomator/strong from code/Applications/code/li liCreate a new strongWorkflow/strong/li liDrag the strongGet Specified Finder Items/strong to the workflow builder./li liDrag the strongChange Type of Images/strong to the workflow builder. This will prompt you to add the Copy Finder Items action as a backup option. That's up to you./li liClick the strongAdd.../strong button in the Get Specified Items action and select all your picture files./li liSelect the desired image type in the Change Type of Images./li liClick the strongRun/strong button. /li liEnjoy your batch converted photos!/li /ol  In the end, your Automator window should look like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vlrnT.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer42223> However, the Automator solution by @Matt Love will not convert multipage PDF files to individual TIFFs. You would need to run two separate Automator workflows, one to convert PDF files to images and one to change the format of image files. As an alternative, you might consider using AppleScript with Mac OS X's built-in Image Events.  Unlike a simple Automator workflow, the script given below (syntax-colorized version here) converts images emand/em PDF files to TIFF, does error reporting and does not break down when failing to handle some files. Before running the script, select the files to be processed in Finder.  EDIT: For multi-page PDFs, only page 1 is converted.  precode# this script converts all PDFs and images selected in Finder # to the TIFF format and appends .tif to the file name  set t to (time of (current date)) tell application "Finder" to set sel to selection set errors to {} tell application "Image Events"     repeat with img_file in sel         try             set img_file to img_file as text             set img to open img_file             save img as TIFF in (img_file &amp; ".tif")             if (class of result) is not file then error "could not convert to TIFF"             close img         on error errMsg             set errors to errors &amp; ((name of (info for (img_file as alias)) &amp; ": " &amp; errMsg &amp; "\n") as text)             try                 close img             end try         end try     end repeat end tell  # error report set errcount to length of errors set msg to (((length of sel) - errcount) as text) &amp; " files converted to TIFF in " &amp; ¬     (((time of (current date)) - t) as text) &amp; " seconds.\n\n" if errors is not {} then     set msg to msg &amp; errcount &amp; " errors occurred: \n" &amp; errors as text end if display dialog msg /code/pre  <answer42233> I believe you could construct such a custom workflow using the commercial program GraphicConverter (US $40). You would use it a stand-alone program, but it also has certain functions that can be used in Automator workflows.  Here is some information from GraphicConverter's page explaining their batch processing image editing functions.     strongBatch conversion with additional functions/strong       GraphicConverter offers you sophisticated batch  processing which   fully automates repetitive tasks applied to a selection of pictures:      ul   liConvert all the selected source pictures easily and quickly into a new format - regardless of whether there are 5 or 5,000 picture files;   you just define the type of conversion and set the details /li   liDuring the conversion process you can apply up to 60 additional batch functions such as rotation, resize, change the resolution, etc./li   liAutomate the removal of the Mac OS Ressourcefork before documents are uploaded if there are compatibility problems when the picture   files are placed in the internet /li   liCreate catalogs in HTML format for publication in the internet and adjust the colors, sizes, etc. to your individual requirements (see   examples)/li   liRename a selection of documents according to special criteria  quickly and easily/li   liJoin pictures together (e.g. for QuickTime VR)/li   liInsert or extract IPTC information into or out of a variety of  document formats /li   liand much more .../li   /ul   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2ptti.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer42246> precodefor i in *; do sips -s format tif $i --out $i.tif; done /code/pre  Bash.   <answer180903> On a Mac, you can also cd into the directory of your image, and use:  precodesips -s format tiff input.pdf --out output.tiff /code/pre  Source: http://www.mactricksandtips.com/2008/07/convert-images-using-terminal.html  <comment47995> The *Change Type of Images* Automator action, at least the version provided with OS X 10.7, **will** convert single page PDF documents to a TIFF file. I've edited the answer to say you can't use it on multi-page documents. I haven't decrypted the Applescript to determine how it works with multi-page documents. <comment47997> I would make one slight change—primarily a matter of preference. I would create this workflow as an application and eliminate the *Get Specified Finder Items* step. This would convert any image file, including single page PDF, or folder of image files, dragged onto the application icon into TIFFs. (Or, more properly said, make TIFF copies of all those files and place the copies on the Desktop.) This eliminates the need to pre-define the files to be converted and allows you to reuse the workflow for future conversions. <comment48003> Yeah, that works too. <comment48023> I love that sips ships with darwin / OSX! <comment48091> In Snow Leopard, the *Change Type of Images* Automator action does not process single-page PDFs either. The AppleScript converts PDFs to TIFF, but only the first page in multipage PDFs (thank you for pointing this out). <comment48092> As far as I know, *Image Events* is only an (AppleScript-enabled) application wrapper to the SIPS command line utility. <comment48149> I just checked on a Snow Leopard system and the *Change Type of Images* module **does** convert single page PDF files—at least according to the documentation. I will test the function later. <comment159884> Is it possible to set this up so you can run it from Finder without having to set it up every time? Like, right click file  Convert to PNG, or whatever? <comment369950> It should be `for i in *; do sips -s format tiff $i --out $i.tif; done`. Otherwise you'll get `Error: Unsupported output format tif`
