ios app certificate section access from itunes connect <body> I have created ios app for client and need to publish it. Client has a paid developer account and has added me as a codeTeam Admin/code in itunes connect whereas I do not have paid developer account.  But i still do not see section for creating certificates and profiles in itunesconnect.  1. Do i need to have a paid developer account to see that ?  2. Or what role should i be given so that i can access that section?
