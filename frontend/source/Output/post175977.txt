Preview image from pipe <body> I have a command line utility, let's called as: codeproduce_image/code. So i can do the following in the Terminal:  precode$ produce_image &gt; some.jpg $ open some.jpg #opens Preview.app /code/pre  also, I have codeImageMagick/code installed and codeXqartz/code too, so I can do the following:  precode$ produce_image | display #the display is a command from ImageMagick suite /code/pre  The above opens an X11 window with the image.  Is possible achieve such image-view as with codedisplay/code also with codePreview.app/code? e.g. looking for something like:  precode$ produce_image | Preview.app #of course, this isn't working $ produce_image | /Applications/Preview.app/Contents/MacOS/Preview #nor this /code/pre  Is possible preview the image with codePreview.app/code strongwithout/strong using intermediate file?  Ps: of course, I can create a command such codeosxdisplay/code  precodetmpfile=$(mktemp /tmp/foobar.XXXXXX) cat - &gt; "$tmpfile" open "$tmpfile" rm -f $tmpfile /code/pre  and use it as  precodeproduce_image | osxdisplay /code/pre  But the merit of the question is about opening images from a shell pipe without intermediate files.  <answer175981> Try  precodeproduce_image | open -a Preview.app -f /code/pre  (To be honest, I was quite surprised to learn that this works)  <comment207652> GREAT! Working! THANX! :) (Where is this documented?) <comment207653> I had a look at `man open` and then went to see whether `-f` also works for non-text documents. Tara! <comment207654> I'm simply blind! :( Somewhat missed the _ *-f**  Reads input from standard input and opens the results in the default text editor_ part. Thank again, you're THE Great! <comment278676> is there any way to do the same trick for HTML stream? <comment278696> @ab If you have a different question, feel free to ask it using the Ask Question button at the top right. Include a link to this question if it helps provide context. Also, please explain what you mean by "HTML stream". <comment279009> thanks for tips @patrix. By HTML stream I mean exactly the same situation as described in this answer, but instead of binary stream with image content the text stream piped to the Preview app like  `cat index.html | open -a Preview.app -f` I wrote `cat index.html` to illustrate. In my particular case this is a stream html output from markdown processor
