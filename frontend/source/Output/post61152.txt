Can you use Catleap display with MacBook Pro? <body> I've read several people doing this, but the ebay description page warns against using with a Mac.  For ex. - http://www.ebay.com/itm/New-YAMAKASI-CATLEAP-Q270-SE-27-LED-2560X1440-WQHD-DVI-D-Dual-Computer-Monitor-/140738200221?pt=Computer_Monitors&amp;hash=item20c4a6829d  It is contradictory and confusing to say the least. Have others used Catleap with success? ( any warnings ) ?  <answer61266> Ok, days of reading later; the answer is 'Yes' with following requirements  ul liNeed to output a native dual link DVI signal at 2560x1440 /li liNeed a mini Display port to Dual Link DVI ( Apple or Monoprice)/li /ul  <comment70556> I'm not seeing in the description where it recommends against using the display with a Mac. However, the question is why *wouldn't* it work with a Mac. A monitor is a monitor. As long as it can connect, it should work. Why would you think it wouldn't, (except for the warning)? <comment70561> the warning is midway through the desc. in a blue box.  i guess they're saying that to protect themselves.
