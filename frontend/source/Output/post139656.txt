Are there any iPhone podcast apps that synch with iTunes <body> Is there a podcast app that synchs with iTunes like the Apple podcast app?  I have a bunch of podcasts with various episodes that have been played/unplayed. Most podcast apps I've tried manage their own lists of podcasts and don't synch at all with my existing list in iTunes. I don't want to have to go and subscribe to those podcasts within a new app and go through marking which episodes I've already listened to.  <comment164695> Is your question related to software for iOS? Then you might improve your question - I searched for "Apple podcast app" and found iOS apps. Or are you searching for an Mac application? <comment164726> Ok, updated question - specifically iPhone/iOS
