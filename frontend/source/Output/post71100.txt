Send keyboard clicks FROM bluetooth phone TO Ubuntu <body> strongNote:/strong   This questions lies firmly between Ask Different and Ask Ubuntu so I will take solutions from the emApple/em site here and cross-post for emUbuntu/em answers on the other site.  strongMotivation/strong:  I've made a nice html presentation with reveal.js (a javascript framework for presentations) that works great locally. The presentation takes input from the keyboard (left, right, up, down arrows) that advance the slide accordingly. My 4G iPhone is discoverable via bluetooth and pairs up with Ubuntu 12.04.   strongQuestion:/strong  I'd like to control the presentation with my phone, which involves sending a keyboard stroke e.g. codeleft/code from my phone to my computer. Ideally this should be done emwithout an active internet connection/em, i.e. exclusively through bluetooth, though a wifi-solution may work.   From the emApple/em side:  ol liIs it possible to have my phone "send" keystrokes?/li liCan a bluetooth device listed as a "phone", be used a keyboard?/li liDoes the question change if a connection over wifi is possible (say some ssh tunnel)?/li /ol  strongRelated:/strong  Corresponding Ask Ubuntu site question.
