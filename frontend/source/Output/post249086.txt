Intermittent AirPort issue on MacBook Pro Early 2015 <body> I have an Apple MacBook Pro Early 2015, with AirPort issues.  The problem is extremely complex, but effectively it means I get page time out intermittently.  ul liI've reinstalled macOS from scratch, without backup, twice./li liThe issue only happens on Wi-Fi./li liIt happens when on WPA Personal Wi-Fi, but not Enterprise, unsure about Unsecured and WEP./li liIt happens on 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz on any wireless channel, regardless of interference./li liI can still ping local devices, but HTTP requests to the router's config page for example do not work, and internet requests either./li liIt isn't DNS related as I've tried 3 DNSs and tested with IP addresses/li liThere is no Firewall, or tools like LittleSnitch running/li liI can see when the issue occours by pinging 8.8.8.8/li liOther devices on the same internet connection both wired and wireless are unaffected./li liThe issue is resolved by a reboot./li liI've reproduced this at other locations, as well as trying a new Router from my ISP, Virgin Media, and buying a Ubiquiti UniFi AP-AC-LR/li liWe've run Wireless Diagnostics, which Apple Engineering has looked at and not found anything./li liThey have changed the AirPort card/li liTried PRAM and SMC resets, and most the stuff on this thread: Wifi Keeps Dropping Macbook Pro 13in Retina Early 2015/li /ul  I'm completely out of ideas, Apple are refusing to replace the Mac, and my work colleague has the identical issue on a newer but same model of MacBook Pro.  Does anyone have any idea how to proceed, I have been waiting for Apple to deal with this and they seem to have no idea, what the issue is.  <answer269100> Resolved by upgrading to macOS Sierra.  <comment335568> Try to look at the traffic with [wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/). <comment335597> Updating to the latest major OS earlier this month was the solution.
