Make mac become more server <body> Take another system I use (for example CentOS). I use the following code to make it become server.  precode# No GUI systemctl set-default multi-user.target  # Enable SSH sudo systemctl start sshd /code/pre  It has two big advantages.  ol lidoesn't sleep/li lisaves power/li /ol  Can I do something similar in OS X?   P.S.  I know how to make it become available by other computer with ssh. I just want OS X not show any desktop environment just the cli.  P.S.2  The link Is there console mode in Mac OS X? didn't work for me in Ei captain, since I select name and password in system preference, and restart. I still get codelist of user/code(icon and username). The reason is codefilevault/code.  If I follow what the link said, I need to turn codefilevault/code off. That is not I want. See link Mac ignores &quot;Display login window as&quot; setting    Then I try to log out the current user and is able to use the function of codename and password/code. when I use code&gt;console/codeï¼Œ I can ssh to it  <answer228058> If you want to turn OS X, the emClient/em version, in to a strongServer/strong then you need to install OS X Server and configure it to meet your needs.  Add strongOS X Server/strong to your Mac from the Mac App Store for just $19.99.  <comment277982> I am sorry, but what exactly is the question? <comment277983> Why does it save power? <comment277984> I have flagged this question as 'very low quality' as it is unclear for me what the question is. <comment277989> A computer  doesn't become a server because the computer doesn't "go to sleep" and/or "saves power."  It is a server because it **serves** something; time, files, web pages, boot environments, etc.  What **exactly** are you trying to do? <comment278004> @CousinCocaine The main purpose is when I start mac, I don't want gui just command line shows
