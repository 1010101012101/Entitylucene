Delete key doesn't work in vim on iTerm2 <body> Firstly, I typed some thing on insert mode, like  pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"codeHello /code/pre  At this stage, if I didn't exit from insert mode, kbddelete/kbd works and can delete the whole word if I want.  If I quit insert mode, and open insert mode again, this codeHello/code can't be removed by kbddelete/kbd. But the newly typed in content can be removed.  I've renamed my .vimrc, problem still exits.  And I did some test on remote server through iterm, didn't encounter the same issue.  What could be the cause of this problem? How to fix it?  <answer174351> This is a feature of vim, although IIRC it wouldn't be enabled by default.  codebackspace/code is a setting in vim, and you can set three different parameters: codeindent/code, codeeol/code, and codestart/code  If you run code:help backspace/code, it will tell you:  precodeInfluences the working of `&lt;BS&gt;`, `&lt;Del&gt;`, `CTRL-W` and `CTRL-U` in Insert mode.  This is a list of items, separated by commas.  Each item allows a way to backspace over something:  value     effect indent    allow backspacing over autoindent eol       allow backspacing over line breaks (join lines) start     allow backspacing over the start of insert; CTRL-W and CTRL-U           stop once at the start of insert. /code/pre  The one that isn't set for you is codestart/code.  If you add codeset backspace=indent,eol,start/code to your .vimrc, you'll be able to backspace over anything in insert mode.  <comment203810> With 'delete' you mean backspace? Removing whole words in insert mode can be done with `Ctrl-W`, try that. If that does nothing, there's something wrong with your vim. I use iTerm 2 and have never had such problems. <comment203820> Yes, I can use `dw` or `dw`+`shift` in normal mode to delete words. But `backspace` and `ctrl` + `w` both don't work in the second situation I mentioned above. <comment203889> But you can use backspace on the normal command line outside vim? Very weird. <comment204133> @oarfish, yes, I can, and in remote server vim I don't have such problem, all just happens in a sudden. I can't get the clue for now. <comment205086> What vim version do you have? I have vim 7.4.481, and I can't reproduce the problem.
