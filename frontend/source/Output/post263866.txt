Today panel is white/disabled and unusable since upgrading to Sierra <body> The right side panel for me, is white and disabled. I do not see any settings that would cause this behaviour. How can I return to the working version of this panel? In particular, the World Clock widget is important to me and I currently can't use it.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZA71p.png" width="333" alt="notifications panel is white and disabled"  <answer268578> The problem has resolved itself. Apparently the solution is to wait.  <comment330687> Have you tried removing the widgets and adding them again (see https://support.apple.com/kb/PH25142 for more information on how to do it)? <comment330811> I did. Just tried again for good measure and the problem still exists.
