Double Fusion Drive Volume in Startup Menu after DIY Drive Fusion <body> After replacing the SuperDrive in my MacBook Pro I copied the Recovery HD to a USB stick and booted from it. Then I ran codediskutil cs create MacintoshFusionDrive /dev/disk0 /dev/disk1/code (SSD, HDD), reinstalled MacOS from the stick and migrated from my backup.  Unfortunately, I didn't think about keeping the Recovery HD, so I ran from the stick codediskutil cs resizeVolume/code on the logical volume and codediskutil cs resizeDisk &lt;UUID&gt; &lt;size&gt; "Recovery HD" &lt;size&gt;/code on the coreStorage disk of the HDD to make a new partition on wich I then copied the contents of my recovery stick.    Somehow the name of the recovery partition emonly in the startup menu (alt boot)/em was localized in German but I got rid of that by running codesudo bless --folder /Volumes/Recovery\ HD -label Recovery\ HD/code. I don't really understand why this happened and how that exact line solved problem. But all seem's fine now. Perhaps I accidentally copied the image on the drive back to the drive directly. Anyhow.  It remains to resolve the last oddity that in the startup hdd menu, there are two codeFusion Drive/codes wich emboth/em start up the system just fine. It's not a real problem but I would like to know what's causing this and how to get rid of the duplication.  precode$ diskutil cs list CoreStorage logical volume groups (1 found) | +-- Logical Volume Group 3D7E41ED-2D3B-4C46-A696-2C0C156B6BF6     =========================================================     Name:         MacintoshFusionDrive     Status:       Online     Size:         625672790016 B (625.7 GB)     Free Space:   154107904 B (154.1 MB)     |     +-&lt; Physical Volume B7097B08-1AD3-4AAA-BD1B-88BF5E0EF57E     |   ----------------------------------------------------     |   Index:    0     |   Disk:     disk0s2     |   Status:   Online     |   Size:     127691702272 B (127.7 GB)     |     +-&lt; Physical Volume 12F98EE5-AE4C-4A14-8276-7915BCD06999     |   ----------------------------------------------------     |   Index:    1     |   Disk:     disk1s2     |   Status:   Online     |   Size:     497981087744 B (498.0 GB)     |     +-&gt; Logical Volume Family 5E001AF2-DE08-46C2-A1DA-5637AB534553         ----------------------------------------------------------         Encryption Status:       Unlocked         Encryption Type:         None         Conversion Status:       NoConversion         Conversion Direction:    -none-         Has Encrypted Extents:   No         Fully Secure:            No         Passphrase Required:     No         |         +-&gt; Logical Volume AC804BCD-419F-4AA0-AE01-1C7D25FF3949             ---------------------------------------------------             Disk:                  disk2             Status:                Online             Size (Total):          619999997952 B (620.0 GB)             Conversion Progress:   -none-             Revertible:            No             LV Name:               Fusion Drive             Volume Name:           Fusion Drive             Content Hint:          Apple_HFS   $ diskutil list /dev/disk0    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *128.0 GB   disk0    1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1    2:          Apple_CoreStorage                         127.7 GB   disk0s2    3:                 Apple_Boot Boot OS X               134.2 MB   disk0s3 /dev/disk1    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *500.1 GB   disk1    1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk1s1    2:          Apple_CoreStorage                         498.0 GB   disk1s2    3:                 Apple_Boot Boot OS X               650.0 MB   disk1s3    4:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             1.1 GB     disk1s4 /dev/disk2    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:                  Apple_HFS Fusion Drive           *620.0 GB   disk2  $ sudo gpt -r show disk1       start       size  index  contents           0          1         PMBR           1          1         Pri GPT header           2         32         Pri GPT table          34          6                   40     409600      1  GPT part - C12A7328-F81F-11D2-BA4B-00A0C93EC93B      409640  972619312      2  GPT part - 53746F72-6167-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC   973028952    1269536      3  GPT part - 426F6F74-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC   974298488    2212488      4  GPT part - 426F6F74-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC   976510976     262159            976773135         32         Sec GPT table   976773167          1         Sec GPT header $ diskutil info disk1    Device Identifier:        disk1    Device Node:              /dev/disk1    Part of Whole:            disk1    Device / Media Name:      Hitachi HTS545050B9SA02 Media     Volume Name:              Not applicable (no file system)     Mounted:                  Not applicable (no file system)     File System:              None     Content (IOContent):      GUID_partition_scheme    OS Can Be Installed:      No    Media Type:               Generic    Protocol:                 SATA    SMART Status:             Verified     Total Size:               500.1 GB (500107862016 Bytes) (exactly 976773168 512-Byte-Units)    Volume Free Space:        Not applicable (no file system)    Device Block Size:        512 Bytes     Read-Only Media:          No    Read-Only Volume:         Not applicable (no file system)    Ejectable:                No     Whole:                    Yes    Internal:                 Yes    Solid State:              No    OS 9 Drivers:             No    Low Level Format:         Not supported /code/pre  Please let me know, if anything else could be of help.  <answer258320> Had the same question... Fusion Drive utilizes a component of OS X called CoreStorage to work. When you boot your Mac holding down Option, you are booting into a screen running in the low-level EFI environment, before OS X has started. EFI doesn't understand what a home-built Fusion Drive is, but sees two physical drives capable of booting into OS X.  I'm not sure of the mechanics of why factory-built Fusion Drives in the latest Macs act differently but my guess is that there is a firmware chip of some sort, like you said. Apple is known to put custom firmware on some of their hard drives.
