How can you pause text to speech so that it restarts from where you left off? <body> I have a 40 page Pages document which is a transcript from a hand written diary.  I wish to use Text to Speech to read passages from my Pages document so that I can check the text against the original version.  This works well except that when highlighting a portion of text in the document and I wish to stop (pause) the Text to Speech it only starts at the beginning of the highlighted text and not restarting from the point of being paused.  If I use the start/stop keyboard shortcut in Text to Speech system preferences the situation is worse.  No matter if you have a highlighted portion of text it will restart from the beginning of the document!!  So the question is How to pause the text to speech process rather than stopping it?  <answer187628> You can select the part you want and let it read only that part  <answer247743> This is a feature people wanted for a long time but it never came. An alternative is to use voice over but it doesn't really allow you to read out loud the highlighted text, it has to be the entire document. To activate it the default shortcut is command F5. You have to enable it in setting, just search for voice over.  This is one other way. You can save the entire document as txt file and open it with any browser of yours, tested on chrome or safari. Select all and right click, then "add to itunes as spoken track." It will take a few minutes and then you will have an audio file you can play. Press pause key on the keyboard to pause or resume while reading.  <answer273435> add [[slnc 1000]] for pause of 1 second  add [[slnc 2000]] for pause of 2 seconds   and so on...  <answer293230> precodelet text = "Text you would like to hear with [[slnc 10000]] pause for 10 seconds. [[slnc 4000]]. It is AppleScript programming language" -- open it in Script Editor say text /code/pre  <comment206953> I have the same problem. In the previous versions of Pages, the text-to-speech hot keys would toggle between reading/not reading only the highlighted portion of text. Now a toggle restarts the reading from the top of the document. <comment206954> I've tagged this OS X, but please edit the question (and tags if needed) if you are using pages on iOS. Bonus points for adding the version of the OS too. <comment343750> How can this be done while reading a document?  Can you please edit your answer to address the problem indicated by the OP?
