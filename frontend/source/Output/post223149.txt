What is MacUpdaterSwift in my com.apple.loginitems.plist file? <body> I saw some strange entries in my Login Items, so I decided to do some digging in the associated com.apple.loginitems.plist file, and found something called MacUpdaterSwift. Google only gave me three search results, and none of them made sense. What is this?  <answer223150> After decoding the LSSharedFileList entry, I discovered this is from an Erlang install.
