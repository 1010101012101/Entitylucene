Notes have disappeared after update to iOS 10 <body> After I upgraded my iPhone 5c to iOS10.0.2 all my Notes have disappeared. Does anyone know how, if at all, I can get them back?  <comment318308> Where did you keep your notes, locally or within iCloud? Did you simply upgrade or did you re-install your phone? Did you re-enter your iCloud password when prompted to do so after the upgrade? <comment318688> Please answer the question from @patrix otherwise your question will get random and useless answers. <comment318702> Hi patrix as far as I know my notes were on my phone. If they were on the cloud I do not know how to retrieve them.  PJDS45
