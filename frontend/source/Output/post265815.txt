Spotlight search result for contact does not open found contact in Address Book <body> When I search for a contact in Spotlight (Cmd-Space), the correct contacts show.  When I select a contact (Enter), Address Book opens, but it has no contact selected. I have to look for the same contact again, this time in Address Book.  I use this all the time and am certain it used to work. Have tried rebuilding Spotlight index by removing Address Book from Spotlight and re-adding it.  Anyone else have this issue? Any suggestions for a fix?  <answer266805> I resolved it by brute force.  ol liOpen Spotlight in System Preferences./li liRemove everything except PDF./li liAdd my home folder to excluded items in Privacy tab./li liReboot./li liOpen Spotlight./li liRemove my home folder from excluded items in Privacy tab./li liAdd Contacts to items indexed by Spotlight./li /ol  Presto, it's working again. I hope it keeps working.  <comment334225> Are you sure the app that is launched is called Address Book? It should be called Contacts now. <comment334591> It's Contacts.app, butt responds to Address Book too.
