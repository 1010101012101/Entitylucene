Does Safari's history eventually get deleted? <body> I recently came across a folder in my computer called "History" with over 30 000 (!!) files. It seems that Safari was collecting a copy of every website I visit (probably to display it in the "history" menu...).  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jPt7t.png" alt="enter image description here"  Would this folder keep on growing if I didn't see it and delete its contents? What is the best way to clean it?  <answer240255> Your history is cleared automatically per your setting in (Safari) Preferences → General:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/TwF8C.png" alt=""  To clear your history manually, go to Safari → Clear History….                                img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/PAqYE.png" width="422"
