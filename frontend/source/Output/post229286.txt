"CMD + tab" makes me lose album view when switching back to iTunes <body> This behaviour is hard to reproduce and doesn't happen everytime. But I have been able to catch it happening with a screengrab.  I am playing an album in iTunes and have iTunes set to album view, then switch from iTunes to Safari (or another app, but Safari is used in this example) using codecmd/code then codeTab/code:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ig8vF.gif" alt="enter image description here"  Then I want to switch back from Safari (or another app) to iTunes, and sometimes, when I press codecmd/code + codeTab/code, the album view suddenly collapses and I get this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9ebGo.gif" alt="enter image description here"  It's very annoying because I have to press codeCMD/code+ codeL/code to get back to the song currently playing.  I am not sure why it does that - it's not everytime. It's not the behaviour I get when I only press codeTab/code or codecmd/code while in iTunes...  strongMac/strong: iMac with Yosemite.  strongiTunes/strong: 12.3.2.35  strongKeyboard/strong: French Apple extended keyboard.  <comment279707> I couldn't reproduce it and since you said it's hard to reproduce as it doesn't happen every time I suggest you edit your question and add what version of OS X and iTunes you're running and if there is anything else you can think of that's common when it does reproduce. <comment279712> Thanks, I will. I will also try and grab a screen capture at some point to share it in the question if I can. <comment281090> @user3439894 I just updated the question with GIF screen grabs
