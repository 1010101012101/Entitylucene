Cannot Log into FaceTime or iMessage <body> I am using VirtualBox to run OS X Mavericks. I cannot log into iMessage or use FaceTime. I have read online that it has something to do with the serial number not being present, but the problem is whenever I try to click About This Mac, I am logged out. How can I fix this?  <comment162639> did you also try this on VMWare? maybe its because of VirtualBox i last had some strange troubles using Virtualbox together with Linux Mint, after i have converted the whole machine to use in vmware there weren't any problems. <comment162640> Are you running VBox on OSX? What install method did you use? <comment162682> I haven't tried VMWare and I'm running it on Windows 7. I used the Niresh copy of Mavericks and installed it using the iso.
