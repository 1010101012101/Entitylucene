How can I toggle magic mouse one finger swipe pages gesture via terminal? <body> How can I toggle magic mouse one finger swipe pages gesture via terminal?  The command codedefaults write -g AppleEnableSwipeNavigateWithScrolls -bool NO/code triggers checkbox in System Preferences, but doesn't affect swiping gesture.  Checkbox toggle in System Preferences turns off swipe gesture instantly without need to restart magic mouse. I want to get same functionality from terminal.   <answer72861> After some research I found out that you have to manipulate codecom.apple.driver.AppleBluetoothMultitouch.mouse/code.  I found a config at github from okine which had the following code:   precode# Disable full-screen swipe (two-finger swipe) on Magic Mouse defaults write com.apple.driver.AppleBluetoothMultitouch.mouse MouseTwoFingerHorizSwipeGesture -int 0 /code/pre  This should work. Other options are  precodeMouseButtonDivision = 55; MouseButtonMode = OneButton; MouseHorizontalScroll = 1; MouseMomentumScroll = 1; MouseTwoFingerDoubleTapGesture = 3; MouseTwoFingerHorizSwipeGesture = 2; MouseVerticalScroll = 1; UserPreferences = 1; /code/pre  <answer73843> The one finger swipe gesture on the Magic Mouse is technically a scroll gesture and it can not be disabled, you can investigate the specifics further with my app NSMonitor.  To investigate the correspondence of ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.driver.AppleBluetoothMultitouch.mouse.plist entries with user interface elements in System Preferences what i do is save a copy of that file as xml, edit something in system preferences, save it again and compare the two.  <comment84609> I ask about 'one finger page swap' gesture (first checkbox in preferences). For example back/forward page in browser. Unfortunately `com.apple.driver.AppleBluetoothMultitouch.mouse` doesn't seem to have this option (correct option is in my original post which doesn't affect actual behaviour too, it just toggles first checkbox in Magic Mouse preferences). I guess there should be another command like "apply changed defaults to current workspace" which should actually do the work. <comment84614> I don't have a Magic Mouse but since there are no other options for a Magic Mouse to configure and the equivalent gesture on a trackpad is a two finger swipe I assume that it is the same setting or not possible. Have you at least tried it? <comment84635> Sure I tried, didn't work for me.
