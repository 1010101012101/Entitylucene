Error executing AppleScript through Launchd - "Service could not initialize" <body> I've written an AppleScript that turns our CenturyLink modem's wireless radio on or off. It works when I run it manually with osascript, but now I'm trying to get it set up on a schedule with Launchd. I keep getting the following error in the Console log:  precode10/11/15 3:10:03.178 PM com.apple.xpc.launchd[1]: (com.highintegritydesign.wirelessgenie[25674]) Service could not initialize: 14F27: xpcproxy + 13421 [1402][AD0301C4-D364-31CE-8BA7-B5DBECE64D0A]: 0xd /code/pre  The script is called wireless-genie.scpt and it's in my home directory, with permissions 755 and owned by me. I can successfully launch it manually from my home folder with:  precodeosascript wireless-genie.scpt mywirelessmodemadminuser mywirelessmodempassword /code/pre  The plist is called com.highintegritydesign.wirelessgenie.plist, shown below. I've placed that into /Library/LaunchDaemons, and it also has permissions 755, and is owned by root.   I've run strong'plutil -lint'/strong on com.highintegritydesign.wirelessgenie.plist and it says the plist is A-OK. I loaded the plist with strong'launchctl load com.highintegritydesign.wirelessgenie.plist'/strong.  I'm stumped why the script won't execute. Any ideas? Thanks.  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt; &lt;!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"&gt; &lt;plist version="1.0"&gt; &lt;dict&gt;     &lt;key&gt;Label&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;string&gt;com.highintegritydesign.wirelessgenie&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;key&gt;ProgramArguments&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;array&gt;         &lt;string&gt;osascript&lt;/string&gt;         &lt;string&gt;/Users/north/Documents/sites/wireless-genie/wireless-genie.scpt&lt;/string&gt;         &lt;string&gt;mywirelessmodemadminuser&lt;/string&gt;         &lt;string&gt;mywirelessmodempassword&lt;/string&gt;             &lt;/array&gt;     &lt;key&gt;StartCalendarInterval&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;dict&gt;         &lt;key&gt;Minute&lt;/key&gt;         &lt;integer&gt;10&lt;/integer&gt;         &lt;key&gt;Hour&lt;/key&gt;         &lt;integer&gt;15&lt;/integer&gt;     &lt;/dict&gt;     &lt;key&gt;StandardErrorPath&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;string&gt;/var/log/wirelessgenie.log&lt;/string&gt; &lt;/dict&gt; &lt;/plist&gt; /code/pre  <comment254001> Since you're putting the user/password in the .plist, have you tried coding it into the script to see if `launched` handles it any different?  Also just as a test I'd schedule it using `cron` to see how it handles it.  BTW you should include the version of OS X you're using in your post.  Maybe even the the AppleScript too. <comment254219> I'm on OS X 10.10.5, the Script Editor says its version is 2.7, and it's generating AppleScript 2.4. Yes, I've tried coding the same username/password into the script and it works fine. I have not tried cron. If that works it would definitely point the finger at the plist. But, that won't help be diagnose what's wrong with the plist. <comment254278> So if you coded the user/password into the script and `launchd` was able to start it okay, then what the issue?  Why can't you leave it that way instead of passing the user/password to the script?  It if does work with the user/password embedded in the script with `launchd` but not passed to it via `launchd` then the issue appear that you can't pass it via `launchd` and leaving it embedded is the way to go.  BTW when I said "_Maybe even the the AppleScript too_", I meant the actual AppleScript not its version number. <comment254301> Ahh, I see what you mean. I mis-understood. The script worked when I coded the user name and password into it, but ran it manually. I have yet to get it to work when executed through Launchd. <comment254304> The script is up on Github at https://github.com/northk/wireless-genie. <comment254309> Have you tried placing the AppleScript outside the Users Home Folder, like in `/Applications` and does `launchd` still fail to run it successfully?
