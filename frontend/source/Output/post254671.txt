Can I force an upgrade, in App Store? <body> I have one version of an app, and there's a new version.  I can see it in the App Store app, and it's free, and I meet the system requirements, and I'm signed in.  Yet the button under the app icon in the App Store just says "Open", and it opens the old version.  I don't see any way to upgrade, either on the app page, or the Purchased tab, or the Updates tab.  How can I force App Store to actually let me download the new version of the app?  Is there some cache I can clear?  <comment317057> Found a workaround: http://stackoverflow.com/a/31250643/6453879
