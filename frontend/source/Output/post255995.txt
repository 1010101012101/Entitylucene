Virtual Monitor "Off Screen" to Control Remote PC <body> I'm successfully sharing my Ubuntu Desktop with my Mac Book, using VNC.  My Mac Book Pro is on the right, my external monitor is in the center, and I have an Ubuntu Laptop on the left as in this image:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Clc0a.png" alt="Example of how my system is laid out."  While using the Mac, I'd like to be able to slide my mouse to the left of my centre external monitor, so I can think of the Ubuntu system as an additional monitor, as it were.   I have been able to do this from within Ubuntu in the past, by setting up a virtual monitor using "x2x -south -to :1"  I'm curious as to whether this functionality is possible using my Mac.  UPDATE:  I've found the following which are close, but "no-cigar" https://superuser.com/questions/276766/create-virtual-external-display-for-vnc-control  I've found the following software that might work, though not free: http://symless.com/synergy/  <answer256030> Synergy is still open source (therefore free), though they don't really go to great lengths to make that known.  https://github.com/symless/synergy  Synergy works pretty well from what I remember.  <comment319214> Want to accept soon, @tubedogg-- just having trouble compiling :-/ Mac SDK not found *grr* <comment319226> Found it in brew: brew install Caskroom/cask/synergy
