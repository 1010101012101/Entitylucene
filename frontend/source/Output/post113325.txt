Building netgen on Mac OS 10.9 - problem with tcl and tk <body> I am a very beginner in building from source on Mac. (It's my first request here...)  I am trying to build netgen and ngsolve.  Mac OS 10.9, Xcode 5.0.2, macports version 2.2.1  After installing tcl 8.6.1_0 and tk 8.6.1_1 from macports, I am getting this error:  precode/opt/local/include/tk.h:21:3: error: #error Tk 8.6 must be compiled with tcl.h from Tcl 8.6 or better  # error Tk 8.6 must be compiled with tcl.h from Tcl 8.6 or better    ^ In file included from ../../libsrc/include/incvis.hpp:4:0,                  from csgpkg.cpp:7: /opt/local/include/tk.h:21:3: error: #error Tk 8.6 must be compiled with tcl.h from Tcl 8.6 or better  # error Tk 8.6 must be compiled with tcl.h from Tcl 8.6 or better    ^ make[3]: *** [vscsg.lo] Error 1 make[3]: *** Waiting for unfinished jobs.... make[3]: *** [csgpkg.lo] Error 1 make[2]: *** [all-recursive] Error 1 make[1]: *** [all-recursive] Error 1 make: *** [all] Error 2 /code/pre  I used this script:  precode#!/bin/sh -f # Compile modules and install #  # install path export TOGL_HOME="/opt/local/share/Togl2.0-8.4" export NETGEN_HOME="/opt/local/netgen" export NGSOLVE_HOME="/opt/local/ngsolve"  # replace these with your compilers: - use compilers from HPC export CC=/usr/local/bin/gcc export CXX=/usr/local/bin/g++  # include GL/gl.h export CPPFLAGS="-L/opt/local/include" export CFLAGS="-I/opt/local/include" export CXXFLAGS="-I/opt/local/include" export LDFLAGS="-L/opt/local/include"  cd netgen-5.1 ./configure --prefix=$NETGEN_HOME --exec-prefix=$NETGEN_HOME  cd ngsolve-5.1 ./configure --prefix=$NGSOLVE_HOME --exec-prefix=$NGSOLVE_HOME /code/pre  Has anyone an idea how to get tcl/tk headers rebuilt properly or get past this compilation error?  <comment132977> Hi and welcome to apple.SE. I'm afraid that your question is too specific for this site as it is more about compiling Netgen than it is about Apple hard- or software. On top of that it is hard to read because of the (lack of) formatting, and hard to understand what steps you've taken. Have you tried asking your question at the [Netgen discussion forum](http://sourceforge.net/p/netgen-mesher/discussion/?source=navbar)? There people will probably have more specific knowledge.
