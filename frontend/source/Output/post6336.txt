How can I disable the Screen Saver on the login window? <body> How can I disable the Screen Saver on the login window?  <answer6377> The problem is that the login screen is not the result of the screen saver, I lock my Mac when I go out. The screen saver appears by itself, even if it is disabled from SysPref.  <answer6739> You can edit the .plist file at code/Library/Preferences/com.apple.screensaver/code either using a text editor, Plist Editor (requires the OS X Developer Tools) or the codedefaults/code command in Terminal to remove the screensaver at login window.  Like this:  precodesudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.screensaver loginWindowIdleTime 0 /code/pre  <answer74477> It isn't possible to disable the login screensaver in Mountain Lion due to a bug. According to https://discussions.apple.com/thread/4540671?start=0&amp;tstart=0 the best you can do is log into root's screensaver settings and change it to Message which uses less resources.  See https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/16515/21181 for how to do that.  <answer86687> I believe this does the trick (at least it seems to have worked for mefor several hours now):  precodesudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.screensaver loginWindowIdleTime 0 /code/pre  This disables the screensaver in the loginwindow.  <answer257733> For some reason I don't understand yet, the solution in the accepted answer didn't work for me. Below is an alternative method that actually idid/i work for me.  Before doing anything, i noticed that a file called codecom.apple.screensaver.plist/code did not yet exist in code/Library/Preferences//code. But issuing the codedefaults/code -command as mentioned in the accepted answer created this file with correct codeloginWindowIdleTime/code-entry just fine. This was confirmed both with codedefaults read /Library/Preferences/com.apple.screensaver/code as well as by manually confirming the files' existence and inspecting its' contents.  However, it didn't seem to have any effect on the screensaver-behaviour in the Login Screen whatsoever.  I then used a different approach that actually did work:  ol liI opened a command-prompt (Terminal window)/li liFirst I issued code$ &gt; sudo -s/code to become root/li liThen, as root, I started emSystem Preferences/em: code# &gt; /Applications/System\ Preferences.app/Contents/MacOS/System\ Preferences/code/li liAnd finally I went into the emDesktop and Screen Savers/em Preference-Pane to use the regular GUI to disable the screensaver timeout./li /ol  This did the trick for me.  I'm wondering though, if the codedefaults/code-command perhaps did actually work fine already, just the changed plist-value wasn't picked-up (synced) yet by the (still running?) codescreensaver/code processâ€¦  <comment7070> how to edit it there? what to add, or what to set, or what to delete? <comment7071> What does your `com.apple.screensaver` file have in it? Can you post the contents to [Pastie](http://pastie.org/)? For what its worth, using `defaults` to read my file returns [this](http://pastie.org/1483439) and I don't ever get a screensaver. Note however that I'm running 10.6.6, so if your file uses the old (XML) style of .plist, don't sweat it. You could just try trashing the file too. <comment83499> -1, doesn't work for me under Mountain Lion. <comment83500> -1, the accepted solution is unclear. It should indicate what to place in the plist file. <comment97793> The file is a binary plist file (under 10.8 anyway) and to be edited with a text editor must first be converted using `plutil -convert xml1 /Library/Preferences/com.apple.screensaver.plist`. Then the file can be edited and the screen saver changed. <comment107888> I believe this should be the answer since I always use it on my servers. <comment268511> The accepted solution should be the one proposed by Kurt. <comment268512> Clarification comments should not be added to the proposed list of answers. The original question should be modified to address additional conditions so as to produce the most succinct answers.
