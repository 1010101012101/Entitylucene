Is there a free analogue clock that displays in the dock? <body> I would like to have an analogue clock displaying right in my OS X dock.  The default clock in the menu bar is too small for me, and it is obviously impossible to drag it into the dock.  If possible, I prefer a free (as in beer) solution.  <answer88922> Andrew Choi's SimpleDockClock does this, although it is not straightforward to change the style.  It looks like this:  SimpleDockClock http://members.shaw.ca/akochoi/articles/simple-dock-clock/SimpleDockClock.jpg  The source code and a binary are available.  <comment350577> It is not available anymore :(
