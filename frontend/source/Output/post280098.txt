Is there a way for AppleScript to detect when a Desktop is switched? <body> When I switch desktops, I want to have a way to remind me of the purpose of that desktop.  I'm thinking of using AppleScript to detect when I switch desktops, and show a pop up of sorts.   Desktops / popups would contain a label of some sort ("work", "communication", etc).  I'm thinking of launching a browser window, bring it to front, and update the contents to say the purpose.   In my head this sounds doable, I just need to find the event, if any that is related to Spaces/MissionControl.
