Can multiple email addresses *with names* be pasted into Mail.app? <body> I read this post, but it doesn't answer my question:  ul liHow to paste multiple email addresss into iPhone mail To: field?/li /ul  I have noticed that it seems to be possible to include a name along with an email address, even for names/emails that are emnot/em in my address book.  After the email is emsent,/em looking at the header shows blue bubbles with the correct name for each email address.  However, when I try to paste emmultiple/em email addresses along with names, I can't tell what Mail.app is going to do with them.  It doesn't turn them into the blue bubbles that make it intuitive.  (It seems to only do this after the email is sent.)  Example of the format I'm talking about:  precodeJoe Blow joe@blow.com Jimmy Dean jimmy@dean.com Sally May sally@may.com /code/pre  By contrast, when a list formatted like the following is pasted into a recipient field, all the email addresses immediately turn into individual blue boxes that indicate how Mail.app will separate them:  precodejoe@blow.com,jimmy@dean.com,sally@may.com /code/pre  Possibly related; when I saved a draft that included multiple email addresses in the BCC field formatted like this, and opened the draft later, I found all but two emails (out of about fifteen) had disappeared from the BCC field.  strongIs there a correct standard format for pasting multiple names and email addresses into a recipient field?/strong  (Not names from the address book.)  If so, what is it?  <answer258721> The expected format for multiple e-mail address is:  precodeJoe Blow &lt;joe@blow.com&gt; Jimmy Dean &lt;jimmy@dean.com&gt; Sally May &lt;sally@may.com&gt; /code/pre  Copying and pasting this into Mail.app on macOS 10.12 works as expected. Three people are added to the e-mail; each with their name associated with the e-mail address.  Individual entries can be separated by a comma:  precodeJoe Blow &lt;joe@blow.com&gt;, Jimmy Dean &lt;jimmy@dean.com&gt;, Sally May &lt;sally@may.com&gt; /code/pre  The angle bracket format originates from RFC 822 Section-6.1. This Request For Comment (RFC) defined the basis of the e-mail standard used on the Internet.  <comment323511> Perfect, thank you!  And for anyone else, the command for the conversion is `sed -E -i '.bak' 's/[^[:space:]]+@[^[:space:]]+/&/' list_of_people.txt`.
