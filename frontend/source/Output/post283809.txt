Can AirPods' double-tap to Play/Pause be made to work in other macOS applications than iTunes? <body> In macOS, it's possible to assign AirPod double-tap to Play/Pause audio (under Bluetooth options; instead of invoking Siri).  But for some reason double-tap Play/Pause only works with iTunes.   If you use the Play/Pause button on the Mac keyboard, or even send it via the wired EarPods, the command command can be intercepted by other applications like VLC. I also use a Chrome extension called emStreamKeys/em whereby the Play/Pause button can control playback on popular audio and video streaming sites.  strongQuestion:/strong Is there a way to make the AirPods control system-wide Play/Pause? If no simple solution exists, could this be done some elaborate way via scripting?  <answer283813> It works just fine with applications like  ul liQuickTime Player.app/li lithe Lynda.com app from the Mac App Store/li liYouTube videos played in Safari/li /ul  However, it does not work with these applications:  ul liQuickTime Player 7/li liVox (audio player)/li liVLC/li liMplayerX/li /ul  <comment366483> I'm accepting your answer for the time being. It seems to suggest to me that some kind of double-tap Play/Pause support for third-party apps is possible, but perhaps developers must carry out special implementations for it to work.
