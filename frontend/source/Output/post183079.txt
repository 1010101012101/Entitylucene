Connect from Macbook Air 2012 (thunderbolt port) to dell monitor (displayport) <body> I just bought this Dell UltraSharp U2312HM monitor to use as an external monitor of my Macbook Air 2012 model.  And, I'm looking for a cable that will connect from thunderbolt port (mini displayport) to displayport of the monitor and wanted to confirm if this cable is the right one.  Mini DisplayPort to DisplayPort Cable M-M 2m  <answer183099> Yes, that looks correct. If you want some other examples, then take a look at the newegg site.
