File save dialog is empty if selecting mounted SDCard <body> I'm trying to save a file download on my Macbook Pro. When i select a mounted SDCard a target, the file save dialog displays no file structure at all, although i can see it in finder. I currently updated to macOS Sierra.  I can not remember having had this problem before.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LUdAO.png" alt="enter image description here"
