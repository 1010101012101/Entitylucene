Enable an alarm in an iOS device remotely? <body> When I'm ready to go to bed, I run an Applescript from my Mac that performs a set of standard actions that need to be done. The only standard action that is still not being taken care of is the alarm for the next morning; I still have to look at the far too bright smart device screen in the bedroom and set the alarm. No, a "repeat every day" alarm won't do because the alarm time is not the same every day. I'm planning to have my Mac consider what time it is [right now], then calculate what the time would be [+ n hours after that], which would be the ideal amount of time to sleep. I'd want it to send the final calculated time to an iOS device that would set an alarm to that time). The problem is that I need my own audio file, because the actual alert sounds just make me feel sick and unwilling.  In the Clock app, you can use a "song" as an alarm sound, but those alarms are always set manually.  Calendars and Reminders can be set to sync between devices and they do have alarm sounds, but from an iOS device, I can't see any way to allow the use of custom sounds for the alert.  If I open the desired sound file in GarageBand and choose "send ringtone to iTunes", the maximum allowed length is 40 seconds, which is pointlessly short. IFTTT has an action that calls your phone at a specified time, and I guess you could set a custom ringtone (a "song file") to that specific caller only, but the IFTTT phone service is only available for US phone numbers.  Can you think of any other ways, Apple or third party, on how to achieve this?
