Why do applications I install only sometimes appear in the Applications directory? <body> This is on OSX 10.7.5.  Often when I install a new application it wont appear in the Applications folder and the only way I can access it is by using Spotlight.  Any way I can make all applications appear in this folder?  <answer252941> Its the strongpath/strong of the installer. Most will automatically download in emApplications/em.br /br /Notice how at the end of most installers, the finder window pops up with only its contents, and a strongsymlink/strong to your emApplications/em folder for you to drag &amp; drop into it.br /br / If an application does not follow that installation structure, its because the developer strongdidn't/strong invest the time to do so.   <comment314730> Where do they end up? The same place or different locations each time? How are you installing these applications, using the Installer app from Apple?
