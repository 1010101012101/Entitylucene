Can't resize iTunes 11.0.2 <body> I own a 2009 13-inch MacBook Pro and a 24-inch Led Cinema Display. I have always been able to resize iTunes horizontally and vertically (both being connected to the Display and not being connected).  However, for no apparent reason, I am not able to do that anymore in both situations. I can't make the window smaller than a certain width and height (being the minimum width approximately the width resolution of the 13-inch MacBook Pro).  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/klLvr.png" alt="enter image description here"  I've tried resizing by using kbdoption/kbd and clicking on the green button, and using kbdoption/kbd and resizing, as recommended by other users but none of these solutions have worked.  strongHow can I allow resizing again?/strong  <answer84217> Try changing the the window's minimum width value. To do so just:  ol liGo to code/Applications/iTunes.app/Conte­nts/Resources/YourLanguage.lpr­oj/code and open the strongAppConfig.plist/strong file. ( I'd use a text editor to open it, as it's easier to modify the file this way.)/li liLook for code&lt;key&gt;browser-window-minimum-width&lt;/key&gt;/code and change its integer value./li liSave the file and Restart iTunes./li /ol  <comment96816> Due to my reputation, I can't post a [screenshot of my 13-inch MacBook Pro showing the minimum width and height allowed](http://imageshack.us/f/560/capturadepantalla201303.png/)  that would illustrate my problem. <comment96876> Thank you very much. It worked perfectly. Are there any established default values? <comment96883> If there is, I must say that I don't know which is it.
