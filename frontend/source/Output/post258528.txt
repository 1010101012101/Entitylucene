Opening app instance with a Spotlight <body> Is it possible to open app window with spotlight?  For example: i have Airmail app opened and pressed "compose a new message", then i would have 2 windows of Airmail app. If in spotlight i type "airmail" i'll get the latest window, but not the main window of that app. Is it possible to choose which window i'd like to see through spotlight?  Like: "airmail:window2"  strongSo i want to switch to apps using spotlight search and have that app select a specific window among the multiple windows for that app./strong  <comment323206> I don't think that's possible. If however only one instance of the app you wanna open is opened, opening that app using spotlight automatically opens that instance.
