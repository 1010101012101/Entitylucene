Share internet connection over wifi when the normal way doesn't work <body> I just tried to set up Internet Sharing of my Ethernet connection to wifi by following the instructions in this answer.  The network appeared only very briefly, one time, in the list of networks detected by my Android device.  I tried setting it up with and without security; I made sure that I was not already connected to a wi-fi network.  The wifi icon rippled upwards a few times (as it does when you turn wifi on) and then went back to grey.  Scanning during or after this process with my Android phone made no difference.  I also tried setting up a network a different way, by clicking on the wifi icon and selecting "Create Network...".  This presented a different set of security options.  After I did this, the wifi option changed to have a little box/monitor inside of it.  The network still was not visible from my Android device.  How can I troubleshoot this?  What are the likely reasons for this problem?
