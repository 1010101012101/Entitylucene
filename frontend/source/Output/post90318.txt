Supressing "You are Not Connected to the Internet" iChat alerts? <body> Thanks OSX, I know I'm not connected to the Internet...  Get that annoying pop-up from iChat everytime the computer wakes from sleep offline, or with a slow-to-reconnect Wifi connection.  There's got to be a way to suppress it?  While we're on it - how do you do the same with iOs Mail app? using it on the subway here in NYC or on a plane is maddening.
