CMD OCR for Mac (no tesseract) <body> Is there a command line software for Mac to do codeOCR/code, which is strongnot/strong codetesseract/code and can bulk read codepdf/code or codejpg/code?  The main issue I have is that my MacBook Air (Early 2015) runs into memory and swap issues when using codeimagemagick/code for bulk conversion of 500 codejpg/code to codetif/code or the codeOCR/code of a codepdf/code with "only" 500 pages.  Can someone suggest a solution to that?  <comment354917> A solution to which part: a tesseract alternative or the memory/swapping issues? AD works better with one specific question per well question, so please focus on one of them. You can always ask the other part in a separate question.
