I m afraid if i missed anyone while reinstalling again!cos i feel i had 2 pages when i 1st time start my laptop. Is final cut pro and logic pro comes free when anyone buy new macbook? I feel i had this, just a doubt :(. or if i give them back to fix will they install?  <answer171904> See this list on apple.com for the applications which are included with a new MacBook Pro. If you are missing additional applications after a reinstall, you can either re-download them from the Mac App Store or from the website of the vendor (in case the software wasn't purchased through the App Store).  <comment202324> Thank u so much for that fastest answer. I REALLY APPRECIATE :) <comment202325> SO FINAL CUT AND LOGIC PRO ARE NOT PREINSTALLED IN IT?! <comment202330> Usually not, but check the Purchased section in the App Store if you think you've bought them already. <comment202331> no,i didn't bought it,i wanted to know if its already installed in mac.i m not sure.thanks anyway :)
