Am I allowed to use an apple device from placeit.net with an app screenshot on Twitter? <body> I've built an iOS 8 app and I'm not 100% sure if I'm allowed to use a photo of an iPhone 5s running my app as a timeline picture on Facebook and Twitter (support pages)? The device will only be visible from the front, hence leaving the Apple logo hidden.  Thank you! Erik  <answer195221> You may want to check this answer:     You will get lots of free iPhone 4s images from internet.

Hope it helps.  <comment233063> Is it showing Apple logo ? <comment233064> @Buscarì›ƒSD nope, sorry for the short question - pushed submit a little too soon and didn't see the edit button. It's only going to show the front side of the device <comment233067> If there is not Apple logo on it then it should not be a problem.
