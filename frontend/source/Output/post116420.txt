Cannot see contact in "Add Invitee" on Calendar <body> I have two CalDAV accounts configured in Calendar. Both are configured in codeSystem Preferences &gt; Internet Accounts/code to synchronize both Contacts and Calendars:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2xYEV.png" alt="enter image description here"  When I go to add a meeting, there's the Add Invitee space as shown:   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/BKuZx.png" alt="enter image description here"  I have a contact in my second account, let's call it CalDAV2, that doesn't show up when I start typing his name in the "Add Invitees" area.   How can I remedy my Contacts-to-Calendar interaction here?  Running 10.9.1 on MBA with native apps for each.
