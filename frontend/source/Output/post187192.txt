Stop Photos.app from opening when any device is connected <body> I know there are thousands of iterations on this question, but I can't find one dealing with Photos.app from 10.10.3+.  I just want to stop it (or anything else) from opening ever. None of the answers I've found for Image Capture or iPhoto work anymore, as far as I can tell.  To be clear, I know I can go into Image Capture and change the setting per-device, but I am regularly plugging in random devices I've never used before, and I want to turn this behaviour off globally.  Is there a way to do this?  <answer187217> Simplest might be to use RCDefaultApp - old but still works on Yosemite &amp; is free.  It installs as a Control Panel, called Default Apps.  Set Media  Camera to 'Ignore'  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kG1kX.png" alt="enter image description here"  I actually set everything to Ignore, I prefer to do these things manually.
