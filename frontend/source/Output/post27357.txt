What models of iPhone 4S are for sale in the US <body> I'm looking for a "just the facts" answer that lists the various models that are for sale and whether these devices are locked to a carrier or unlocked.  I understand that CDMA doesn't become active unless you elect to activate it at the time of purchase, so the locking status can apply only to the microSIM GSM usage when roaming to avoid billing through your primary carrier.  I'm not looking for shopping advice - just a clean summary of the list price and limitations of what is for sale for Fall 2011 in the US (we can edit this later if things change, but I expect stability as in the recent past on pricing and models). Also, please ignore any temporary shortages or any temporary discounts/bundles. Just the full list price of the devices sorted by carrier and just iPhone 4S.  Apple have done a marvelous job with a concise summary of rate plans for AT&amp;T, Sprint and Verizon. I'm looking for that to cover all the hardware locking to carriers that is done in Apple's servers when you buy an iPhone 4S which then restricts what you can and can't do with that device after purchase.  <answer27361> All models come in white or black at the same price, so we'll list them by capacity and locking status by increasing price.  hr  h1Unlocked GSM Phones/h1  All these ship without a micro SIM (Coming in November)  ul li16 GB - $649 - GSM unlocked - no contract or subsidy /li li32 GB - $749 - GSM unlocked - no contract or subsidy/li li64 GB - $849 - GSM unlocked - no contract or subsidy/li /ul  hr  h1AT&amp;T/h1  AT&amp;T iPhone 4S will be configured to use GSM domestically and GSM roaming.
