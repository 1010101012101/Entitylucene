Macports: libgnome-keyring taking days (or forever) to build <body> I have upgraded to mavericks and I am following the instructions to upgrade MacPorts, but it is taking days to rebuild libgnome-keyring - I stopped it after three days and deleted it from my "myports.txt" file and restarted - and it was reloaded as a dependency and is now in its second day of building.  Is this behaviour normal? Is there a fix if it's not?  strongupdate/strong  This is the output...  precode---&gt;  Computing dependencies for libgnome-keyring ---&gt;  Fetching archive for libgnome-keyring ---&gt;  Attempting to fetch libgnome-keyring-3.10.1_0.darwin_13.x86_64.tbz2 from http://mse.uk.packages.macports.org/sites/packages.macports.org/libgnome-keyring ---&gt;

I'm wondering if your port tree is out of date maybe?  EDIT: I see your log has this line:  precodeDEBUG: Skipping completed org.macports.configure (libgnome-keyring) /code/pre  Which suggests the port hasn't been cleaned properly. Is that still showing up after doing the above?  Also I see this:  precodecompiler clang 421.11.66 not blacklisted because it doesn't match {clang &lt; 211.10.1} /code/pre  What version of XCode are you running? Not 4.2 I hope? codexcodebuild -version/code will tell you. You should be on 5.0.2. If you have to install or update from the App Store, you'll also want to run codexcode-select --install/code to install the CLI tools.  <comment141401> Could you run the command again but with the `-d` (debug) flag to show more output? <comment141481> I am using the restore_ports.tcl script (as per the upgrade instructions) and I don't know any TCL - can you tell me where to insert the flag in the script? <comment141590> Use `sudo port -d install libgnome-keyring` to run just that portion with debugging on. <comment141671> Full output at http://pastebin.com/WhE5zYhu <comment141946> The log looks OK = try a `port clean libgnome-keyring` and try again <comment141975> Did you look at the full output in the pastebin? <comment142042> Yup, mine (linked above) is 3 times as long. Though I don't see any errors in yours, clearly something is wrong. <comment142053> just gets to the build bit, and then remains in the build <comment142063> This is just the same - gets to build and then hits the processors hard but no sign that it will complete the build. <comment142132> Any info from the XCode version check? <comment142155> Won't be near the box until Monday morning I'm afraid. <comment142384> It's xcode 4.5.2 - I will update that now <comment142399> Upgrading xcode did indeed fix the issue
