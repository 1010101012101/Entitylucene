Unknown shared network in the Finder <body> I connect to the internet at my office using wifi. There is an unknown item in network window named code108.61.0.48.choopa.net/code. I can't remove it or connect to it. How has it added to my network item and how can i remove it?  <comment123572> Perhaps your office wifi utilizes one of these http://www.choopa.com/ <comment123573> No. absolutely not.
