How to enable echo service for tcp or udp on well-known port 7 on Mac OS X 10.8 or above? <body> I am learning TCP/IP protocol with a Mac, and need echo service (refer to [RFC 862], or Wiki) to test network. But it seems to OS X doesn't implement it or disable it.  I learned that launchd replaced inetd, you can create a launchd Property List File to launch daemons. In that way you can control some network service. So i edited telnet.plist (located in /System/Library/LaunchDaemons), set "Disabled" to "NO", and successfully enable telnet service. But I don't find echo.plist or something similar.  Or, I can create an echo.plist according to telnet.plistbr img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/At3Hq.png" alt="enter image description here"  But what ProgramArguments should be? Is there a built-in daemon for echo service of which name maybe echod?  Or, I have to compile inetd from source?  Thanks for any advice.  <answer217335> AFAIK the echo service isn't implemented in OS X. You may use either a Java echo client/server or CocoaEcho instead.  After unzipping the file check the folder em.../build/Debug/em. I tested CocoaEcho server/client in 10.9.5 and it still works though it was built for 10.7. If you use a newer OS X version you may have to recompile it.  <comment262808> Does it support both tcp and udp, and can I set CocoaEcho's port  to be constant to port 7 and assign the port with name "echo", as the original echo service should be. I known it may be unnecessary to do, just want to know how to do it. <comment262818> @kinishinai CocoaEcho is just sample code. Starting it, a port in the dynamic range (49152 - 65535) will be assigned. But if you are a programmer you may change the source to use port 7 and recompile it.
