Mail App only shows a few days of emails <body> I am using Sierra 10.12.2 and my Mail App only shows the last few days of emails.  If I search for an email from a  sender or topic that I know I have, it appears. I checked all the view settings for anything that might limited the number of emails that are displayed but have been unable to find the problem. All my emails used to appear in my inbox but I noticed now that they are limited to just the last several days.  Thanks for any troubleshooting suggestions
