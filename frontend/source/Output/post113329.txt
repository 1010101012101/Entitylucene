Problems installing bootcamp drivers - Win8x64 on MacBook5,2 <body> new here.  I have the following scenario: I own a MacBook5,2 (thats the white one, early 2009 model IIRC) with OS X 10.8.5 installed, BootCamp 5 is included. I already successfully installed Windows 8 and it runs fine so far, I just can't install the Bootcamp Drivers.  Now, the problem is somewhat weird.  ul liWindows 8 isn't officially supported for the early 2009 model (though it installs and runs just fine, as I said)./li liThe Bootcamp Assistant downloads drivers, but they aren't suited for my MacBook (the setup.exe on Windows tells me so)/li liI downloaded the correct drivers for my MacBook from here, but they won't install with the message "Boot Camp x64 is unsupported on this computer model". Multiple websites suggested that these run fine on Win8 as well, so.../li liI tried installing the drivers with their respective installers, but the installer tells me it needs more rights and I should execute the main setup (which I can't as mentioned above)/li /ul  So yeah, what do I do now? Do I emreally/em have to use the 32bit Win8 though the x64 bit runs just fine? Is there any workaround for executing the installers?  Would it work to fully install Win7 (with drivers) and then upgrade to Win8? I never did an Upgrade and have no idea if drivers are deleted or not.  I hope I didn't forget anything... Thanks in advance  em/edit/em I also tried the commandline-solution propposed here, but the installer just tells me it needs to run on Win7... So apparently I just need Win8 drivers :/  em/edit2/em Downloaded the Win8 Bootcamp drivers from support.apple.com/kb/DL1638 and this installed fine with the commandline, only issue is that the touchpad won't work -_- everything else installed just fine :(  em/edit3/em OK I also downloaded the Bootcamp drivers from support.apple.com/kb/DL1630 (which would be the "correct" one for my MacBook) and only executed the AppleTrackpadInstaller64.exe file and now the Trackpad is working :) Also the iSight-driver from it works.  Only device without a driver is a "Co-processor" and I have no idea which is the correct driver for it... or what it even does :S
