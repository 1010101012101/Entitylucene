SSH no longer listens on custom port after update to 10.12.4 <body> I had a custom port by using the "Port" line in /etc/sshd_config.  After updating to Mac OS X 10.12.4 I found I could no longer connect on the custom port - instead it was listening on port 22.  I found that my sshd_config had apparently been renamed to sshd_config~previous, so I moved it back to the correct spot and restarted sshd from the command line using codesudo launchctl stop com.openssh.sshd; sudo launchctl start com.openssh.sshd/code.  However, after the restart sshd was still listening on port 22.  I then opened System Preferences and under sharing clicked on "Remote Login".  Running `netstat -a -n" showed that port 22 was no longer being listened to.  I then click on "Remote Login" to restart sshd, and then found sshd was still listening on port 22, not my custom port.  In /var/log/apache2 I see an empty codeaccess_log/code on startup, and codeerror_log/code contains the normal startup message.  No clues there.  How do I get sshd to listen on my custom port again?  <answer290302> I found the answer here and it appears to also apply for upgrading to Sierra from a pre-el capitan version of OS X.  To summarize:  precodesudo cp /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/ssh.plist /Library/LaunchDaemons/ssh2.plist /code/pre  Edit /Library/LaunchDaemons/ssh2.plist and change the lines that read:  precode&lt;key&gt;Label&lt;/key&gt; &lt;string&gt;com.openssh.sshd&lt;/string&gt; /code/pre  to:  precode&lt;key&gt;Label&lt;/key&gt; &lt;string&gt;com.openssh.sshd2&lt;/string&gt; /code/pre  And change the lines that read:  precode&lt;key&gt;SockServiceName&lt;/key&gt; &lt;string&gt;ssh&lt;/string&gt; /code/pre  by replacing "ssh" with whatever port you want to use.  Then start the new port with:  precodesudo launchctl load -w /Library/LaunchDaemons/ssh2.plist /code/pre  As noted in the article, this doesn't eliminate ssh running on port 22.  In my case that was okay - the main reason for running on the new port was to match the port ssh was visible at outside the firewall.  <comment366506> To stop `sshd` answering on port 22, enter: `/usr/bin/sudo launchctl unload /Library/LaunchDaemons/ssh.plist`.
