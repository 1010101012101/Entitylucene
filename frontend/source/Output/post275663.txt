Complex triggers for HomeKit devices <body> Is it possible to create more complex triggers than what the Home app enables?  For example, if I have a motion sensor and a smart bulb in the bathroom, I can make a trigger to turn the lights on when it senses motion.   Is it possible to make the britness level different at night? Or make it turn off after a given time, if no motion detected?
