Google Photos won't stop syncing on iOS <body> I have Google Photos installed on my iPhone 6S and would like it to stop automatically syncing my photos.  I like to view my pictures but don't want everything backed up.    I have gone into settings on the app and turned off "Backup &amp; sync" but if I take a picture it still gets uploaded!  I've tried restarting the app and the iPhone but it still does it.  <answer216015> Try turning off Background app refresh   <answer295780> If you turned off back up &amp; sync, then it should not upload the photos to the cloud. However, you can still view the photos in the app, but each picture that is not uploaded will have a no cloud sign -- a cloud icon with a line through it.  <comment272714> That option does not seem to work.  The Google Photo iOS app continues to upload my photos even when I tell it not to. <comment373551> I would disable sync during cellular connection and just live with the options.
