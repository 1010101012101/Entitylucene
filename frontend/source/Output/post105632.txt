Then going to Messages-Preferences  There is an option in here to remove it from your menu bar img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/EZ6kn.png" alt="status in menu bar"  Hope this helps :)   <answer105704> Although this is Mac help site, where we are glad to answer questions, reading thru Apple's Mac Basics would aquaint you with the Preferences settings every application has.  <comment124201> Worked like a charm, thanks a lot! <comment124712> The ol' Cmd-drag can (re)move the built-in icons up there.
