OS X Dock is showing invalid icon for Calender app <body> I've noticed an issue. Are you facing the same?  How to resolve it? I tried removing the icon &amp; added back but issue remains.  It is showing two code15/code as a part of Calender itself. Is there something that I've missed for understanding dock icon for Calender app?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/r4pk3.png" alt="Dock Calender Icon"  <comment215132> I'd be tempted to run the 10.10.3 combo updater over it, see if it clears up - https://support.apple.com/kb/DL1804?locale=en_us <comment215138> Already updated to 10.10.3. <comment215139> that's why I suggested running the combo - it will recheck everything since 10.10.0 & make sure it's up to date. <comment215400> Tried that also. Not working :( <comment215402> hmmâ€¦ then I'm stumped, sorry
