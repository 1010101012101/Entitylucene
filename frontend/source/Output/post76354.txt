Which iOS jailbreak apps most closely implement an Android style notification system? <body> Which iOS jailbreak apps implement a notifications system that most closely resembles Android's implementation?  <answer78963> I stumbled upon SMS, Mail, Missed Calls Notifications In Status Bar | iPhone Cydia Tweak.  <comment89741> I don't know of any, and if I don't know of any, then I'm sure it doesn't exist. I've read through the descriptions of almost every tweak in the default Cydia repositories and a plethora of others, too. I think it's because there's not enough people using iOS that want such a tweak. Most people are happy with the Apple's notification system. <comment89878> I just got an idea - I'm going to post this question on a Cydia forum too and I'll report the results back here.  http://cydiaforums.com/f24/ios-jailbreak-apps-implement-notifications-system-thats-closest-androids-1612/#post5801
