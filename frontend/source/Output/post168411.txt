Yosemite Keychain Access Not Showing Keychain List <body> I have Yosemite, and my Keychain Access only shows the login keychain, giving me no option to switch between keychains.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/AbsTN.png" alt="enter image description here"  As you can see, my sidebar on the left is missing. I try toggling it with âŒ˜+K, but to no avail.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1FW6n.png" alt="enter image description here"  Pressing that button repeatedly, thereby supposedly hiding and showing the keychain sidebar, doesn't do anything.  What might be the problem, and how can I fix it?  <comment271027> Did you solve this problem i have the same problem but can't figure out how to solve it. I've already deleted my com.apple.keychainaccess.plist file in /Library/Preferences but this doesn't seem to help <comment271028> No, sorry, I never solved it.
