Partition on USB-connected drive not appearing <body> The partition I was using for Time Machine started generating error reports about not being writeable and now fails to mount. The partition is on a 3TB Seagate drive. First Aid fails to repair.    If I use the partition manager in Disk Utility.app I see its size as 668,636,708.864. (The commas surprised me, but maybe that's Apple being helpful?). The screen shot shows that DU says it is "journaled" but the error message says I need to enable journaling under the File menu. There is no such option in the file menu.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/E2LOu.png" alt="Disk Utility"  Running El Capitan on an early 2008 MacPro. I can run something at the command line if needed for a more NIX-level diagnostic.

I don't like having the ability to edit a disk if I'm not familiar with the program.
