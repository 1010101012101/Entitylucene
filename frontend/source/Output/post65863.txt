Is it possible to dual boot Mac OS X Snow Leopard and Fedora 17? <body> Has anyone attempted this before? Are there any installation guides to follow?  I attempted to install before but I wasn't able to boot into the fedora partition when i was done.  <answer65865> If you've successfully installed Fedora on a free partition, the rest is easy. Just download an ISO  copy of rEFIt and burn it with Disk Utility to a blank DVD.  Then, while booting, hold down kbdC/kbd after the chime to boot to rEFIt.  It will give you the option to boot to Linux (this is indicated by a Tux icon).    Additionally, rEFIt is able to install itself to your system without a DVD boot every time, but I couldn't recommend it as I had some issues with this personally.  <comment77467> Which partition should I install the bootloader in when it ask? <comment77468> For the Fedora installer?- on free space; presumably you have made a partition of free space in Disk Utility before attempting the install. Do you need help with doing this?
