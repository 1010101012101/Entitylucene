An email as my name on other people's phone, iOS7 update <body> Why is my email popping up on other people's phone as my name?  Ever since I did the iOS7 update on my phone, my messages are not coming up as "sussy joes" it is now some kind of email.   How do I stop this from happening?  <answer102264> Go to Settings - Mail, Contacts, Calendars - under Contacts, select Short Name and turn it off.   <answer102283> Go to codeSettings &gt; Messages &gt; Send and recieve/code and change your codeReached at by iMessage/code settings to just your phone number.  <answer102407> The first thing that comes to mind would be if messages is set (or became reset during the iOS 7 upgrade) to start new conversations from your Apple ID email instead of your phone number.  ul liOpen Settings app/li liSwipe up and tap Messages/li liTap Send &amp; Receive/li liVerify that the checkmark is next to the phone number/li /ul  You'll want to watch for errors like I have below where the messages is still waiting for activation. em(That might force it to send as your Apple ID until the activation finishes.)/em  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6DiGB.png" height="400"  Set the "Caller ID" or send as email or phone:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3C5ZM.png" height="400"  <comment120585> I wonder if you need to change the "Start new conversations from:" section to preserve receiving at the email and still send as the phone? Your step should work if my guess and your guess are correct as to the issue.
