Launchctl difference between load and start, unload and stop <body> I was reading through the launchctl man page and have a few questions about its functioning:  ul liWhat is the difference between load and start, unload and stop?/li liWhere do I find the job label for a daemon, is it in the plist file?/li /ul  <answer29062> Loading and unloading tells launchd to load the configuration file. Whether it runs the program and under what conditions is determined by the plist file. A job that isn't currently running can be started with codelaunchctl start .../code and stopped with codelaunchctl stop .../code.  The label for the job is defined by the label key, and the name of the plist should also be the job label followed by the plist extension.  <comment215827> How does remove factor into this? Specifically how is it different from unload?
