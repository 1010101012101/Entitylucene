I can't change the user's picture path with Applescript <body> My user's profile picture path is /picture1.jpg.  I want to change it to /picture2.jpg using applescript.  I run the following applescript:  precodetell application "System Events"     set the picture path of current user to "/picture2.jpg"     get the picture path of current user end tell /code/pre  I expect this script to change the user's profile picture to /picture2.jpg.  This doesn't happen, and the line "get the picture path of current user" causes "/picture1.jpg" to be returned, confirming no change.  Why doesn't this work?
