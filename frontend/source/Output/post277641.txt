Preview does not find words correctly <body> I recently updated my OS to Sierra. The new Preview seems to have some serious bugs for searching words inside a document.   1st problem: certain words are not found despite Adobe acrobat reader is perfectly able to find them.  2nd problem: the bar to the right displays the pages where the word has been found. The pages are arranged in an apparently random order.  Is there a way to fix these issues?  strongEDIT/strong  Actually I solved the second problem. Results where sorted by search rank instead of page order. I still have the first problem though.
