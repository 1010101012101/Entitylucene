Calling terminal command (pdfcrop) either directly from python or from within applescript (do shell script) <body> on OSX, I am using applescript to get a latex string from an application (OmniOutliner), process it via a python script that calls codepdflatex/code and codepdfcrop/code, and paste the final cropped pdf back into OmniOutliner. See details on github.  Since I upgraded to OS 10.11 El Capitan and TexLive-2016 I have been running into a weird problem:  ul liapplescript calls the python script that calls codepdflatex/code, that all works still fine, after I changed the paths pointing to codepdflatex/code./li linow, when I run codepdfcrop/code from  ul lieither within the python script from within the applescript  precodeset com to {"source ~/.bash_profile; cd " &amp; presentDirStr &amp; "; python create_latex_pdf.py " &amp; strNoteQ} do shell script com /code/pre/li lior directly from within applescript: `  precodeset com_pdfcrop to {"source ~/.bash_profile; cd " &amp; presentDirStr &amp; ";/usr/local/texlive/2016/texmf-dist/scripts/pdfcrop temp.pdf"} do shell script com_pdfcrop /code/pre  I get the error codeerror "sh: /usr/local/texlive/2016/texmf-dist/scripts/pdfcrop: is a directory" number 126/code/li /ul/li lihowever, when I call my python script from the terminal directly (not from within applescript), it produces the cropped pdf fine  precode     os.chdir(cur_path)      cmd_pdflatex = '/Library/TeX/texbin/pdflatex temp.tex'      if talk_to_me is True:          print "command for executing pdflatex:\n    ", cmd_pdflatex      os.system(cmd_pdflatex) /code/pre/li /ul  Now,   ul liis the command codedo shell script/code the best way in this case to call a python script from within applescript?/li liwhat could some reasons for this behaviour be?/li liwhat does the "is not a directory" number 126 error imply (I googled, but unsuccessfully, unfortunately)?/li liwhat error could occur between calling pdfcrop either from within a python script via codeos.system(...)/code or from within an applescript that calls that exact same python script via codedo shell script .../code?/li /ul  strongupdate 20160616 12:32/strong  a) as Mark pointed out, this is a bit confusing, so I simplified this into one applescript: b) somehow I got confused with links and actual directories where TexLive stores things; so I updated to call codepdfcrop/code from the what I assume is the at any time current directory  precodetell application "Finder" to get folder of (path to me) as Unicode text set presentDir to POSIX path of result set presentDirStr to result set com_pdfcrop to {"cd " &amp; presentDirStr &amp; ";/usr/local/texlive/2016/bin/x86_64-darwin/pdfcrop temp.pdf"} do shell script com_pdfcrop /code/pre  Now I get from this applescript codeerror "!!! Error: Ghostscript exited with error code 127!" number 127/code  strongupdate 20160616 13:16/strong  it does work now, here are some thoughts:  ul limy code~/.bash_profile/code had added code/usr/texbin/:/code to the Path. I am sure this was necessary for something at some point. /li liCurrently, I have taken it out, but that led to the problem that codepdfcrop.pl/code located in code/usr/local/texlive/2016/texmf-dist/scripts/pdfcrop/code could not find codepdftex/code. Originally line 352 contained code$::opt_pdftexcmd  = "pdftex";/code which I switched to code$::opt_pdftexcmd  = "/Library/TeX/texbin/pdftex";/code/li /ul  This means, it works now, but I probably get in this mess again, when I decide to update TexLive, likely in 2017.  <comment298787> You do not need and should not source ~/.bash_profile Also I don't think wither applescript or python will expand the ~ <comment298806> ok fair enough, but that didn't solve the problem â€“ pdfcrop still returns: `error "sh: /usr/local/texlive/2016/texmf-dist/scripts/pdfcrop: is a directory" number 126` <comment298808> The scripts you run from shell and Applescript/python are all different so that is confusing - also what does `ls -l /usr/local/texlive/2016/texmf-dist/scripts/pdfcrop` show <comment298814> it returns  `-rwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel  38527 Nov  5  2012 pdfcrop.pl` <comment298827> pdfcrop.pl is not the same as pdfcrop That is two different names
