How to remove group membership from user using the Lion Terminal? <body> How to remove a self created daemon user named '_denyhosts' from group 1025(workgroup), 403(com.apple.sharepoint.group.2), 404(com.apple.sharepoint.group.3) and 405(com.apple.sharepoint.group.4) using Lion Terminal?  emBackground/em  To create a reduced privileged daemon user account, to run denyhosts.py using launchd, the example on http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Tutorials/Create_a_Mac_OS_X_startup_daemon has been helpful.  However the created Lion daemon user account "_denyhosts" seems to have to many groups assigned:   precode$ id _denyhosts uid=300(_denyhosts) gid=300(_denyhosts) groups=300(_denyhosts),1025(workgroup),12(everyone),61(localaccounts),403(com.apple.sharepoint.group.2),404(com.apple.sharepoint.group.3),405(com.apple.sharepoint.group.4)  /code/pre  In my opinion the groups membership of:  ol li1025(workgroup)/li li403(com.apple.sharepoint.group.2)/li li404(com.apple.sharepoint.group.3)/li li405(com.apple.sharepoint.group.4)/li /ol  can be removed.  I have been trying to accomplish to remove the user its groups memberships using:  precode$ dscl . -delete /Groups/workgroup GroupMembership _denyhosts delete: Invalid Path &lt;dscl_cmd&gt; DS Error: -14009 (eDSUnknownNodeName)  $ dscl . -delete /groups/workgroup GroupMembership _denyhosts delete: Invalid Path &lt;dscl_cmd&gt; DS Error: -14009 (eDSUnknownNodeName)  $ sudo dscl . delete /Groups/workgroup GroupMembership _denyhosts delete: Invalid Path &lt;dscl_cmd&gt; DS Error: -14009 (eDSUnknownNodeName)  $ sudo dseditgroup -o edit -d _denyhosts -t user workgroup Username and password must be provided. /code/pre  I guess that these commands fail because group "workgroup" is not located in a local directory but an LDAP directory:  precode$ dseditgroup -o -read workgroup | grep AppleMetaNode -A 1 dsAttrTypeStandard:AppleMetaNodeLocation -         /LDAPv3/127.0.0.1 /code/pre  But that is not all, because com.apple.sharepoint.group groups are /Local/Default, there code$ sudo dseditgroup -o edit -d _denyhosts -t user com.apple.sharepoint.group.2/code doesn't output an error, but also doesn't remove the _denyhosts user from the group:  precode$ id _denyhosts uid=300(_denyhosts) gid=300(_denyhosts) groups=300(_denyhosts),1025(workgroup),12(everyone),61(localaccounts),403(com.apple.sharepoint.group.2),404(com.apple.sharepoint.group.3),405(com.apple.sharepoint.group.4) /code/pre  https://superuser.com/questions/279891/list-all-members-of-a-group-mac-os-x helped to know that group membership can also be assigned by inheritance. Guess is that such inherited membership is what happens here.  precode$ dscl . -read /Groups/com.apple.sharepoint.group.2 | grep NestedGroupsNestedGroups NestedGroupsNestedGroups: ABCDEFAB-CDEF-ABCD-EFAB-CDEF00000050 ABCDEFAB-CDEF-ABCD-EFAB-CDEF0000000C /code/pre  <answer252059> Try this command to remove the user from a particular group   precodedseditgroup -o edit -d $Username -t user $GroupName /code/pre    precodedseditgroup -o edit -d _denyhosts -t user workgroup /code/pre  <comment350725> For this to work, I had to add authentication with "-u ADMINUSER -p" (or, you could put the directory admin password into the command with "-P PASSWORD" instead).  That was a 10.8 server.
