How to change email settings on iPad so as not to show images by default <body> My friend has an iPad.  I have never used an iPad, but am trying to help her set things up better -- so it's clearly a case of the blind leading the blind.  In my own email (a gmail account, which I read in thunderbird), if I open a message with images, the images are not shown as images -- there's a placeholder where each image would be.  I would like to set things up that way on my friend's iPad.  How do I do that?  She reads both yahoo mail and Exchange on her iPad.  Please make your instructions detailed, clear and idiot-proof -- thank you!!  <answer206655> Go into Settings.app and then go to strongMail, Contacts, Calendars./strong  Scroll down the to strongMail/strong section...  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Z1MsP.png" alt="enter image description here"  I hope this helps!  <answer206656> Perhaps not truly idiot-proof, as this is from an iPhone not an iPad, but the option is the same, even though the layout is slightly different...  Settings  Mail, Contacts, Calendar... switch off 'Load remote Images'  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uitUH.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment249103> You lost me already on the first sentence.  But that part, at least, I was able to google.  Once I got into the settings, your instructions worked great.
