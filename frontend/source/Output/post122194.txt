I cannot change Game Centre Profile name <body> When I first put in my nickname I used emoji with the name. now each time I try to sign in to change the name a box comes up saying to update my account cannot connect to server. As far as I know my account is updated. However the emoji keyboard no longer is available when I sign in. How do I fix this?  <answer122223> To log in to Game Center, you use your Apple ID email and password, not your Game Center nickname. Go to Settings  Game Center, tap your current nickname (under Game Center Profile) and then you should be able to edit it.   <comment142555> Where do you try to login? <comment142619> I always sign in with Apple ID and password as I didn't know you could have a different one for game centre.
