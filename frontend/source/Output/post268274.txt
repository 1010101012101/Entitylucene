El Capitan's Disk Utility won't format new 3 TB drives higher than 800 GB <body> My iMac Mid.2010 running OS X EL Capitan v10.11.6 will not format any of my brand new 2 x 3 TB SATA drives and although I tried any other format like exFat, etc, it keeps making them no higher than 800 gigs.  I do connect each drive to the iMac with a "kdLinks HDD docking station" and a SATA-to-USB2 interface cable. The purpose is to use these 2 drives for Time Machine backups. What am I doing wrong?   Update:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/X2Lsy.png" alt="enter image description here"  Also:   precode2017-01-14 12:59:38.663 defaults[9465:6786462]  The domain/default pair of (/Library/Preferences/com.apple.TimeMachine.plist, MaxSize) does not exist /code/pre  Also from codemount/code:  precode/dev/disk0s2 on / (hfs, local, journaled) devfs on /dev (devfs, local, nobrowse) map -hosts on /net (autofs, nosuid, automounted, nobrowse) map auto_home on /home (autofs, automounted, nobrowse) /dev/disk1s2 on /Volumes/OLDisk (hfs, local, journaled) /dev/disk2s2 on /Volumes/SATADisk2 (hfs, local, nodev, nosuid, journaled) /code/pre  <answer268299> Fire up terminal and do:  codesudo defaults read /Library/Preferences/com.apple.TimeMachine.plist MaxSize/code  if it outputs a codeinteger/code, like code1024000/code  codesudo defaults delete /Library/Preferences/com.apple.TimeMachine.plist MaxSize/code  codediskutil list/code to see that this drive is visible, then create a  new hfs partition (put proper device where code/dev/diskNumber/code is): codediskutil partitionDisk /dev/diskNumber 1 GPT HFS+ volumeName 100%/code  Parameters explained: code1/code is the number of partitions, codeGPT/code is the table scheme, codeHFS+/code is the filesystem and code100%/code is the Volume size. To format 1 HFS+ Volume on the entire drive you do:   codediskutil partitionDisk /dev/diskX 1 GPT HFS+ volumeName 100%/code  To get 2 partitions, each having 50% of your drive:  codediskutil partitionDisk /dev/disk5 2 GPT HFS+ firstVolume 50% secondVolume HFS+ 50%/code  If you want just the GPT table without HFS formatting: change codeHFS+/code to code%noformat%/code  You can try strongAPFS/strong, Apple's new HFS replacement, its still in-dev though and I don't know if ElCaptain supports it, and I definitely strongdon't recommend it/strong for a TM backup, still you can try if it creates the volume   codediskutil apfs create /dev/diskNumber/code                                                                                                              and you will get a warning message that's not very encouraging for backup but see if it creates the partition if HFS+ fails- you can reformat them.  Let me know what kind of errors you get, and what codedefaults read/code tells about MaxSize (if any). Please paste any codediskutil/code output somewhere if you have issues with partitioning.   Update: Why the down votes people :(  <answer268305> Please check the output of codesudo defaults read /Library/Preferences/com.apple.TimeMachine.plist MaxSize/code, its probably because that a system-wide codeMaxSize/code is set.   This command strongcan't harm your system in any way/strong- it will simply read  the value of codeMaxSize/code within your codeTimeMachine/code config .plist file.  codediskutil/code command will also not harm your system- it is meant for partitioning (DiskUtility.app is a UI for it) and it is more verbose then DiskUtil. Let me know what those commands says.   If I remember right, there was some TM limit and 800gb sounds just right. You can also post the whole TimeMachine configuration output, will be easier to check it for some clues:  codesudo defaults read /Library/Preferences/com.apple.TimeMachine.plist/code   strongupdate/strong please, post the output from codediskutil list/code and codemount/code as well.  <answer268428> Your problem is probably related to the 2.2 TB (or 2 TiB) limit. Your disks either have an MBR (instead of a PMBR) or it's a limitation of the firmware of the kdLinks HDD disk station.  Check the disks after getting their disk identifiers with codedisktuil list/code with codesudo gpt -r show diskX/code with diskX the disk identifiers of the external disks (e.g. disk1 and disk2).  If you get an output like this:  precodegpt show: /dev/disk1: Suspicious MBR at sector 0       start       size  index  contents           0          1         MBR           1          1         Pri GPT header           2         32         Pri GPT table          34          6          40     409600      1  GPT part - C12A7328-F81F-11D2-BA4B-00A0C93EC93B      ..... /code/pre  destroy the MBRs and add a proper GUID partition table.  To destroy the MBR and restore a proper GUID pt use:  precodediskutil umountDisk diskX sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/diskX bs=512 count=1 /code/pre  Destroy the GUID partition table and create a new one:  precodediskutil umountDisk diskX sudo gpt destroy diskX sudo gpt create -f diskX /code/pre  with diskX: once more the disk identifiers of your external disks.  Be sure to use the proper diskX or you may accidentally delete valid disks!  hr  After removing the MBR you often/sometimes have to completely eject the drive (or reboot your Mac) for the changes to take effect.  hr  Update:  With your partition data posted one can definitely say it's a 2 TiB problem:  The default size of the disk is 5,860,533,168 blocks. Your gpt output shows a size of 1,565,565,872 blocks. The difference is exactly 4,294,967,296 blocks which are 2sup32/sup blocks or 2 TiB.  <comment336735> What have you been doing thus far? Also can you post the output of `diskutil list` <comment336737> What drive manufacturer? <comment336861> Possibly because someone asked for a match & you gave them the formula for rocket propellant ;) Also, APFS is very much beta only right now. It's not even cross-compatible between 10.12.1 & 10.12.2 - see https://forums.developer.apple.com/thread/67007 <comment336869> Well, you got a point although I don't see any harm in that answer and I edited the `less humorous` comments. Down-vote without any comment isn't very helpful either, I need to keep my (~lack of) humour out. <comment336870> See http://meta.apple.stackexchange.com/questions/2921/why-was-my-answer-down-voted-and-most-importantly-why-did-it-not-require-the-us?cb=1 <comment336871> I knew it!

Thanks. <comment338199> So you said I need a newer machine instead of this old iMac?  Thanks a lot! <comment338200> @opgalloso No, the iMac 2010 and the OS installed shouldn't be affected by the 2TiB limit. It's either a problem of the disk station's firmware or maybe the USB2SATA controller. It may be salvaged by attaching it to a Windows PC and completely repartitioning it.
