Applescript that responds to key presses? <body> I want to write an AppleScript that   ol liruns (in a loop) until I press kbdesc/kbd/li li"listens" for keystrokes kbd1/kbd, kbd2/kbd, etc./li liexecutes a given command for a each keypress (running a shell command codeddcctl/code to change secondary monitor brightness/contrast)/li /ol  I've searched and everything I find relates to emsimulating/em a key press.  (If this can be done in codebash/code that's fine but I don't know enough shell scripting to even start...)  hr  strongUPDATE/strong  Based on this tip, I wrote the shell script below, which works great, but only if I run it emwithin Terminal./em Is there any way to run this script 'invisibly', say, from Spotlight or via AppleScript codedo shell script/code, and have it respond until I exit?  precode#!/bin/bash if [ -t 0 ]; then stty -echo -icanon -icrnl time 0 min 0; fi keypress='' while [ "$k" != "^[" ]; do     case "$k" in         1) ddcctl -d 1 -b 10;;         2) ddcctl -d 1 -b 20;;         3) ddcctl -d 1 -b 30;;         # ...etc...         0) ddcctl -d 1 -b 100;;     esac     k="`cat -v`" done if [ -t 0 ]; then stty sane; fi exit 0 /code/pre  <answer260341> The easiest way of accomplishing this is probably to use Automator to create a Service. The service should just execute your a bash script similar to this:  precode#!/bin/bash ddcctl -d 1 -b 10 /code/pre  Then in System Preference under Keyboard, add a keyboard shortcut to activate your Service.  This way your shortcut will work across all programs.  You'll probably need to do this for each of the 10 keyboard shortcuts you need.  <answer295735> I have just found an amazing solution. You can change the brightness with code-b [+-]number/code. For example:  code#!/bin/bash ddcctl -d 1 -b +10 /code  Reference: How to get system volume control on Dell monitor .  <comment325914> You'll need a different way of capturing key-presses if you want to capture not only within your focused window but system wide. I would suggest that instead you bind the keys you want to use to each execute your apple script with a simple parameter (i.e. bind for example ctrl-1 to execute your script with the parameter 1). <comment325926> Yeah, I know many ways to run a single command from a keystroke; but this is not what I want. I want to launch something, then be able to adjust brightness via 1-9. <comment325945> This can still be achieved using the same method. The bash script that is executed by the keyboard shortcut could just check if your "something" is launched - if it isn't, it doesn't do anything. Then create a dummy program that when launched just hangs around doing nothing until it is closed down. <comment325946> Alternatively if you want to create a standalone program that does this is to use the addGlobalMonitorForEvents method in NSEvent in AppKit. However, I have no idea how easy that is to do from AppleScript. It is relatively easy to do so from Swift however. <comment373487> **Reread the OP.
