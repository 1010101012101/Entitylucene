Is there a fast way to change proxy setting? <body> On my laptop I usually have a ssh connection open and use the remote machine as a proxy server just so that all my network traffic is over ssh. I know that it's hopeless and we're all doomed, but it makes me feel a little better.  Problem is sometimes I need to set and unset it for some reason and then I have to dig through millions of dialogs to get to here...  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4om6J.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  ...so that I can uncheck that option.  Is there a faster way to do that or a way I can set up a script to turn "SOCKS Proxy" on and off? Probably something with Applescript, right?  Is there a way to do this without learning Applescript?  <answer14376> Set up two locations - one with proxy one - one off - you are an Apple menu item away from the switch.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/31Qu8.png" alt="Apple Menu"  Just select network, then edit the locations.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QpdMj.png" alt="network"img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5V83R.png" alt="location"  <answer23469> If you use Alfred, you can try a variant of this extension:  precodee=$(networksetup -getsocksfirewallproxy wi-fi | grep "No")  if [ -n "$e" ]; then   echo "Turning on proxy"   networksetup -setsocksfirewallproxystate wi-fi on else   echo "Turning off proxy"   networksetup -setsocksfirewallproxystate wi-fi off fi /code/pre  For more information, look up the codenetworksetup/code command line function. (Note that you may need to change codewi-fi/code above to something else -- codeethernet/code for wired connections, or codeairport/code if you're on Snow Leopard.)  <comment85299> This method is really inefficient, btw. You are tunnelling TCP over TCP, and it slows things down a lot. Check SSHuttle for one solution, or use a vpn.
