git not works after update to El Capitan <body> I have just updated my OS X to El Capitan.  In previous version I have git installed with Xcode em(as it was recommended settings)/em.  After updating I could not use git. codegit/code command shows.  precodexcrun: error: invalid active developer path (/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools), missing xcrun at: /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/bin/xcrun /code/pre  codegit --version/code also shows same error. I have installed XQuartz but the problem didn't resolve.  I will mostly use git from terminal or from Jetbrains IDE  <answer231741> One solution might be install git again.  But to ensure it works like before you may install Xcode by running  precodexcode-select --install /code/pre  <comment283028> Welcome to Ask Different!
