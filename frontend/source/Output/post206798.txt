Can I move my Dock to the left side of my right monitor? <body> I have set up a two-monitor display, with my laptop on the left and my main screen on the right. I like having the Dock on the left side, but it's on the left of the left monitor, and as such it's too far to the left.   In the Dock settings, I only have the choice of Left (left side of left monitor), Bottom (bottom of left monitor), or Right (right side of right monitor). Is there any way I can set it to the left side of the right monitor?  <answer206800> Unfortunately, I don't think that you can. OS X likely sees both the MacBook's display and the external monitor as one screen. Since you can't normally put the Dock in the middle of the screen, I doubt that you can put it on on the left side of the right monitor.  <answer206811> Try this:  First, set the primary monitor:  ul liOpen System Preferences/li liChoose Displays/li liSelect the Monitors tab/li liDrag the small white bar that appears on the graphic of your screen to the screen where you want the dock to reside. In this case, from the left to the right screen./li liYour screens will blank out briefly and the dock should appear where you want it./li /ul  Also:  ul liBack in System Preferences, select Mission Control/li liSelect "Displays have Separate Spaces"/li /ul  Doing the second list may actually put the dock on both screens, if that was more convenient for you.  sup* I, unfortunately, don't have access to my other monitors to confirm this so the points may be general./sup  <answer252994> I too have tried to have this setup, looking in display settings the closest thing that worked was this. It's not perfect but it does the job! Rearrange the left screen so that the screens meet at diagonals.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wYbFk.png" alt="System Preferences &gt; Displays &gt; Arrangement"  <comment249557> A non-Apple suggestion would be [DragThing](http://www.dragthing.com/english/about.html) which is a Dock substitute that's been going since before the Dock existed. Can be pinned to anywhere, any screen. Not free, but I wouldn't be without it. No affiliation, just been using it since 1995 ! <comment273980> This is not working, when you have a monitor left of your main monitor (the one you dragged the bar to) and you position your dock left, your left monitor will be the one displaying the dock no matter what. That was the original problem of this question.
