Free iPhone from pictures and access them on demand <body> I'm running in a head scratching problem with my iPhone.   I'm running out of memory and the main cause are the picture made with the camera.  Is there a way to unload them from the iPhone and simply access them on demand via internet, more or less like I do with iTunes match, where simply I can delete all the music from the iPhone when is full and then download only the ones I want.  Or other tricks to solve my storage problem!  <comment120733> Have you tried transferring them to your main machine simply by plugging in the iPhone with the USD cable? Or do you actually need them online? <comment120751> Where on Internet would you store them? <comment121016> @Melwan yep I passed them on the mac, and deleted them from the iphone. this solved the space problem, but then those pictures are not reachable any more. <comment121018> @Buscarì›ƒ I would like a system like itunes match that sync the pictures among all your devices keeping them online and showing you maybe a small preview of the picture, and give you the possibility of downloading the high quality version if you want. But I know photostream is pretty limited by now; only 1000 pics and no albums. Is there an alternative? <comment121019> Take look at Amazon online storage offering http://aws.amazon.com/s3/ <comment121025> how do I hook it into the phone camera app?
