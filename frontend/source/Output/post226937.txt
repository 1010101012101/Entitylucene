How to prevent someone accessing my iMac <body> My desktop is in the living room where anyone visiting can access it.  I'd like to make it secure from those in my home since I have a roommate.  <answer226942> You can't make it emtruly/em secure; there is a saying that says given enough time, physical access is root access. That being said, there are some steps you can take to get as close as possible.  h1FileVault/h1  Enable filevalult. This will keep people from accessing your data if they boot from an external drive. To do this, go to codeSystem Preferences/code - codeSecurity &amp; Privacy/code - codeFileVault/code, and click codeTurn On FileVault/code. This will most likely require an admin password, and will probably take a very long time, depending on how much stuff is on your computer. That being said, it's worth it.  h1Screen lock/h1  Enable auto-locking of your computer after a set amount of time. This can be done in codeSystem Preferences/code - codeSecurity &amp; Privacy/code - codeGeneral/code. Check the box that says coderequire password [5 minutes] after sleep or screensaver begins/code and change it to your desired amount of time.  h1Firmware lock/h1  To prevent booting into single user mode or from an external disk without a password, enable firmware lock.  strongWARNING: THIS IS VERY HARD TO RECOVER FROM IF YOU LOSE YOUR PASSWORD. DON'T LOSE IT./strong  To do this, shut down your computer and turn it on while holding the kbdCommand/kbd+kbdR/kbd keys. This will put you in recovery mode. Click the Utilities menu, and select the Firmware Password Utility. Click codeTurn On Firmware Password.../code and set a password. You will need it to boot from anything other than your main partition, so keep it safe! If you have an older Mac (Pre-2011, I think) there is a trick to get around this, but it requires removing the RAM, so it's pretty unlikely.  <answer226950> There's never a way to make it entirely secure, especially with physical access. However, you can significantly increase the difficulty.  I would recommend following this guide by hardentheworld.org to harden OS X. It's pretty long, but I'll list the steps quickly here: bold is more important.  ul liAllow only signed apps/li liCheck Privacy permissions/li liDestroy FileVault Keys/li liDisable Bonjour/li liDisable Creation of Metadata Files/li liDisable Diagnostics/li listrongDisable Guest user/strong/li liDisable Handoff/li liDisable password hints/li liDisable recent items/li liDisable Spotlight localization/li liDisable Spotlight Suggestions/li listrongEnable FileVault/strong/li listrongEnable Firewall/strong/li liEnable screen saver/li liEmpty trash securely/li liErase free space/li liPower off memory during standby/li listrongRequire an administration password/strong/li listrongRequire password to un-lock/strong/li liSave to Disk by Default/li listrongSet a Firmware Password/strong/li liShow all filename extensions/li liShow when localization is used/li liUsers privilege separation/li /ul  In addition, I'd recommend the following:  ul liEnable secure virtual memory (it's on by default)/li liSeparate your user account from your administrator one/li /ul  <comment275573> Lock the screen everytime you leave it or do you need other security - note that physical access to the mac will allow complete access if they reboot it to sing;e user mode <comment275613> @Mark Which can easily be prevented.
