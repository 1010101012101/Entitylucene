How do I change the PIN on an iPhone? <body> A simple one, I guess:  I recently bought a new (unlocked) iPhone, and at the same time changed my phone subscription to another operator. strongHow can I set the PIN code on the new SIM card/strong to something other than the default? With a quick look, I couldn't find anything related in iPhone settings.  <answer3057> You can find the option under Settings  Phone  SIM PIN.  <answer290747> You can go see here. All you have to do is :  ul liGo to "settings"/li liTap "security"/li liThen "set up SIM card lock"/li /ul  And that's it !   <comment2693> Ah, I somehow overlooked that. I guess "Phone" was just too obvious. :)
