VLC Stuck in playlist mode. I hear audio but no video! <body> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/R0LrQ.png" alt="Screen shot"  My VLC player is stuck in playlist mode, and I can not get it to play the video but I can hear Audio. It doesn't work on any of my videos. But all my quick time files work. My VLC is up to date. It was working earlier today, I made no adjustments then a few hours ago I went to open up a video and I can't get it out of playlist mode to show the video.  <answer256249> Go to Preferences and click reset all.  <comment286824> Maybe it's in full-screen mode? When videos are played full-screen, they appear in a separate space from the current desktop. <comment286827> No I've tried looking for it already that's not it. <comment287666> Exact same problem here - VLC 2.2 on OSX EL Capitan 10.11.4. <comment319554> Hi Parker, welcome to Ask Different, please provide a small detailed description of the answer to maintain a good quality answer.
