Round iPod connector <body> My car stereo claims to support my iPod touch, and has an iPod connector that is round. The car is second-hand, and no cable was supplied. It emisn't/em the specific adapter shown below - nor indeed that specific ipod, but it is the same connector - and simply, I don't recognise it.  Searching for "round ipod cable" hasn't been fruitful. is this a common/known connector type?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/JMxQw.jpg" alt="Stereo adapter"  <answer2171> My first thought on seeing that was that it looks like a 9 pin DIN connector. So I did a quick Google and it looks like there are such things as 9 pin DIN to iPod leads. This lead for example looks to match (though the picture quality is rubbish so it's hard to tell).  <comment1836> Specifically, that's a mini-DIN connector.
