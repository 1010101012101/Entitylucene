How to fix OS X Server mail forwarding to multiple addresses? <body> Under OS X Server Mountain Lion, we are creating accounts in LDAP via Workgroup Manager.  We would like to be able to manage forwarding-only mail accounts from within the GUI (i.e. no editing of the /etc/postfix/aliases file) to multiple target email addresses.  Unfortunately, it looks like there is a possible bug in the forwarding option in an account that cuts off the list of forwards at around 215-ish characters and results in a bounceback email after that point.  Clarification:  If the list of addresses is under 215 characters in length, the forward works fine.  If it goes over 215 characters, one e-mail address is cut off in the middle (e.g. 'myemail@gmai'), bounces backs to the sender, and the rest of the addresses are ignored.  Has anyone encountered this before?  What did you do to fix it?  We would rather have the GUI manage the mail server rather than do this from the command line.  <comment98287> I'm a little confused. Is this 215 character bug a result of setting the forwarding recipients in Workgroup Manager? Or directly into `/etc/postfix/aliases`?
