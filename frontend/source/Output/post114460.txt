Problem with homebrew recipe for ctags <body> I was trying to install codectags/code using codehomebrew/code:  precode&gt;brew install ctags ==&gt; Downloading http://downloads.sourceforge.net/ctags/ctags-5.8.tar.gz Already downloaded: /Library/Caches/Homebrew/ctags-5.8.tar.gz ==&gt; Downloading patches  curl: (22) The requested URL returned error: 404 Error: Failure while executing: /usr/bin/curl -f#LA Homebrew\ 0.9.4\ (Ruby\ 1.8.7-358;\ Mac\ OS\ X\ 10.8.5) https://raw.github.com/gist/4010022/8d0697dc87a40e65011e2192439609c17578c5be/ctags.patch -o 000-homebrew.diff /code/pre  Any idea how I can troubleshoot this?  <answer114462> HTTP 404 Error: Not found. This means the URL referenced something that no longer exists at that location. The problem isn't with codecurl/code, the problem is with the homebrew recipe for codectags/code -- it's out of date.  You can see this for yourself by pointing a browser to the patch URL that the homebrew recipe is trying to the URL that codecurl/code is trying to download from: https://raw.github.com/gist/4010022/8d0697dc87a40e65011e2192439609c17578c5be/ctags.patch  You get a 404 Not Found error from GitHub.  Try updating your recipes, it's likely the codectags/code recipe is out of date:  precodebrew update /code/pre  If that doesn't resolve the problem, report it as an issue for the codectags/code recipe here: https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/issues  <comment134137> `brew update` fixed it.
