Emacs key bindings on other programs <body> I am a heavy Emacs user and would love to have some of my Emacs keyboard bindings when editing text on other apps.  I understand I could program these macros with Keyboard Maestro manually, but I was surprised I could not find any pre-defined macros for this. Before I reinvent the wheel, are there any repositories of keyboard maestro macros out there? Does Keyboard Maestro come with any set of macros that facilitate this process?   <answer119777> Keyboard Maestro macros often have noticeable delays and it's not really the best method for keyboard remapping.  You could create code~/Library/KeyBindings//code and save a property list like this as DefaultKeyBinding.dict instead:  precode{   "~b" = moveWordBackward:;   "~f" = moveWordForward:;   "~F" = moveWordForwardAndModifySelection:;   "~B" = moveWordForwardAndModifySelection:;   "~d" = deleteWordForward:;   "~u" = (uppercaseWord:, moveForward:, moveForward:);   "~l" = (lowercaseWord:, moveForward:, moveForward:);   "~c" = (capitalizeWord:, moveForward:, moveForward:);   "~v" = pageUp:;   "~V" = pageUpAndModifySelection:;   "^V" = pageDownAndModifySelection:;   "^ " = setMark:;   "^w" = deleteToMark:;   "~&lt;" = moveToBeginningOfDocument:;   "~&gt;" = moveToEndOfDocument:;   "~/" = complete:;   "^l" = selectParagraph:;   "~h" = selectParagraph:;   "^_" = undo:;   "^/" = undo:;   "^x" = {     "^x" = swapWithMark:;     "^m" = selectToMark:;   }; } /code/pre  DefaultKeyBinding.dict doesn't work in some applications like Xcode or Firefox. Key combinations that enter dead key states (like ⌥U in the U.S. keyboard layout) can't be reassigned. There are also methods like codeperformClose:/code and codeopenDocument:/code, but they don't work in all applications. See http://www.hcs.harvard.edu/~jrus/site/KeyBindings/Emacs%20Esc%20Bindings.dict or http://www.hcs.harvard.edu/~jrus/site/selectors.html.  Another option is to use a private.xml like this with KeyRemap4Macbook:  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt; &lt;root&gt;   &lt;item&gt;     &lt;name&gt;test&lt;/name&gt;     &lt;identifier&gt;test&lt;/identifier&gt;     &lt;not&gt;{{EMACS_MODE_IGNORE_APPS}}&lt;/not&gt;     &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::P, VK_CONTROL | ModifierFlag::NONE, KeyCode::CURSOR_UP&lt;/autogen&gt;     &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::N, VK_CONTROL | ModifierFlag::NONE, KeyCode::CURSOR_DOWN&lt;/autogen&gt;     &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::B, VK_CONTROL | ModifierFlag::NONE, KeyCode::CURSOR_LEFT&lt;/autogen&gt;     &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::F, VK_CONTROL | ModifierFlag::NONE, KeyCode::CURSOR_RIGHT&lt;/autogen&gt;     &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::P, VK_CONTROL | VK_SHIFT | ModifierFlag::NONE, KeyCode::CURSOR_UP, VK_SHIFT&lt;/autogen&gt;     &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::N, VK_CONTROL | VK_SHIFT | ModifierFlag::NONE, KeyCode::CURSOR_DOWN, VK_SHIFT&lt;/autogen&gt;     &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::B, VK_CONTROL | VK_SHIFT | ModifierFlag::NONE, KeyCode::CURSOR_LEFT, VK_SHIFT&lt;/autogen&gt;     &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::F, VK_CONTROL | VK_SHIFT | ModifierFlag::NONE, KeyCode::CURSOR_RIGHT, VK_SHIFT&lt;/autogen&gt;     &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::B, VK_OPTION | ModifierFlag::NONE, KeyCode::CURSOR_LEFT, VK_OPTION&lt;/autogen&gt;     &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::F, VK_OPTION | ModifierFlag::NONE, KeyCode::CURSOR_RIGHT, VK_OPTION&lt;/autogen&gt;     &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::B, VK_OPTION | VK_SHIFT | ModifierFlag::NONE, KeyCode::CURSOR_LEFT, VK_OPTION | VK_SHIFT&lt;/autogen&gt;     &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::F, VK_OPTION | VK_SHIFT | ModifierFlag::NONE, KeyCode::CURSOR_RIGHT, VK_OPTION | VK_SHIFT&lt;/autogen&gt;     &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::D, VK_OPTION | ModifierFlag::NONE, KeyCode::FORWARD_DELETE, VK_OPTION&lt;/autogen&gt;     &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::V, VK_OPTION | ModifierFlag::NONE, KeyCode::PAGEUP&lt;/autogen&gt;     &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::V, VK_OPTION | VK_SHIFT | ModifierFlag::NONE, KeyCode::PAGEUP, VK_SHIFT&lt;/autogen&gt;     &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::V, VK_CONTROL | VK_SHIFT | ModifierFlag::NONE, KeyCode::PAGEDOWN, VK_SHIFT&lt;/autogen&gt;   &lt;/item&gt; &lt;/root&gt; /code/pre  The key codes have to be changed for keyboard layouts like Dvorak or Colemak. EMACS_MODE_IGNORE_APPS includes terminal emulators, Emacs applications, and VMs, but you can also add custom appdef elements.  There is also a predefined Emacs mode group, but for example the setting for changing ⌥F to ⌥→ also changes ⌥⌘F to ⌥⌘→.  <comment139733> Thanks! How does the link to `EMACS_MODE_IGNORE_APPS` relate to the `private.xml` snippet that you included in the answer? <comment139839> The private.xml includes `not{{EMACS_MODE_IGNORE_APPS}}/not` which makes it not apply to the applications that are listed on the linked page.
