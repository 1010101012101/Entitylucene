iPod nano 7th generation app development <body> What programming language does the iPod nano 7th generation use? I would like to develop an app for my own iPod nano 7th generation.  <answer255195> The iPod nano uses a custom OS for which Apple has not made any documentation available, nor is there any way to load apps onto a nano. Only apps developed by Apple are available on the nano.
