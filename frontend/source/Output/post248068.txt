How Can I Create A Service To Alphabetize A Comma Separated Text String? <body> My understanding is that RegEx will not do this. What will?   My issue, specifically, is extremely messy iTunes genre tags. I would like to merge genre tags that have the same or similar comma separated values, and to merge those values in alphabetical order. I have found scripts that can do this with tab separated lists, but not comma separated strings. I have not been able to find any existing app (or script) that will allow me to merge, for instance:   'Rock, Indie, Soundtrack, Folk, Electronica, Experimental'   with   'Folktronica, Experimental, Soundtrack, Rock, Indie'   to result in   'Experimental, Folktronica, Indie, Rock, Soundtrack'   Another instance might be merging and alphabetizing the genre strings of tracks with classifications such as:  'Harmonica Blues, Electric Blues, Blues'  'Blues, Harmonica Blues, Electric, Harmonica'  'Harmonica, Blues, Electric Blues'  into  'Blues, Electric Blues, Harmonica Blues'  What's my best bet?  <answer249132> I found the/an answer by combining the informationbr here: https://stackoverflow.com/a/23026003br and here: https://stackoverflow.com/a/3445211  The created service looks like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/h5C29.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  I will probably look into how to modify this to work on batches of tracks, which will be a little bit different since the text, itself, isn't, in that instance, specifically selected, but this works for now on a single track at a time basis.   <comment306156> Please add a link to the script(s). The problem here is probably **not** the separator - it may be changed from `tab` or `;` to `,` inside the script - but the rules how to merge categories/genres...
