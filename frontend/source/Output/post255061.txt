Broken Iphone 4s backup - trust your mac <body> My iphone 4s accidentally dropped on the floor and now the screen is not working. I don't have any backup and I've never connected it to my Mac.  Now I want to retrieve some data, but when I connect it to the Mac it says I have to trust this computer, but I'm not able to tap the screen.  Suggestions?
