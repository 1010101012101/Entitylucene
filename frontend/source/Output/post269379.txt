MacBook force click as secondary click <body> Is there a way I can use the force click on my MacBook trackpad as a right click (secondary click)?  <answer269380> Apps can't override a single finger force click, since that always produces a left click action.br Using two fingers, you may as well use the standard two finger tap/click for secondary click.  <answer269457> The BetterTouchTool, as mentioned here, cannot replace the force click per se, but offers you some alternatives, such as "2 finger force click".  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nNUzC.png" alt="BTT"
