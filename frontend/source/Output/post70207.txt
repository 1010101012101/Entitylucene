License problems installing aquaterm via macports <body> I am trying to install aquaterm via macports. I run  precode sudo port install aquaterm /code/pre  This gives back an error:  precode ---&gt;  Building aquaterm  Error: org.macports.build for port aquaterm returned: command execution failed  Please see the log file for port aquaterm for details:        /opt/local/var/macports/logs/_opt_local_var_macports_sources_rsync.macports.org_release_tarballs_ports_aqua_aquaterm/aquaterm/main.log  To report a bug, follow the instructions in the guide: http://guide.macports.org/#project.tickets  Error: Processing of port aquaterm failed /code/pre  In the log file I see:  precode:info:build You have not agreed to the Xcode license agreements, please run 'xcodebuild -license' (for user-level acceptance) or 'sudo xcodebuild -license'  (for system-wide acceptance) from within a Terminal window to review and agree  to the Xcode license agreements. /code/pre  However, when I run   precodesudo xcodebuild -license /code/pre  I receive this message:  precodexcodebuild: error: invalid option '-license' /code/pre  I did not find anything useful on this error on internet.  Did anybody see this error before? Do I need to run xcodebuild in a specific directory?  I am running Mac Os X 10.8.2 and Xcode 4.5.1.  Thanks!  <comment81516> Which version of Xcode is installed? <comment81517> Thanks @patrix for your interest. I am running Mac Os X 10.8.2 and Xcode 4.5.1. <comment81518> Did you install the command line utilities from within Xcode? <comment82577> @patrix I am not sure how I installed them. How can I reinstall them from within Xcode?
