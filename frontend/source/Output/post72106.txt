Cannot differentiate between LEFT ⌘ (0x37) and RIGHT ⌘ (0x36) keys <body> I would like to strongswap the right-kbd⌘/kbd key with the right-kbd⌥/kbd key/strong.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/T0oIl.png" alt="Microsoft Natural 4000"  KeyRemap4MacBook's codeEventViewer/code shows that kbdAlt Gr/kbd key acts as the emleft/em-kbd⌘/kbd (codeCommand_L/code in codeEventViewer/code), whereas I'd like to be the emright/em-kbd⌘/kbd (codeCommand_R/code).  This is what it look like in codeEventViewer/code: first 2 lines are from left-kbd⌘/kbd, next 2 lines are from right-kbd⌘/kbd (with the same strongcode0x37/code/strong code): img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7YqHW.png" alt="enter image description here"  strongHow can I get the right-kbd⌘/kbd key to register as codeCommand_R/code (code0x36/code) instead of codeCommand_L/code (code0x37/code)?/strong  h1About the keyboard/h1  It's the codeMicrosoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000/code with its drivers installed and setup like this: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hcY3e.png" alt="enter image description here"  I'll try my luck with uninstalling the drivers (which don't cause kernel panics anymore, as described here).  <answer94009> Hopefully I misunderstood the question, but did you, um, try remapping them?  precode&lt;root&gt;   &lt;item&gt;     &lt;name&gt;Swap Command_L and Command_R &lt;/name&gt;     &lt;identifier&gt;private.swap_command_l_and_r&lt;/identifier&gt;     &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::COMMAND_R, KeyCode::COMMAND_L&lt;/autogen&gt;     &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::COMMAND_L, KeyCode::COMMAND_R&lt;/autogen&gt;   &lt;/item&gt; &lt;/root&gt; /code/pre  If the problem is that you are not using a Mac keyboard and both L and R are sending the same Keycode, then, as stated in the KeyRempap4MacBook FAQ:      If you are using [non-Apple] vendor's keyboard drivers, KeyRemap4MacBook may not work properly. Please uninstall vendor's keyboard drivers.   <answer94029> Why didn't it try this before? emRemoving/em Microsoft's drivers was the solution! Right-ALT now acts as codeOption_R/code out-of-the-box (and isn't affected by swapping CMD/ALT with OPTION/Windows key on the left side).  <comment110194> What kind of keyboard are you using? <comment110211> @DanielLawson, it's a `Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000`; I'll put it (back) into question. <comment110214> Yes, I did try to remap them by ticking checkmark next to `Commmand_R to Option_R` option in `KeyRemap4MacBook`'s frontend ... which surely translates into something alike your XML (and which also works on a MacBook Air). You're also correct on the 2nd part: the keyboard is the `Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000`, with its drivers installed (I've updated the question). <comment110545> It looks like the Op answered his/her own question.
