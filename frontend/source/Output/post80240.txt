Web-based screensharing applications that works with MacOS 10.5 Leopard? <body> Using MacOS 10.5 Leopard, I want to be able to share my screen with others during a meeting so the people I'm talking to can easily see my screen through a web browser. A free solution would be preferable.  I looked at Join.me, ReadyTalk, and AnyMeeting, but none of those work with MacOS 10.5. Skype's screensharing emdoes/em work, but (a) recipients need Skype (vs. just a web browser), and (b) I don't think you can do one-to-many sharing for free.  Thanks in advance for any suggestions.  <answer80251> Have you tried Screenleap? I'm not sure which versions of Mac OS it supports, but it's worth a try.
