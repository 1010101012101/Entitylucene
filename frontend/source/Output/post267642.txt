Opening Word files from HTTP links in Outlook <body> If I have an email in Outlook containing a link like https://example.com/Document.docx and I click it, it gives me a warning dialog "Do you want to open the file? Some files harm your computer blah blah blah". I click yes and it starts Word, but then nothing. No error message, no document, it's just as if I started Word manually.  If I right-click the link and select codeOpen URL/code it opens it in Chrome and downloads the file which is slightly better.  I did also try running code"/Applications/Microsoft Word.app/Content/MacOS/Microsoft Word" "https://example.com/Document.docx"/code from the command line but it gives a dialog with the error:     Word cannot open the document: User does not have have access privileges (Document.docx)   Is there any way to have Word actually open the file? Or alternatively to make clicking a link behave the same way as right-click-Open URL?  <comment335852> The best you're going to get is to download it then open it. On the website you have no rights to the document at all, so you must work on a local copy. <comment335871> I have the right to open it. Word handles read-only files fine normally - it provides a 'Duplicate' button to create a local writable copy.
