What should the standard contents of $DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH be? <body> I'm trying to install CERN's root libraries on my mac os Lion.  It needs me to set code$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH/code, but on checking   precodeecho $DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH /code/pre  it seems to be empty (before I'm adding to it). Is this normal?   What are code$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH/code's default contents?  <answer40467> I have checked on clean installs of Lion at 10.7.3 and 10.7.3 with server and both have the $DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH variable unset. Installing Xcode doesn't change that variable either on the current OS.
