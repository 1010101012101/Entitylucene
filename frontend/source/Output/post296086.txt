Is it safe to quit kernel_task? <body> I recently quit kernel_task because it was taking a lot of cpu time, when I was about to force quit it it says you will be logged out but I did not care but then after I force quit it I thought does it disrupt the system?  PS. Is quitting the kernel_task same as logging out?  <answer296090> Killing codekernel_task/code is "killing" your entire system.    It's not the same as logging out; it's asking you to log out because everything will be going down.  From What Is kernel_task, and Why Is It Running on My Mac?     A “kernel,” if you didn’t know, is at the core of any operating   system, sitting between your CPU, memory, and other hardware and the   software that you run. When your turn on your Mac, the kernel is the   first thing that starts, and basically everything you do on your   computer flows through the kernel at some point. Activity Monitor puts   all of this varied activity under one banner: kernel_task.   <comment373921> don't do that. Kernel Task is the core of the os and without it you don't have a usable operating system. <comment373957> So should I worry about any software damage? And does reinstall of OS fix it.Because after I force quit kernel_task I decided to reinstall OS. PS. I did a reinstall because in my internet speed it only takes 6 minutes. <comment373959> And yes totally agree, but I had done it twice or thrice but I had encountered not problem. <comment373966> Realistically, the only damage would be to open files.  You don't need to resinstall macOS after you do something; there's no point in doing so unless there's a bonafide reason.
