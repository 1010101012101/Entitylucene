Apple iPhone 5s 2 Apple IDs <body> When you set up your Apple ID when you first get your phone can you set up another once you have signed in on that account?  <answer248686> Yes, you just need to sign out the existing 1, then you are free to login using different Apple ID. Apple ID is not tied to only 1 particular device. However only 1 logon Apple ID at 1 time.  <answer248690> Short answer, yes, long answer, it's going to be a lot more trouble than it's worth. You'll have to constantly swap between them to get downloads/updates etc.  Each app/book/tune etc, even the iOS itself belongs to the account that purchased it.  If you really must have 2 IDs on one phone, the best solution is probably to set up Family Sharing &amp; join both IDs to the same 'family'.
