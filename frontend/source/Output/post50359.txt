What is a method for sharing an Aperture library? <body> As a group (work, family,...), you produce an Aperture library on your computer.  Others (spouse, coworker...) in the group now want to access and edit this library from other computers.  Any solutions?  <answer50365> Put the library file in a folder that is accessible to other computers and set permissions so that it can be accessed/edited by other users. You also need to be certain that only one person is editing the file at any given time – the software isn't designed as a shared database and I don't know what, if any, protections it provides against this scenario.   You can also use emreferenced/em images instead of emmanaged/em and put strongthose/strong images in a shared space. strongHowever/strong, other users will only have access to the master images and you will want to beware of external edits that are emdestructive/em to those master files. Changes to that file hierarchy itself (file moves, renames, etc) made outside of emAperture/em will result in embroken links/em and you'll have to relocate the images from inside Aperture. . I prefer the simplicity, security and embeauty/em of a emmanaged/em library.   emIn what way is this/em lock-in? It's a simple case of access to a database file. Granted the file — a emsparse bundle/em containing images, metadata and edit instructions in which your master images are stored in their original format — is proprietary to emAperture/em but the master files remain available should you emlose/em Aperture for some reason.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ltTv5.png" alt="screen shot of Contextual Menu option to Show Package Contents of Aperture Library"  emAccessing the files contained within the Aperture Library package using a right (control)-click/em  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ykXxc.png" alt="screen shot showing contents of Aperture Library package including master image"  emInside the library bundle your master images are filed, hierarchically by import date, in their original format. They can be copied out as you wish./em  I fail to see this as an example of Apple emforcing/em the eco system on you. You are not forced to use emAperture/em if you don't like it's features and limitations and departure is a simple emexport/em (of versions and masters) or "unbundling" of the library file (masters only) away.   emBeautiful indeed./em  <comment57759> Be wary of using such pejoratives with the anticipated audience here, especially when added to that fact that you are *asking for help* ;)  Also, be mindful of understanding the principles of such wonderful sounding soundbites - the "lock-in" meme would only really be suitable if, once you have started using Aperture, you could not *stop* using Aperture.  As it stands, it's merely a tool you can choose to use as a paid piece of software, and you are welcome to export and use your photos in the tool of your choice, *sans lock-in*, at any point. <comment57760> Good points, remember that Aperture is a personal photo management system that costs £50.  It's not really intended to be usable as a professional solution for collaborative photo management with other users.  Tools exist for export and even sync of select photos, but the Database file itself is designed for use by a single person at a time, running a local copy of the program, and there's nothing wrong with that. <comment57761> It is intended as a professional solution – iPhoto is the personal solution – but it isn't designed for collaboration or multi-users. <comment57763> I'd argue more "home enthusiast", their own description steers clear of using the word Professional other than to describe available themes and image effects.  It describes it as "Designed for iPhoto users who want to get more from their photos" <comment57764> Originally sold for $500, then reduced to $199 prior to availability on App Store,  and aimed squarely at professionals. I'd argue that the wording is aimed at expanding the market rather than fundemental changes to the software. <comment57994> I have removed the lock-in comment as it is not key to my question.  Lock-in here referred to all the work that went into managing my picture which I do not think I can recover even using iPhoto, let alone a not mack product.  To avoid loosing this work (sorting, tagging, face recognition, non-destructive editing...), I have to continue using Aperture.  Admittedly, this is opinion, so again I have removed the unnecessary comment. <comment61797> Wohoo!  iPhoto now opens Aperture libraries!  I learned my lesson, whining is productive! <comment61818> Thanks for the update, useful to know :)
