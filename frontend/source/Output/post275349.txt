Using micro cd's in a MacBook Pro <body> Is there a proper way to insert micro cd's so they are less likely to get stuck inside the cd slot on my MacBook pro?   <answer275351> Your MacBook Pro User Guide will state the following:  precodeSlot-loading SuperDrive This optical drive reads and writes standard-size CDs and DVDs. /code/pre  By standard-size CDs and DVDs it means that the slot-loading drive is not designed to take mini/micro optical discs of any sort.  Instead, you will need an external tray-loading optical drive or access to an older Mac with one. Of course, if it's some sort of promotional material, software, etc, then you may be able to view/download it from the internet.
