I would like to unlock and use this partition when ever I want not every time. So I want Mac leave it and do not ask me the password automatically at the startup every time iMac, Mac OS X (10.7.4)  <answer56521> Add the following line to the strong/etc/fstab/strong file:     LABEL= none hfs ro,noauto   Being code&lt;label&gt;/codethe name of the encrypted volume.  If you are just wondering, strongro/strong means emread only/em (you should use coderw/codeinstead, if you want to emread and write/em after mount).  strongNote/strong that the file could not exist, therefore you'll have create it. To do so just open strong/Applications/Utilities/Terminal/strong and type:  ol lisudo vi /etc/fstab/li liThis will prompt the password. Type it. It won't be shown, don't worry./li liAdd the already mentioned line./li liHit kbdEscape/kbd, type strong:wq/strong, and hit kbdEnter/kbd/li /ol  <comment64896> You might consider using nano in Apple SE. This is not SU. <comment64899> The *instructions* are pretty straight forward, there's no need to be a *Super User* to use them. And he can still use whatever program he wants, of course, this was just a tip. Never used Nano, though. <comment64903> If you're on Mac vi is way off the used user experience. nano is easier. Try it!
