Installing ODBC via HomeBrew <body> I installed freetds and unixodbc via Homebrew, more or less following the directions found in this sql server and odbc on Mac link.  I diverged from those directions when it came to the location for the driver and setup, instead using  precodeDriver = /usr/local/Cellar/unixodbc/2.3.2_1/lib/libodbc.dylib Setup = /usr/local/Cellar/unixodbc/2.3.2_1/lib/libodbc.dylib /code/pre  in the file code/usr/local/Cellar/unixodbc/2.3.2_1/etc/odbcinst.ini/code since this is where I found my ODBC dynamic libraries.  (I also made those changes because Macs do not use *.so files, that's a *nix nomenclature, which I admit made me nervous in following those directions, but they did seem to match advice at other sites, such as this one for installing RODBC on Mac and these great instructions for *nix.)  I have tried to run it, made changes, done a trace via dtruss, specifically doing this command:  precodedtruss isql -v odbc-test &lt;my_user_id&gt; &lt;associated_password&gt; 2&gt; junk_to_sift_through.txt /code/pre  No matter how I adjust things - without actively breaking them further - I keep getting the following error:  precode[IM004][unixODBC][Driver Manager]Driver's SQLAllocHandle on SQL_HANDLE_HENV failed [ISQL]ERROR: Could not SQLConnect /code/pre  The codejunk_to_sift_through.txt/code generated file with errors is fairly large, but below is the tail end of it, which emshould/em have the error hidden somewhere in it.  But I cannot seem to figure it out.  precodeopen_nocancel("/usr/local/Cellar/unixodbc/2.3.2_1/etc/odbcinst.ini\0", 0x0, 0x1B6)       = 3 0 fstat64(0x3, 0x7FFF53378CB8, 0x1B6)      = 0 0 read_nocancel(0x3, "[ms-sql]\nDescription = TDS connection\nDriver = /usr/local/Cellar/unixodbc/2.3.2_1/lib/libodbc.2.dylib\nUsageCount = 1\nFileUsage = 1\nTrace = Yes\n\0", 0x1000)        = 143 0 read_nocancel(0x3, "\0", 0x1000)         = 0 0 close_nocancel(0x3)      = 0 0 open_nocancel("/Users/mike/.odbcinst.ini\0", 0x0, 0x1B6)         = 3 0 fstat64(0x3, 0x7FFF53378CB8, 0x1B6)      = 0 0 read_nocancel(0x3, "[ms-sql]\nDescription = TDS connection\nDriver = /usr/local/Cellar/unixodbc/2.3.2_1/lib/libodbc.2.dylib\nUsageCount = 1\nFileUsage = 1\nTrace = Yes\n\0", 0x1000)        = 143 0 read_nocancel(0x3, "\0", 0x1000)         = 0 0 close_nocancel(0x3)      = 0 0 fstat64(0x1, 0x7FFF5337CD08, 0x1000)         = 0 0 write_nocancel(0x2, "[ISQL]ERROR: Could not SQLConnect\n\0", 0x22)       = 34 0 write_nocancel(0x1, "[IM004][unixODBC][Driver Manager]Driver's SQLAllocHandle on SQL_HANDLE_HENV failed\n\0", 0x53)  = 83 0 /code/pre  Any ideas out there?  Thanks!
