Where is the httpd error log file on Lion? <body> I'm running a local web (development) server on my mac with apache installed.  I'm sure it depends on my apache config but basically I just want to run codetail -f /var/log/httpd-error.log/code in a terminal so I can see the error and warnings that occur during the development of my websites.  So my question is where or how do I find where this log file is placed since it is not placed in code/var/log//code  <answer40714> The Error Log is located at: /var/log/apache2/error.log  This is for Lion...  <answer40715> Is code/private/var/log/apache2/error_log/code what you are looking for?  <answer40718> As morth pointed out, for the default Mac OS X Apache installation these are located in: code/var/log/apache2/error_log/code.  The location can be changed in the httpd config using the ErrorLog directive, even for individual virtual hosts. Also note that if you installed another Apache besides the built-in one (like through MacPorts, or MAMP), this probably is different for you too. In that case you should have a look at the httpd.conf or equivalent for your installation.  codetip:/code If you have Growl installed, also have a look at this 'growltail' script. I think it's great to get notified of errors while developing, without having the need to switch back to the Terminal all the time.  <answer112204> precode#/usr/sbin/httpd -V Server version: Apache/2.2.24 (Unix) Server built:   Aug 24 2013 21:10:43 Server's Module Magic Number: 20051115:31 Server loaded:  APR 1.4.5, APR-Util 1.3.12 Compiled using: APR 1.4.5, APR-Util 1.3.12 Architecture:   64-bit Server MPM:     Prefork   threaded:     no     forked:     yes (variable process count) Server compiled with....  -D APACHE_MPM_DIR="server/mpm/prefork"  -D APR_HAS_SENDFILE  -D APR_HAS_MMAP  -D APR_HAVE_IPV6 (IPv4-mapped addresses enabled)  -D APR_USE_FLOCK_SERIALIZE  -D APR_USE_PTHREAD_SERIALIZE  -D SINGLE_LISTEN_UNSERIALIZED_ACCEPT  -D APR_HAS_OTHER_CHILD  -D AP_HAVE_RELIABLE_PIPED_LOGS  -D DYNAMIC_MODULE_LIMIT=128  -D HTTPD_ROOT="/usr"  -D SUEXEC_BIN="/usr/bin/suexec"  -D DEFAULT_PIDLOG="/private/var/run/httpd.pid"  -D DEFAULT_SCOREBOARD="logs/apache_runtime_status"  -D DEFAULT_LOCKFILE="/private/var/run/accept.lock"  -D DEFAULT_ERRORLOG="logs/error_log"  -D AP_TYPES_CONFIG_FILE="/private/etc/apache2/mime.types"  -D SERVER_CONFIG_FILE="/private/etc/apache2/httpd.conf"  #find / -name error_log /code/pre  <answer112613> It's normally code/var/log/apache2/error_log/code but...  Note that there's certain types of strongerrors which can occur before apache starts logging/strong, which might lead you to believe that you're looking in the wrong place. If you seem to be having trouble starting apache, and it's not logging any new errors, try doing:  precodesudo bash -x /usr/sbin/apachectl -k start /code/pre  or try  precodesudo apachectl -e debug /code/pre  or bypass the apachectl script and try just  precodesudo httpd -k start /code/pre  <comment46446> Doesn't lion use apache2 and not apache in /var/log to contain the web server logs? Also, the Console app in /Applications/Utilities is the "Cocoa" log viewer, but it's not as handy as tail for most developers other than to explore the contents of /var/log or peek at multiple logs for short durations.
