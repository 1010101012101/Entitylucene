Taking forever to move files to the trash <body> Finder is taking forever to move, rename, etc. files, especially when moving to the trash or emptying the trash.  Here is a video http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI1jlh8d6C0&amp;feature=youtube_gdata_player  It takes 80-95% of my CPU and spins 13 threads to think about it for a few minutes: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/oE13i.png" alt="enter image description here" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NH95k.png" alt="enter image description here"  About my Mac:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/OXlDp.png" alt="enter image description here" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bplce.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer75794> So, I took it to the Apple store, they weren't really any help. I held down codeoption/code and reinstalled the OS in-place and that worked! Finally I can use Finder again .. whew! Let me know if this helped you.  <comment87614> What happens if you move the folder elsewhere in the filesystem instead of moving the files to the Trash, does it also need a long time? Does the folder reside on a external hard drive? How full is the hard drive where the folder is located? <comment87620> Sometimes yes. No externals connected. 12GB remaining. <comment87645> I don't understand the disconnect between the `% CPU` column data and the data at the bottom of the window, both numbers and graph. <comment87709> How old is the system you are working with? Was it a fresh 10.8 install or have you updated your OS for years? I'm thinking directory data corruption. <comment87794> This is a brand new retina mbp <comment87795> Video of the problem added <comment87796> @Josh The `% CPU` column shows a per-core percentage, while the graph is an aggregate of all cores. <comment87797> @KirkStrobeck Check out [XBench](http://www.xbench.com/) and see how you stack up. The drive may be doing strange things, possibly a dud controller or some such thing. Also, HDD or SSD? <comment87798> @alexandru, thanks for the clarification... that makes sense. <comment87810> How large is the folder and how many files are contained within? Folders with lots of files (500) can take a while to process prior to deleting--both when moving to the trash and emptying the trash. <comment87987> I see this all the time on my MacBook Pro running 10.8.x. I suspect it's due to HDDs and sloppy, inefficient coding in Mountain Lion. This is up to Apple to fix. I never saw this behaviour in the 10.6 Finder. <comment87993> Great if it worked for you. I assume manually clearing out the trash via Terminal (`rm -rf ~/.Trash`) wasn't helpful? <comment88343> I'm not sure .. I never tried it. I went with the advice from the Apple Store
