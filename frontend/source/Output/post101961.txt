Gmail lock screen notifications don't appear on iPod Touch, but the device still wakes from sleep <body> I've got the Gmail iOS app installed on my iPod Touch 5. Also, I have set the app to only show notifications for "Important" emails (which are indicated with a yellow tab in the web version of Gmail). Sometimes, when I get an important email, the email will show (as expected) on my iPod Touch's lock screen as a notification. However, sometimes the iPod Touch will wake from sleep to show the lock screen, but no notification appears.  Is this something that I can fix on my end? Or is it a bug with the Gmail iOS app itself?  <comment120129> What are your settings for gmail in settings- notifications?  Also does this happen for 'important' messages? Or others? <comment120131> All notification types are enabled for my Gmail app. This happens only for "Important" Gmail emails. It doesn't happen for non-Important emails, and it does not happen for any other app, at least that I can see.
