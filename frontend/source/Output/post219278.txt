What is the best free option for automatic ftp sync with finder? <body> I was quite happy when I found out that Finder had native support, but it didn't take long until I realized it was read-only access.   What is the best free option for automatic ftp sync with finder? I am using El Capitan. I'm not interested in very much functionality, just the ability to edit files.  <answer219290> FileZilla, but beware of the adware in the installer, as its hosted on SourceForge. CyberDuck, in the App Store, is another good option; both support editing and syncing back to the server.  <answer219293> h2TextWrangler/h2  You can use BareBones' Text Wranger. It is a free texteditor with onboard codeftp/code capability. TextWrangler is BBEdit's little brother, and BBEdit is emone of the best/em text editors. I use this text editor at least since Mac OS 7.6 And, just like BBEdit, TextWrangler does not suck.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ig1rE.png" alt="Demo image from barebones.com"  <comment265202> Is there a free version of CyberDuck? And can I have an automatically synced finder folder with FileZilla? <comment265210> Yes -- on their website, there's a [Download button](https://cyberduck.io) between the Windows download and the Mac App Store link. Sorry, I'd forgotten that the App Store version was for pay. And yes, there's a File  Synchronize option, though I've never used it myself. <comment265228> So, do you want FTP acces? Or do you to be able to sync? Or do you just want the ability to edit files? <comment265256> I want FTP access automatically syncing with a finder folder I can edit. Dropbox-style.
