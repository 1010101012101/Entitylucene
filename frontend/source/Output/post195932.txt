How do I resize the magnifier/zoom window in iOS 8? <body> My wife lets our baby daughter play with my iPad, and something she did has caused the magnifier/zoom window (one of the accessibility features) to end up tall and narrow instead of the usual size and shape. How do I resize it so that it is more useful again?  <answer195957> What you want to do is:  ol liToggle the zoom/li liLocate the rounded rectangle at the bottom of the zoom window(the one you use to move the zoom window around) img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rBYtg.png" alt="Step 2"/li liTap that once(strongwithout dragging/strong)  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zKtfw.png" alt="Step 3"/li liTap "Resize Lens"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/AkKlF.png" alt="Step 4"/li liUse the classic resize tools img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1D29E.png" alt="Step 5"/li liTap outside of the window to save the configuration./li /ol  Hope that helps!  <comment233930> I was going to say ask the baby, but that might not work :)
