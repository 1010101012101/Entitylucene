Create Keynote presentation automatically <body> At the introduction of Keynote in 2003 they said that Keynote presentations would be a XML-based open file format and so, keynote presentations could be created programmatically by 3rd party applications.br Is this still possible in Keynote 6.2?  <answer127973> Until Keynote 6, this was true. However, Keynote 6 uses packages for storing keynotes:  precodetest.key ├── Data ├── Index.zip ├── Metadata │   ├── BuildVersionHistory.plist │   ├── DocumentIdentifier │   └── Properties.plist ├── preview-micro.jpg ├── preview-web.jpg └── preview.jpg /code/pre  This doesn't stop you from creating older-style XML keynotes, since Keynote 6 is backwards compatible.
