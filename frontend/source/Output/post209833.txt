How to disable mouse acceleration without logging out? <body> I know I can type in the terminal:  precodedefaults write .GlobalPreferences com.apple.mouse.scaling -1 /code/pre  to turn off mouse acceleration strongBUT/strong this requires me to log out and log back in to take effect. The problem is that I'm using a Mac in a network that resets all user preferences every time I log out. So when I log back in, everything is back to default settings. I've tried typing in the terminal:  precodecurl -O http://ktwit.net/code/killmouseaccel chmod +x killmouseaccel ./killmouseaccel mouse /code/pre  which turns off mouse acceleration strongbut/strong the problem is that it also resets the tracking speed to very low. If I try to increase the tracking speed in System Preferences, it turns acceleration back on.  Is there a way to disable mouse acceleration without logging out? If not, is there a way to set tracking speed to the max level after using "./killmouseaccel mouse" without turning acceleration back on?  <comment253159> There is no `killmouseaccel` by default, so this seems to be a custom script. What exactly does it do? And if you are using a mouse anyway, can't you change the tracking speed in Preferences? <comment253240> @patrix killmouseaccel completely disables mouse acceleration. When acceleration is disabled, a fast mouse movement moves the cursor just as much as a slow mouse movement. I can change the tracking speed in Preferences, but as I mentioned above, it turns acceleration back on as soon as I adjust it. <comment253242> @patrix I read about killmouseaccel in [this site](http://osxdaily.com/2010/06/02/kill-os-x-mouse-acceleration-from-the-command-line/) <comment274595> @patrix I edited my post, now I included the whole custom script that kills mouse acceleration. It turns off mouse accel but it resets the tracking speed to a very low setting.
