Change the default save location for Excel 2016 <body> I want to change the default save location for Excel files (Office Mac 2016), but cannot find anywhere to do it (unlike Word).  <answer225367> ol liSave an Excel file in the folder you wish to set as default /li liSelect "Open" from the File menu/li liIn the green vertical banner, select "Open"/li liNavigate to the folder/li liSelect and open an Excel file from that folder/li /ol  The folder will now be the default save location.  This seems clumsy and there may be another way, but it seems this unhelpful opacity is a feature of Office 2016.  <answer268696> •  In Excel, navigate to File|Options|Save.   •  Check "Save to Computer by default"   •  Enter "Default local file location"  <comment369428> purplemac's solution works, clumsy as it is @Sparker - do not see "file/options" in my navigation should really be in Preferences/Save....
