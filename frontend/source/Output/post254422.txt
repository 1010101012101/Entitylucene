Resetting the "Recent places" in "save as" dialog to default <body> I am using OS X 10.11.6.  I wanted to increase the items listed in the "recent places" in the "save as dialog", so I followed the instruction here: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/5185944?tstart=0  and typed the command in the terminal:  precodedefaults write .GlobalPreferences NSNavRecentPlacesLimit -int 12 /code/pre  Then I discovered that it didn't work, and instead my "recent places" is not changing anymore.  So I tried to reset by typing the below in the terminal:  precodedefaults delete .GlobalPreferences NSNavRecentPlaces /code/pre  Now the recent places is completely gone in the save as dialog.  I created a new user with admin right, logged into it and also found the recent places is gone from the save as dialog.  I also tried to download OnyX for El Capitan → Parameters → General → Restore Defaults, but this didn't work either.  How can I reset the recent places back to the original?  <answer254427> With El Capitan 10.11.6, here's the output from codedefaults read .GlobalPreferences NSNavRecentPlaces/code on my system.  pre (     "~/Desktop/news",     "~/Documents/text",     "~/Documents/text/news",     "~/Documents/astronomy",     "/Volumes/Video" ) /pre  Try codedefaults write .GlobalPreferences NSNavRecentPlaces -array /Applications/code to restore a value for the codeNSNavRecentPlaces/code key.  There is no codeNSNavRecentPlacesLimit/code key in code.GlobalPreferences/code for El Capitan on my system. The following list of keys are part of the output from codedefaults find NSNav/code which is a long list. I assume these are the default settings. Here are the codeNSNav/code keys:  pre Found 9 keys in domain 'Apple Global Domain': {     NSNavPanelFileLastListModeForOpenModeKey = 2;     NSNavPanelFileLastListModeForSaveModeKey = 2;     NSNavPanelFileListModeForOpenMode2 = 2;     NSNavPanelFileListModeForSaveMode2 = 2;     NSNavPanelSidebarKeyForOpen =     (     );     NSNavPanelSidebarKeyForSave =     (     );     NSNavRecentPlaces =     (         "~/Desktop/news",         "~/Documents/text",         "~/Documents/text/news",         "~/Documents/astronmy",         "/Volumes/Video"     );     NSNavSortOrder =     (         NSNavDisplayNameFileProperty,         1     );     "NSNavSortOrder_10.6" =     (         displayName,         1     ); } /pre  Try codedefaults delete .GlobalPreferences NSNavRecentPlacesLimit/code to remove the key you added. The discussions article seems to be about OS X versions before El Capitan and may not be relevant or useful with OS 10.11.  <comment316776> Next time you want to mod, don't use global preferences ;-) and make a backup!
