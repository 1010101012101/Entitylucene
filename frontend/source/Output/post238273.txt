Time Machine partition won't mount in OSX El Capitan, but mounts in Bootcamp Windows 10 <body> Not sure what happened. Two days ago I just did a Time Machine backup and today the partition won't mount. The external disk is a WD My Passport bought several years ago and total 2 TB. I partitioned it into two partitions, 1TB each. One partition for Time Machine and one for general backup. Both are formatted as OSX Extended Journal. Usually when I plug in the drive both partitions will mount, but today only the Backup partition mounts. If I try to Eject the Backup partition the disk is greyed out and it seems the system is trying to eject it forever and ever. When I open Disk Utility it just keeps loading and loading and loading, see screenshot. I have Restarted many times, unplugged and plugged both ends of the USB cable, no luck yet.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HyQGK.png" alt="enter image description here"  Strangely enough when I plug in the drive onto my Bootcamp Windows 10 both partitions mount just fine and I can read files on both. So seems like the drive itself works fine, just OSX is refusing to mount it. Can anyone help figure out what to do here? Thank you very much.

I have posted it as you requested. Looks like the Time Machine partition can be seen from this command. <comment292133> Ok, post a dump of the drives's partition tables.  The commands are `sudo  fdisk  /dev/disk1` and `sudo  gpt  -r  show  /dev/disk1`. These commands will not change your computer. Some commands may ask for your login password. This is normal. If everything looks Ok, then I will have you run a command to verify the filesystem of the partition that will not mount. (i.e. `diskutil  verifyvolume  /dev/disk1s2`) <comment292134> Thanks again @DavidAnderson. I've posted everything you asked for, but the verifyvolume failed. <comment292135> You can run the command to repair the volume but I doubt it will do any good. The command is `diskutil  repairvolume  /dev/disk1s2`. If repair fails, I am out of ideas. Either erase the partition or wait for someone else to post an answer. <comment292143> @DavidAnderson I did the repairvolume and it failed as well. I read posts from other threads and seems like people with the same problem end up erasing the disk and creating a new Time Machine. I wish I knew what went wrong though to prevent it. And I wonder if I copy Time Machine from old drive to new drive using Windows if the problem would be copied over... Anyway thank you David. <comment292147> @DavidAnderson OK VERY STRANGE. I was copying my Backup to a new external drive and left the computer for a couple hours. When I came back the Time Machine volume had mounted and working as normal. I'm going to copy the old Time Machine to a brand new drive just to be safe. <comment292149> Ok, but what happens if you now run 'diskutil  verifyvolume  /dev/disk1s2`. <comment292151> Actually, if you can format the partition as NTFS using Windows, then you can use the command `CHKDSK  [drive letter]:  /B` to check the disk for bad clusters. (A cluster is usually 4096 bytes long.) One or more bad clusters would indicate a drive hardware failure. Note: This command will take a long time to execute. <comment292186> @DavidAnderson I ran the verify again and although it took a long time the results came back OK. So strange, I have no way to explain this. I posted the results.
