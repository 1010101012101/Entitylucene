Flash doesn't work on some sites OSX <body> I'm on OSX 10.8.2, flash 11,5,502,146 installed, and firefox 18.0.1  On some sites, e.g. TED, playing flash video would not work. I get the error: Error #2032 But other sites, like Youtube, works just fine.  Or, if I go on TED in chrome, it works fine.   Any ideas what's wrong?   <answer79493> The videos you're able to watch are probably HTML5. Flash requires Java which is not installed by default in Mountain Lion.  You can install it from   http://java.com/en/download/index.jsp  Though there's been so many security scares about it recently, you might want to stick with using Safari (which should play all the videos without issue)  <answer90624> I have a Mac running OS X 10.8 and Firefox, and I ran into the same problem on the TED website. After some experimenting, I determined that it was caused by the HTTPS Everywhere extension.  I am able to work around the problem by disabling the TED rule in the extension, or by disabling the extension altogether.  <comment106390> Flash does not require Java and so you do not need to install Java. (Flash does need Javascript which is something completely different and is part of your browser unless you have altered the defaults) <comment109658> Is there any indication that the TED web video player is still broken for this set of OS/Browser/Plug-In combination?
