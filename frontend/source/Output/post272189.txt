Lost SMS when iPhone screen auto-locked <body> I've been having this issue several times: I'm writing a lengthy SMS, suddenly stop to do something else, and later come back with the auto-locked screen.  When I unlock my iPhone, the SMS I was writing is gone.  Is there any way to recover it?  <comment342152> Tested it on my iPhone 5s running on iOS 10.3 beta (14E5230e). Can't reproduce. Try a soft reset holding lock + home button for several seconds until apple logo shows up. Try to reproduce that problem; write a message and wait for the lock screen. Please give some feedback whether or not the problem persists. Edit: also tell us what you already tried and which iPhone on which version of iOS you are using. <comment367118> Please tell us which iPhone and iOS version you are using exactly.
