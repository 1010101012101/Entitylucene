16 gb RAM specs for mid 2012 macbook pro <body> I have a mid 2012 Macbook pro.  I want to upgrade it to 16 GB -- I know Apple does not support this but is possible.  I would appreciate it if someone can give me the specs of the RAM to order.  Thanks.  <answer144178> A simple answer: PC3-12800 , or to be more specific, a DDR3-1600MHz 204 PIN SODIMM.  DMS Sells a 16GB kit, as does Crucial and OWC.
