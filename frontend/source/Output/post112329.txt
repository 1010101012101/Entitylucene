Limit my upload speed at OS level ? <body> I know my upload speed is limited at about 100/110KB/s, sometimes I reach this limit and it impacts the connexion of other computer of my home network.   Is there a way to tell OSX to limit its upload speed to (for example) 80KB/s ?  <answer112333> h2Network Link Conditioner/h2  You can create a custom profile for Network Link Conditioner, using the following settings:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/UbZNx.png" width="300" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/F33qM.png" width="300"  supIt is a free download in Xcode (go to Xcode → Open Developer Tool → More Developer Tools… and download the strongHardware IO Tools for Xcode/strong)./sup  <answer112334> Two ways that I can think of:  strong1./strong Install Apple's Network Link Conditioner  strong2./strong Use codeipfw/code commands to create a pipe and limit bandwidth:  codesudo ipfw pipe 1 config bw 80KByte/s/code  codesudo ipfw add 1 pipe 1 src-port 80/code  To disable the pipe:  codesudo ipfw delete 1/code  <comment131858> That's exactly the kind of tool I was looking for ! <comment278234> Solved my issue as well. Was using all upload bandwidth and ended up killing the internet completely when I was uploading files for work. Now I can upload and use the internet at the same time! Imagine that!
