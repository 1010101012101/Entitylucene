'Build' is not displayed in iTunes Connect using Xcode 8 <body> I also get the same problem while uploading my build to the app store via Xcode 8. After uploading successfully from Xcode, I login to iTunes connect and see that it shows as Processing. After a little while it disappears. I've tried multiple times but have never been able to make it visible.   I emailed Apple Support and they only say that my build contains an error and they ask me to check my build settings again. But, If there is any error there, shouldn't it at least be showing something for me to know?   How have others resolved this issue? I would appreciate any advice.  :)   Thank you  <answer254070> I had the same problem. after 8th attempt i tried Xcode Version 8.1 beta (8T29o) and also updated all my pods to most recent version. now it works for me, but not sure about the exact problem.  <answer271500> Please check your email inbox.This may be the issue  em"Dear developer, We have discovered one or more issues with your recent delivery for "App Name".
