MacBook Pro : Dual-boot <body> I need to dual boot on CleanOS on a MacBook Pro  I installed ClearOS but at the boot I only boot on the Grub, when Command key is pressed I also have OSX  I tried to install rEFIt, but without success, at the end I install it on a USB stick but only allow me to boot on the GRUB (or OSX)  Can I recover &amp; boot form the Grub ?  UPDATE : I realise each time I do the install I have boot load not installed error img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/JoVZB.jpg" alt="scrennshot"  <comment343522> Why didn't you use bootcamp? <comment343523> his bootcamp not limited to windows? when I run the setup process, I can't do nothing with out a windows install disk <comment343597> Do you mean ClearOS? You could run in VM... They also have a uEFI version of the OS available on the site for a download [here](http://mirror.clearos.com/clearos/testing/daily_iso/ClearOS-DVD-x86_64-7.iso) although it is not advised to be used for production. <comment343600> Yes sorry, clearos community, I wonder will my thunderbolt to Ethernet will be recognised anyway, maybe I should just build a new server
