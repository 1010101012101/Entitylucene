How to set the colour of a folder with a specific name on mac terminal? <body> I am using these four lines in my .bash_profile file to enable colouring on my mac terminal (Mac OS Yosemite).  precodeexport PS1="\[\033[36m\]\u\[\033[m\]@\[\033[32m\]\h:\[\033[33;1m\]\w\[\033[m\]\$ " export CLICOLOR=1 export LSCOLORS=ExFxBxDxCxegedabagacad alias ls='ls -GFh' /code/pre  The outcome is a little generic (for example all the directories have the same colouring) so I wonder if there is a way to have a specific folder name painted with a different colour. For example I want all the directories named 'bin' painted in red. Any ideas? Thank you.  <comment227083> This might be better asked in UNIX Stackexchange.
