Should you unplug the cable once your MBP is fully charged? <body> With Mavericks is this still needed? Doesn't this eventually cause the battery to die faster because it means it'll have to go through more cycles frequently?  <answer135921> Personally if I am using the machine I will keep the charger plugged in until I'm done, regardless of whether its full or not, if I'm not using the machine I will unplug when its full.
