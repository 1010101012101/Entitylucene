My iTunes sync completes, but my iPod doesn't get any music. What can be done? <body> Device : iPod Shuffle 2nd Second Generation OS     : Windows 7 64 bit  My steps were as follows   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/eaF9W.png" alt="enter image description here"  I checked the "Sync only checked songs"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wAUhK.png" alt="enter image description here"  Even though i checked some songs before syncing, i did not find any of them in my iPod. The sync completed without any error output.  Settings tab  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qgkbJ.png" alt="enter image description here"  Contents tab  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/BDtGf.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer61323> Get info for the checked tracks and see if in the Options tab, Skip when Shuffling is checked. If so, those tracks won't sync to an iPod shuffle.  <answer61368> There is an strongAutofill/strong button that you must select (click) before syncing to get the music onto the device.  <answer174927> As someone's said, the square button that says 'automatically fill space with songs' has to be ticked. I spent two hours trying to work out what was going wrong before finding this answer on here. The labelling of the button is misleading - iTunes only puts the songs you have ticked on your device, it doesn't randomly fill the whole thing.
