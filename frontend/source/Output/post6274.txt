Currently I'm looking for this only for my iPad WiFi, so no baseband.   If there are not solutions yet, do not post anything.  <answer6376> This how-to guide should help.  It's amazing and I used it :)  <answer8045> Greenpois0n rc5 Has been released and can do an untethered jailbreak on 4.2.1 without older SHSH blobs.  http://www.greenpois0n.com  <answer8050> Here is a step by step tutorial to do untethered jailbreaking on an iOS 4.2.1 device.  <comment6723> Thanks for the effort but this method requires SHSH from 4.2 beta3, somthing that most people do not have and will never have. <comment6741> just google limera1n then - latest version should really work <comment8401> Doesn't support 4.2.1.
