How is the battery life on the new iPod Touch G5s? <body> I had an iPod Touch G4 and the battery life was terrible.  Has there been any improvement in this area with the G5s?  <answer97652> Based on the strongTechnical Specifications/strong (5G, 4G) no big change is apparent, as the only difference between them is the lasting time while playing videos, as it's up to strong8 hours/strong (when fully charged) for the 5G while the 4G's is strong7 hours/strong.  They both share the following battery specifications:     Built-in rechargeable lithium-ion battery.      Music playback time: Up to 40 hours when fully charged.      Charging times: Fast charge in about 2 hours (80% capacity), full charge in about 4 hours.   <answer97762> I've owned both, and the battery life in the 5th generation is much better. In Ars Technica's review they find that the iPod Touch will last about 7 and a half hours while being actively used (in their test they were browsing the web, streaming Spotify and Netflix, and playing some games).
