Accessing wireless from my Macbook? <body> There's this network at my school which I emknow/em requires a username and password. If I access it on my PC, it asks for it, and I give it, and I get access. Works great.  On my Mac, when I select it from the drop down list of detected wireless networks, it asks me for emjust a password./em  Like this is some normal home network. Which is wrong. Inapplicable. No.  How can I get it let me put in my username and password instead?  <answer56925> This should work, but, as this is working with tech, you never know:  ol liOpen System Preferences./li liSelect Network./li liSelect "Wi-Fi" on the sidebar (AirPort if you're running SL or earlier)./li liClick "Advanced..." in the lower right./li liOn the Wi-Fi tab, click the plus sign beneath "Preferred Networks"./li liEnter the name of the network that you want to connect to./li liIn the security drop-down, select "Any (Enterprise)"./li liLog in with your username and password./li liPress OK./li /ol
