How to copy folder items on disk mount automator <body> i want to automatically copy a specific folder's items when a usb is inserted at any given time. Program logic:  ol liOnce usb is available /li lisimply copy all content of (/Users/x/Documents/myfolder) to usb folder such as (/Volumes/BOSS/myfolder)/li lideletes copied contents from myfolder /li /ol  What software or scripts could do this?  <answer145390> One way to do this is to use Automator:  ol licreate a Folder Action on /Volumes /li litrigger an Applescript or shell script when a new drive is mounted/li lido the copy/li ligrab a coffee (optional). /li /ol  You'll probably want to scrape the output of codesystem_profiler SPUSBDataType/code to make sure you're not messing around with DMGs.  Oooh, option 2 from stack overflow (copy/paste as a block quote below):     You can use launchd for that purpose. Launchd can be configured   to automatically launch a program when a file path is modified.      For example the following launchd config plist will launch the program   code/usr/bin/logger/code when the desktop folder of my user account is   modified:  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt; &lt;!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple Computer//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"&gt; &lt;plist version="1.0"&gt; &lt;dict&gt;     &lt;key&gt;Label&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;string&gt;logger&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;key&gt;ProgramArguments&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;array&gt;         &lt;string&gt;/usr/bin/logger&lt;/string&gt;         &lt;string&gt;path modified&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;/array&gt;     &lt;key&gt;WatchPaths&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;array&gt;         &lt;string&gt;/Users/sakra/Desktop/&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;/array&gt; &lt;/dict&gt; &lt;/plist&gt; /code/pre      To activate the config plist save it to the LaunchAgents folder in   your Library folder as "logger.plist".      From the shell you can then use the command codelaunchctl/code to activate   the logger.plist by running:  precode$ launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/logger.plist /code/pre      The desktop folder is now being monitored. Every time it is changed   you should see an output in the system.log (use Console.app).  To   deactivate the logger.plist, run:  precode$ launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/logger.plist /code/pre      The configuration file above uses the codeWatchPaths/code option.   Alternatively you can also use the  codeQueueDirectories/code option. See the   launchd man page for more information.   <comment171324> Could you edit your body to list criteria? You tagged this with some options like automator, but it's not clear if you need a specific tool or would be happy with any solution. <comment171328> sorry for that, any solution would be perfect. <comment171475> I still have a problem, what is coding for the script specifically using the same code logic thanks. Im not a tech wizard so the more detail the better thanks.
