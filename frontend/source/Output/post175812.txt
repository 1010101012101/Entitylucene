How to change location of specific keys <body> I've spilled a coffee on my keyboard, as a result right and left arrows don't function any more. Is there a way to change locations or maybe to create a shortcut to represent those keys? for example shift + up arrow = right arrow, smth like that?  <answer175872> There is a free app called Karabiner that allows you to modify the keys.
