OSX EL Captain customization and themeing <body> emI don't like the new dock, I don't like the new folders, I don't like flat/em or may be I am bored of looking at same stuff. But really I still miss OSX Lion/Mavericks 3D dock and a more lively user interface.  I am a big fan of Ubuntu, Arch Linux. I go to noobslab every once a week to customize my pc. I easily get bored of looking at same think for a long time.  What am I already using for customization:   1) LiteIcon for changing app and custom icons which I usually grab from DeviantArt strong{disable SIP}/strong  2) cDock for custom Docks strong{disable SIP}/strong  3) Xtra Finder &amp; TotalFinder for more enhanced and shortcuts strong{disable SIP}/strong  4) iTerm and Oh-My-Zsh for a better shell   5) Alfred in place of spotlight with custom themes  6) Irvue for OSX to grab Hi-Res wallpaper from unsplash automatically    Are there any suggestions for creating better User Interface , customization, Personalize better? Any cool app for widgets, any kind of amazing stuff.  NOTE: This is not just a question. This post is more of like a Wiki. Everyone can post there cool, customization apps, tweaks, scripts, anything here. This is an effort to grow the apple stack exchange community and make it more fun. Thanks.  Request: Please don't downvote, keep on hold as personal opinion etc. You can however edit this question. I am still asking for better customization apps.  What is SIP?   How to disable SIP?  I have disabled SIP but why shouldn't you disable it? Know what you are doing. I am not encouraging anyone to compromise his/her security  <answer222791> Amazing post I wished to write a blog post about this same topic. For yosemite you had Flavour 2 for customizing. The was large of people contributing there themes. But, the support for Flavour 2 had ended. They won't support EL Captain because of SIP   strongEl Capitan Means The End Of Mac Themes &amp; Deep System Tweaks/strong  But, there is still a work around for EL Captain and you can install Flavour 2. Have a look at this reddit post.   <answer259738> NerdTool lets you put up .qtz as wallpaper!  <comment269978> This will probably be more on topic on [softwarerecs.se]. And StackOverflow doesn't allow "wikis" and questions asking for "good books for so-and-so programming language". Those are off topic. The ones that do exist are old and only remain because they have "historical significance" <comment269994> The most recent re-evaluation of list-type questions I can find is this - [Re-evaluating “list of tips” type questions](http://meta.apple.stackexchange.com/questions/1555/re-evaluating-list-of-tips-type-questions) which would seem to say they're OK. However, for it to be a *good* list question, the list ought to be in the answers, not in the question. Having said that, 'customising OS X' questions already exist - http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/256/can-i-change-my-os-x-theme <comment270001> @Tetsujin so I have modified the question and I am mostly targeting SIP now. So, its exclusively for EL Captain now. <comment270005> @Arc676 I have removed that point. Thanks. <comment324994> Welcome to Ask Different.  We like answers to be more than just a single line.
