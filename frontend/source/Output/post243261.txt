Where is "mkpasswd" for OSX? <body> There is a well-known unix utility called codemkpasswd/code available on many *nix systems.  I was just trying to use it from terminal on an OSX 10.10.5 Yosemite (Early 2015) machine, and it is nowhere to be found.  How can I install it on this machine? or is there an alternative already available?  <answer243263> There's a Mac implementation of mkpasswd on GitHub - https://github.com/PrototypeAlex/mkpasswd  Alternatively, Keychain Access has a built-in GUI password generatorbr File menu  New Password Item...

It's an codeexpect/code script. You would have to modify the script (at least the shebang) in order for it to work. There are other command line tools such as codeopenssl/code (codemd5/code), codejot/code and codedd/code that can generate passwords.  <answer290852> I made a tool for creating codemkpasswd -m sha-512/code (Linux/Ubuntu) style hashes on OS X (or any platform).  precode#!/usr/bin/env python3  # based on https://stackoverflow.com/a/17992126/117471  import sys from getpass import getpass from passlib.hash import sha512_crypt  passwd = input() if not sys.stdin.isatty() else getpass() print(sha512_crypt.encrypt(passwd)) /code/pre  It only handles a single use case of codemkpasswd/code but if it fits, enjoy.  strongNote:/strong There is a slightly more complicated version at https://gist.github.com/RichardBronosky/58f1b34d2bcf4c4e5f1cd18a88fdc37d which simplifies tuning the CPU Cost, but passlib manages that periodically for you so it's fine to keep it simple like this.  <comment299537> Thanks - the "Mac implementation" is a ruby script requiring "gems" -- any idea what it's relationship is to the unix `mkpasswd.c` utility? Helpful Apple Discussion thread: my main take-away is that you can use `$ slappasswd -g` from the command line natively in OSX to generate an 8-character mixed case + digits password, but no way to tailor output (e.g. string length) that I can see, like there is with the Keychain Access helper. <comment299539> Sorry, idk what the relationship may be - I'm afraid my skill-set is very much GUI-based, so I always rely on the Keychain version. <comment299589> `pwgen` is also useful and has similar options to `mkpasswd` for phonetic/memorable passwords . I was not familiar with mkpasswd and found this comparison: http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/generating-random-password/ <comment299600> `jot` is a new one for me (from BSD?) and included with OSX. There's a nice [forum post](http://daemonforums.org/showthread.php?t=2912#post21666) giving examples of its use for password generation. <comment366736> And FWIW, there is an interesting [online password generator](https://www.memset.com/tools/password-generator/) I've found which lacks options, but looks useful all the same!
