Safari - Easy way to open a link in private window? <body> Is there an easy way to open links in a private window in Safari in OS X?  With this, I mean copying the link and pasting it in a new private window not as being easy.  In Chrome and Firefox, you can easily open a link in Incognito/Private mode, right clicking on the link and from the context menu, choose Open in an incognito window. This is a feature that I use quite often in my browsing, but I'm trying to switch to Safari because I noticed that Chrome uses more battery and read some articles about it too.  I would really appreciate it if you tell me of any way to add an option to the right click context menu in Safari to open in a private window, or a keyboard shortcut so that you click while pressing some keys and it opens in private mode, or maybe an extension that adds this functionality.  <answer205057> In Safari 9.0 (El Capitano) you can strongright-click on the URL while holding down the option key/strong and you then have the option to open the URL in a new private window. This option is provided from regular or private windows, unlike what appears to be the case in previous versions of Safari.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/TQjj8.png" alt="OPTION-RIGHT CLICK in Safari 9.0"  <comment221651> In Safari 8.0.6 (OS X 10.10.3), "Open Link In New Private Tab" and "Open Link In New Private Window" are right-click options, but only if the link is in a Private window/tab. I keep Safari set to open in Private, and always use private windows/tabs, unless I specifically need a non-private window (for example, to save a new password into Keychain). Not a direct answer for your question, but it's an option. <comment247319> Thanks Adam. I'll upgrade to El Capitan as soon as its final release is available. <comment290482> Works in Yossi as well.
