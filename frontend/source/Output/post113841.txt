Tiered list paragraph in Pages 5 <body> I have a document converted from pages 09 and I am trying to achieve with Pages 5 something that I was able to do easily with older version.  Basically I want a series of paragraphs structured like this, with no indentation, all aligned to left:  precode1.Title (h1) text following... 1.1 title (h2) text following... 1.1.1 title (h3) text following... 1.1.2 title (h3) text following... /code/pre  I have three main header style header 1, header 2 and header 3, represented above as h1,2,3. I have assigned a numbered list to each of them, giving the correct checkbox option and the value from drop down selection that is translated from Italian: start from preceding.  However, I am not able to build such structure. Sometimes, I end up with this:  precode1.Title (h1) text following... 1.1 title (h2) text following... 2 title (h3) text following... 3 title (h3) text following... /code/pre  <answer120304> Simiply select  codeBullet &amp; Numbering/code style to be codeTiered Numbers/code and it should work fine in iWork '09.  <comment237402> The question is about version 5 of Pages.
