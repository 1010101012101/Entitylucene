Loading photos onto Windows PC with broken iPhone touchscreen <body> I've cracked my iPhone 5 and the touch screen no longer works. Is there any way I can load my photos onto my laptop without getting the screen fixed?    My computer runs the latest Windows and its a ThinkPad if this helps.  <answer240290> Here's a way to transfer photos to your computer (Windows 8 and above)  ol liConnect your iPhone to a trusted computer using the lightning cable.

If it does not, you can open it using the Windows start menu or search bar. /li liClick on the import button in the top right corner, represented by a downwards arrow in a square box. /li liSelect the photos you would like to import. /li liFollow the prompts on the screen.
