Siri stopped working <body> Since iOS 8.1 Siri stopped working for me. The sound and wave animation appear, but it seems the microphone does not register my speech, or it is not processed by Siri.  I have read various "solutions" and tried to troubleshoot it, but I am running out of ideas.  I have tried, turning Siri on and off again :), restarting the phone and resetting different settings (including the network settings). Nothing seems to work.  Any ideas, how can I resolve this?  <answer180567> I have iPhone 5s and iOS 8.3 and my siri stopped working after replacing broken glass. My current workaround is to use the headphone microphone.  I think iPhone when using SIRI does some sophisticated background noise reduction. For that it uses additional microphones I think for iPhone 5s and up there are three all together.  Try to use the iPhone supplied Headset microphone I am certain this will work for you. This is my current workaround and it works all the time..  <answer207676> I think it's a microphone problem. Test it by recording a video of using the front facing camera. If you can hear yourself then it's probably a software issue but if there is no noise then it's probably a hardware problem with the front facing microphone  <answer221177> Reset all settings and then do a hard reboot by holding home and power buttons. This fixed it for me  <comment209579> If the 'wave' actually 'waves' then it's hearing the mic. Does it move or remain a static line? <comment209581> How dit you restart your phone, pressing both power and home button or only the power button? <comment209602> @Tetsujin it moves but it is very synchronous movement. It doesn't seem to change the amplitude while I am speaking. In other words it is never a static line, when I stop talking. <comment209603> @Jules I have tried both. <comment209604> I'd go for a full backup/restore <comment209605> Thanks. I'll try that and will let you know. I thought that was the only option left. <comment209619> You could try to restore your network settings in settings  general, also check if your microphone is working <comment209659> @Jules Thanks, but as I have written, I already have reseted the network settings. The microphone must be working, because I can talk on the phone normally. <comment214595> You are right, it works with the headphones. Didn't know that. However, this does not fix the problem. Do you have an idea? I googled a bit, but people don't seem to have found a solution... <comment250760> Hi! Thanks. Video recording, talking on the phone, etc. works normally. I think it is a mix between a hardware and a software issue, as Siri works with the headphones, but not without them. A full restore did not work.
