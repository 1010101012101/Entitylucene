Automator: Get filename <body> I'm creating a folder action to display a notification when a new file is downloaded and would like the notification to display the filename. I can't figure out how to extract the filename of the downloaded file and pass it on to the variable.  <answer195961> Try something like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kt2FF.png" alt="Picture"  Transcript:  ul listrongFolder action receives files and folders to/strong emDownloads/em(default Folder Action script)/li listrongRun Applescript:/strong  on run {input, parameters}     tell application "Finder"         set filename to name of file input     end tell end run/li listrongSet value of Variable:/strong emfileName/em/li listrongAsk for Confirmation:/strong strongTitle:/strong Alert! The file emfileName/em has been downloaded! strongBody:/strong A new file has downloaded/li /ul  So if I add a file named "NewFile.png", I get: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/EPock.png" alt="Example"  <comment234809> Alternatively, you could also use a "Display Notification" action, which would be less obtrusive. <comment234810> That would work as well.
