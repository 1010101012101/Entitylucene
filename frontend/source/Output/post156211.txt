Using CTRL +V in Mail app on Mac Os X <body> I'm using strongMail/strong client that's built-in into the system (Yosemite). I've decided that I want to use CTRL+V, CTRL+C and similar instead of CMD because I work half of the day with Windows and it's impossible for me to easily switch off my habits every half a day. I've considered 2 options:  ul lifinal switch between CTRL and CMD which had a lot of consequences that I didn't wanted to tackle/li liswitching on Shorcuts option available at System Preferences - Keyboard - Shortcuts and adding here any "special" shortcuts on per app basis. /li /ul  I've used 2nd option. This generally works fine. I've added things like strongCopy/strong, strongCut/strong, strongUndo Paste/strong and so on mostly mimicking what I have on my Windows machines. And everything seems to be working fine except one small detail "strongCTRL+V/strong" paste. It only works as a PASTE until the email I'm creating fits on page. When there's a lot of text.. the strongCTRL+V/strong becomes strongPage Down/strong button. It's like strongCTRL+V/strong in the Mail app is hardcoded to be Page Down and the shorcuts seems to be working fine until strongCTRL+V/strong is able to actually behave as Page Down then it stops working.   How do I disable Page Down strong(CTRL+V)/strong behaviour as described above?  <answer156261> There's a much easier and more effective way to do this: go to System Preferences  Keyboard  Keyboard tab and click the "Modifier Keys..." button.   From there, you can set the Control key to behave like the Command key:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/D5l0X.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer174491> strongKarabiner/strong  This will do exactly what you're looking for, I think this is the setting you're looking for too.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NGHI0.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer230006> I run into same issue: At work I have to use Windows and at home I use a Mac. I'm sick of having different shortcuts for these basic tasks. Here is my solution for it:  Go to your User folder on your Mac and open the Library directory.  Here you create a "KeyBindings" folder.  Then navigate into that folder: (Your User folder)/Library/KeyBindings/  Create a file "DefaultKeyBinding.dict" with following lines:  precode"^v" = "paste:"; "^c" = "copy:"; "^x" = "cut:"; "^z" = "undo:"; /code/pre  Save everything and restart your Mac.  Now, you will have CTRL + x/c/v/z working like it is on a Windows machine.  This will change the behaviour for page down as requested by MadBoy.  <comment183709> It's easier to get used to the distinction than try to fight it, long-term. <comment183710> Instead of using key strokes, cut, copy & paste can also be executed from the Edit menu. <comment183719> I switch daily between Linux and Mac. Trust me, it is the completely opposite of impossible to switch. I rarely make a mistake <comment183753> I am not fighting. I just want to use what I want to use. I have virtual machines on mac and those use ctrl+c/v an then mac uses cmd+c. Then another computer next to me users ctrl+c. I switch a lot between different systems. I want things to work my way. It seems like a bug to me in Mail.app. <comment183761> Control+V is no bug; it's an Emacs and general UNIX shortcut for page down. Apple implemented it so you can navigate text easily. ([here's a list of all shortcuts](http://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201247)) <comment183803> I've already mentioned in my main post I don't want to do that. This changes behaviour of so many things it's not an option for me. <comment183804> Ok. So the question is how can it be disabled.. Since I've overwritten the Shorcut and it's behaviour is now less than expected. <comment280267> See my answer on [this question](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/228523/microsoft-outlook-does-not-properly-handle-redefined-paste-keyboard-shortcut/229729#229729) <comment280336> I got used to CMD +V although I do get some frustrations from time to time when things don't go as planned.
