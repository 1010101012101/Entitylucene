Locate spinning pinwheel in Mavericks <body> The loading-icon also known as Spinning pinwheel was located in an old Mac version at the following location:     /Library/Frameworks/OpenBaseManager.framework/Versions/A/Resources/gear.tif   In Mavericks, this location does not exist. Where (if not renamed by Apple to something weird) is this file located in Mavericks? I've checked strong~/Library/strong but it cannot find the stronggear.tif/strong it used to be in the past.  <answer134848> Here is one  It is called the Wait Cursor :)  /System/Library/Frameworks/GLUT.framework/Versions/A/Resources  You can help looking for it, it does belong to the Cursor category.  <comment159736> Are you referring to the [asynchronous progress indicator](http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/24444/5472)? If not, a picture might be worth many words here... <comment159742> the gearicon.tiff is here (but that is not the beach ball) /System/Library/Frameworks/Quartz.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/QuartzFilters.framework/Versions/A/Resources <comment159846> @GeorgeGarside why is it necessary editing the TIFF in to TIF ? <comment159847> @Buscar You edited it to be TIFF, this is not correct per the last time this file existed in its location in OS X. <comment159849> @GeorgeGarside I would not know that since I do not have the older OSX any more. Where was it located in those OS ? Actually my search shows both so it really does not matter. <comment159851> @Buscar It was located at the path in the question. Whilst I agree a single letter might not make a difference when reading the path, if you're actually attempting to find the file using the path with an extra t, it won't exist. <comment160069> Now I have to wait for a crash to check if that's the one. It looks different as I thought by the way.. <comment160070> @Buscarì›ƒ The Quartz.framework is not the beach ball I'm looking for. Thanks for the search though.
