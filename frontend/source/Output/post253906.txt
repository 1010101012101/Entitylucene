Mid-2010 Macbook Pro won't boot after trying to install macOS Sierra <body> After I ran the macOS Sierra installer to start installation, my 2010 Macbook Pro wouldn't start anymore. It would get to the grey startup screen, flash the Apple logo for a second, and then switch to a crossed circle, and periodically restart that sequence.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7R1Ej.png" alt="Boot error logo"  I got into verbose mode by starting my computer with kbdCmd+V/kbd and saw error messages like:  precodeefiboot loaded from device: Acpi(PNP0A03,0)/Pci(1F12)/SATA(0,0)/HD(Part3,Sig4B75...) efiboot file path: \System\Library\CoreServices\boot.efi ERROR!!! Prelinked kernel corrupted ERROR!!! Load prelinked kernel with status 0x000000000000001b Error loading kernel cache (0x1b) Error loading kernel cache (0x1b) ... /code/pre  How do I get my computer back on track?  <answer253907> It's still absolutely possible to boot from the recovery partition by pressing kbdCmd+R/kbd. This starts a stripped-down version of your current OS that's able to connect to the Internet, perform some manipulations, and reinstall itself. I don't know of a way to recover from this specific error without reinstalling an OS, though I speculate that grabbing the /System/Library/Kernels/kernel file from a healthy Mac and putting it on the computer could help recover.  Since I'll be reinstalling an OS anyway, I might as well install Sierra for real. From recovery, it's possible to run the Sierra-bundled codecreateinstallmedia/code program to create an installer on a thumb drive or SD card:  precode"/Volumes/Macintosh HD/Applications/Install macOS Sierra.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia" --volume "/Volumes/disposablethumbdrive" --applicationpath "/Volumes/Macintosh HD/Applications/Install macOS Sierra.app" /code/pre  This puts a Sierra installer on the volume disposablethumbrdivre (strongerasing whatever it contained before/strong) that can (probably) be used, instead of reinstalling El Capitan. This process is documented in more details on other sites.  <answer277945> Try to remove the corrupted 'prelinked kernel' first, then rebuild the kextcache.  From the Recovery HD (putting your own volume's name instead of "Macintosh\ HD") try those three commands in Terminal in succession (pressing 'enter' after each):   precoderm -f /Volumes/Macintosh\ HD/System/Library/PrelinkedKernels/prelinkedkernel  touch /Volumes/Macintosh\ HD/System/Library/Extensions  kextcache -u /Volumes/Macintosh\ HD  /code/pre  See also:  precodeman kextcache /code/pre  <comment316244> Does Safe Boot rebuild this? Edit: From https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201262 : "Deletes font caches, Kernel cache and other system cache files" <comment316245> Didn't try and installing Sierra from a separate installation media solved my problem, but based on the description of safe mode on Apple's website, my best guess is that it wouldn't. That's a very early boot error. <comment316246> Ah, glad you're booting again!!
