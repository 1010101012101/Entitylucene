MacOS Sierra - Cannot find what is using all disk space <body> My Macbook Pro has run out of disk space, and I cannot find out why.  I have minimal Applications and user data.  Output from codedf -h/code  precodeFilesystem      Size   Used  Avail Capacity  iused   ifree %iused  Mounted on /dev/disk1     233Gi  227Gi  5.8Gi    98% 59462769 1518477   98%   / devfs          182Ki  182Ki    0Bi   100%      630       0  100%   /dev map -hosts       0Bi    0Bi    0Bi   100%        0       0  100%   /net map auto_home    0Bi    0Bi    0Bi   100%        0       0  100%   /home /code/pre  As you can see here, it is reporting that I have around code6GB/code free space.  I then used codencdu/code to try get a better understanding of what was actually using the space  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/XnjiB.png" alt="enter image description here"  As you can see, codencdu/code is reporting that I have used about code30GB/code of space, which looks right to me.  I am obviously looking at something incorrectly here.  Any insights?  <answer264045> Try codesudo ncdu/code instead. As a normal admin or user you are not allowed to scan the content of certain folders (all indicated by an error while scanning and in the final listing by a dot - if a subfolder can't be scanned - or an exclamation mark - if the whole folder is excluded from scanning due to missing read permissions!).  Examples (only the big six and the .Spotlight-V100 folder are shown here):  ul licodencdu/code:  precode   10,7 GiB [##########] /Applications                                                                                                .   4,8 GiB [####      ] /System .   3,5 GiB [###       ] /Library .   2,2 GiB [##        ] /usr .   1,8 GiB [#         ] /private .   1,1 GiB [#         ] /Users              ... !   0,0   B [          ] /.Spotlight-V100 /code/pre/li licodesudo ncdu/code:  precode.  10,7 GiB [##########] /Applications                                                                                                    6,3 GiB [#####     ] /System     5,2 GiB [####      ] /Library     2,6 GiB [##        ] /private     2,4 GiB [##        ] /usr     1,2 GiB [#         ] /Users              ...   310,7 MiB [          ] /.Spotlight-V100 /code/pre/li /ul  hr  Another nice perl hack is this command:  precodesudo perl -e'%h=map{/.\s/;99**(ord$&amp;&amp;7)-$`,$_}`du -h`;die@h{sort%h}' /code/pre  It will sort strongall/strong folders (not just those in the current folder) depending on size similar to Grand Perspective without bricks:  precode 29G    .  11G    ./Applications 7,4G    ./Applications/Xcode.app 6,3G    ./System 5,2G    ./Library 2,4G    ./usr 1,9G    ./usr/local 966M    ./Users/user/Library 879M    ./System/Library/PrivateFrameworks 851M    ./Applications/MAMP 850M    ./private/var/db/dyld 805M    ./usr/local/mysql-5.7.11-osx10.9-x86_64/lib 778M    ./System/Library/Frameworks ... /code/pre  <answer264052> While I'm a big-enough fan of codedu/code and codencdu/code, sometimes it's still useful to try a GUI.  Here's Grand Perspective's output of my MBP's after-market SSD, scanned from /:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/quhIv.png" alt="Grand Perspective scan results"  I can see that Xcode.app is the largest entry in my /Applications folder, for example.  (I also just found 9GB that I could free up from an old Deleted User home folder.)  <answer264059> While codencdu/code is excellent (and this is not a knock against it) there are a couple of built in commands you can try if you don't want to install (or can't) 3rd party utilities:  precodesudo du -hsx -d 1 / | sort /code/pre  This command lists all files from the root directory but excludes any file system mounts (i.e. USB or network mounts) and sorts from smallest to largest.  For example, issuing the command on my iMac, I get the following results:  precode  0B    /.Trashes   0B    /.vol   0B    /Network   0B    /cores  30G    /Applications  64K    /Volumes 1.0K    /home 1.0K    /net 1.0M    /sbin 2.5M    /bin 234M    /.fseventsd 261G    /Users 314G    / 383M    /.cleverfiles 4.7G    /Library 478M    /.DocumentRevisions-V100 5.0K    /dev 523M    /usr 7.1G    /private 811M    /.Spotlight-V100 9.1G    /System /code/pre  This gives me a nice summary of what starge the top level folders are using on my drive.  In my case, the code/Applications/code folder is consuming 30G while my code/Users/code has 261G.  If you want to take a look at everything within your Applications folder and sort it by size, you can issue the command  precodesudo du -ha /Applications | sort -r /code/pre  I pipe the output to codesort/code and use the code-r/code flag to sort it in reverse (largest to smallest) order so I can see what files and directories are taking up what space.   precode996K    /Applications//The Unarchiver.app/Contents/Frameworks/XADMaster.framework/Versions 996K    /Applications//Microsoft Word.app/Contents/SharedSupport/Proofing Tools/Latvian Speller.proofingtool/Contents/SharedSupport/LatvianSpeller.lexicon/Contents/Resources/LexiconData 996K    /Applications//Microsoft Word.app/Contents/SharedSupport/Proofing Tools/Latvian Speller.proofingtool/Contents/SharedSupport/LatvianSpeller.lexicon/Contents/Resources 996K    /Applications//Microsoft Word.app/Contents/SharedSupport/Proofing Tools/Latvian Speller.proofingtool/Contents/SharedSupport/LatvianSpeller.lexicon/Contents 996K    /Applications//Microsoft Word.app/Contents/SharedSupport/Proofing Tools/Latvian Speller.proofingtool/Contents/SharedSupport/LatvianSpeller.lexicon 996K    /Applications//Microsoft Word.app/Contents/SharedSupport/Proofing Tools/Latvian Speller.proofingtool/Contents/SharedSupport /code/pre  The listing will be quite long, so I suggest sending the output to a text file for evaluation:  precodesudo du -ha /Applications | sort -r &gt; ~/Desktop/du_results.txt /code/pre  This will give you a text file on your Desktop which you can view with any text editor.  This way you will have a record of what files/subdirectories you need/want to investigate as to why you are consuming so much disk space.  <answer264074> I don't think your question is exactly a duplicate of this one, but you should definitely have a look as it has an extensive discussion of ways to free disk space.  How can I figure out what&#39;s slowly eating my HD space?  <comment330908> Before we go too far, have you run DiskUtility to see if there's simply some corruption of the Btree or other directory management files? <comment330914> Your sorting is wonky because you have used `-h`, so `sort` treats the sizes as strings. <comment331740> indeed `sudo ncdu` showed me that all the space was being used by `/.Spotlight-V100` <comment331762> @kabal But 200 GB in the spotlight folder is really a lot. Did you rebuild the spotlight index?
