Differences on modifier keys between US and International Keyboards <body> I'm aware of the differences in layout, character placement etc however I have always wondered why the modifier keys on the US layout use the full word such as kbdcommand/kbd instead of kbdcmd/kbd. Similarly the same can be seen for kbdfunction/kbd and kbdcontrol/kbd.  Any idea why? The only reason I could think of is that the abbreviations suit various languages, whereas the full word e.g. codefunction/code as opposed to codefunktion/code in German would be wrong but codefn/code makes sense in both.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/eSqbe.jpg" alt="Keyboard Comparison"  <comment251221> Perhaps it is because the keys are smaller that the words have been abbreviated? <comment251222> Yes that could be a reason, but on MacBooks which have the function key on the left for both layouts unlike above the same abbreviation exists as well as the full word on the US version. <comment251256> You can see them all at https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201794
