Download of big (GB size) files stops at 100% <body> I have this problem when I try to download the latest Xcode beta (2.5 GB) on the main Apple Developers page, but it happened in the past as well.   When I try to download the file, everything goes smoothly up until it reaches 100%. At this point it just stops indefinitely, it seems that it misses the last step of converting the file from a partial download to a regular file.  Changing the extension from dmg.part to dmg doesn't work either.  It seems to me that is something related to my Mac (Retina Macbook Pro 15' 2013) or the OS (Mavericks) since it happens with Safari, Chrome and Firefox.   I will try some download manager extension to get around it, but I would really like to understand why it is happening in the first place.
