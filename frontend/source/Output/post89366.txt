I can drag the files onto my ipods but not onto my iphone.  any ideas?  thanks  <answer89763> In order to be able to drag/drop media tracks freely from your iTunes library to your iPhone, you need to set your iTunes sync settings for your iPhone to manual mode.  ol liConnect your iPhone to your computer and run iTunes. /li liSelect your iPhone, iPad, or iPod. If your device is not visible in the upper right corner of the screen, choose Library first./li liClick the Summary tab and select "Manually manage music and videos". /li liMake sure that contacts and calendar sync is not enabled from the Info tab/li liClick Apply. /li /ol  You can now drag/drop songs from your iTunes library to your iPhone  <comment104879> Is your iPhone synced with the library you are using? Can you drag any other files onto the iphone? <comment104888> I am not sure, I havent really messed with the sync button as I was scared I might get rid of contacts etc. I can't drag anything into the iphone not just music. <comment104890> Sounds like your phone is synced with another library, hence why you can't copy to it. It's a part of the block to not be able to just transfer content to other computers and such.
