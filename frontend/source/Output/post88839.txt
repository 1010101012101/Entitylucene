Recent items are showing under "No Date" when sorting by date in finder <body> This thing's driving me crazy.  Often, when I download or create a new file, and then I have to upload it to a website or something like that, it will appear after the oldest items under a "No Date" section.  I'm running Mountain Lion but it happened for me at Lion as well.  Any ideas how to fix this?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8Omxq.png" alt="Screenshot"  <answer88983> Try deleting the Finder's preferences file: com.apple.finder.plist, found in ~/Library/Preferences. This file seems to easily become corrupt. Trashing it is a good first step when Views become wackyâ€”anything to do with Finder.  <answer100822> I don't know if this is really a "solution" per se, but it's a workaround that I prefer anyway: I changed the "Arrange by" to "None" as described here Mac OS X - File Open Dialog: Can&#39;t sort or resize columns  This gets rid of the categorization by Today/7 days/30 days/etc. altogether, and just gives a straightforward dialog that lets you sort however you want (be it Date Modified, or Name, or Size). I find this much more useful and fail to see the advantage of the other view (which is made almost useless by this No Date bug).   Note that some applications (e.g., MS Office) do not let you change the Auto-arrange setting. Just open up some other application that does (e.g., Chrome) and set it there (just go to Open File or similar -- you don't have to actually open the file). This action seems to set this setting globally (on 10.8.4).   This problem is all over the web. Why does Apple not comment on it? Does it not care about its users? Why does it not release a fix? Is iTunes so much more important? This bug seems almost ludicrous: The arrange-by setting used for categorization is (normally) "Date Modified", and the actual modified date is clearly shown in the Date Modified column. Indexing in the general case perhaps needs to happen emnot/em in real time (e.g., if you are viewing "All Files"), but when we open a dialog, can't just the (usually very few but most important) No Date files be manually indexed in that moment?  <answer219648> Just click on Today, and it should update the downloads to their correct date.  <comment104151> This happens when the files in question have a "Date Modified" in the future. <comment104204> OK. Why would this happen? Is this a timezone issue? <comment104244> The file metadata may be corrupt. <comment104378> I have only experienced this in Chrome's Open dialog - are you experiencing this as a general issue in Finder or just in Chrome? <comment104379> There is a similar thread in the Apple Support discussion forum - but no fix: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/3272875?start=0&tstart=0 <comment104408> @EmilRasmussen currently I can reproduce this only on chrome but I'm pretty sure in the past it happened in general finder windows or other apps' open dialogs as well. <comment254837> This didn't work. <comment259959> It is now 2015, almost 2016.  Has Apple made any fix to this?  Or is this workaround the only viable option? Completely agree with givo - why won't Apple fix these ludicrous counterintuitive configurations!?!?! <comment259963> Note that sorting by Date Created seems to have fixed this for me also. <comment371302> Im still having the issue. macOS Sierra 10.12.6
