Mail removes sender in reply-all (spam header?) <body> This is a weird one: I have a mail with multiple recipients. When I hit "reply to all" it creates a mail with all participants of the conversation but then removes the original sender and replaces it with one of the CC addresses.  Apparently this only happens when the mail has "X-Spam-Level: ***" in it's header.  The original sender is on a server-side whitelist.  Is this known behavior and if so, what can I do about it?
