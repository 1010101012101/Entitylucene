Turn off automatic preview in apple mail <body> Is it possible to turn off automatic preview of attachments when composing an e-mail?  NOTE: Yes I know that I can manually ctr+select the attachment and disable preview, but I want this done automatically  <answer24573> There is an extension for Apple Mail called Attachment Tamer.  It has all kinds of settings, but the most useful is the one that defaults attachments to the icon view.  http://lokiware.info/Attachment-Tamer  It is $15 but well worth it.  <answer83069> In Terminal, type:  precodedefaults write com.apple.mail DisableInlineAttachmentViewing -bool yes /code/pre  If you want to turn it off again, use   precodedefaults write com.apple.mail DisableInlineAttachmentViewing -bool no /code/pre  You may need to restart Mail after running this to change the behavior.  <answer141078> To expand on @user43521's answer, there are two ways to solve this problem:  strongFirst solution:/strong  If you drag-and-drop files—even images—into Mail.app's compose window, they'll be sent as real attachments (codeContent-Disposition: attachment/code).  strongSecond solution:/strong  If you open a terminal and enter this command, it will always make attachments real attachments:  precodedefaults write com.apple.mail DisableInlineAttachmentViewing -bool yes /code/pre  You only need to do this once. To revert to normal behavior:  precodedefaults write com.apple.mail DisableInlineAttachmentViewing -bool no /code/pre  The codeViewing/code portion of this is very confusing; this affects how your outgoing mail is sent. If you receive mail with inline attachments, they'll be displayed as expected. In fact, it's even more confusing than that, because regardless of this setting, both inline and attached images that you receive will be displayed inline.  <comment141879> I get a `Command not found` when running this from terminal on a fairly new MacBook air? <comment166233> Don't remove this answer; it's the best way to solve this unintuitive behavior with Mail.app. This changes the default behavior of the "attach" button in the app to do real attachments instead of inline attachments. The `Viewing` portion of that is really misleading; it affects how attachments are sent.
