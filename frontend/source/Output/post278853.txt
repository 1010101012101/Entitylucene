How do I identify the latest iPad Pro model? <body> How can I tell if an Apple 12.9 inch iPad Pro with Wi-Fi is the latest model? Is the model # enough? Thank you.  <answer278855> Apple has only released one 12.9 inch iPad Pro model so far (Wikipedia, EveryMac:iPad Pro 12.9 Wifi, EveryMac:iPad Pro 12.9 Wifi/Cellular), so the current model in fact is the latest.  <comment350965> This appears to be an [XY Problem](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/66377/what-is-the-xy-problem).   What exactly is the problem you're trying to solve?  Let's start with that and maybe we can help you.
