MobileMe on iPod <body> Is it possible to change the default codemyname@me.com/code address to by codemyname@mac.com/code? I'm part of a lot of mailing lists with the "mac.com", but iPod seems to send email with "me.com" ...  <answer1256> If you had @mac.com before and have same name @me.com -mac.com is aliases of your me.com account If you have only @me.com account you cannot  <answer26134> If you set up that account with @mac.com in the Apple ID section - it will default to that domain rather than @me.com.  <comment1072> They are aliases indeed. But the Mailing list engines deny my me.com address. That's my problem. I just want to send emails from my iPod with mac.com
