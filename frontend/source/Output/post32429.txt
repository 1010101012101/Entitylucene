Lion's Preview regularly hangs when unhiding with open documents <body> In Lion, I've had an incredible amount of difficult with Preview hanging indefinitely when restoring open documents after being hidden for any extended period of time.  There is no immediate solution except to force quit Preview and relaunch it.  Console reports no error messages except for Preview being manually killed.  Any recommendations on dealing with this problem?    <answer32872> I’ve been having this problem in Lion, and the only workaround I’ve found is to disable Resume, on a once-off or total basis for Preview.  hr  h2Disabling Resume permanently/h2  If you open Terminal (code/Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app/code), and enter the following string, then Resume for Preview will be disabled permanently:  precodedefaults write com.apple.Preview NSQuitAlwaysKeepsWindows -bool false /code/pre  You can also disable Resume for all apps in System Preferences: in the codeGeneral/code pane, untick the checkbox marked codeRestore windows when opening and quitting apps/code. I find Resume generally useful, so I haven’t, but you might want to do this.  hr  h2One-off disabling or Resume/h2  If you don’t switch it off permanently, and you’re working with a lot of files in Preview, you might not want it to re-open them the next time you launch it. When you quit Preview, hold down the codeoption/code key; then the codeQuit Preview/code command becomes codeQuit and Discard Windows/code. Use this, and it won’t reopen all of your files next time. (Keyboard shortcut is codeopt-cmd-Q/code).  If you forget to do this when you close Preview, and it starts hanging, then you can flush the Resume data. Navigate to code~/Library/Saved Application State/com.apple.Preview.savedState/code and delete the file or folder stored there. This deletes all the saved data for Preview, so when you open Preview later, it doesn’t restore any of your saved documents.  This is probably more useful if it’s misbehaving intermittently, than for the problem you describe.  hr  h2Further comments/h2  ul liIf you’ve set Preview to never remember your files, you can temporarily get it to remember them. As with the one-off disable, hold down the codeoption/code key when you quit Preview, then you get the command codeQuit and Keep Windows/code./li liI disabled Resume for Preview shortly after Lion came out, and I’ve not had any problems since. However, I only use Preview for images, not PDFs (I use TeXShop for that), but even so, the hanging is completely gone./li liYou can also have “opt-in” Resume using these steps. If you disable Resume for all apps, then run the Terminal command above with codetrue/code instead of codefalse/code, then you can whitelist Resume-enabled apps, rather than blacklist them. You can find the codecom.apple.Preview/code equivalent for any app by looking at what the appropriate file is called in the codeSaved Application State/code folder. (A quick Google search for Terminal commands involving that app  would also do the trick)./li /ul  I hope some of this is useful and speeds up Preview: it certainly worked for me.  <comment37157> I've had this problem too, especially in 10.7.0 and 10.7.1 - it seems to be something to do with the new way Lion automatically quits and reopens apps without you knowing it to free up memory. 10.7.2 has been much better, but I still occasionally have it happen. <comment37576> Alex, great answer. You should edit this answer and check it as community Wiki. That'll help future readers who stumbled on this. Thanks. <comment39595> I've noticed that Preview often resumes correctly when not trying to open another document.  Anyone tried creating a tool to block open document messages to Preview until the activation message has completed?
