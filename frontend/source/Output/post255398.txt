Network Port Forwarding From a Shared Connection <body> I have my mac connected to a ppp vpn on centos, I’m sharing that connection with a ethernet to my pc. The pc has ftp setup, i can connect to it on the mac by using the internal ip address of the pc. I'm trying to connect  I'm running this script below that i got from another post for portforwarding on mac.  precode192.168.1.13 - Mac computer Internal ip  192.168.3.3 - My pc Internal ip(Getting internet from shared vpn connection of mac) /code/pre  The script:  precode/usr/sbin/natd -alias_address 192.168.1.13 -interface en1 -use_sockets -same_ports -unregistered_only -dynamic -clamp_mss -enable_natportmap -natportmap_interface en0 -redirect_port tcp 192.168.3.3:21 21 -l /code/pre  I run this cmd in terminal  precodesudo ./osx_fw.sh  Password:  Binding to NATPM port failed! /code/pre  I’m not for sure if the vpn would cause that binding to NATPM port failed.  I use this in iptables.  precodeiptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp -d 192.168.1.13 --dport 21 -j DNAT --to 192.168.3.3:21 /code/pre  Can anyone help?
