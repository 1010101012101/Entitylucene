Waking Mac over WiFi by Linux <body> Does anyone know if a mac can be woken up from the sleep state by a Linux machine over WiFi? The router is non-Apple.  <answer282004> Under System Preferences - Energy Saver, select the checkbox "Wake for network access". Note that for Mac laptops this can only be enabled while the laptop is connected to a power source.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Bf3cW.png" alt="enter image description here"  Accessing the Mac over the network from your Linux machine, such as through SSH, will wake the machine.  <comment354887> Please let us know your machine's specs: OS X/macOS version, Mac type and year <comment354892> @oa It's El Capital. iMac late 2015. <comment354893> @William So a mac can't be woken up if it's connected over WiFi at all? <comment355013> @William What about wake on LAN? He said "wake" not "boot". <comment355015> @JMY1000 there are guides about this never done it before http://osxdaily.com/2013/12/14/wake-on-lan-mac-iphone/  Yes you are right technically he said wake not boot so as the guide posted it is probably possible.
