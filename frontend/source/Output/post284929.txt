Changed Time Capsule from device password to user names and passwords - Lost files? <body> Since I want to backup multiple Macs to my Time Capsule, I switched its setup from a device password to multiple user accounts.   Before, I had one sparse bundle on the Time Capsule. Now I can't see that bundle anymore. My TC is 3TB and I only see 1.5TB free, so the file must still be there. How can I access it and move it to one of the user accounts, or still use it for backups?
