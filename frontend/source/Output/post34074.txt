How to send existing photos to photo stream? <body> I just enabled iCloud on my iPad. I've also downloaded iPhoto on my Mac to sync my photos on the iPad. The problem is that I can only get pictures that I downloaded after I enabled iCloud on my iPad.  Is there a way to add all the photos to photo stream?  <answer34076> Drag the photos from the album to your photo stream. Careful though; I did this and can't find a way to undo what I've added to my photo stream!  <comment97670> I don't seem to find a way to act as described on my iPad 3: When chosing "Albums" in my pictures I cannot drag and drop my camera roll. And when I go into my fotos from my camera roll I can select a couple of pictures but I cannot drag and drop them anywhere; and I cannot drag and drop them singly either. <comment216771> I believe @pully6 meant you had to drag photos on iPhoto, on a Mac.
