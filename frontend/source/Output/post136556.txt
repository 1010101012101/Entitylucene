Macs running Mavericks break permissions periodically <body> I work for a college in the UK. We have around 60 Macs on site for which I am responsible for managing. Ever since we upgraded them to Mavericks, we've been experiencing a very strange problem with disk permissions on them.  Every so often, when a standard (i.e. non-admin) user logs onto them, the user is unable to open any installed application. They see a series of question marks in their dock and they can't open the /Applications folder to open applications. Logging on as an administrative user and repairing the disk permissions either by the command line or using Disk Utility fixes the problem and users can open apps again.  This would be fine if it was a one-time thing but it keeps on recurring. Today it happened on all of our Macs at once when they wanted to use them for lessons. I'm sure you can imagine what I've been spending my morning doing. This doesn't seem to happen on any particular schedule or pattern that I can see and this is the first time it's happened to all of them at once.  Our Macs are all running Mavericks, versions between 10.9.1 and 10.9.3. We are running three different kind of Macs: Mid 2010 iMacs, Mid 2010 MacBook Pros and 2013 Mac Minis. They are running OS installations from two different images. They are all joined to our Active Directory domain but not to an Open Directory. The Macs are being managed by the Parallels plugin for SCCM. They are also all running Microsoft System Center Endpoint Protection (SCEP). The only Mac that I've come across this morning which emdidn't/em have b0rked permissions this morning was a MacBook Pro which isn't joined to the domain at present and that doesn't have SCEP installed.  I've checked the diagnostic console on a Mac on which this did happen to this morning but I've found nothing obvious in its logs to indicate why this (or even that it has) happened.  I'm wondering if anyone has ever experienced this before and if they have found a fix.  Thanks,  Ian  /edit In response to a question on a comment that seems to have disappeared, running "ls -l /Applications" returns the following:  precodeOSX6648-Perm:~ itsupport$ ls -l /Applications/
