Recommendations for video editing + screen capturing software <body> I'd like to make a video demo of my upcoming web application. Requirements include:  ol liBeing able to have a sound track (probably just an mp3)/li liBeing able to 'film' screen work and chop it to bits and pieces to be embedded in the movie/li liHaving text, photo effects, fade in-out, constant motion (similar to mac screen saver slide show) etc - nothing too fancy./li li"Timeline" editor where I can combine all those elements and time them perfectly/li liHD output with formats I can export later to Vimeo or YouTube./li /ol  I you have recommendations to video editing/video screen capturing i'd be happy to hear those. I've never done that before, but I do have lots of graphics experience and a good eye. Should be an interesting attempt.  <answer16835> Try strongScreenFlow ($99)/strong  It's a little pricey, but very powerful screen capture utility. You can do the effects/transitions inside, or export and edit it Final Cut or iMovie.  This is an example clip I did a while ago with ScreenFlow and Final Cut.
