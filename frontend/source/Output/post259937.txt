Typing ~ on macbook pro keyboard <body> I have a macbook pro 2015, and I've got the UK keyboard layout. I have trouble typing the standard ~ character as I've only got §/±. Does anyone know any workarounds?  <answer259940> The code~/code on a UK keyboard is located on the left side of the kbdZ/kbd key. To get it, you have to press it with kbd⇧ SHIFT/kbd.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ub2ZQ.png" alt="Keyboard with tilde key marked."  <comment325302> What character do You have on the left side from the letter `Z` ? <comment325303> Oh well that was very unintuitive by me. Thanks a lot Mateusz, that character seems to input ` and ~. Much appreciated. :)
