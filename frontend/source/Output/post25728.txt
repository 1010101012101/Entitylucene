Help getting Nautilus running under MacPorts <body> I have been trying to run Nautilus on OS X 10.6.8 without any luck. First, I installed MacPorts, then installed Nautilus. However when I try to run it from the command line, I am getting an error. I came to this thread and followed the instructions given. However I am still getting this error:  precode(nautilus:27170): Gtk-WARNING **: Locale not supported by C library.     Using the fallback 'C' locale. Xlib:  extension "RANDR" missing on display "/tmp/launch-42nv45/org.x:0".  ** (nautilus:27170): WARNING **: Can not calculate _NET_NUMBER_OF_DESKTOPS  ** (nautilus:27170): WARNING **: Can not calculate _NET_NUMBER_OF_DESKTOPS  ** (nautilus:27170): WARNING **: Can not get _NET_WORKAREA  ** (nautilus:27170): WARNING **: Can not determine workarea, guessing at layout nautilus: Fatal IO error 0 (Unknown error: 0) on X server /tmp/launch-42nv45/org.x:0. /code/pre  And then X11 stops unexpectedly. Can anybody tell me how to solve this?  <answer25757> This sounds like a problem in X11 itself. To find the real issue with X11, you would have to take a look at the generated crash reports. You will find these within the application Console at "Diagnostic Reports".  As a workaround, you could try to use XQuartz instead, which is a package providing an usually more up-to-date version of the X server for Mac OS X.  <comment114820> Macports loads Xquartz how does this differ? <comment114852> Back when I wrote this answer, Apple still shipped X11.app with Mac OS X. As of Mountain Lion they no longer do this and you always have to install XQuartz separately. <comment134396> This question appears to be off-topic because it is needs more information e.g. output from consoles <comment135361> Chances of finding more information is slim after 2 years !!
