Is there any way to show feeds from multiple webcams into separate windows on Mac? <body> I want to simultaneously show multiple camera views to my Skype music students, I figure the best way is the bring each camera's feed into a separate window, then do Desktop Sharing in Skype for Mac. I can show one camera at a time with camera switching in Skype's preferences, but would really like to show 2 or 3 views at once. Anyone know software or solution that will make that possible? Thanks.
