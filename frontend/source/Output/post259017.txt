On macOS Sierra Airplay is always "Looking for Apple TV" <body> Just upgraded to macOS 10.12.1 Sierra and the mirroring display options keeps oscillating between: "Looking for Apple TV" and "Off".  In preferences i have turned AirPlay Off. But it keeps looking for AppleTV. As recommended in an earlier discussion i tried:  precodesudo chmod 000 /System/Library/CoreServices/AirPlayUIAgent.app/Contents/MacOS/AirPlayUIAgent  /code/pre  but it gave an error:  precodechmod: Unable to change file mode on AirPlayUIAgent: Operation not permitted /code/pre  It looks like Sierra always wants to keep connecting to Apple TV - big nuisance. Any other ideas to turn this auto feature off?  <comment323937> Can you reference this "earlier discussion" by giving the source? <comment325213> Possible duplicate of http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/255662/37413 except I don't know if the other person had some problem with it always trying to connect with something or just wanted it disabled for other reasons.
