Downgrading from "Java for OS X Lion Update 1" <body> I recently ran Software Update and installed "Update 1" for Java for Lion. Unfortunately this broke about the only thing I use Java for - a webcam applet to check conditions at a ski area. The applet hangs Safari until I close the tab and force quit the process, and in Chrome it simply displays the Java Applet loading screen with no progress.  So, the questions:  ol liHow can I remove this update?/li liWhere can I get the original version? The only download link I can find now leads to the updated version./li /ol  <answer31646> I don't know where to find original version of Java for Mac OS Lion.  At least you can download emJava Developer Package for Mac OS X 10.7/em with your AppleID or try emJava Developer Package for Mac OS X 10.7 Update 1/em package to be sure if this bug is here.  Tutorials how to downgrade your Java you can find here and here.  <comment36269> Can you give example link to check if Java Developer Package for Mac OS X 10.7 Update 1 package is also broken or not? <comment36276> Haven't tried your solution yet, but this is the page that hangs Safari for me: http://www.craigleith.com/site/index.cfm?DSP=Section&ID=10 <comment36278> Thanks. Gave this a try with the first developer package, but it seems the bug is still there. Perhaps it's not directly related to the update. <comment36285> I see endless loading or white blank space (Safari & recent Opera 11.60) with no errors in console and Oracle VisualVM. <comment36286> I've got [error](http://pastebin.com/X3fHYkqN)! Probably it's server-side problem <comment36288> same for my Windows machine. no luck to download classes.
