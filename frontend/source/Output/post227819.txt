Unable to Adjust Size for pdf in Preview <body> As shown in the screenshot the "Adjust Size" is disabled for the given pdf.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jvvRQ.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  So how do we reduce the size of a pdf in preview (or even skim?)  <answer227829> I did not find out how to do this in preview or skim: so a "real" answer would still be awarded.  However there is a workaround when printing: the print dialog for my HP laserjet has a "Scale" that can be applied. This took care of my immediate need.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Drwog.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer227831> The Adjust Size / Colour feature in Preview doesn't work for PDF files, only for bitmap image files. Usually you don't want to change the format of a PDF document, anyway.   However, if you have a PDF file that contains only embedded bitmap images, and you want a downsized version of that image, it's possible to use the Preview's export feature: strongFile  Export/strong. The export dialog will ask for a pixel density (in ppi) to use for the export, as it is assumed that you are converting vector graphics/text to bitmap graphics…    Another possibility is to use the marquee/selection tool to select an area or the whole page and press Cmd-C, then create a new Preview document from the selected area by pressing Cmd-N, and save the new document in a bitmap format.    I can't say what it does to the exported image if you put in a ppi value different from the actual ppi value of the embedded image. There are commercially sold third-party tools that extract bitmap images from PDFs without resampling them, e.g. Acrobat Pro/DC and others. A smaller and free tool is downloadable via SourceForge: https://sourceforge.net/projects/pdf-images/  <comment277684> Try making a selection on the PDF, then try ⌘K to crop? <comment277685> @perhapsmaybeharry  cropping selects  a portion of the pdf but does not resize the selection. The intent here is to retain the (entire) selection and reduce its resolution <comment277701> Ah, I understand. You want to *scale* the image. Like Dictionarics Anonymous indicated, Preview only does this on images and not PDFs. <comment277704> Thanks - those are probably the only options. They are not adequate for my particular circumstances. However I am going to upvote (though not accept) anyways - since your points are valid and probably helpful to others reading this question. <comment363781> This was the most useful for me too.
