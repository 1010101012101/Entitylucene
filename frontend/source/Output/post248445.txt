Expand current volume in OSX without being destructive? <body> I am looking to grow a Volume on El Capitan that has run out of space, this is a secondary boot point that unfortunately has important information so I cannot be destructive when I do this. I have looked at the Disk Utility app multiple times, but it is frankly crap and will not do what I want it to do.  I know that I can destructively merge Volumes doing something like this:  precode$ diskutil eraseVolume HFS+ Blank /dev/disk0s4                                  # Delete / Remove  $ diskutil list /dev/disk0 (internal, physical):    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    1:          Apple_CoreStorage Macintosh HD            450.3 GB   disk0s2     # Shaved space from here    2:                  Apple_HFS Blank                   20.1 GB    disk0s4     # Partition I want to merge from    3:          Apple_CoreStorage PhoneHome               28.2 GB    disk0s5     # Partition I want to merge into   $ diskutil mergePartitions HFS+ PhoneHome disk0s5 disk0s4                       # Destructive merger =/ /code/pre  Also, attempting to delete this Volume while booted into it will attempt to re-allocate the extra space to code/dev/disk0s2/code, so that doesn't seem to work either. How can I merge or grow the space on code/dev/disk0s5/code without wiping its contents?  <comment307865> I don't think you can do anything approaching what you want with it being CoreStorage in the first place, though I may be misremembering on that. Even with non-CoreStorage volumes I don't know that you can expand backwards, only forwards.
