iTerm2 does not show username, machine name, time <body> On my new mac machine, I could not do autocomplete for Git when I hit Tab.  So I thought to modify the terminal and found certain things on this link.  I may have messed when I installed iTerm2, Oh-My-ZSH, and Solarised Dark. So now I have nice looking terminal and git autocompletion works.   But in the terminal, the user name, machine name etc does not appear, like it is the in above link.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rMeM4.png" alt="enter image description here".  The colour scheme is also not great.  Can someone please help me, possibly step-by-step, on how to show these things like in this image img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0sVbX.png" alt="enter image description here"  I am very new to Mac and please assume that I know very little about how it works.  <answer229276> Everything you're asking has more to do with the shell than with iTerm. There are numerous tutorials on how to set up your codePROMPT/code variable (I use a modified version of this one). Since you're using Oh-my-zsh, try looking through the themes page. There are a variety of styles available (I began with the af-magic prompt). Once you find a prompt you like, feel free to copy the source from the code.oh-my-zsh/themes/code folder to code.oh-my-zsh/custom/themes/code and modify the custom version. Details on custom plugins and themes are available here.   <comment279679> Note that Oh-my-zsh will look in `custom/` and `custom/themes/` for files named `$ZSH_THEME.zsh-theme` if you set the `ZSH_THEME` variable in your `.zshrc`, so you could name a theme `af-magic_mod.zsh-theme`, place it in the `custom` folder, and set your theme to `ZSH_THEME=af-magic_mod`, just the same way you'd set any of the included themes. <comment279687> This worked just like I wanted. But I did not have to copy or move any theme files. All I did was open /zshrc file and set the theme to `ZSH_THEME = ys`.
