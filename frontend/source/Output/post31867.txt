What is icon\r file and how do I delete them? <body> I notice that within my xcode project I see an icon\r file.  When I go to the folder where the project is from finder,  I dont see this file.  I believe this is some sort of hidden file that I should not be able to see.  However, xcode see this file and its causing some error on my project when I try to archive it.    The following is the error that I got:  precodeerror: Codesign check fails : /var/folders/7l/l93zzs6n4h14qb7rmj5r7zn00000gn/T/GtLyx05w1O/Payload/stryker.app: a sealed resource is missing or invalid In architecture: armv6 resource added: /private/var/folders/7l/l93zzs6n4h14qb7rmj5r7zn00000gn/T/GtLyx05w1O/Payload/stryker.app/www/Icon resource missing: /private/var/folders/7l/l93zzs6n4h14qb7rmj5r7zn00000gn/T/GtLyx05w1O/Payload/stryker.app/www/Icon /code/pre  Is there a way I can delete this file?  I can't delete it from within xcode.  When I drag and drop it into trash nothing happened and when I right click it, it doesn't give me the option to delete the file.  The project folder is inside my dropbox folder so I think dropbox is the one that put the file there.   Any idea on how I can delete this?

You can remove the file via terminal with coderm $'Icon\r'/code  Alternatively, if you want to delete the file through Finder, you must make it visible first; also something you can do via terminal: codeSetFile -a v $'Icon\r'/code  hr  Somewhat related info on how to change file's or folder's icon via Terminal: strongChanging a file or folder icon using the Terminal/strong  â€¦ And be sure to see strongIcon? file on OS X desktop/strong on Super User.  <comment36527> Thank you very much sir.  That allowed me to delete the icon\r and now I can succesfully archive my project!
