Get notified of changes to specific iOS and macOS App Store apps? <body> For both my Mac and my iPhone, I leave auto-update of App Store apps turned off. The reason being that there are several apps for which I want to know what is being added/changed during an update. However, this has two problems: 1) I don't care about changes to most of my apps, only a select few. So having to check which apps are being updated is a waste of time if it's not one o the ones I care about. 2) I would actually prefer the apps emdid/em update automatically when changes come up. I just want to know about those changes when they happen.  Is there anyway I can easily setup getting these notifications some other way? And if not, is there anyway I can autoupdate only specific apps (the ones I don't care about changes to)? Thanks!  <comment319129> You can't have auto update on a per-application basis. On both systems it's an all-or-nothing for updates. You'll have to leave the auto as off and review each update as you've been doing. <comment319269> I'm in the same situation. I just manually go into the App Store app, tap on the Updates icon and if none of the ones I want to manually review are listed, I just tap on Update All. Because I do this regularly, I never have a really long list of apps, so it's easy to see those I do want to check the details of. I know this doesn't really provide you what you're after, but it's the best we've got for now (except for those cases where individual apps have been designed to notify you directly of an update).
