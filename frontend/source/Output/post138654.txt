Double tap -> drag and drop stopped working in Chrome when using Logitech mouse <body>    OSX 10.9.4       Chrome Canary: Version 38.0.2086.3 canary (64-bit)       Chrome Stable: Version 35.0.1916.153   Trackpad, magic trackpad work as they should. In Chrome I can double tap on text and drag it and drop it from within the app, and out of the app.  However, when I use my logitech mouse, I can double tap, but I cannot drag and drop the text/image/whatever. If I switch to my trackpad I get the {+} icon and I can move the text around.   Any suggestions as to what I can do to fix this?  <answer138659> I tested a few other mice, and it seems that it was my mouse that was causing the problem. The clicker got too much use over the last 5-6 years, and does not accept the click+hold any longer.
