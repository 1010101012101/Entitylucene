How can I get my new mails? It is "disconnected" <body> I can't get Mail to fetch new emails. Even after quitting and restarting, I can't get new emails and the refresh button is disabled.  I really don't know what to do. I am using Apple Mail 5.2 and Mac OS X version 10.7.  <comment72924> I take it by the Mail version that you are on OS X 10.7 Lion? <comment72925> I am using Mac OS X <comment72930> Yes. Apple Mail only runs on OS X. What version of OS X are you running? <comment72934> the version is 10.7 <comment72935> Thanks to all!! Well, the main problem that made me try to close the program was also the one who gave me the idea of what is wrong... the problem is that Mail stop working well, and when I try to close it, it works even worse, but still works (for me that I am new in Mac is kinda confused, in Linux or Windows when it fails, u notice it), so, someone told me to force to end the program, once done it, Mail was finally closed and when re open was all working fine.  1 hour and half to figure it out ... but hope could help someone in the future, thanks all for your help.
