Does the iPhone 6s in 2G mode conserve more battery than using it in 3G or 4G with cellular data disabled? <body> I mostly use my phone with Cellular Data turned off and prefer to use internet on WiFi all of the time. With that said, keeping my phone in 2G mode for voice calls use less battery than using it in 3G or 4G?
