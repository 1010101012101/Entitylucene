Google Chrome not responding on Lion <body> I have this irritating issue with the latest version of Chrome on my Air running Lion.  At least once a day it ceases to work. It doesnt freeze or crash, it just will not search or go to any sites. If I enter a URL into the browser and hit enter nothing happens. I have to completely quite the program and start again.  Does anyone know why this would be happening?
