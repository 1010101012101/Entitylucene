Copy/Paste creates a hidden files <body> I have a copied music files to USD drive, but after copy/paste, the files are hidden. For example, in Finder:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5Hj2w.png" alt=""  Console:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/cPfoz.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  And in hidden file there are a many attributes.  Example:   codecom.apple.quarantine^@^@^@^A^K^@^@^@�^@^@%com.apple.metadata:kMDItemWhereFroms^@0001;53419077;Google\x20Chrome;BFE9A983-768C-4B56-BC4F-1A2B69A72963bplist00�^A^B_^P9/code  How can I can a disable the hiding of files for coping/pasting files?  <answer127675> These are AppleDouble files. As you discovered by opening them, they contain metadata for the files that you copied.  Since the disk is formatted as MS-DOS, OS X needs somewhere to store certain metadata for the file. This metadata is stored in an AppleDouble file. Such metadata includes Finder information and extended attributes.  These files begin with a dot, so are hidden. You shouldn't unhide these files, or modify them. You can remove AppleDouble files using codedot_clean -m/code  <comment149574> I am sure it is only me, but I have trouble understanding your question, I will edit it and you tell me if you do not like my edit. <comment149582> Or use applications like CleanMyDrive to automatically delete these unwanted hidden files from non mac drives. <comment149630> It is possible to completely disable this feature? <comment149717> @ZhukV You can use [BlueHarvest](http://www.zeroonetwenty.com/blueharvest/) — it doesn't prevent their creation but automatically removes them. Note that you won't be able to store certain metadata.
