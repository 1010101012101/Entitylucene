iOS9: configure spotlight news suggestions <body> When I swipe left from the first page of my home screen, iOS 9 brings me to the spotlight screen.  There I can see Siri suggestions and news. Is there a way to configure which news are showed in this page?  Note: I do not have the news app, I suppose because it is not yet available in all the countries.  <answer205962> You need to set your region to USA from settings.app to use news app   <answer206183> strongEdit/strong: As of iOS 10 you can remove the news widget.  It is not possible in iOS 9. See this question for more information about turning all/news suggestions off. Removing news headlines from Spotlight Search in iOS 9  <answer248467> There seems to be no way to "configure" the spotlight suggestions for the news. You can only disable it altogether from Settings/General/Spotlight search.  All I get are news from NY Times, CNN, Washington Post.   <answer254432> Go to Language and Region in General settings and set it to your region.  <comment248550> Could you add a screen shot of this? You might be on to a solution on customizing this for many.
