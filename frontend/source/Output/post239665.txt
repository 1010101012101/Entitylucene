MacBook Pro Issues: Stalling and Detection of External USB <body> I have a MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Early 2015). I bought it in end of July 2015 and am using it since then. I am using OS X El Capitan Version 10.11.4  Recently I am facing two problems.  ol listrongMy computer hangs (stalls), and then I cant do anything other then to press start button./strong This even happens when very few applications are opened on my MacBook (for example, 2 pdfs, a powerpoint, Safari with 3 or 4 windows). This is very annoying and this is happening quite often now like at least one everyday.  strongWhat can i do in this case?/strong When this happens I cant press any key just to start the MacBook again. This was not happening at all when I had OS X Yesemite. strongIs any one facing something similar. Please guide me/strong/li /ol  strongUpdate:/strong Option-Command-ESC didnt work when my MacBook was hanged. When I press Option-Command-Esc, nothing happen. I just have to restart computer by pressing start button. Is there any other suggestion.  ol start="2" liMy MacBook also not detect my external hard disk sometimes. In that case when I shutdown and start the computer, then it detects. strongI dont understand the cause of this behaviour. This was also not happening when I was using OS X Yesemite/strong./li /ol  strongUpdata:/strong I have tired this post, but this didn't worked for me   <comment294217> You have multiple questions here, which should probably be broken into two or more separate questions. As to question #2, the OS X equivalent to CTRL-ALT-DEL is Option-Command-ESC. This can also be found in the Apple Menu  Force Quit... This will usually bring up a window where you can kill running apps individually, or restart the Finder. <comment294220> @IconDaemon, I will try when this happens again. Normally when this happens my mouse gets stuck .. but i will see if Option-Command-ESC works in this situation. <comment294464> @IconDaemon ,Option-Command-ESC didnt work when my MacBook was hanged. Any other suggestion what to do?? <comment294472> When a Mac does not respond to keystrokes, it is well and truly in bad shape. It could be most anything from a bad hard disk, to faulty RAM, or even malfunctioning internal electronics. Question: when the external drive is NOT connected, does it ever hang? I had a bad FireWire external drive once that would hang my Mac eventually, and hang any other Mac it was connected to. Perhaps your external drive is the cause of the hang? **Note:** 'hanged' is the verb used when somebody is executed. 'Hung' is the correct term to describe a computer which has so badly crashed is is rendered inoperable. <comment294475> @IconDaemon, it have hung when external hard disk is not connected.  Macbook is less than an year old and external hard drive is around 6 months old. <comment294722> @IconDaemon, I have tried CTRL-ALT-DEL and starting finder, as you suggested, but that didn't worked for me also i tried [this post](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/125854/remount-drive-without-physically-disconnecting), but this didn't worked for me too
