How can I open a file in its default application from the command line in OS X? <body> How can I open a file in its default application from the command line?    For example if I have a file codefoo.doc/code, can I type codecommand ./foo.doc/code into the CLI and have that file open in Word?  Note: on my linux machine, I would use codexdg-open/code but that doesn't work on my Mac.  <answer60836> codeopen foo.doc/code, or codeopen -n foo.doc/code to force it to open a new window if one is already open for that app.  <comment70092> `open` is a very good command to get to know. <comment70093> `open -n` opens a new instance, not a window. <comment70098> Also nice is `open .` (or any directory name in place of `.`), which opens Finder (the default application for a directory). <comment279075> where could I set default preferred program that open opens for specific file type? ( it would be great if this preference stored somewhere, cause setting it by gui is very annoying )
