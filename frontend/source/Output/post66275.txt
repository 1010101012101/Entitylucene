Can Spotlight show results for disconnected drives? <body> I have several external hard drives which I would like to search for files with Spotlight. They cannot be all connected at the same time.   How can I get Spotlight results for offline external hard drives ?  <answer66276> You can't, Spotlight stores the search index in the root folder of the volume. When the volume is disconnected, you cannot get search results from it.
