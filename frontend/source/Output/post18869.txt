Creating a quick event in iCal using LaunchBar & AppleScript <body> what i want to figure out is how to send a String to iCal 5 on 10.7 which is interpreted the same way as creating a quick event, as if you press CMD+N with iCal in focus and then just type "tea at 5" into the popover.  a simplistic sketch (which doesn't work):  precodeon handle_string(theString)     tell application "iCal"         make new event with theString     end tell end handle_string /code/pre  i'm comfortable with programming but never done anything with AppleScript. Is there a reference for application commands?  edit:  this works and it's not even slow, the only caveat is that it breaks the  clipboard:  precodeon handle_string(theString)      tell application "LaunchBar"         perform action "Copy" with string theString     end tell      tell application "iCal" to activate      tell application "System Events"         keystroke "n" using {command down}         keystroke "v" using {command down}         keystroke return     end tell  end handle_string /code/pre  it's sort of finicky to use the clipboard in a script? i can't figure out how to temporarily hold the clipboard content in a variable, and then set the clipboard back to it. i'll accept your answer if you help me with that.  <answer18883> Here's a script that lets you restore the clipboard:  precodeset oldClip to the clipboard as string --save the old clipboard set the clipboard to "hello world" --put your stuff in the clipboard log (the clipboard) --do your stuff here set the clipboard to oldClip as string --restore the old clipboard /code/pre  <comment20684> Is the existing LaunchBar calendar integration insufficient? You just type the name of the calendar, a space, and then the event. For example, to add your event to my iCal calendar called "Family" I just type `family tea @ 5pm` and poof, there's an even called "tea" at 5pm the same day (if I do it before 5pm) or the next day (if it's already past 5pm). This LaunchBar help page describes it: http://www.obdev.at/resources/launchbar/help/WorkingWithCalendars.html <comment20718> hehe, yes i tried that. the clipboard seems to be really sensitive about who makes these calls though, i'm seeing errors in the console like this: `27.07.11 04:33:16,733 LaunchBar: NSAppleScript Error -1728: LaunchBar got an error: Canâ€™t get clipboard. (Range: 0, 0) (Application: LaunchBar)`. So the non-trivial part would be, where do i put these commands in the context of my script? <comment20721> huh, well sort of overlooked this... nice! <comment20739> That error shows that LaunchBar is causing problems. Try saving your stuff in the clipboard from outside of the `tell application` block.
