iPad3 iOS 9.3.5 fails to refresh EPUB file in iBooks transferred through DropBox <body> I've created an EPUB file and used DropBox to transfer my partial file (chapters 1-40) to iBooks on my iPad which worked fine.  When I finished the EPUB file, I attempted to refresh it on my iPad.  I deleted it from my iPad; copied it updated file (chapters 1-53) to DropBox. I again selected open it in iBooks, but the original, deleted file with only the initial portion (chapters 1-40) reappeared.  I tried it on my Mac and the whole book (chapters 1-53) was added. The only way I am able to get the updated EPUB was to give it a different name in DropBox.  <comment342259> Do you have Auto iCloud Uploads for iBooks on? <comment342986> iBooks sync to iCloud Drive is disabled.
