Retina dsiplay support on Intellj Idea for Java /JavaScript development <body> I have seen this question on retina display issues while working with Eclipse on Macbook . I have a latest personal Intellij Idea License and would like to know your views of retina display support for codeIntellij Idea 12/code? I am planning to buy an 11 inch Macbook Air and main purpose is normal net surfing + Java development on Intellij Idea . Are there any gotchas that I should take into consideration before buying?  P.S: I am not an Apple user and hence would like to make sure that I get inputs from experienced people before I make this investment.  <answer75839> IntelliJ Idea 12 is a perfectly well behaved 64bit retina enabled application on Mountain Lion.   I use IntelliJ, day in, day out on Windows PCs for Enterprise Java Dev, because it's the best there is. IMHO On the Mac it's even better.
