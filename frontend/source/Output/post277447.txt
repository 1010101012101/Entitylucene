Chrome on macOS suddenly rejects self signed certificates <body> I have been happily using self signed certificates for locally hosted sites running on apache2 for a couple of years.  Today emone/em of those certificates expired - no biggie, I recreated it and replaced the cert in my keychain.  However, Chrome is now giving me an error when I try to visit the site:     Certificate Errorbr   There are issues with the site's certificate chain (net::ERR_CERT_COMMON_NAME_INVALID).   So I thought maybe the cert I had generated was dodgy.  But no - all of my other (unexpired) self signed certs have stopped working too!  Is it a coincidence?  I don't know.  I thought maybe it didn't like my 'common name' (which was codecom06/code, e.g. codehttps://com06//code) so I tried with codecom06.dev/code.  No luck!  What is going on?

However, this excellent answer explains how to generate compatible certs using open ssl.  To check if your cert contains an SAN, use codeopenssl x509 -in my.crt -text/code  <answer283870> You can temporarily disable the SAN enforcement using the EnableCommonNameFallbackForLocalAnchors policy, see this page for details. This will allow you to reissue your certificates when time allows it.  On OSX this can be achieved using the following command:  precodedefaults write com.google.Chrome EnableCommonNameFallbackForLocalAnchors -bool true /code/pre  <comment349197> Are you asking if chrome is ratcheting up security and doubling down on trust? Or how to get better carts like using certbot or other sources? <comment349207> No, I'm just wondering why my certs stopped working all of a sudden
