Is it common for Apple support to ask for User's account name and password for screen repair over the phone? <body> Initially is was doing an online chat with an Apple advisor and I was told I will get a phone call, which I did.  Towards the end of the call the support person asked me my admin account name and password, which I found odd for screen repair, but I did not provide.   Is it common for a supports person to ask for the password? Is it a violation of support policy? If so, how do I report it? I have case ID and the name this person provided.
