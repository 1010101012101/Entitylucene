MacBook Pro failing Internet Recovery with exclamation mark <body> My MacBook Pro from 2009 restarts itself and doesn't charge, I tried recovery hd but I hadn't used Time Machine so the option is not there and now I'm trying Internet Recovery it give an exclamation mark on the big round web icon.   <answer177003> Try retting the System Management Controller [SMC] (instructions here).
