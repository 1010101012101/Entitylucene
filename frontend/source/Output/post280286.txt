What is the cause of a MacBook Pro getting the error "panic CPU 0 caller 0xffffff000f56f6ef): initproc exited" and no longer being able to login? <body> This was fixed by reinstalling macOS Sierra, but Iâ€™m wondering why this happened.img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/VpgOf.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <comment352537> You blocked-out everything we need to see the cause of the crash.  Can you just copy/paste the text instead of using a photo of the screen? <comment352544> He has blocked out nothing, that's what a kernel panic looks like. In order to get more info you would have to access the hard drive from the Mac that crashed and look at the system.log or the kernel.log. Sometimes they have more information in them than what the panic spits out to the screen. But since you re-installed the OS I am unsure if that info would be retained. Look through the console for times before you re-installed Sierra <comment352580> @SteveChambers Unfortunately, Sierra's Console may not be of any help. See my answer [here](http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/278685/168832). <comment352597> Crap, I hate it when Apple does stuff like that...
