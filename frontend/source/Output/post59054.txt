How to view text/rtf message part in .eml files which are ignored since Mail 6.0 upgrade? <body> I have a bunch of .eml files that contain the message part encoded as  precodeContent-Type: text/rtf Content-Transfer-Encoding: base64 Content-Disposition: inline /code/pre  Up to OS X Lion, Mail and Quick View both happily displayed the message.  The new Mail 6.0 included in Mountain Lion seems to ignore this part of the message and shows only a blank sheet (same for Quick View, of course).   Any ideas if that is intended or a bug and how I could resolve this?  <answer127625> Solved in OS X Mavericks (10.9.x)
