How do you use Family Sharing to effectively merge multiple Apple IDs? <body> My wife and I have separate Apple IDs. To simplify (!) things a while ago we both started using a third ID.    Now with Family Sharing we can each access the other's purchases.  So I set myself up as the family organizer, invited Laura, and invited the 3rd account.  Well to accept the invitation for the third account, I would have to sign out of iCloud, loosing a bunch of data, or possibly having merge problems later.    The invitation has to be opened in Mail. I try not to use Mail. I certainly didn't want to not only sign out of iCloud, but also configure yet another account on Mail.  (The third Apple ID forwards to both of us.)  What to do?  <answer256095> .The answer turned out to be only slightly convoluted.  ol liSet up a new user on my mac, tempaccount./li liLogin as new user./li liUse 3rd id as my icloud login./li liSet up my gmail account as the Mail account.  (Since I don't intend to send email with this account on a regular basis, I don't really care if Mail.app gets confused./li liFind the email forwarded from 3rd id to my gmail account./li liClick and accept./li /ol  With luck this may help other people in similar circumstances.
