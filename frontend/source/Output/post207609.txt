iPhone does not see WiFi shared by Mac Mini <body> Does anyone knows why my iPhone cannot see and connect to the WiFi that is shared on my Mac Mini? At the same time, iPad does see it and WiFi works perfectly.  I am using my Mac Mini as a wireless router. Mini is connected via Ethernet and then WiFi is simply shared. My other devices (iPad and MacBook) see and use that connection.  Thanks, PM  <comment250466> What version of iPhome and iPad and versions of the operating systems <comment250492> Iphone is 4s (but it does not work on my friend iPhone 6, we tried) iPad is Air 16GB They both have 9.0.1 <comment250493> iPhone4s does not work on all WiFi frequencies <comment250737> This is great! Thanks so much [Mark](http://apple.stackexchange.com/users/237/mark)! I changed channel to 10 and it started working like a charm. Keep in mind, thou, that the same applies even for new iPhone 6 -- it does not work on higher frequencies, same as older 4s.
