Why does htop show different CPU levels for processes than top or Activity Monitor? <body> I installed codehtop/code through codebrew/code, real pleasure of a view compared with codetop/code.  The totals across both CPUs for codetop/code align with the sum of totals per-CPU in codehtop/code. E.g. right now I see about 40% per CPU in codehtop/code, or 80% of codeCPU, and/codetop` gives the right number.  But the individual processes are completely different. codeCrashPlan/code in codetop/code currently gives ~20%, and if I sum up all of the individual tasks in codetop/code it gets to the right total.  In codehtop/code, all of the individual tasks show 0.0%, even if the total per CPU is high.   In sum:  ol liCPU of individual processes in codetop/code do not equal those in codehtop/code/li liThe sum of CPU of individual processes in codehtop/code do not equal the total CPU used in codehtop/code./li /ol  What am I misunderstanding? How do I read codehtop/code results?  <answer190737> Turned out to be a permissioning problem.

Tried with `sudo`, same thing. <comment262531> Does this answer help explain the differences? http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/65835/htop-reporting-much-higher-memory-usage-than-free-or-top <comment262532> It would... if I were on Linux with `/proc`, but it doesn't exist on OS X. Maybe it is just an issue with the 0.8.x port?
