How do I remove /etc/nologin <body> I was perusing man pages for fun, as I often do when bored, and happened to be playing around with codelogin/code today. The codelogin/code man page mentioned that creating a code/etc/nologin/code file would prevent a user from logging in. I decided to try it.   The good new is it works as advertised. The bad news is I can no longer use the Terminal. I can't remove the file with coderm/code for obvious reasons, and I can't even delete it from Finder because I can't see hidden files.  How do I regain control of my system?  <answer288179> Power down the system (using the standard Shut Down in the Apple menu) and then start it up again. Shutdown should remove the nologin file for you.  <answer288185> If you have another admin user on that Mac you can open a shell as that user and rely on codesudo/code.  If not, boot to single user mode and remove the file.   ul lihttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201573/li /ul  <comment363889> `/etc/nologin` works for all users, using another one won't help
