How to disable 3D acceleration on the Mac Book Air? <body> I have a Mac Book Air 2010 with an NVidia GeForce 320M chip. When I use Xcode 6 in the View Debugging tool (a 3D interface that allows debugging the view hierarchy of an app),  the computer crashes and then reports an error with GPU driver (similar bug reported here).  One solution might be to disable the 3D acceleration with a utility called codegfxCardStatus/code. Unfortunately, this solution does not work for the Mac Book Air. Is there any other method to tweak the graphic driver?  Many thanks!  <answer148755> One way of disabling your graphics is safe mode. I don't know if your xcode debug tool will run in safe mode but unless you know otherwise, I think it's worth a shot. good luck  OS X: What is Safe Boot, Safe Mode?     Safe Mode in Mac OS X v10.5 or later also disables Quartz Extreme (hardware accelerated graphics). Applications that depend on Quartz Extreme do not open in Safe Mode, and the Mac OS X menu bar will appear solid even if "Translucent Menu Bar" is enabled in Desktop &amp; Screen Saver preferences.   <comment174394> interesting question, it's like I could've asked it myself! ;) <comment174395> The error report:  Kernel Extensions in backtrace:  com.apple.GeForceTesla(8.2.4)[B0074750-2FC6-3E26-BEA0-5AD5469686CF]@0xffffff7f827d6000-0xffffff7f828a0fff  dependency: com.apple.iokit.IOPCIFamily(2.9)[2852ACFE-FD28-3C37-9B39-885201BB8D25]@0xffffff7f814bf000  dependency: com.apple.iokit.IONDRVSupport(2.4.1)[D41125CE-69BD-32E7-9B1D-4E83431662DD]@0xffffff7f818be000  dependency: com.apple.iokit.IOGraphicsFamily(2.4.1)[75D81741-64C1-3941-ADFA-9D6B6C434EE4]@0xffffff7f8187b000  dependency: com.apple.nvidia.classic.NVDAResmanTesla(8.2.4)[D61B2BB9-4289-318D-9197-5E1E13B1FF32]@0xffffff7f818ce000 <comment175289> Thank you for your answer. This indeed disabled the 3-D but also the View Debugging tool :( <comment181782> @neural5torm Thanks for posting that backtrace; I found this page by searching for the UUID `B0074750-2FC6-3E26-BEA0-5AD5469686CF`. :-) <comment205279> I have the same problem, I think it is/was an issue with Xcode. <comment327324> Everybody who is experiencing this needs to file a Radar with Apple.  http://radar.apple.com
