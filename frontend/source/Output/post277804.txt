Mounting a disk image without the "nodev" option <body> I need to mount a disk image. From terminal, I issued:  precodehdiutil attach &lt;myImage.sparseimage&gt; /code/pre  Now if I run codemount/code I get:  precode/dev/disk2s2 on /Volumes/&lt;myDisk&gt; (hfs, local, nodev, nosuid, journaled, noowners, mounted by administrator) /code/pre  The codenodev/code flag is creating problems for my next commands. Is there a way to disable it?  <answer277873> You can't easily change the way codehdiutil/code mounts the image. You can, however, change the status of a mounted volume using the codemount/code command with the code-u/codeoption. The following will do what you wish:  codesudo mount -u -o dev /Volumes/&lt;mydisk&gt;/code  <comment349771> I didn't try but I think this answers my question. However, after discussions on #macosx @freenode, I found out that creating and accessing device nodes on a mounted volume could create serious problems to my whole system (they explained that a new node on the mounted volume could wrongly reference my hdd, so a program wishing to write to that node could actually write to my hdd and corrupt it). Do you agree with this? <comment349898> Yep, adding and accessing device nodes directly is dangerous and can be fraught with problems.
