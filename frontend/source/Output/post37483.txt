Functions keys in windows 7 macbook <body> I have a late 2007 MacBook 3,1 with windows 7 x64 installed on it as part of bootcamp. I can't set the function keys to behave as they would on a pc... I have to press fn each time in order to use their original functionality. I don't have any kind of boot camp option under control panel, so I'm puzzled what to do.  <answer37485> I'm not entirely clear what the problem is, but I expect it might be solved by going to (while it's running Mac OS) System Preferences  Keyboard  "Use all F1, F2 keys, etc. as standard function keys" and toggling it.  That's just a hypothesis; I don't have Boot Camp.  <answer37562> Ok, I have downloaded bootcamp 4 and installed it with BootCamp64.msi and now I have a BootCamp option under control panel. Works like charm!  <comment42537> That can be done from OSX, but not from Windows 7. <comment42538> This is true, but I thought maybe it would carry over to the way Windows handles the keyboard. Oh, well!
