Restore app windows to their original Spaces <body> When re-opening an app, all of its windows end up on the first Space, regardless of their original placement:  strongOriginal layout: one app has two windows open, each in a separate Space/strong  precode+-----[ Space 1 ]-----+  +-----[ Space 2 ]-----+ |                     |  |                     | |  [Chrome window 1]  |  |  [Chrome window 2]  | |                     |  |                     | |                     |  |                     | +---------------------+  +---------------------+ /code/pre  strongIncorrect layout after app restart: both windows are in the first Space/strong  precode+-----[ Space 1 ]-----+  +-----[ Space 2 ]-----+ |                     |  |                     | |  [Chrome window 1]  |  |                     | |  [Chrome window 2]  |  |                     | |                     |  |                     | +---------------------+  +---------------------+ /code/pre  hr  Is there a setting or an app that would make it possible to have apps restore their windows in the Spaces they were originally located before the app was quit?   <answer189229> I am aware that my answer doesn't address your issue but it is a close workaround. I am using a software called Cinch and SizeUp to reposition windows. Resizing a window across space and screen is really fast and is done using keyboard shortcut.  The software comes with a trial version for you to test it. http://www.irradiatedsoftware.com/sizeup/  <answer269664> There is a bug #74812 in Chromium. Vote for it!  Same question on Superuser.  <comment224178> If you're going to give separate spaces to individual windows, couldn't you just use full-screen mode, which essentially does the same thing? <comment224204> Full-screen is not what I'm looking for. My typical workflow is to have a dedicated Space for each project I'm working on. So I have many active Spaces, each of which usually has a Chrome window, an editor window, a terminal window, etc. And I don't want to spend time distributing windows across Spaces every time I reboot, restart an app, or an app crashes. So I'm really interested in just what you see in the diagram above: to have apps or the OS remember which Space each individual _window_ was before an app was quit. <comment224206> Not sure why people are having issue with OP's question. I get impression that people don't understand how Spaces and Mission Control works. From my perspective, I see the OP's issue frequently, and the behaviour is inconsistent across various applications, such as Safari and Finder windows. Sometimes the windows go to their various Spaces, and sometimes not. <comment224225> @Vzzdak Good point about the behaviour being inconsistent. Forgot to mention that.
