Why is my script editor coming up with connection invalid after running it for a while? <body> This is the script I've found on the web I'm trying to just have the script drop items for me by pressing 1, but it works only for a little while before script comes up with an error "error "System Events got an error: Connection is invalid." number -609"  I use this script  precodedelay 3   tell application "RuneScape" to activate   repeat       delay 5       set mydate to current date       repeat while ((current date) - mydate &lt; 1)           tell application "System Events" to keystroke (key code 83)       end repeat   end repeat   /code/pre  <answer163835> For a double-click every 5 seconds, until you quit the script, try just  precodedelay 3   tell application "RuneScape" to activate   repeat       delay 5       tell application "System Events"           keystroke (key code 83)           keystroke (key code 83)       end tell   end repeat   /code/pre  <comment191852> How many times are you expecting it to press the key? Once? Every 5 seconds? As fast as it can until tomorrow? <comment191868> Well I really only want it to click a couple of times every 5 seconds <comment191999> foe some reason when I try this it only wants to type 1 in the comments section it does not want to press 1 in my action bar. It seems to only work when I put the date section in there?
