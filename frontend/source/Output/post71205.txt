Adium combined contacts sync <body> Over time, I have created quite a clean list of all my contacts across various IM networks - Faceboo, Google, MSN, ICQ - where every contact has their respective IM network account merged into one using Adiums "contact merging" capability.  Since I plan on starting with new system installation from scratch, I was wondering if there was an option for exporting those contacts to Adium-readable format, or maybe combining them to some already existing contacts list solution like Google Contacts.
