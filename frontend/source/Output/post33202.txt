iPhone Gmail Exchange Password Error <body> I use an Exchange account to sync my Gmail account to the iPhone's mail app. Recently (the past 2 days or so), every time I try to open the account I get an error that says my password is incorrect. I've reentered the password several times with no luck; I've even verified the password by opening up gmail on my laptop, so I know the password is correct.  This problem was outlined on the FeldThoughts blog, so I tried following his advice to unlock the captcha in google apps, but that didn't do anything either.  Is there anything else I can do?  strong[Edit]/strong I'm not using 2 step authentication, and I'm using "Google Sync"/"Exchange", not imap or pop. This page explains how I set up Google sync.  <comment37866> are you using the imap or pop gmail setting? <comment37887> Are you using two steps authentication? <comment37945> @Graeme see my edits above, thanks! <comment37947> @Gio no, not using 2 step authentication <comment41419> Have you removed the account and re-added it? <comment41509> @MattLove I tried doing that, no luck either. I eventually just installed the Gmail app for iPhone and used that. <comment41510> Do you have a friend or relative with an iPhone that you could attempt setting up your account on their device? This would be a good way to isolate if it's something related to your device or if it's something on the Google server. <comment41526> I think it was just something with the iPhone's mail app, but I'll try setting it up on a friend's phone.
