Why can't I add artwork to my music in iTunes? <body> I have a few songs that don't have artwork, and would like to manually add the cover art. I'm trying to use iTunes (Get Info  Artwork  Add Artwork). However, the 'Add Artwork' button is grayed out and cannot be clicked. Is there a way to fix this?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pVOm2.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer226657> One reason the strongAdd Artwork/strong button can be grayed out when selecting a song in strongiTunes/strong and then strongGet Info/strong, is the emfile/em does not have emwrite permissions/em set.  Select the song in strongiTunes/strong and then emright-click/em it, then select strongShow in Finder/strong.  In strongFinder/strong select the emfile/em and then emright-click/em it, then select strongGet Info/strong.  Under the strongSharing &amp; Permissions:/strong does it show strongRead only/strong for you?  If yes change the empermissions/em so you have strongRead &amp; Write/strong empermissions/em.  The image below shows strongAdd Artwork/strong grayed out when the emfile permissions/em are set to strongRead only/strong.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5Vaak.png" alt="Read only Permissions"  The image below shows strongAdd Artwork/strong active when the emfile permissions/em are set to strongRead &amp; Write/strong.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gMK9R.png" alt="Read &amp; Write Permissions"  If it shows strongRead only/strong for you, then click the strongLock/strong icon on the strongGet Info/strong emsheet/em and enter your password and then click the arrow next to the permission for emYour Name (Me)/em and select strongRead &amp; Write/strong, then click the strongLock/strong icon.  <comment275185> @user3439894 Sorry! I meant to say 'add artwork'. <comment275194> You can usually just drag an image to that area. <comment275237> Where did the song come from, how did it get into iTunes? <comment346292> Thank you! but that doesn't work for me, I have read & write in the finder but the add artwork button is still grey. <comment346293> OK I got it, it;s because it's a wave file, works on .aif
