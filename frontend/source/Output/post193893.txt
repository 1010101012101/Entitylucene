How do I transparently compress a directory? <body> I'd like to enable HFS+ compression for a directory, applying it to both the existing files in that directory and newly copied files. I expect to be able to read and write the contents of that directory normally.  Does HFS+ treat non-compressible files intelligently, say by trying to compress the first few KB of the file and bailing if it doesn't compress? I don't want non-compressible files expanding or their access significantly slowed down by compression and de-compression.  Is this possible to do out of the box in Yosemite? I'm also open to installing a third-party app (even a command-line one) to enable the compression, if I can then uninstall it later and have the directory retain the compression.  I found afsctool, but it hasn't had a release or update in an year and a half, and I don't want to use unmaintained software. Besides, afsctool works only for existing files, not newly copied ones.  <answer265709> The compression it-self is out of box, however macOS by default doesn't compress any files.  However you can use Clusters app which will automatically compress selected folders or given file extensions (it silently work in the background). Once it finishes, you can always disable it.  <comment231184> not sure if this is a dupe or not, so I'll just post this link, see if it helps at all - http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/50525/creating-an-automated-hfs-compressed-folder  Also http://superuser.com/questions/579371/does-os-x-support-disk-compression <comment231189> I checked those, and this post is not a dupe of the first one, since I'm not interested in cobbling together a solution using scripts to compress newly added files. Besides, this question adds another consideration, which is that already compressed files should perform no worse. <comment333132> Clusters hasn't been updated in years and I've had numerous troubles with it in more recent versions of macOS, including corrupting files it has compressed. <comment333135> I'm using Clusters on macOS Sierra without major issues. Sometimes it get stuck or freezing, but after restart it continues to work fine.
