The Printers &amp; Scanners control panel is a 'set &amp; forget' control, one you really only need if you add a new printer.  You deal with the regular task of adjusting printer defaults for a given print job from the Print menu in your current application - this example from Safari  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/UA81u.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment259046> Thanks for the response. But I want to give two-sided printouts. I don't get that option anywhere. I have edited in my question. Please check. "Two-sided" dropdown is greyed out.
