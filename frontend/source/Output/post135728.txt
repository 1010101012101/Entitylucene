Using AppleScript to lock screen <body> I need an applescript which locks my Mac in the same way pressing kbdshift/kbd+kbdctrl/kbd+kbdeject/kbd would. I tried two different approaches, but both failed. The first one was to search the internet for a script, which failed. There are only solutions with screensaver or other applications, which I don’t want. I just want to use what I described. The second one was to tell applescript to press the three keys which didn’t work. If someone could tell me how to lock my Mac or how to tell applescript to press three keys, I would be really happy, because I am getting kinda’ frustrated.  <answer135732> I use a macro to accept the shortcut Command-L. Having recently switched from Windows to Mac, am easy way to lock my screen was important. In Windows, one merely needs to press the Windows key and L, and, voila, locked.   Using Keyboard Maestro, I created a macro for the shortcut Command-L, being essentially the same (comparing the Command key to the Windows key). The shortcut triggers the function "Login Window", which locks the screen. Easy peasy, at least to me.  (In Keyboard Maestro, the "Login Window" function is under Actions  System Control.)  <answer135740> Getting information from this answer and this answer:  ol liPress the Spotlight button at the top right of the screen (kbdCmd/kbd + kbdSpace/kbd)/li liSearch codeKeychain Access/code.

See Lock screen shortcut on Mac OS X for an illustrated step-by-step guide.  <comment160988> That worked. Thank you very much. <comment231064> Just to note: alfred and the cmd+shift+eject kills the network when it suspends the machine. This is super handy because it *just* locks the screen. <comment289454> When I run the script, it opens the keychain menu and gets stuck. When I close the menu, I get this error: `System Events got an error: Can’t get menu 1 of menu bar item 2 of menu bar 1 of application process "SystemUIServer". Invalid index.` <comment289757> @AgentME are you sure you've done steps 1-4? I've also updated the code so try that after doing steps 1-4 :) <comment320663> @ᔕᖺᘎᕊ I get the same error as above, "Invalid Index" <comment323547> I combined this answer with [the accepted answer](http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/135740/80045) and it worked very well. Maybe the accepted answer could incorporate this. <comment350304> Contrary to the code in the accepted answer, the code of this answer does not require setting privileges for all apps where you want to use your shortcut and also does not require that the keychain status is visible in the menu bar.
