What about copying using the Finder? <body> From this link, How can I speed up SD card writing speed (using /dev/disk*) on a MacBook Pro?, it implies the SD card might be alright... just because the software is using the buffered version of the disk...  Now, I mostly use the Finder to copy files, and it takes over 10hours to copy 40GB of files (around 7000 images of various sizes) to the SD card... and it seems to die without completing the copying. The copying was left alone overnight.   Now what to do?  Macbookair4,2 128 apple SSD (SD interface is spec'ed at 48MB/src max) 10.11.3 Class10 SD card 64GB (80MB/sec transfer rate) formatted as HFS+ journaled  Found out the copying the same files (a portion of it) to USB thumb drive (16GB) is much much faster than copying to SD card (64GB) on the Macbookair4,2.   <comment274312> You've left out the most important information, the hardware specifications, along with test info using information from the linked question in your question. We have no idea what Mac or SD card, and filesystem on the SD Card, your using or results of any performance tests showing speed/time differentials between Finder and Terminal writing to `/dev/disk*` or `/dev/rdisk*`, etc.  Are the copy operation being done with/without additional load on the CPU by other things going on at the same time?  Have you run hardware diagnostics? <comment274313> Agreed, and additional bottlenecks include hard drive read speed, SD memory class, processor speed, disk format, and large vs small file transfers. Copying 1 GB of thousands of files will take far longer than a 1GB sequential write of 1 file. Copying to FAT will take longer than HFS. Also, please bring the elements of the related article you care about into your question. <comment274314> And, can you achieve 80MB/sec when you transfer a single large file (e.g. 1GB movie) <comment274396> Will try soon. Disk space is so tight, I need to reboot regularly to clear all caches stored in the SSD <comment274440> Using Disk Utility to do a secure erase, and from Activity Monitor Disk page, I can see the maximum Data written/sec can be as high as 17MB/sec. On average it's 11-13MB/sec. Would the hardware be OK?
