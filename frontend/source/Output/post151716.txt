Notification settings aren't being retained <body> After upgrading an iMac and MacBook Air from Mavericks to Yosemite, changes to Notifications aren't being retained:  ul liLooking at the Notifications Preference Pane - there are a set of apps with Notification settings./li liChanging Notification settings for any of these apps works - ie I can change the alert style, whether notifications appear in Notification Center, etc.  ul liThese settings are respected until I reboot / logout, at which point they revert back the original settings./li liNew apps will appear in the preference pane when they are run. Notification settings can be changed. After rebooting, the app disappears from the notification preference pane until I run it again, at which point it appears with default settings./li /ul/li /ul  So what seems to be happening is that these settings aren't being saved to disk. I have:   ul lirepaired permissions/li lideleted the code~/Library/Application Support/NotificationCenter/code folder/li /ul  None of this had made any difference. Does anyone know where these settings are stored?  <answer152782> Fixed:  This thread on the Apple forums is the key:  ul liOpen the Library folder in your Home folder./li liIn the Library folder, open the Application Support folder./li liLocate the folder named NotificationCenter. Drag this folder to the desktop./li liNext, open the Terminal application and enter the following/li /ul  .  precodecd `getconf DARWIN_USER_DIR` rm -rf com.apple.notificationcenter  killall usernoted; killall NotificationCenter /code/pre  ul liRestart your computer./li /ul  The issue is clearly to do with the NotificationCenter database. There are 3 files:  ul lidb/li lidb-shm/li lidb.wal/li /ul  In my case codedb.wal/code was a 0 byte file compared with 1.9MB on a correctly working Yosemite install. Permissions were correctly set, but looks as if Yosemite wasn't writing to it. Only deleting codedb.wal/code didn't fix the problem - another 0 byte file was created on restart. Deleting everything works though!  <comment178609> I am having the same issues. Unfortunately, my developer account has expired and I'm not re-upping for probably another month (we are switching over to a business account). This was something I was going to send in on the dev bug reporter. I've also tried everything including an SMC reset. Still no luck. I noticed it because I disable notifications for gfxCardStatus. Now every time my MBPr 15" switches between the integrated and discrete graphics, the banner pops up every time. I went from Mavericks to Yosemite, so it wasn't something to do with going from Mtn Lion to Yosemite. Like you, I can <comment178632> Same here. As a temporary measure I've disconnected a lot of accounts that generate messages. Too distracting. Will try http://www.tekrevue.com/tip/how-to-completely-disable-notification-center-in-mac-os-x/ if i get desperate. <comment179176> I'm having exactly the same problem with the notification center not retaining my settings. Like anu, I've tried repairing permissions and removing `~/Library/Application Support/NotificationCenter` and `~/Preferences/com.apple.notificationcenter.plist`, but nothing has worked. I need to get rid of those %&*! Facebook notifications!!! <comment180004> I'm having this same issue and submitted an Apple Bug report (18762327) for it. <comment180005> Thanks for including the radar. It sure looks like a bug to me as well. <comment181008> Note: In the forum it is pointed out, that you have to restart the computer 2 times to make the changes work. <comment181012> You really only need to reboot once. The second reboot really just proves that the fix works. <comment181130> This was super annoying. Your fix worked for me. Thanks anu!
