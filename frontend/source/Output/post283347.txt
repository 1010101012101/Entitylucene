Managing and sharing photos <body> My wife is a prolific picture-taker, both on her iPhone 6 and her Nikon. As a result, both her 64Gig iPhone and 240Gig Mac Air are completely filled to the brim (the later has all sorts of others stuff too). As her devices are often running out of storage room, she sometimes uses my iPhone to take shots.  iCloud Photo Sharing would seem to be a solution, but... Unless I am reading the instructions wrong, it seems you have a 5000 photo limit, and also have to individually upload images to a shared folder using the sharing buttons? I'm looking for something that's emcompletely/em automatic, and can hold at least 10k photos.  An external drive is another solution, but again, this takes away the automation side of things. Or is there a way to get iPhoto to see a second source of images if it is present and simply not show them if it's not?  My monthly budget is zero. My one-off budget is $100.  <answer283350> h2Solution/h2  You can use Apple iCloud's "My Photo Stream" to hold more than 10,000 photos.  You can easily continue to use iPhoto/Aperture/Photos.app so there's no need to learn any new app or to migrate data.  h2Upgrade Storage/h2  The only limit is the total size of your photos and the storage you are paying for. 5 GB are free with every iCloud account.  See iCloud storage plans and pricing for more information on the pricing in your country.  h2Details/h2  My Photo Stream does not limit the number of photos that you can upload. Keep in mind that Apple has a soft limit on how many photos you may upload per day:     h2My Photo Stream upload limits/h2      The My Photo Stream limits below are based on anticipated upload   patterns. These are the My Photo Stream upload limits:      ul   liUploads to My Photo Stream per hour: 1000 photos/li   liUploads to My Photo Stream per day: 10,000 photos/li   liUploads to My Photo Stream per month: 25,000 photos/li   /ul      If   you exceed one of these limits, your uploads to My Photo Stream will   pause temporarily, and you might see a notification on your device.   Your uploads will resume automatically when you no longer exceed the   limit, such as in the following hour or on the following day.

Moreover, it is possible to move the existing photo library to an external drive, maintaining space, and an alias may be created in the original location with the same name to preserve the library files.     h1Google Photos/h1      h3Limitations of Service:/h3      ul   liUnlimited free storage./li   liPhotos are compressed to save space.

If a Plex Pass is bought for $159.99 CAD, it will organize faces, objects, and places based on geolocation, The Application also has extensive video support, Apple TV, iOS , Roku, and Android apps are included. Camera Roll upload can be enabled by device, and an external hard drive is recommended.      See This Page for more   <comment357228> Unfortunately 5 GB is simply not enough, and to get enough storage is $12.99/Mo CAD. That is FAR too much to consider. <comment357230> Thank you for your comment. I could not find a maximum amount you are willing to spend in your question. <comment357236> "Moreover, it is possible to move the existing photo library to an external drive, ... and an alias may be created in the original location with the same name to preserve the library files." I am confused as to what this means - is this a Google photo library, or the iPhoto one? <comment357237> You can move over the existing iPhoto Library to an external drive, just create an alias when it is in the new location, move the alias back to the Pictures folder with the same name as the original photos library. It must be exactly the same, otherwise the indexes will not be valid. <comment357238> Note: I just use the 16 MP Google Photos storage, it automatically categorizes it, and files the metadata correctly. The facial recognition is definitely a plus. Google Photos also supports RAW, and will automatically process it. All data is converted to JPG, and RAW support is only availible with the Desktop Uploader.
