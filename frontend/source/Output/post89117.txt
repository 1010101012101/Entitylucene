What file permissions do I need to change after 10.8.3 restore? <body> My 08 mb, OSX Mt Lion, crashed so I bought new 2012 MBPr. Luckily, I backed everything up.  Migrated everything from 08mb over to new MBPr.  I noticed that when I deleted files, it skipped the trash can.  My home folder did not have me as admin with RW permissions so I had to add myself and give myself RW access.    Before, when I opened iTerm (similar to Terminal), it would say codecomputer name:~ username$/code. Now, I see an odd hexadecimal name for my computer.     How do I change the hexadecimal code to my computer name?    img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rbeHm.jpg" alt="2012 MBPr after migration assistant"  Is this the correct default permissions for Home folder?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/UKc0J.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Thanks.  <answer91062> Turns out that my issue was resolved here: OS X computer name not matching what shows on terminal  ol licodesudo scutil --set ComputerName "newname"/code/li licodesudo scutil --set LocalHostName "newname"/code/li licodesudo scutil --set HostName "newname"/code/li liFlush the DNS cache by typing: codedscacheutil -flushcache/code/li liRestart your Mac./li /ol  <answer91100> The home folder is supposed to be owned by the user:  precode$ ls -l /Users/ total 0 drwxrwxrwt   6 root   wheel   204 Apr 13 23:28 Shared drwxr-xr-x@ 53 lauri  staff  1802 May 11 18:00 lauri /code/pre  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/OzLR4.png" alt=""  If there are further issues, you could try running codesudo chown $USER ~/code or resetting home folder permissions and ACLs from the recovery partition.  <answer91115> I ran into a similar problem. It sorted itself out after I rebooted the machine and also my wireless router--so I can't obviously know which of the two actually fixed the problem. BUT, this does suggest to me steps (4) and (5) of your solution might be sufficient to solve the problem if you've already named the computer in System Preferences.  <comment104514> Have you repaired Permissions already? <comment104517> If you go the "sharing" preference pane, it allows you to set a name to your computer. Have you tried that and checking in iTerm? <comment104594> I have repaired permissions. Just changed name of computer in "Sharing" to something else and it still shows that weird `unknown20c9d....` <comment107183> Thanks for the link!  Very helpful.  It hung up on resetting so I had to quit it after a few hours.  Still worked though.
