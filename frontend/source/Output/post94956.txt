The folder Library/StartUpItems is empty <body> Under strongSystem Preferences / Users &amp; Groups / Login Items/strong I can see all of the items that I've selected to launch at startup, but the folder,  codeLibrary/StartUpItems/code is empty.  Where can I see these items?  <answer94967> The file the preference pane loads the list of items from is:  code~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginitems.plist/code  It is a binary file. You can use Xcode to open it.  For example, if you add iPhoto to your login items:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/z8jw1.png" alt="enter image description here"  your codecom.apple.loginitems.plist/code will look similar to this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jySxg.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <comment111344> What do you mean by *these items*? You mean the original file? <comment111348> @Thecafremo Perhaps he means the source configuration data? i.e. where does the pref pane load the list of items from? <comment111351> Yes, It is my problem. I want get by the Terminal the name of the apps that are launched when i start the mac <comment343208> I still have several apps that are being opened automatically on osx startup and are neither on this panel nor on `/Library/StartUpItems` and I can't help to find them
