Remove Linux partition on Mac. CoreStorage problems <body> I have a Macbook pro 2015 with a 256 GB SSD and a Linux partition. I would like to remove the partition. Following the steps written in here, I got stuck in the Modify step. Once I execute the command codegpt add -b 409649 .../code and than I do the diskutil list command, it does not appear any disk with the size 60 GB.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nzJTJ.jpg" alt="output of terminal 1:"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/O9wW6.jpg" alt="gpt -r show disk0:"  Does any one know how to solve my problem?  <answer281990> By accident the OP took one command in the answer Remove Ubuntu and grow Mac partition literally and entered:  precodegpt add -b 409640 -i 2 -s 118430560 -t 53746F72-6167-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC /dev/disk0 /code/pre  to add a partition table entry, though his original macOS volume was much larger. The command above creates a ~60 GB CoreStorage partition right after the EFI partition. No output of the previous partition table was available code(sudo) gpt -r show diskX/code.  To recreate the partition table an external volume with a full macOS install, wxHexEditor and some knowledge about the typical sizes and internal structures of macOS recovery volumes is necessary.  ul liInstall macOS to a thumb drive and configure it./li liDownload and install wxHexEditor/li liSearch for the typical start blocks of the Recovery HD like in this answer./li liRecreate the Recovery HD with codegpt add -i 3 .../code/li liRecreate the main macOS volume between EFI and Recovery HD partition codegpt add -i 2 .../code/li liVerify the disk and the volumes with codediskutil verify[Disk|Volume] diskYsX/code/li liExpand the recovered main volume/li /ul  <comment354964> Yes!!!
