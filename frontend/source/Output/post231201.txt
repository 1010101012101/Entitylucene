Switching between three monitors <body> I have two Apple monitors with active connections and a 13" Cintiq. I know I can't have all three monitors on at the same time, but I was wondering if there was a program that I could detect all three monitors, name them (left, right, cintiq) and then let me switch one off and the other on without having to unplug anything.  If anyone knows a good application to handle this I would very much appreciate it.
