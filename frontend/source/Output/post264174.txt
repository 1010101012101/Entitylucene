Apache localhost doesn't work: Safari can't connect to the server localhost <body> I have upgraded to El Capitan a few months ago. I have followed a few guides to install and setup AMP: Get Apache, MySQL, PHP and phpMyAdmin working on OSX 10.11 El Capitan  But I can't access my /Sites folder, because I can't connect to "localhost".   ol lilocalhost (I actually tried with "localhost" typed in the address bar, and with my machine's address 192.etc) doesn't display "It works" message, instead I see this:   precodeYour website.  Create and publish your own website quickly and easily using iWeb, Pages, and many other applications available for Mac OS X. /code/pre  and a few other sentences./li lineither codelocalhost/~username/code   (username = my name), nor codelocalhost/username/code work - Safari displays a message that it can't connect to the localhost. /li liand of course I can't reach my Sites folder, because two previous steps don't work.   precodehttpd -v Server version: Apache/2.4.18 (Unix) Server built:   Feb 20 2016 20:03:19 /code/pre/li /ol  Apache configtest is successful:  precodeapachectl configtest Syntax OK /code/pre  I have seen these discussions/pages:  ul liEl Capitan Safari Can&#39;t open localhost/li lihttp://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/34060/discussion-between-fred-j-and-max-ried/li liSetting up a local web server on OS X/li liHow to install MySQL on Mac OS X El Capitan/li /ul  but I am not sure if this is applicable to my situation.   Aslo, what's surprising, given the situation with apache, is that I can access phpmyadmin and mysql tables.   I will be grateful for your help!  <comment331022> I wasn't allowed to post other links I used due to lack of points, so I add them here https://discussions.apple.com/docs/DOC-3083 http://wpguru.co.uk/2015/11/how-to-install-mysql-on-mac-os-x-el-capitan/ and others. <comment331024> @klanomath, Thank you very much. Sorry, but how did you do that? I mean adding links, etc? <comment331026> After gaining another 5 [reputation points](http://apple.stackexchange.com/help/privileges) (now 6, then 11) your are allowed to add as many links as you want/need in your contribution.

What's happening is that [per user directories](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/howto/public_html.html) are not enabled and this must be done in `httpd.conf` <comment331069> @klanomath Thank you very much. <comment331071> @Allan Thank you very much; I will read this to see what I have missed, though it seems I have uncommented all necessary items in httpd.conf - I have checked it numerous times. But I have to study the page you suggested. <comment331105> @Allan unfortunately this tutorial was not helpful. (1) I have checked the Include part many time, and it is uncommented in httpd.conf;  (2) I checked again the information presented in tutorials I have mentioned; but I still can't access Sites folder and get the message: `The requested URL /~username/Sites was not found on this server`, though today I don't get the message zSafari can't load a page` when I try to load my `localhost/~username`.  It used to work though, a few months ago. I do need help on this issue. I am just learning, so the all is still difficult for me.
