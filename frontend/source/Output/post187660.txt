Wireless Keyboard Volume Down acting different <body> Just for my curiosity and knowledge, on my mac wireless keyboard, has been a couple of days that every time I click on the Volume Down (F10) key, instead of rising down the volume it will move the application.    I made a small video so you can have an idea.  How can I change to default factory?   <answer187677> Most likely a change was made to the kbdFn/kbd key setting. The behavior you are seeing is "Show Desktop", but generally requires pressing kbdFn/kbd-kbdF11/kbd to activate. (Note on my keyboard Volume Down is F11. It may differ on yours, but the steps below don't chnage.)  To change this behavior:  ol liOpen System Preferences./li liIn the second section, click on Keyboard, then on the Keyboard tab if necessary./li liUncheck "Use all F1, F2, etc. keys as standard function keys."/li /ol  <comment221884> Go to expose and spaces in System Preferences. Then change the key from F10 to something else. <comment222133> Tubedogg you just fixed my issue. Thank you
