Ghost folders in /Volumes <body> I've had a problem today where when I plug my external HDD in, it creates a ghost folder in code/Volumes/code with the same name, causing my hard drive to change it's path to code/Volumes/HDD 1/code. This is messing with programs that direct to code/Volumes/HDD/code. Is there someway to fix this? Also, my harddrive has an issue where even a small bump can cause it to give the error of it not being removed properly, so this could potentially be the cause of it.   Thanks for the help.  <answer189811> Yes - premature ejection can cause these ghosts.   You would need to script a cleanup that uses codedf/code and codediskutil list/code and codels /Volumes/code to remove the ghost entries.   I typically do this by hand as it happens very infrequently to me.   <comment225147> Are you sure the folder isn't there before you plug in the drive? <comment225149> It's there before, during and after. If I delete it then it just creates a new one when I net plug the drive in <comment225396> How would I go about this? And would this then allow my HDD to mount at the location `/Volumes/HDD`? <comment225420> @AdamBreguet Best to start a new question. Do you know any scripting language? If not - coursera, lynda to get started. If so, you can break down these tools and ask what they do. You could even run one and post the output as a question and ask how to understand it. It will be hard to do a tutorial in the comments. <comment262667> How exactly do you use those commands to get rid of the ghost?  It seems like each of them can help me see the ghost, but I can't see the right way to get rid of it. <comment262670> And in fact, the ghost does not show up in diskutil list or df.  Only in ls /Volumes
