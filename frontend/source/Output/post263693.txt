Office 2016 on Mac - PowerPoint found a problem with content in the file <body> We're in a mixed Mac OS and Windows environment and our MAC users are unable to access/open PowerPoint files on MS Azure's file server. This started happening a few days ago and it's becoming a regular occurrence.  The error messages are:  *PowerPoint cannot open the file. The file may be damaged, or it may have been created in a pre-release version of PowerPoint.  *PowerPoint found a problem with content in the file. PowerPoint can attempt to repair the file. If you trust the source of this file, click repair.  Clicking repair does not solve the issue.  The users are on Yosemite and El Capitan, running office 2016 on their macs.  Any idea why this is happening?  Thanks
