Can you power on a MacBook with a wireless keyboard? <body> Is it possible to power on a MacBook using a wireless keyboard? If that sounds strange, I'm asking because I use a Bose radio as the sound system and the radio fits nicely on top of the laptop.  <answer39866> No, you cannot power on a laptop (or desktop, for that matter) from a wireless keyboard (or a wired USB keyboard).   You emcan/em, however, wake the computer from sleep with a wireless keyboard.
