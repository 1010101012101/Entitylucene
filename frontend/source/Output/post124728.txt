Apple script to lock computer using knock <body> There is a great app called knock which lets you unlock your mac by tapping on your phone twice while in proximity.   http://www.knocktounlock.com  Unfortunately in order for the app on your phone to unlock your mac, you must have locked your computer using emtheir/em lock utility.  The 3 ways I normally lock my computer do not seem to work with the app.br - Alfredbr - control + shift + ejectbr - Waiting for screen saver    Their utility must be interfaced with a mouse and can not be triggered from the keyboard as far as I can tell.   How could you write a script (applescript?) that would lock the computer using their interface?    knock to unlock interface  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/trick.png" alt="enter image description here"  Alfred lock interface img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KRMu3.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer124736> I sent a question to the support personel at knock, and they informed me that a script has already been written.
