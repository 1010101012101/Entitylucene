How can I correct mirror image webcam image for both myself and my viewer? <body> My webcam on my mac (Logitech C920 camera, Mac Pro 2010, Mountain Lion) shows a reversed image -- as if looking in a mirror.  I want to use this to image writing to my friend.  (I'm coaching him in math, and it's a lot faster to write math than set it.)  How can I correct the image so that both my preview and his view show up properly.
