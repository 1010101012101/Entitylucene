Being new to Apple I have no idea.  Free would be good too.  Many thanks.  <answer173780> Just get GIMP! It's LGPLv3+ und GPLv3+ licensed.     GIMP is a multi-platform photo manipulation tool. GIMP is an acronym for GNU Image Manipulation Program. The GIMP is suitable for a variety of image manipulation tasks, including photo retouching, image composition, and image construction.      GIMP has many capabilities. It can be used as a simple paint program, an expert quality photo retouching program, an online batch processing system, a mass production image renderer, an image format converter, etc.      GIMP is expandable and extensible. It is designed to be augmented with plug-ins and extensions to do just about anything. The advanced scripting interface allows everything from the simplest task to the most complex image manipulation procedures to be easily scripted.   <comment204472> by Make? you mean what? <comment204473> Sorry yea, by make I intend, produce. <comment204474> Gimp has a reputation for not being user-friendly, but I haven't had any trouble with it personally. <comment204475> this tutorial might help http://www.gimp.org/tutorials/Creating_Icons/ <comment204643> @ klanomath Thankyou for the info...I will give it a try.
