Can't open old Pages files <body> I have older Pages files I need to open. I am running Mavericks and get the "This file is too old..." error that tells me to save the file with Pages 09. So I reinstalled Pages 09' at it won't even open without updates and the AppStore says there are no updates. My 09' instal is in the applications/iWork folder. How can I get these files open?  <answer176411> I've posted a solution for all three iWork programs at this Ask Different question: New version of Keynote won&#39;t open old versions .
