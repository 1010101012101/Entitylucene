Change colors of various items in iterm2, without using tput <body> Alright, so I already asked a related question here, and the solution used codetput/code which worked, emuntil/em I realized that it was screwing up how command-line folding was happening. (Long commands were not starting on a new line, and were folding over the current line).   So I guess I am back to square one. So my question is: How, via iterm2, (or any other method), can I specify colors of my files, directories, conda environments, and git branches?  Thanks.   <comment355650> Does this help? http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/053 (Your previous q doesn't seem to be prompt-related, so I'm not convinced, but I'm not sure I understand how LSCOLORS or `grc` would affect "folding over") <comment355655> @JohnN After some googling on why command line commands fold over, the accepted answer was "tput does that so dont use it". I cant find it now I already closed the tab.  <comment355656> Could you post a screenshot of what you're seeing? I'm maybe being a little slow (long weekend!) but I'm not sure I understand what you mean by "folding over"... <comment355657> @JohnN I already "fixed" the issue by removing `tput`, (so no colors now hence the question :-P ), but basically what was happening was this: Imagine you are normally typing on the command line a long command. Normally, the commands as you type them will simply continue on the *next* line. In this case however, they would simply continue on the *same* line, visually overwriting what was already typed. Does that make sense?... <comment355658> Hmmm, interesting - this isn't something I've seen with `tput`. Could you give steps so I could replicate it? Something like... "set LSCOLORS to ..., run `ls ~`, then run `a_very_long_command`". I realise this isn't answering your q, and might be better off in chat, but I feel there's maybe something easier and fixable than deprecating `tput`! <comment355661> @JohnN Ok I will try to do so.
