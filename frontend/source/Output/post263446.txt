Google AMP of iOS Chromes wastes quarter of screen <body> Google AMP results show on mobile search results, leading to pages like the following on iOS Chrome:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pbXsi.png" alt="enter image description here"  This wastes about a quarter of my phone's screen compared to normal results, e.g.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/iLAaK.png" alt="enter image description here"  On non-AMP pages, the address bar of Chrome for iOS normally hides as you scoll down, but not with AMP.  Is there a way to disable AMP, get the address bar and AMP banner to hide, or easily get to the original page from an AMP page?  <answer263447> You can easily hide that AMP banner by loading the regular page instead of the AMP page. To do that, hit the three dots in the top-right and choose codeRequest Desktop Site/code. This works in the iOS and Android versions of Chrome.

It is annoying.  I also don't think @owlswipe answer is "unquestionably the right answer" because requesting the desktop page gets the desktop page, not the mobile page.  I think I'll go send Chrome feedback on this issue. <comment330064> Google forum: https://productforums.google.com/forum/m/#!category-topic/chrome/report-a-problem-and-get-troubleshooting-help/ios/im-not-sure/07wMebDNwk4
