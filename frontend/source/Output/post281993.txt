Plugin for the printing subsystem? <body> I want to be able to afferent how everything I print is outputted.  Specifically I want to always include the   ol lipage number / out of count/li liCurrent date/li /ol  Ultimately I would be happy to be able to for ex. affect the printing layouter to be able to print 2 pages scaled to 50% in on single A4 page and co..   Is there such a tool for Mac that can allow me to do any of the above?  I'm using an HP printer, and the driver itself (at least the one downloaded by Apple doesn't support any of this so I'd assume that if it can be done it would be done on the subsystem or some fake printer install).
