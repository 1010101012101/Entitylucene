Logitech Device Manager - Button to navigate between screens in mission control <body> I recently acquired a Logitech MX Performance mouse that has tons of buttons.  I really like the Mission Control button but I was hoping to be able to swap between screens in mission control with one of the buttons.  I've setup (in the Logitech configuration program) what I thought would work for me.   I made a specific profile for Mission Control and I mapped both the tilt wheel and the front/back buttons to CTRL+Arrow which I believe is the correct keyboard setting to do the screen changes.  This did not work.    Anything else i should try (including other software programs)?  Thanks!!
