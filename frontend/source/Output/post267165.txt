Why is codedevfs/code 100% capacity?  <answer267183> devfs is a special filesystem containing a representation of physical devices.  The implementation of devfs doesn't maintain file system statistics, like space available (because you can't store anything on devfs), but because devfs is visible as a part of the filesystem hierarchy, it must report those values to the regular tools asking for them. In effect the tools will show the file system space and inode usage as 100%.  hr  Likewise codemap -hosts/code and codemap auto_home/code are not real file systems, but mountpoints for autofs - a component which automatically mounts external devices and network shares. See codeman automount/code and codeman automountd/code.
