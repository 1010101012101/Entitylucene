To hide unused rows in Excel <body> How do I hide all unused rows in Excel? I hate that if I scroll to fast I do not stop at the end of the data. I am running Excel 15.  Here is an example. I want every row after code263/code hidden so when I scroll down the data scrolling stops at code263/code. I also want every column after codeE/code hidden.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/icExZ.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer242277> strongemTaken from this article on TekReview/em/strong  Make sure to leave room for expansion, if necessary.   ul liSelect the first column to the right of your data. Now we need to select all columns from this starting point to the end of the spreadsheet. Because Excel gives users spreadsheets with tens of thousands of rows and columns, we’ll use keyboard shortcuts to quickly jump to the end./li liWith the rightmost empty column selected, press and hold the codeShift/code key and then press codeCommand + Right Arrow/code. This will jump you to the end of the spreadsheet while the codeShift/code key automatically selects every cell in between./li liNow we have to tell Excel to hide these cells. With your cells still selected, go to Excel’s strongMenu Bar/strong and choose codeFormat &gt; Column &gt; Hide/code. You’ll now see all the cells to the right of your data disappear./li liNext, we need to deal with the cells below your data. Similar to the steps above, this time select the first row beneath your data. With the bottommost cell selected, press and hold codeShift/code and then press codeCommand + Down Arrow/code. This will jump you to the very bottom of the spreadsheet and select all the rows in between./li liFinally, head back up to Excel’s strongMenu Bar/strong and choose codeFormat &gt; Row &gt; Hide/code. You’re now left with a spreadsheet that features only cells containing your data, resulting in a much cleaner look./li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1AIhR.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  If you need to expand your table, or simply don’t like the new look, you can easily unhide the cells. First, click the top-left heading cell that looks like a white arrow pointing to the bottom-right corner. Clicking this cell will select all cells in your spreadsheet, both hidden and not. Once selected, go to Excel’s strongMenu Bar/strong and choose both codeFormat &gt; Column &gt; Unhide/code and codeFormat &gt; Row &gt; Unhide/code. Your spreadsheet will now be restored to the default look.
