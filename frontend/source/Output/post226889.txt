How to restore backups manually from Time Machine? <body> I bought a new mac a few days ago. Before my new mac I had also an mac. I back upped everyday using TimeMachine. I did a clean install, so I can start blank. Now I want to restore some files back to the new mac. Is there a way to get the Time Machine interface so I can travel through my old back ups using TM on my new mac?  Thank you in advance.  <answer226892> To restore the latest backup, connect the drive used for Time Machine to the new Mac and run code/Applications/Utilities/Migration Assistant.app/code. There is also a support document from Apple covering this (but it reads some reading between the lines because it covers several use cases as once).  To access the backup as a whole, see this answer.  <comment275513> Do you want to access a) the latest TM backup of the old Mac to restore your files, b) a previous version to restore from or c) have access to the whole history again? There are different solutions depending on what your needs are. <comment275514> My apologize, if it is possible to have access to the whole history it would be nice, otherwise the latest backup is fine. <comment275518> Thank you for the answer. I tried the last option to get access to the whole backup. I access the TM interface after holding alt + click. I will see all dates at the right side, but there is now way to click on a date or travel back in time. What does I do wrong? <comment275519> I can't verify this here. @grgarside, any idea? <comment275521> I can only travel through "Programs", the tab "Documents" etc I can't access.. <comment275522> I just got the method to get access to my previous backups. My Mac User name is different from my last one, so he can't find older backups from my new mac name, that's right. So I retrieve the level inside finder so I see the user and from there I can access my older backups. Thanks for the time and answers!
