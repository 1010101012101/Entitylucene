Files missing after doing disk repair <body> I have an NTFS external disk,  And I followed a stupid tutorial, it told me to repair my disk then I can delete the 'un-deletable' files in the NTFS external disk.  However, When I done the repair-disk, the files on the disk were missing.  But it seems all the files are still existing on the disk,  But couldn't be seen on OSX and Windows 7 (I used the parallel to inspect the disk)  How could I recovery the data on the disk, thanks T_T  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/cbvE2.png" alt="enter image description here" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8TRB4.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer142641> I experienced this exact problem yesterday. I fixed it by putting the ntfs drive onto a PC and searching for the files. They had all just been moved, not deleted--very strange. Also, running a disk error check in windows after to clean up any straggling issues.
