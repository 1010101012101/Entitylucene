Revert terminal to default state with bash without affecting iterm on oh-my-zsh <body> I am using oh-my-zsh on iterm while I would like terminal.app to be using bash.  I did see a previous thread, but when I ran codechsh -s /bin/bash/code, I got:  code-chsh: illegal option -- c/code  codeusage: chpass [-l location] [-u authname] [-s shell] [user]/code  <comment350630> Are you sure you run `chsh -s`? What does `type chsh` return? <comment350679> I tried running `chsh -s /bin/bash` again and it worked. I just updated and restarted my laptop. I guess it was a weird error. Thank you @patrix
