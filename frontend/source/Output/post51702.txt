iTunes notifications <body> I'd like to have a notification displayed in the dock every time a new song is played. Unfortunately, this doesn't exist as an option in the program preferences, but there are ways to do it, see this article for example.  However, for some reason this doesn't work for me. Can you guess why? I'm using a MacBook Pro with iTunes 10.6.1 running on Mac OS X 10.6.8.  <answer51738> This tweak is for OSX 10.7 only.  For something equivalent in OSX 10.6, you might want to give a try with 3rd party notifiers. The ones that come in mind right now are:  ul liGrowl (my personal favorite)/li liSizzling Keys/li /ul  There surely are more notification apps out there, Google is your friend!  <comment59078> I think this is because your link is a tip for Mac OS Lion (10.7) and you're using Snow Leopard (10.6).
