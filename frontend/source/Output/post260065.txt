Why are my displays not showing up in ColorSync? How can I restore them? <body> I recently purchased a new colorimiter — a Datacolor Spyder5Pro — with which to calibrate my displays, since my old Spyder3 had suffered a catastrophic failure. Calibration went fine, but when I came to save the profiles I got error messages about not being able to associate the profiles with the displays.  Digging a bit deeper, firing up ColorSync Utility, I discovered that there are no displays listed under the Displays node in the Devices tab.   This is happening on both my 2013 iMac and my 2014 MBPR, which I upgraded to Sierra around the same time. Interestingly, on an MBA that's also running Sierra, the display shows up in ColorSync — and lo and behold I'm able to calibrate it without issue.  Why are my displays not showing up? What can I do to get them back? I'm in the process of reinstalling macOs on the iMac just to see what happens, but I'd rather not to have to go through that rigmarole with both machines if it can be helped.
