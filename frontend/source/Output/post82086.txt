iphone 4S 6.0.1 has poor wifi reception upstairs <body> I've had an iphone 4S running 6.0.1 for just about a month. I find that it has trouble connecting to wifi when I'm in my room upstairs.  It connects fine downstairs (which is where the combo. router/modem resides.) I tried a Macbook to test the connection in my room and it had a very strong wifi connection. What can I do?  The wifi seems to work well in other situations, including at work, which is in a hospital, so I'm sure I'm not near a modem/router.  <answer82311> WiFi networks require two-way communication.  Even though your emrouter/em may have enough strength to send a signal to that room, whatever wireless client emdevice/em you want to use in that room strongalso/strong has to have enough strength to send a signal emback/em to the router.  Evidently, the Macbook you tested in the room had enough strength to send a decent signal back to the router.  Yet, the iPhone did not.  Signal effectiveness is a combination of a number of variables, two being antenna configuration, and power.  Your iPhone's WiFi antenna and/or power are inferior to the computer's.  What you could do is either strongmove the wireless router closer to (or into) the room/strong, or else strongset up another access point to extend your network's wireless reach/strong.  To get a new access point talking to your existing network's router, you'll need to consider using wireless-to-wireless repeating, power line network adapters, or an Ethernet cable &ndash; Ethernet being the best option, if you can somehow run a cable from point A to point B.  <comment94661> I have found iPhone to have less signal reception strength then a Macbook. Perhaps you could get a signal booster. <comment103414> perhaps it is a software problem, this is the case with my iphone 4s. upgarde
