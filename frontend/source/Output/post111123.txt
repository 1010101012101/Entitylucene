How to create linux USB discs that do work on Apple Macs? <body> It seems that there are several problems releated to incompatibilities between  Apple-EFI and UEFI that do prevent Apple users from easily using USB drives to install or even run other operating systems.  I am planning to make this a quick guide, so others will not loose precious time encountering the same problems as me.  It seems that the latest ISO of Ubuntu that has the UEFI removed in order to be able to boot on Macs is 12.04.3  What I did so far:  ul liTryed YUMI with mac blend of the ISO and it produces a disc that is recognized by rEFInd but that gives "Missing Operating System" when trying to load it../li liunetbootin tool works on OS X, Linux or Windows BUT it will not create USB disks that will work on Macs./li liTried penguintosh.com with both Ubuntu ISOs and none of them works, it does run and creates the USB disc but it's not recognized by Mac EFI or rEFInd./li /ul  So, stronghow can I create an USB disk that will install Ubuntu on Mac, preferably latest version Ubuntu./strong   Note: Assume that I do not want to keep anything on the Mac, the USB has to be bootable and any use of DVD drive is excluded.  <comment130787> The steps are detailed on ubuntu's site - http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/create-a-usb-stick-on-mac-osx - what step isn't working for you? What error message do you see? (Basically what problem are you looking to solve...) if you are just asking a jeopardy question - flag this for reopening once you have that ready to post... <comment130789> @SorinSbarnea See my answer to this question also http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/86287/installing-ubuntu-12-04-lts-on-mountain-lion/92540#92540 <comment130804> @mike I updated the question, it seems that all documented ways to do this are not working. That's kinda strange as I do remember being able to do this, still this Mac Mini from 2010 doesn't want to be converted to Ubuntu.
