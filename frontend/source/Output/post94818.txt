Why do I keep having to reenter the SIM code after each iOS update? <body> With my iPhone 5, I've been finding that I keep having to unlock the SIM code every time I update the iOS from one minor release to the next. While this isn't a problem, as I've memorized the code, it is rather annoying.  Is there any way to change this behavior, so that I don't have to keep worrying about this?  <answer94822> Is this a 'SIM PIN'?  If so, go to settings - phone - SIM PIN and turn it to off.  <comment111171> It is just the way it is :) the Update automatically locks the SIM, since that is the "normal" condition. Just imagine what would happen if updates would unlock the SIM without asking you!
