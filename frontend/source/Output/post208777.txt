How to edit many lines at once in TextMate? <body> I am testing my first Chromebook and its Caret editor.  I would like to have the feature called "editing many lines at once" by holding CMD and clicking appropriate lines, like in sublime but much faster, here thread about it.  How can you have Sublime-like editing of many lines at once in TextMate?  <answer208794> You've answered your own question; to edit multiple lines at once in TextMate, you Command-click the places you want to edit. Is that not working for you for some reason?  <comment251814> Thank you for your answer! I have a faulty installation of OSX which is a reason of this. I will try this again after I get my OSX from Apple care.
