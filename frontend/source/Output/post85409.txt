Can't register Line app on MacBook <body> According to the instructions on the website I should be able to got to the Line menu, click on Settings, and the register my email address. Massive problem: Settings is grayed out, non-functional, and masses of searching the internet seem to indicated that no one else is having this problem. Does anyone have an answer? (it will help you to know that I do not yet have a compatible smart phone...)  <answer85411> I'm afraid that you won't be able to use it, as for using the emComputer Version/em you need to have previously registered your email on the emsmartphone version/em. This is stated on the login screen of the Computer Version.  As a side note, strongSettings/strong is grayed out because you have no account to configure.   <comment98435> Ok, so you mean that the settings option won't show up until I log in - which requires an account. <comment98440> @user122527 Precisely. <comment109649> Which line app are you trying to register? I saw several when searching to see if this is a unique name for an OS X app. <comment109690> is it a must to register from a smart phone?
