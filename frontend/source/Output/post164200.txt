why does my ipad not sort series properly <body> I have several tv series on my ipad mini running ios 7.1.2 and itunes is on windows 8, now my ipad has started to sort the seasons so that a few episodes are under 1 season tab and the rest of the season is under another which is very annoying as for example it shows me having 2 tabs for the 1st season of something. I have tried using itunes to change it but cant see how too and I deleted and re-downloaded all the series I'm having problems with but nothing has worked, please help me sort this  <answer164212> Easiest way to edit meta data is via iTunes (on the computer):  ul liOpen "Information" Window for an episode/li liSet as TV Show/li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/N1Rfo.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  ul liSet Name, Season and Episode number /li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3B0qg.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Depending on the kind of video embefore/em switching to TV Show you may need to close and reopen the window before the third steps to have the fields appear.  <answer164217> iFlicks 2 is a great app to manage video files in iTunes: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/iflicks-2/id731062389?mt=12  <comment192423> meta-data is probably wrong. Try bulk-editing all the data except the individual episode title & resync. Did this stuff come from Apple or 'elsewhere'? Also, why still iOS 7? <comment192506> my itunes doesn't look like that or let me edit data :/ <comment192509> I've got it like that but there's nothing wrong with the meta data, everything is numbered and named correctly <comment192542> I've just updated and it hasn't fixed anything and everything was bought from itunes, all meta data is correct
