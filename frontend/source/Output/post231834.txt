MBP running El Capitan freezes at login <body> Since today, my mid 2011 15 in Macbook pro freezes after login on the admin account. The status bar doesn't even appear, nor the desktop icons. Nothing responds and I need to force shutdown to be able to reboot.  Those are the things I already tried : - rebooting in safe mode : desktop icons will appear, but everything freezes after a couple of seconds. I believe since safe mode doesn't work the problem is related with the Finder, DS_Store issue, icon issue, or an iCloud issue. So I went to the next step.  - running the disk utility First aid tool in the OSX recovery tools (reboot+Cmd+R) : It says the disk is OK.  - running /sbin/fsck -FY in single user mode : the disk seems to be OK.  I don't know what to try next. Since I really need my computer for the next days, I might go to an Apple store later this week. I would of course be really happy to avoid the costs of that option.   Does any of you have an idea of what I should try next?   strongUPDATE/strong  As Allan suggested, the problem was my drive beginning to fail. I changed it to a ssd and everything went back to normal.   <answer231841> I suspect that your drive is failing.  Run AHT (Apple Hardware Test)  Basically, power off your MBP, disconnect all of your peripherals with the exception of your mouse and keyboard (if you have them attached), boot your MBP while holding down the kbdAlt/kbdkbdD/kbd keys.  Be sure to check the box that says "Perform Extended Testing"  The utility will take the MBP through a battery of tests.  If there are any failures, it will list them for you.  If you have a hardware issue, this should let you know.  From there, we can proceed.  <answer231872> On Apple Support Communities I got a helpful answer I will copy here for others. I don't exactly understand what it does exactly.     Log in as Guest.       This procedure will delete certain temporary and   cache files. The files are automatically generated and don't contain   any of your data. Occasionally they can become corrupt and cause   problems such as yours.       Please back up all data.       Triple-click anywhere in the line below on this page to select it:       code/var/folders/code      Right-click or control-click the highlighted line and select codeServices ▹ Open/code from the contextual menu.*       A folder with the odd name "folders" should open. Inside "folders" are several subfolders, each with a two-character name. Drag all the subfolders   except the one named "zz" to the Trash. strongDon't delete the subfolder   named "zz"./strong You'll be prompted for your administrator login   credentials. Restart the computer and empty the Trash.      * If you don't see the contextual menu item, copy the selected text to the Clipboard by pressing the key combination codeCmd-C/code. In the   Finder, select             codeGo ▹ Go to Folder.../code from the menu bar and paste into the box that opens by pressing command-V. You may not see what you pasted   because a line break is included. Press return.   I have to mention that for now, it solved my primary issue. However, I'm experiencing some extraordinary slow speed on every app up to now. I guess that this might be caused by the missing temporary files that the system is rebuilding.  Hope this helps somebody!  <comment283186> For some reason, AHT won't load. If I reboot while holding the D key, it simply boots normally to the login screen. Any ideas how to make it work? <comment283191> If your MBP came with 10.7 (which it may have) then AHT would be on Disk 2 of your Original Install DVDs.  Do you still have those? <comment283193> It came with 10.6. I lost the original disks long ago now. I'll try alt+D as soon as I have access to a power source. <comment283225> OK, I did the alt+D trick and I got a apple.com/support -3403D error back. <comment283296> There seems to be some charachters missing from that error code.  It should look something like:  `4SNS/1/1/4000000 TL0P-130` <comment283577> For the AHT error, I confirm it was -3403D and nothing more. Since the hard drive is now making a faint periodic rattling sound, I won't wait and I'll bring it to the Apple store. Especially since the Time Machine backup won't go further than the "preparing backup" state. <comment283578> It seems my suspicions were right.  If you aren't under Apple Care, I have written some posts on how to upgrade your MBP with an SSD: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/229372/my-mac-is-getting-really-slow-what-should-i-do/229377#229377  It's something that's quite easy to do. <comment283724> I just remembered that I have an old Bootcamp partition laying around so I booted on it and it works just fine. So it seems that the problem is definetely confined in the main accounts files or in the system, rather than being a global hard drive failure.
