"Apply Rules" to Sent Mail folder in OS X 10.9 Mavericks does not work <body> Any idea why in Mail 7.0 (part of OS X 10.9 Mavericks,) when I select a group of messages in the Sent Mail folder and do Message -- Apply Rules command, nothing happens?  (In prior versions of OS X back to 10.5, my extensive list of 70+ rules automatically moved messages from my Sent folder to various other sorted folders. I have several plain POP3 accounts set up in Mail.app, not leaving messages on the server.)  <answer107443> I'm not sure, but you may be able to get this functionality from Mail Act-On (now in beta for Mavericks).  http://www.indev.ca/MailActOn.html
