Good PostScript viewer for MacOS? <body> On OS X, is there a good application to open PS files without converting them to PDF?  In addition, I want to associate PS.GZ files to this application, but retain the TAR.GZ association to my uncompressor. Is this feasible?  <answer62989> There are several possibilities:  ul listrongPreview.app/strong (comes with OS X) will open any PS (PostScript) file. In the background, I assume, a conversion to PDF takes place, but this should not be an issue./li listrongAdobe Illustrator/strong can open strongand edit/strong PostScript files. Shelling out a rather big amount of money for just viewing a PS file seems overkill, though. However, there is a free 30-day-trial (link from January 2013 for CS6)./li listrongPostView/strong by Metaobject is said to support PostScript as well, but I personally am not convinced / could not get it to work./li /ul  My personal recommendation: Use Preview.app!  <answer275460> To answer your first question:  No need to download anything to open the *.ps file without converting just open your terminal.  codeopen -a textedit filename.ps/code  It will open a *.ps file like Ultraedit.  <comment71461> Hello! Regarding the opening: Have you tried to open the PS files directly with Preview.app? <comment71462> Also, would you consider splitting your question, which is actually two questions, into two articles? Your second question will gain visibility, and it will be easier for people to help you. <comment239970> Note that Preview cannot "open any PS file" -- it is limited to Postscript files that are structured in such a way that Preview can convert them to a PDF, and then it displays the PDF. That means that hand-coded PostScript may not be compatible, but the output of any commercial application should be.
