What causes the UserEventAgent to run with 100% CPU usage? <body> Since about a month, my MBPr sometimes starts up it’s fans and is getting really hot. The activity monitor tells me, that this is because of the UserEventAgent, which runs with 100% CPU usage.  This spike can last for about 10 to 30 minutes and then everything goes back to normal. There seems to be no reason behind it. There is no pattern, when it starts and nothing I can do, to stop it. The same pattern still applies when I don’t do anything and just wait. It still takes a serious amount of time, until UserEventAgent goes back to normal.  I also checked the log to find out, if there are any messages, that could give me a hint, but the messages differ every time. There is no message that always causes the UserEventAgent to start up the fans and there is none to stop it.  The only thing I noticed is a huge number of errors, logged in the UserEventAgent statistics:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rHZpz.png" alt="enter image description here" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1YKzD.png" alt="enter image description here"  Is there any way to find out, what causes the UserEventAgent to go haywire? Maybe a terminal command, or something like that?  emAs a note: Testing it will take some time, because I will have to wait for the next spike to test solutions./em  hr  h2Update January 2nd, 2015/h2  I just got a new spike.  precode02.01.16 12:18:14,403 UserEventAgent[47]: Failed to send message because the port couldn't be created. 02.01.16 12:18:14,404 UserEventAgent[347]: com.apple.TMHelperAgent.SetupOffer enabled 02.01.16 12:18:17,234 UserEventAgent[47]: Failed to send message because the port couldn't be created. 02.01.16 12:18:17,235 UserEventAgent[347]: com.apple.TMHelperAgent.SetupOffer enabled 02.01.16 12:19:26,417 UserEventAgent[47]: Captive: [UserAgentDied:143] User Agent @port=101939 Died 02.01.16 12:19:26,422 com.apple.xpc.launchd[1]: (com.apple.UserEventAgent-Aqua[347]) Service exited due to signal: Killed: 9 02.01.16 12:19:26,681 UserEventAgent[16347]: Failed to copy info dictionary for bundle /System/Library/UserEventPlugins/alfUIplugin.plugin 02.01.16 12:20:27,224 UserEventAgent[45]: Failed to copy info dictionary for bundle /System/Library/UserEventPlugins/alfUIplugin.plugin 02.01.16 12:20:27,227 UserEventAgent[45]: Captive: CNPluginHandler en0: Inactive 02.01.16 12:20:27,794 UserEventAgent[45]: Received XPC_ERROR_CONNECTION_INVALID for connection com.apple.backupd.xpc 02.01.16 12:20:27,799 UserEventAgent[45]: Failed to send message because the port couldn't be created. 02.01.16 12:20:28,000 UserEventAgent[45]: nsurlsessiond_events plugin: adding token 1 for client softwareupdate_download_service 02.01.16 12:20:30,795 UserEventAgent[45]: Captive: [CNInfoNetworkActive:1748] en0: SSID 'Boop' making interface primary (protected network) 02.01.16 12:20:30,795 UserEventAgent[45]: Captive: CNPluginHandler en0: Evaluating 02.01.16 12:20:30,797 UserEventAgent[45]: Captive: en0: Probing 'Boop' 02.01.16 12:20:30,897 UserEventAgent[45]: Captive: CNPluginHandler en0: Authenticated 02.01.16 12:20:30,921 com.apple.xpc.launchd[1]: (com.apple.UserEventAgent-LoginWindow) This service is defined to be constantly running and is inherently inefficient. 02.01.16 12:20:31,047 UserEventAgent[217]: Failed to copy info dictionary for bundle /System/Library/UserEventPlugins/alfUIplugin.plugin 02.01.16 12:20:31,072 UserEventAgent[217]: user agent networkd: built Nov  3 2015 13:38:22 02.01.16 12:20:34,359 UserEventAgent[45]: assertion failed: 15C50: com.apple.fsevents.matching + 4704 [80662126-A833-3279-8A32-49393FD4E964]: 0x0 02.01.16 12:20:44,822 com.apple.xpc.launchd[1]: (com.apple.UserEventAgent-Aqua) This service is defined to be constantly running and is inherently inefficient. 02.01.16 12:20:45,031 UserEventAgent[269]: Failed to copy info dictionary for bundle /System/Library/UserEventPlugins/alfUIplugin.plugin 02.01.16 12:20:45,064 UserEventAgent[269]: com.apple.TMHelperAgent.SetupOffer enabled 02.01.16 12:20:45,167 UserEventAgent[269]: user agent networkd: built Nov  3 2015 13:38:22 02.01.16 12:20:45,453 UserEventAgent[269]: received an unknown event from daemon 02.01.16 12:22:12,000 kernel[0]: process UserEventAgent[45] thread 1395 caught burning CPU!

I have to restart my mac in order to bring back a normal cpu usage of the UserEventAgent. I tried to close all running apps, but that does not seem to have any effect at all.  My guess is, that it might be a driver related problem, but I have no clue how to track it down. Is there any way to do that?  emOk, currently even a restart does not help. Battery is dead in an instant and fans are constantly running at full speed. I am so annoyed!/em  <answer226895> Same issue. I completely reinstalled 10.11.3 on an erased drive and the problem persists. This is an OS X bug so send Apple a bug report.  My temporary solution is to disable the launch daemon:  precodesudo launchctl unload /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.UserEventAgent-System.plist /code/pre  But you must remember to load it prior to the next boot or in safe mode, or else many things will fail at the next boot.  Unfortunately, we must wait for Apple to get their act together on this one.  <answer230755> In my case it seemed to be the Wacom tablet driver.br Wacom has updated its driver to code6.3.15-2 RC/code. The changelog says:     ul   liUserEventAgent hangs at or near 100% CPU usage at startup/li   /ul   I just updated to this driver, and it seems to work fine.  hr  If the driver update does not help, deleting those files also fixed this problem for me:  precode/Library/LaunchAgents/com.wacom.wacomtablet.plist /Library/LaunchDemons/com.wacom.displayhelper.plist /code/pre  <comment267658> Please search the system log for UserEventAgent and add a typical spike related event found their to your question. <comment267662> Thanks, I’ve added a log entry, but I don’t know if that matches the lag spike I had today. I will update this post again, if there is a new spike … <comment319456> has this been fixed yet? I'm just now having the exact same problem (October 2016) <comment319529> strike that downloaded malwarebytes and preformed a scan to find I apparently had adware which seems to have been the cause.
