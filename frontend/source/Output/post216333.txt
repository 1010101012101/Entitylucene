How can I locate an iMessage from 1-2 months ago? Possible? <body> I am trying to find/locate iMessages from a certain day back at the beginning of October. Is this possible? Scrolling back on the history on my iMac in Messages goes back to 10/19/15 but no further. On iPhone it is more recent than that.  <answer216340> The last I tried this was OS X Mountain Lion and iOS 6.x on a jailbroken device.  There is a messages database located on each device.  You can Google for the exact location in your OS versions.  I know these databases used to be SQLite, and you could browse the database using SQLite commands and see all info stored in the entire database.  Be sure to make a backup first, and ideally, do all your investigation in the backup database.  There also used to be a Cydia app that would allow you to search all of your iMessages by date/contact/etc., but the name escapes me at the moment.  This may not be the greatest answer, but it's all I've got, and at least it's something!  <answer216356> If it was archived on your Mac, you can find it by date.br Navigate to code~/Library/Containers/com.apple.iChat/Data/Library/Messages/Archive//codebr Open the relevant dated folder &amp; any conversations for that day will be listed by the contact names.  Double-clicking will open it in Messages.  <comment261678> You rock! Thank you. This is exactly what I needed...and it was simple to get it done.
