Dual 27" Thunderbolt <body> How can I set up a dual Thunderbolt on a 2012 Mac mini server? I daisy chained them but the second stays black.   Do I need a Thunderbolt to HDMI adaptor, from which vendor, how can I not lose resolution?  Or does this setting work only with the non-server Mac mini with the AMD Radeon HD 6630M graphics card?  http://www.apple.com/macmini/features.html  <answer64846> You need the 2.5 Ghz Mac Mini, which indeed also comes with an AMD Radeon HD 6630M instead of the integrated Intel HD Graphics 3000 on the 2.3Ghz model.  For a list of models that support up to two Thunderbolt displays connected, check this support article over on the Apple website:  Thunderbolt ports and displays: Frequently asked questions (FAQ)   ul li14 - How many Apple Thunderbolt Displays can I use with my Mac in OS X?/li /ul
