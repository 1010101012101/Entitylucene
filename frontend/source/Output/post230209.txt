How do I drop outgoing packets to specific host/port? <body> I want to test something locally. For that, I'd like to be able to drop outgoing packets sent to a specific host/port. I tried messing around with pf rules using Murus (the non-free version), but have been unsuccessful.  I am comfortable in the terminal, but am unsure where to make any changes and how to apply them. I am familiar with iptables on linux.  Can I get some direction on how to achieve this?  <answer230556> You could use the PF firewall:  Add this line to /etc/pf.conf to drop all packets to the given ip:port   precodeblock drop out quick proto tcp  to 192.168.1.103 port 80 /code/pre  After changing pf.conf you should reload it with  precodesudo pfctl -f /etc/pf.conf /code/pre  Eventually you will have to enable it with  precodesudo pfctl -e /code/pre  <answer230558> To permanently block outgoing traffic to specific domains and/or ports you should create a new anchor file and add it to pf.conf.  ol liCreate an anchor file emorg.user.block.out/em in /private/etc/pf.anchors   precodesudo touch /private/etc/pf.anchors/org.user.block.out /code/pre  with the following content and a trailing empty line  precodemybadtcphosts = "{ www.domain.com, domain.com, 135.0.9.17, 10.0.0.17 }" mybadtcpports = "{ 443, 80 }" mybadudphosts = "{ www.domain3.com, domain3.com, 27.134.89.124, 192.168.5.37 }" mybadudpports = "{ 53, 5353 }"  block drop out proto tcp from any to $mybadtcphosts port $mybadtcpports block drop out proto udp from any to $mybadudphosts port $mybadudpports /code/pre  The additional domain names/IP addresses in mybad*hosts are just an example how to add additional domains. The same goes for the ports 80/5353 in mybad*ports.  A simple but less flexible solution is:  precodeblock drop out proto tcp from any to domain.com port 80 /code/pre/li liModify the file /private/etc/pf.conf but keep a trailing empty line  original file:  precodescrub-anchor "com.apple/*" nat-anchor "com.apple/*" rdr-anchor "com.apple/*" dummynet-anchor "com.apple/*" anchor "com.apple/*" load anchor "com.apple" from "/etc/pf.anchors/com.apple" /code/pre  to  precodescrub-anchor "com.apple/*" nat-anchor "com.apple/*" rdr-anchor "com.apple/*" dummynet-anchor "com.apple/*" anchor "com.apple/*" anchor "org.user.block.out" load anchor "com.apple" from "/etc/pf.anchors/com.apple" load anchor "org.user.block.out" from "/etc/pf.anchors/org.user.block.out" /code/pre/li liParse and test your anchor file to make sure there are no errors:  precodesudo pfctl -vnf /etc/pf.anchors/org.user.block.out /code/pre/li liNow modify /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.pfctl.plist from   precode&lt;array&gt;     &lt;string&gt;pfctl&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;string&gt;-f&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;string&gt;/etc/pf.conf&lt;/string&gt; &lt;/array&gt; /code/pre  to  precode&lt;array&gt;     &lt;string&gt;pfctl&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;string&gt;-e&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;string&gt;-f&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;string&gt;/etc/pf.conf&lt;/string&gt; &lt;/array&gt; /code/pre  You have to disable System Integrity Protection if El Capitan is installed to accomplish this. After editing the file reenable SIP. After rebooting your Mac pf will be enabled (that's the -e option).  Alternatively you may create your own launch daemon similar to the answer here: Using Server 5.0.15 to share internet WITHOUT internet sharing./li /ol  After a system update or upgrade some of the original files above may have been replaced and you have to reapply all changes.  hr  strongMurus:/strong  Open Murus.

Do you prefer a Murus solution (to further understand Murus) or is my linked answer sufficient? <comment281899> Thank you @klanomath. Sorry I was offline for a few days.
