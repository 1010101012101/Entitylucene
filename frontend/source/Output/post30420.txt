Applescript to disable screen saver through sending keystroke <body> I'm trying to write an applescript that will disable the screen saver through sending a keystroke.  Something like sending a "shift key" pressed every 30 seconds.  I don't want to have the applescript actually disable the screen saver through system preferences.  <answer30422> Check out the dictionary for the System Events app that's included with Applescript. You can access it from the AppleScript Editor:     File  Open Dictionary...  System Events.app   There's a class called "screen saver preferences object" in there that should do what you need without having to script the GUI.  EDIT: Try setting the property "delay interval" of the object to 0 to disable the screensaver.  <answer30428> You could also use an on idle() handler, like this:  precodeon idle    -- Add your code here to keep the computer awake.    return 1800 -- The number of seconds the script should delay before being idle again end idle /code/pre  but the screen saver prefs obj is a better tool. It does exactly what you want.  <answer82072> You have defined strongHOW/strong you want to solve the problem. I don't think that is the right approach. I think you should consider disabling and reenabling the screensaver.  This sets the Screen Saver to "never":  precodeosascript -e 'tell app "System Events" to tell screen saver preferences to set delay interval to 0' /code/pre  This sets the Screen Saver to 5 emminutes/em:  precodeosascript -e 'tell app "System Events" to tell screen saver preferences to set delay interval to 300' /code/pre  The interval value is in seconds even though the GUI shows minutes.  If your version of OSX has a slider in the Screen Saver System Preferences, the slider will update. Later versions, like Mountain Lion, have a dropdown with a few enumerated options. This does not update.  <comment34889> http://lightheadsw.com/caffeine/ perhaps ? <comment34910> So basically: `tell app "System Events" to tell screen saver preferences to set delay interval to 0`. Display sleep might need to be disabled separately.
