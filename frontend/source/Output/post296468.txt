How to commit a file with TortoiseHg? <body> I have installed TortoiseHg on my Mac. I can run it, and it opens the repository browser. However, unlike on Windows, it doesn't add new items to Finder context menu. So I cannot right-click a file or a folder and do 'commit'. How can I perform commit then, without going to Terminal level?  <answer296475> To do this, you would need to do basically two things:  ol liCreate an Automator Service that commits the job/li liAdd the Service to the context menu/li /ol  Both of these topics has been answered here on Ask Different; I linked to two excellent examples.  What you would have to do is create an Applescript or a bash script (bash probably being easier) that "commits" whatever it is you want to commit - strongyou will have to scope the requirements in detail./strong   Once you have the script written, add it to the context menu.
