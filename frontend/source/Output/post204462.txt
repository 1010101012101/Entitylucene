Resizing HFS+ volume after cloning <body> I cloned a disk containing an HFS+ volume to a larger disk using the command line codedd/code utility.  Now I want to grow the HFS+ volume to fill the new disk.  There's an EFI partition before the HFS+ volume in the partition table but nothing after it.  When I attempt to resize the HFS+ volume in Disk Utility, it acts like everything works, but completes in about 4 seconds without making any changes to the partition table.  Trying from the command line using codesudo diskutil resizeVolume /dev/disk3s2 0/code gives code0 does not appear to be a valid disk size/code.  If I use a size of code2T/code instead, I get the error codeError: -5341: MediaKit reports partition (map) too small/code.  How can I resize this partition?  I'd prefer not to have to copy the data to the new drive all over again.  <answer204467> Following instructions from this helpful article, I wiped and rebuilt the partition table (GPT).  Basic commands used:  precodesudo diskutil unmount /dev/disk3 sudo gpt show /dev/disk3 &gt; ~/tmp/disk3-gpt sudo gpt delete /dev/disk3 sudo gpt create -f /dev/disk3    # -f for MBR compatibility sudo gpt add -b ${start} -s ${size} -t ${type_guid} /dev/disk3 # repeat above command for each partition to be re-added /code/pre  Afterwards, I used the codeDisk Utility/code application to resize the HFS+ volume.  It worked!  OSX may remount partitions immediately after they are re-added; in this case, you will need to unmount them again before continuing to re-add more partitions.  If the command line is not your thing, well, then you probably didn't clone your drive with codedd/code in the first place.  <answer236023> This is really terrifying that the only answer suggest to overwrite your gpt table.  The correct and safest solution, with explanation, is from this comment.  ol lidownload GParted-Live CD from http://www.gparted.org/download.php/li liboot from this CD/li liaccept the suggestion to enable the full disk/li lireboot from mac OSX/li litry again – now you can resize it!/li /ol  Explanation:  The only problem is the disk header which exists twice: at the beginning and at the end of of the disk. Somehow Mac OSX shows the real disk size, but is not capable to change the GPT size header and to relocate the second “header” to the real disk end.
