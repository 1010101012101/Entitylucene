How can I connect to one server using two user names - at the same time? <body> I am struggling to find a way to allow users to connect to two different shares on a server at the same time. It seems like it should be possible, but no matter what I try I am always forced to disconnect one user to connect as another.  I have tried using aliases like this:  precodeafp://user1:password1@ServerName._afpovertcp._tcp.local afp://user2:password2@ServerName._afpovertcp._tcp.local /code/pre  The first one connected works, and the second one ignores the name/password when connecting and just offers to connect as the first user again.  Is there a user friendly way to make this work?  <answer38548> I'm not ementirely/em sure it would work, but try this, from Terminal:  precodemkdir /Volumes/foo /Volumes/bar mount -t afp afp://foo:foopass@ServerName._afpovertcp._tcp.local /Volumes/foo mount -t afp afp://bar:barpass@ServerName._afpovertcp._tcp.local /Volumes/bar /code/pre  <answer57130> You can always cheat and use a different protocol for the second connection.  OS X works with SMB.
