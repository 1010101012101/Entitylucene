How to use Homebrew to install local archive <body> I'm trying to use Homebrew to install wget, but something is happening where the download is always corrupt.  This happens for all packages, not just wget.  I can download the tar.gz fine through a browser.  Can I use Homebrew to install a locally downloaded archive?  Something such as:  precodebrew install wget-1.14.tar.gz  /code/pre  <answer84631> If Homebrew already has a formula for it (in /usr/local/Library/Formula), and you have the exact archive that the formula expects (i.e. same file name and same contents, as determined by SHA1 or whatever hash type the formula uses), you can put the archive in ~/Library/Caches/Homebrew and then try codebrew install formula_name/code (substituting the correct name for emformula_name/em, of course).  <answer204833> precode$ brew install -f wget-1.14.tar.gz /code/pre  <comment97165> Seems very odd. I don't know of you can do that but it sounds like something more serious is happening. Have you tried running `brew doctor`? <comment97167> If you have the exact archive that Homebrew's expecting, you can put it in ~/Library/Caches/Homebrew and then try `brew install`. But this is mysterious. How about posting the output of `brew install` when you try it the normal way? <comment97450> @echristopherson Your method worked.  If you post it as an answer, I'll accept it. <comment97451> I know why it doesn't work.  Brew doctor doesn't show any issues.  It looks like the HTTP proxy being used isn't allowing the download. <comment114620> Just to note, this is useful when there are multiple mirrors and the one in the recipe doesn't work. You can set a different SourceForge mirror via an environment variable, but for others the accepted solution is very useful. <comment124105> `Homebrew` folder does not exist, but it works after I `mkdir` one. <comment292445> Different package but same requirement, -f doesn't appear to work:  `zaynehalsall@mbp:~$ brew install -f Library/Caches/Homebrew/pwgen-2.07.tar.gz  Error: No available formula with the name "Library/Caches/Homebrew/pwgen-2.07.tar.gz"  == Searching for similarly named formulae... Error: No similarly named formulae found. == Searching taps... Error: No formulae found in taps. zaynehalsall@mbp:~$ ` <comment292446> `brew install` didn't work for me, but `brew install package` did. Thanks! <comment292506> Oh, I had left that implicit. I'm fixing that in my answer. <comment312883> same error happens
