iTunes put a "1" at the end of many of my song and video titles. How can I fix this? <body> I recently consolidated my iTunes Library and now many videos have a "1" at the end of the file name. And weirdly, in the media library, there are two files - one with the "1" and one without. Luckily only one video appears in iTunes. Is there some way to clean up my media folder AND the filenames in itunes?  <answer85704> The most possible issue is you already have added songs (with copying to iTunes folder, it's by default), removed them with 'keep files' variant.  following steps should fix this:  ol liRemove weird titles from iTunes library and quit from. /li liopen your iTunes media folder code~/Music/iTunes/iTunes Media/Videos/code (you can find it in preferences)/li liremove weird titles from this folder (you can save correct file copies if you have no backup)/li liAlso you should remove these entries from iTunes library. /li lire-add correct versions into library. /li /ol  strongUPDATE:/strong added awk script and description for.  How to use this script:  ol lisave it to the file named code~/dups.awk/code (code~/code is your home directory)/li liopen your codeTerminal.app/code and change directory  to your iTunes media folder like we talked before (e.g. codecd "~/Music/iTunes/iTunes Meda/Videos"/code)/li liremove duplicate files with command codefind $(pwd) -type f|sort -r|awk -f ~/dups.awk| xargs -L 1 rmtrash/code/li /ol  some strongimportant/strong notes:  ol lithis script strongdoes respect/strong unicode and spaces in file names. I've tested it./li liI believe that unix-way tools are enough to do this task.(they are the fastest too)/li licodermtrash/code is utility from MacPorts, sends files to your Trash./li licoderm/code command remove files directly from file system and they can't be restored from trash bin. This is the fastest and the best way if you really strongsure/strong what do you do./li liusing automated stuff like this I always double check if there's no mistakes in output. You can replace command codexargs/code with arguments with codeless/code command or redirect output to the file (e.g. code~/dups.txt/code)/li /ol  precodefunc checkfile(a,b) {     if (length(a)+2 &lt; length(b) || a != substr(b, 1, length(a)))         return 1;     suffix = substr(b, length(a)+1);     return !match(suffix, "^ [0-9]+$"); }  func cutext(a) {     return  substr(a, 1, length(a)-4); }  {     file=cutext($0);     if (length(name) &gt; 0)         if (checkfile(name, file))             name = file;         else             printf("%s\n",$0);     else         name = file; } /code/pre  <answer130110> I just use a quick and dirty AppleScript to do things like this:`  precode-- BP Jan 2014 -- Trims a set number of characters from the Start of track names in an iTunes playlist -- Or trims a set number of characters from the End of track names in a playlist -- Or adds a prefix to each track name in a playlist. -- Or adds a suffix to each track name in a playlist. -- Trims take precedence over adds -- It's best to do just one operation at a time, and set all the other variables to "" or 0 as appropriate. --------------------------------- User settable variables set PlaylistName to "AAA" -- Just add the tracks you want to change to a single playlist.

By "1" and "2" I mean that there is a space, and then a 1 or 2. Kind of like when you add a file to a folder and the Finder asks if you wish to keep both, it adds a number. <comment98766> Potential solutions exist but it heavily depends on the number of impacted files. Are we talking about a handful or hundreds? <comment98775> Thank you. We are talking hundreds, if not thousands, of files here. I was wondering if there was a program or script (like a doug's apple script) that would compare what itunes is displaying, with what is in the media folder - and ELIMINATE anything that's in the media folder that itunes isn't displaying. Or perhaps there is a script that looks to see if there is a " 1" or " 2" after the name in iTunes, and remove that extra 1 or 2? <comment98776> Right now, I think Eir Nym is the only way to go: delete files from library, then delete duplicates from media folder, and reimport all files. Problem is, I have nearly 10TB of files - more than 25000 songs and about 10,000 movies and TV shows. It would be an impossibly big task. <comment98823> I see. Please, wait just a little, I'll write you little script. <comment98827> Your script is here. <comment98919> WOW. OK Eir Nym. You are making me brave. I need to study this script a bit and then see if I am going to make it work. Just to be careful I think I am going to get help from a more confident Terminal junkie than me. On the plus side I do have my old library which I THINK I could roll back to if needed. <comment99005> Another approach would be to use the Find Duplicates within iTunes. <comment99530> Yes, bur this doesn't solve problem of numbers at the end of track names <comment159186> Having 25k Songs in iTunes is not a good idea. I messed with iTunes Once on a 50k basis. Same Problem and now I don't let iTunes "manage" my Library. If the files are really the same, just use a regex to find all those and delete them, then ask for all "unavailable" tracks in iTunes and delete them. <comment159245> I should try to overload it!
