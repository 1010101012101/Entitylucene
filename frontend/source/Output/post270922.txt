My drawings from Tayasui Sketches are blurred on PC? <body> When I backed up my drawings on my computer by iTunes. It was badly blurred that I cannot even make out the drawing. I already backed up my drawings before and it was great! But I guess  after the Layers thing came, it became like that.  The dog one is the one that has been backed up before and was perfect and the other one is the blurred one. I noticed that the blurred ones were smaller too.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HEZvc.png" alt="Before"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HFYgP.jpg" alt="After"  <comment340544> It's always helpful to present one and the same pic in a before/after comparison...
