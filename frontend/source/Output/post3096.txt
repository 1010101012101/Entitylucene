Command Line method to backup using two Time Machine disks <body> Does anyone know of a command line method to select the active Time Machine disk? I would like to alternate between two backup disks for redundancy. I would like this to be automated, presumably via cron, perhaps launchd.  There is an AppleScript method to swap disks, but I am doing remote system administration and cannot rely on GUI scripting. I would presume there is sufficient control of Time Machine using the strongdefaults/strong command, but am not sure how to achieve this yet.  <answer3103> Note: The restore component of backing up like this has not yet been tested.  Get the ID of the attached drive  precodedefaults read /Library/Preferences/com.apple.TimeMachine BackupAlias                        /code/pre  Eject, plug in 2nd drive, make it the Time Machine drive with the GUI, repeat.  Write (rather than read) the ID:  precodedefaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.TimeMachine BackupAlias '&lt;00000000 014e0002 ....&gt;'                                                    /code/pre  source &amp; thanks to Christian Stocker. Key comments from that post:  ol lihttp://developer.apple.com/DOCUMENTATION/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/defaults.1.html "WARNING: The defaults command will be changed in an upcoming major release to only operate on preferences domains. General plist manipulation utilities will be folded into a different command-line program."/li liAlso the property DestinationVolumeUUID should be set./li /ol  <answer3118> If your need is to have redundancy on Time Machine backups, an alternative is to maintain a clone of your Time Machine Volume. I use SuperDuper! for that purpose.  <comment28011> Update: Here is a solution for this on 10.7 Lion: http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20110906221223743 <comment28012> This is easier to do on 10.7 Lion: http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20110906221223743
