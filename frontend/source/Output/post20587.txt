How to merge two InstaPaper accounts? <body> A while ago I inadvertently created two Instapaper accounts. How do I combine the contents of one into the other and have one account?  <comment22675> Welcome to Ask Different! This site is for questions about Apple hardware or software, or questions about software specific to the Mac. Instapaper is not made by Apple, and you're asking about help with your account (which isn't Apple-related). Thus, this question is off-topic for this site. See the [FAQs](http://apple.stackexchange.com/faq) for more info. Thanks. <comment22684> I can think of one way. Use Instapaper's export feature. Create a Read It Later account. Use RIL's import from Instapaper feature. Then use RIL's export feature. Then use this tool at this page to finally import into your desired Instapaper account. http://minus.com/mc3va2C Any questions?
