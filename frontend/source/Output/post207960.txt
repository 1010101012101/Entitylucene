iTunes doesn't sync music with iPhone <body> After updating to iOS 9.0.1 (from iOS 9.1 beta via recovery mode), I cannot add any music to my iPhone 5S.  I tried to delete all the music from my device and then syncing in different ways (checking and unchecking all the stuff like "Sync only checked songs and videos" and "Sync Music") but it doesn't work. Now when I try to add something it looks like thisimg src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rX1ir.png" alt="music library", but download doesn't start.
