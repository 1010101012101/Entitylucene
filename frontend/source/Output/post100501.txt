Use PhotoBooth.app with Automator <body> Using Mountain Lion - 10.8.4  I would like to setup a daily snapshot system using Automator:  ul liuse the PhotoBooth.app/li liset it to auto start with the countdown "1,2,3"/li liautosave the picture to a specified folder/li liclose PhotoBooth.app/li /ul  Looked around on the internet and didn't find anything on this topic.  Automator has take video snapshot but the size of the output photo is tiny "200x200"  This would be perfect if I knew how to increase the size of the output file.  <answer100505> Have you looked at this script?     Download 27: Take Picture v1.0      This action will cause the Photo Booth application to take a picture. Requires GUI scripting be activated.   <answer100540> You could use imagesnap in a Run Shell Script action.  Or run codebrew install imagesnap/code and codesudo gem install terminal-notifier/code. Then save a script like this as code~/bin/cron-imagesnap/code:  precode#!/bin/bash  terminal-notifier -title 'Taking a snapshot in 3 seconds' -message '' -group imagesnap sleep 3 /usr/local/bin/imagesnap ~/Pictures/imagesnap-$(date +%y%m%d%H%M%S).png /code/pre  Make the script executable with codechmod +x ~/bin/cron-imagesnap/code. Then run codeEDITOR=nano crontab -e/code and add something like this:  precodeMAILTO="" 59 23 * * * ~/bin/cron-imagesnap /code/pre  codeMAILTO=""/code disables adding a message to code/var/mail/$USER/code when a command has stdout or stderr output.  Edit: you could also use an AppleScript like this:  precodeactivate application "Photo Booth" delay 5 tell application "System Events" to tell process "Photo Booth"     click menu item "Take Photo" of menu 1 of menu bar item "File" of menu bar 1 end tell delay 5 quit application "Photo Booth" /code/pre  <comment118277> I should of mentioned I tried that. The installer says the application can only run on a PowerPC. <comment118629> Pretty close. This seems to work. However, I was really hoping to use `PhotoBooth.app`. I have seen this in action before using `PhotoBooth.app`. I just can't seem to figure out how... <comment118746> I edited the answer to add an AppleScript that just activates Photo Booth, takes a photo, and quits Photo Booth. You can run it from Automator by adding a Run AppleScript action. <comment118802> Almost! However, it is not taking a photo for some reason. <comment118803> Ok, had to add a delay 3 before "tell application..." <comment118804> @MichaelIrey You're right, I edited the answer to add the delay.
