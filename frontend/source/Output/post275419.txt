iOS guidelines archive <body> I'm researching historical changes of UI widgets.   Do you know if there's an archive with all the iOS interface guidelines published by Apple over the years?  <answer275431> People rehost the PDFs everywhere. You can find PDFs of the interface guidelines just by searching for "strongiOS interface guidelines pdf &lt;year/strong" on Google. For example, here's the guidelines for 2011. There's no official archive.  <comment346477> Did you already contact Apple about this? Or tried archive.org?
