How to show a file in finder immediately? <body> Whenever I add a file to any folder in the finder (desktop, downloads, etc.) the only way to get that file to show up is to delete another. On the desktop, for instance, I can save a file to the desktop but it won't show up until I delete something else and then, boom, the new file shows up. Any ideas?  <comment254044> Change the view e.g. icon to list, then back again <comment254070> What model Mac do you have, how much RAM and what version of OS X are you running?  Additionally, is this issue a constant one or does it only occur occasionally. <comment254829> iMac 27", Late 2013, 8gb RAM, Yosemite 10.10.5 It happens EVERY time grr - Thanks!
