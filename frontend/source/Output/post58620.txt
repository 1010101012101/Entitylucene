Set keyboard shortcut for nested menu selection <body> Say an application has a menu selection Export in the File menu.  On mouse over, a sub-menu extends with the export options.  Is there a way to make a keyboard shortcut for one of those nested selections?  I've already tried implementing the keyboard shortcut for Export, setting it to Command-E.  However, this doesn't work, even though the Command symbol shows up next to Export.  Any help is appreciated  <answer58621> If you want to assign a shortcut to the submenu you can just use the name of the submenu as it appears. So if I wanted to assign a shortcut to the default encoding in Safari, using "Default" is enough.   If however you want to assign a shortcut to a submenu that occurs multiple times, such as "My Folder" you can use: Move ToNotes, in Lion at least. This no longer works in Lion.  You could also try to assign a shortcut using apple script like this:  precodetell app "System Events" to tell process "Terminal" click menu bar 1's menu "Shell"'s menu item 1's menu "New Window"'s menu item "Pro" end tell /code/pre  and then use these steps to generate an automator action:  ol liOpen Automator and choose the emService/em template/li liAdd a emRun Shell Script/em or emRun AppleScript/em action/li liCheck that the values for accepted data types and application scope the are correct/li liPaste the script and save/li liAssign a shortcut in the Keyboard preference pane/li /ol  If the shortcut for a service doesn't work at first, try running the service once by selecting it in the Services menu.

It turned out that if I put the shortcut in the "All Applications" section in System Preferences, instead of the Filemaker Pro Advanced section, it worked!!  This only applies to nested menu items. Non-nested works as they should (ie in the FM Pro Advanced section).  <comment67495> [A similar question at Super User](http://superuser.com/questions/177574/how-to-add-custom-keyboard-shortcut-for-a-nested-menu-item) <comment67496> Specifying the menu titles like `FileDuplicate` no longer seems to work on 10.8. <comment91965> What is the point of posting the exact same thing as Johan Kaving but a day later. <comment208451> Take note: you have to put in the full "path". Partial paths will not work!
