How to use a selfie stick remote trigger with iPhone 3G? <body> I have an Apple IPhone 3G and Version 4.2.8 (8E401), and a generic selfie stick.  The selfie stick has a wire that plugs into the headphone jack on the phone, and when pressing the shutter release on the stick increases the volume?  It does not release the shutter to snap a photo.  Can you help with this issue?  Thanks.  <answer216796> The generic Selfie Stick button emulates the volume down button action on the iPhone. Initial iterations of iPhone(3G,4,4S) did not use the volume button as a shutter.  iPhone 5 and above introduced the volume down button as the "shutter key"  Alternatively, [Camera+][1] built the feature into their app back in 2011 for this purpose. Try the Selfie stick with the Camera+ app and it should work.  Incase it doesn't work, Open Safari and type codecamplus://enablevolumesnap/code into URL box and the feature will be enabled.  <comment262090> Wasn't Camera+ asked by Apple to remove this feature? <comment262231> @patrix - Camera+ managed to include the feature hidden anyways.
