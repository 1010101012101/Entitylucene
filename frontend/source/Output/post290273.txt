Can I connect my Macbook (Retina, 12-inch, Early 2016) to my Macbook Pro (13-inch, Early 2011)? <body> A the title suggests, I'd like to connect my macbooks together to easily transfer files and mirror displays when i need to.   <answer290311> As long as both Macs are in the same network this can be easily done.  To set it up do the following on both Macs  ul liOpen System Preferences - Sharing/li liEnable Screen Sharing and File Sharing/li /ul  Afterwards the remote Mac should get listed in any Finder window in the side bar (in the Network part). Click on it and either attach the drive or start screensharing.  <comment366426> That is two things, Ask Different works better with one question in any post. Transferring files is built-in, just check the right boxes in System Preferences  Sharing.
