How can I resize a partition on OSX 10.10.5 <body> I have a Mac with OS X 10.10.5 on a HD which had 4 partitions.  Using Disk Utility I deleted one of the 4, intending to slightly grow the 3rd (containing the OS), leaving space for a new partition to install El Capitan.  This has been my practice up to now when a new version comes out.  I booted to another HD and deleted the partition, but it then proceeded to resize the 3rd partition YoodenVranx to use all the free space.  There seems to be no way to change the Partition Layout, or resize the partition.  I rebooted and used diskutil to list the current state.  precode/dev/disk0    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *500.1 GB   disk0    1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1    2:                  Apple_HFS Fenchurch               80.0 GB    disk0s2    3:                  Apple_HFS BxxxxxData              70.0 GB    disk0s3    4:          Apple_CoreStorage                         349.0 GB   disk0s4    5:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s5 /dev/disk1    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:                  Apple_HFS YoodenVranx            *348.6 GB   disk1                                  Logical Volume on disk0s4 /code/pre  <answer209176> To get some additional un-allocated disk space on disk0 to create a new partition you have to shrink your CoreStorage Volume Group and all subsequent CoreStorage items.
