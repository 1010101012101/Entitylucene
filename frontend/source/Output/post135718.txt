Logging onto Mac with RFID Cards <body> I want my users to be able to login to their computers (which are Macs) using RFID or Magnetic Stripe. Can anyone recommend a way to implement this?  They all run Mavericks or Yosemite, and it doesn't matter whether they are connected to AD or not, as long as I can get cards to work! I will unbind the macs if necessary!  Thanks Ed  <answer135723> There are quite a few smart card readers (e.g. this one on the Apple Store) that work with OS X.  For support of Smart Cards you may also want to check out Smart Card Services on MacOsForge.org, as highlighted by this Apple Support document regarding smart cards on OS X Mavericks.  <comment160912> Looks perfect. Thank you so much! <comment160917> Could you recommend anywhere to buy written smart cards or a smart card reader/writer? <comment160924> @EdG unfortunately, not really. I have only sparse experience with them (and it also depends on where you are on the world), but StackExchange & Google are your friends ;-) Also I can recommend the [Macenterprise.org forums](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/macenterprise) for such specific IT-admin questions. <comment280329> What do you mean by "AD"? Oh, Active Directory. <comment280330> The Apple support doc has been removed by Apple, it appears. <comment280464> @ThomasTempelmann Strange, I can still see it; while it is now "archived" (article not getting updates in the future) it should still be available. Could you check again accessing the site, maybe with a different localization (e.g. https://support.apple.com/kb/PH13936?locale=de_DE )
