What kinds of files can be added to Documents in the Cloud? <body> I already know that Pages can add .doc files too, but my knowledge ends at that. Does anyone have an exhaustive list of files that can be added to Documents in the Cloud strongthrough Apple apps (Preview, iWork, TextEdit, etc) only?/strong  <answer59697> If you consider the strongFinder/strong to be an Apple app, the answer is strongany arbitrary file/strong.  From my experimentation, it appears files dropped into folders in the code~/Library/Mobile Documents/code hierarchy get synched to other computers using the same iCloud account, regardless of type.  <comment69192> This is "technically" an unsupported feature. It's been postulated that Apple might be prepping for a dropbox competitor. <comment69256> Sure, it's unsupported. But as of now, it works quite well.
