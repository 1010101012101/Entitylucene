Notifications "Flash" All Screens <body> I have two external monitors connected to a Late 2013 rMBP. Previously, when I got notifications of any kind (iMessage, for example), the small notification would appear in the top-right of one of the screens, and that was it. However, after last night, each one of these notifications is paired with a emflash/em of all three screens, as another method of alerting me to the notification. I never enabled this.  The only place I can find this "feature" addressed is under Accessibility-Audio here: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DADDG.png" alt="Screenshot" When I codeTest Screen Flash/code, it does exactly what the notifications do, even though this box has never been checked, and I have ensured it is now unchecked.   Is there another place I can disable this functionality?
