Facebook issues with iOS 8.0.2 <body> I updated to iOS 8.0.2 yesterday and now I'm having problems with the Facebook app. It takes longer than normal to open and locks up every time I tap on something or goes completely blank. I have already tried rebooted my device several times.  <answer147628> You can try to delete the Facebook app completely by holding your finger on the app icon until it shakes, then click on the small x in the corner of the Facebook app icon.  Then redownload the Facebook app from the app store.  If that doesn't help then you'll have to wait until Facebook releases an update.  I've seen mine lock up, but not to the extent that it sounds like yours is, so this might be beyond your control.
