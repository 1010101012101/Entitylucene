Create a pdf with just certain pages from a pdf <body> I have a pdf, and I would like to select some pages from that pdf and build another pdf. Is it possible? If yes, how? I am on a El Captain.  <answer224923> What you might want to try is this:  ol liDuplicate the PDF you want to remove the pages from in the Finder/li liOpen the duplicate file, show the sidebar/li liSelect the page(s) you no longer want and press the backspace key/li liOnce you have deleted the pages you no longer want, save the duplicated file./li liIf you like you can then open another PDF and drag the thumbnails from one sidebar to the sidebar of the other document, thereby adding pages from one PDF to another./li /ol  Hope that helps.  <answer224935> There's a command-line option as well:  ol liInstall MacPorts (hosted by Apple) from https://www.macports.org/install.php . The link for your version of OS X, at the time of this writing, is https://distfiles.macports.org/MacPorts/MacPorts-2.3.4-10.11-ElCapitan.pkg/li liOnce it's installed, run the following command:  precodesudo port selfupdate &amp;&amp; sudo port install qpdf /code/pre  Enter your password (it will not be displayed as you type) and push return./li liNow, you'll be able to use the command codeqpdf/code. To do what you're trying to do, try this:  precodeqpdf --empty --pages ch01.pdf 1,5,9-15 ch02.pdf 1,5,7-20 -- output.pdf /code/pre  You can specify as many input PDFs as you want (in this case I'm using ch01.pdf, and ch02.pdf), the way I did here. Separate individual pages using commas, and page ranges using a dash, as I'm doing here. You can change "output.pdf" to whatever output file name you want./li /ol  <comment272982> The easy way hasn't changed in Preview for El Capit√°n In Thumbnail view select the pages you want, CMD-C (copy), File - New from Clipboard (Save extracted pages to the new file). (See [How to Extract Pages from a PDF Document in Mac OS X Preview](http://www.tekrevue.com/tip/extract-page-pdf-mac-os-x-preview/)). <comment312798> Does not work for me: on Capitan 10.11, I don't have a "File-New from Clipboard" after copying page thumbnail. <comment312799> Does not work for me: I cannot delete pages in the sidebar (Capitan 10.11) <comment312852> Odd, works fine for me. Maybe the PDF is protected with a password somehow? <comment313056> nope, I tried with normal PDFs I generate, I can select a thumbnail but not delete it or copy it, are you also on 10.11? <comment313097> Damn strange, yes I am. Sorry, no other ideas...
