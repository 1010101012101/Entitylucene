What are the differences between Applescripts saved as *.scpt and *.applescript? <body> It seems to me that those scripts that are saved as *.applescript are always meant to be the raw, uncompiled text while those that are saved as *.scpt can be either the raw text or the compiled program.  What advantages/disadvantages are there to using each extension?  An ancillary question: is there an analogous extension to *.applescript for the new JavaScript for Automation (JXA) language? Perhaps *.jxa?  <answer181055> code.scpt/code is in binary. code.applescript/code is in text.  You can use Spotlight/Finder's find function to search for words in code.applescript/code. You cannot do this with code.scpt/code.  Since code.scpt/code is already compiled, it's quicker to launch.  My favorite thing about code.applescript/code is that I can write that a script that read/write onto itself, so that variables are saved for next run without creating a separate file to house the variables.   <comment189795> May be of help, http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/146927/55365 <comment215245> "Since `.scpt` is already compiled, it's quicker to launch" -- really? What's it compiled in to? Byte code? Has anyone ever done a study of run time differences between compiled AppleScript and non-compiled AppleScript on modern Apple hardware?
