Low CPU usage when performing big task in java <body> I recently got mac mini and I'm new to OS X so maybe this is a trivial question. I'm developing web application in java using Spring. I have another project to run IT tests which sets up the API and performs lots of testing.  Tests take ~6 minutes on Linux and Windows (and when this is first thing i do after restarting my mac). When i run them on my mac they take very long time (~30 mins and go on) I notice in Activity Monitor that CPU is 90% idle after the API has started and tests begin to execute. Java processes uses ~0.5% of CPU. There is still ~7 GB memory free.  Running this on other environments (e.g. Linux) usually takes most of available resources (almost 100% CPU usage and memory)  Can somebody help me resolve this issue? Does OS X have any limitation regarding CPU usage for java processes?  I can provide more informations but need to know where to look.  <comment371012> Is your "IT test [suite]" available in the public? <comment371015> are you asking about project sources? It is not available in public. <comment371016> Are you running it via command line or an IDE? (Some IDEs negatively affect performance). Also, is the program throwing any uncaught errors? <comment371018> No errors- test do execute but very slowly. Running it via command line using maven <comment371031> I'm using Check Point endpont security to connect to VPN. Disconnecting seems to resolve this issue which makes me even more confused
