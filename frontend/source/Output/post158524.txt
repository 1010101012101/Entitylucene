Process using more memory than I physically have <body> I was messing around with a large (4GB) csv in pandas, when I noticed activity monitor was reporting using more RAM than I physically have in my laptop (15GB instead of the 8 I have). I was wondering what's really going on and how this is possible internally?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4ItSY.png" alt="I need to download more RAM"  <answer158536> This guy explains it well http://www.chriswrites.com/what-is-virtual-memory-on-the-mac/     So What is Virtual Memory?      Your Mac comes with a limited amount of   physical memory (RAM) installed by default. Memory is critical to any   computer to run applications and carry out all the operations   commanded by the user. Memory must be as fast as possible (and it   helps to have as much as possible) to maximise your Mac’s performance;   thankfully, prices have drastically fallen in recent years.   Nevertheless, every computer has a finite amount of memory so Mac OS X   might actually need to use more than is physically available on your   system.      This is where virtual memory comes in – you can think of it as a kind   of extension to the real memory on your system, albeit much slower   because it is in fact physical space on your hard disk (or SSD, if you   have one installed). Let’s say that you have 4 GB of main memory on   your Mac and a 512 GB hard disk. If Mac OS X needs to use all 4 GB of   main memory, it can still make use of any free space on your hard disk   as an extension to that memory. Unfortunately, virtual memory is much   slower than the physical RAM installed in your computer, because hard   disks cannot match the speed of memory chips.   <comment186359> Shortly: swap file is used to extend your physical RAM <comment186361> check this quesiton,might help  http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/97341/why-is-my-mac-using-so-much-memory/125707#125707 <comment186382> got it, thanks. As an aside, if I wanted to manipulate 100GB csv files, could I install linux with a gigantic swap partition? <comment186383> Yes but your system will slow down because some of the system procs will also swap. The right technique is to manipulate big files efficiently ;) eg striping your reading.
