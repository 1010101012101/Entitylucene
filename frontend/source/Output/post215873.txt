Print jobs cancelled if waiting too long? <body> I tend to send things to print, even when not connected to my printer (via usb). This allows it to print the minute I connect the printer, which is nice when I am on my laptop. It used to work, even if I didn't connect my printer for a day or two, but now it doesn't. The print jobs seem to die after 3 hours. Any help?  <answer215874> Printing in OS X is handled by CUPS, the Common Unix Printing System. Older versions of OS X had older versions of CUPS. A new strikeIt's not a bug, It's a /strikeem"feature"/em was added in CUPS 1.6, which corresponds to Mac OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion, in order to prevent stuck jobs.  The codeMaxJobTime/code option, which defaults to 10800 seconds (3 Hours), will cancel the active print job on a printer that has timed out. The next job in the queue will start, either printing or eventually timing out.  From the cups.conf man page:     strongMaxJobTime seconds/strongbr   Specifies  the  maximum time a job may take to print before it is canceled.
