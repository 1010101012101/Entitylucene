How to get Open File selector to show hidden files? <body> I would like my Open File selector to be showing hidden files.  I am not sure if the same Open File module is shared among many applications that use it or each app has its own.  The specific app I have in mind with which I would like to enable this functionality is codeSublime Text 2/code.  However, I do NOT want the codeFinder/code to be showing hidden files.  What I tried to do is execute  precodedefaults write com.apple.Finder AppleShowAllFiles TRUE killall Finder /code/pre  from the codeTerminal/code but that changed it only in the Finder and not in the Open File selector for Sublime (exactly the opposite of what I was trying to accomplish).  <answer100464> You can use ⇧⌘. (shift-command-.) to show hidden files in a file dialog temporarily.  To make Sublime Text show hidden files by default, run:  precodedefaults write com.sublimetext.2 AppleShowAllFiles -bool true /code/pre  To show hidden files in all applications but not in Finder, run:  precodedefaults write -g AppleShowAllFiles -bool true defaults write com.apple.Finder AppleShowAllFiles -bool false /code/pre  You can apply the changes by quitting and reopening applications. AppleShowAllFiles also affects other views besides file dialogs.  <comment118143> See this response...  http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/64324/how-do-i-get-sublime-texts-open-file-gui-to-show-hidden-files <comment118145> Cmd+Shift did not work for me <comment118149> Try Command + Shift + . <comment184432> Similarly, for Sublime Text 3: `defaults write com.sublimetext.3 AppleShowAllFiles -bool true`
