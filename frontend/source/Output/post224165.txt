Set default user in terminal <body> I just formatted my Mac and upgrade it to El Capitan,  When I open Terminal I see that I am always logged in as root:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8gmqe.png" alt="enter image description here"  How can I get my usual user name every time I open a new Terminal window,   I have tried codesu -l username/code and it worked, however when I close the window and open another the root user comes back.  <comment271840> Did you enable the root user, yourself? <comment271841> No, the issue appears immediately just after installing <comment271849> Is just the prompt wrong or are you really logged in as root? What does `id -a` return? <comment271864> @patrix I am really logged in as a root <comment271866> Can you move all your .bashrc, .profile etc. files away and open a new tab in Terminal? Still root? <comment271867> Also, enable ssh and log in as username@localhost. Do you get logged in correctly or as root? <comment272686> That does seem very strange; to be the root user, by default, on a fresh install.
