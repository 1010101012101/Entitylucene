Unstoppable crashes - Clean 10.12 Install, Apple Store found no hardware issues <body> thanks in advance for any ideas. I need help with my personal “white whale” mac problem. A friend of mine has a late 2013 15" Retina MacBook Pro that… for about seven months has been “crashing” at random times.   The thing about these crashes is that they’re not like any normal kind of crash I’ve seen. There are three types: 1) The screen suddenly goes black and is off (no kernel panic). 2) Black screen but still backlit, turns off in ~1 min. 3) Screen goes black, fans keep running, needs hard reset.  Common shutdown causes: -104, -128.  This has been happening anywhere between 0-20+ times a day, sometimes 5x in as many minutes, sometimes it goes a week without any issues. We went to the Apple Store yesterday, no hardware issues. It was recommended that he start with a fresh install of macOS and not bring any preferences or applications over (I also recommended this when the problems started but)… So he finally did that, except moved some preferences and applications over--crash. We erased the drive and reinstalled 10.12 again, just signed into iCloud--crash. Started over one more time, no iCloud… crash.   I had been starting to think it’s a power/battery issue, as it started 7 months ago when he moved, but did not happen for a week when he was on vacation. Also last night we used it to watch a movie and play video games (not plugged in) and it was fine. But overnight plugged in it crashed. It doesn’t crash in Safe Mode either. He’s reset the PRAM and SMC, run disk utility, all the things you do. We've done other innumerable things to try to fix it. Thanks for your help!
