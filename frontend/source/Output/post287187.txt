Is there a way to go back a few seconds in a movie on iTunes on a Mac? <body> Such as going back 5 or 10 seconds. This is a function I needed most but don't find on iTunes.  P.S. the kbdCmd/kbdkbdOpt/kbd Left arrow doesn't work by the way.  <answer287189> Use strongCmd+Option+Left Arrow/strong to skip backwards five seconds.  Use strongCmd+Option+Right Arrow/strong to skip forward five seconds.  Hold the keys down and you'll keep skipping backwards or forwards with momentary pauses so you can keep up.   <comment362603> I Googled and got this result too but it didn't work
