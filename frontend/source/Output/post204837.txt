Printer connected to Mac only works if other Mac is turned on <body> I have an old emiMac strongG5/em/strong with emMac OS X 10.5 (Leopard)/em and a emCanon PIXMA MG5350/em printer. It prints without a problem on the old G5. I think the printer is connected via bluetooth.  And now I also have an emiMac strongG6/em/strong with emMac OS X 10.7 (Lion)/em.  I can print on the printer, but only if the old G5 is turned on. Why?  How can I change this, so that I can print on the G6 when the G5 is turned off?  <answer204841> Probably the printer is connected to your emiMac G5/em and you are sharing it over the network. If you use this shared printer as your standard printer at the emGen. 6 iMac/em, it will quit working as soon as you turn off the emiMac G5/em. Connect the printer to you WLAN and configure a new printer at the emGen. 6 iMac/em.   <comment246953> Please use proper Mac identifiers. iMac G5 may refer to the G5 PowerPC processor (Generation 3 iMacs) as well as Generation 5 iMacs. <comment246956> Can you please add your specific setup? Is the printer connected directly to the "G5" Mac (either physically or via Bluetooth) or do they share the same network (WiFi or LAN)? Also there is no such thing as a "G6" iMac, please refer to "About this Mac" in the Apple menu for the proper identifiers.
