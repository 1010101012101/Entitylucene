How to set default Window position and/or size? <body> Whenever I start an application like Terminal or Preview, they are always opened as a small window on the top left corner of the screen. Is there any way to set them to open in the center of the screen? Preferably maximized too?  <answer124296> I'd like to help you with the correct answer which is given on SuperUser: What controls saved / default window sizes and positions in OS X?  Next to that, if you don't want to mess with the .plist files I can recommend you BetterSnapTool which can be used to drag a program to the top of a screen like you can do in Windows 7 by default.  <answer124420> On OSX 10.9, when I drag the Terminal window to a different spot, then quit, the new location is remembered upon relaunch. To change the size of the window, in Preferences - Text, you can make the font size bigger, which will be remembered. In Preferences - Window, you can set the number of rows/columns as well.  <answer124524> In Terminal you can change the default window size from Preferences  Settings  Window:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/OxH23.png" alt=""  You can also use window groups to set a default position and size for the window opened when you launch Terminal (but not for new windows opened later).  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jIrsJ.png" alt=""  I use Sequential and Skim as alternatives to Preview and iTerm 2 as an alternative to Terminal. All of them have an option to open windows in full screen by default, and all of them have their own (pre-Lion and actually usable) implementations for full screen windows.  The sizes of Finder windows are saved in code.DS_Store/code files and there are no default window size settings in codecom.apple.Finder.plist/code or anything. I use a script like this to reset the properties of windows:  precodetell application "Finder"     if number of Finder windows is 0 then return     tell Finder window 1         set toolbar visible to false         set sidebar width to 0         set statusbar visible to false         set current view to column view         set bounds to {960, 44, 1920, 1076}         tell its column view options             set shows icon to false         end tell     end tell end tell /code/pre  <answer125674> Slate (a window manager) is emextremely/em configurable, and using the JavaScript config file will allow you to do this. Events like a window opening can be handled with a JavaScript callback which moves the window to fill the screen.  An example of what you want: (taken pretty much directly from the wiki page)  precodeslate.on("windowOpened", function(event, win) {     if (win.app().name() === "Terminal" || win.app().name() === "Preview") {         win.move("x" : "screenOriginX", "y" : "screenOriginY",                  "width" : "screenSizeX", "height" : "screenSizeY");     } }); /code/pre  <answer125676> Get an app named SizeUp. It is not free but it pays for itself in productivity real quick.  <comment149301> And I gave you points for this one 2, in thanks for publishing the script :)
