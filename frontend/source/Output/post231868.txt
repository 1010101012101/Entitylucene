Why would a codesigned app suddenly start triggering "... not allowed assistive access." error? <body> strongEnvironment/strong: OS X 10.10.5  strongBackground/strong: I have an applescript I've been using for past year or so. I use it for copying a password from my password manager (1Password, in my case), and it then pastes that into the system prompt to unlock my encrypted disks. As you know, OS X doesn't allow pasting of passwords into these password prompts. As my passwords are very long and very random, it's not easy to type them. I wrote this script to handle the pasting for me. It's worked perfectly fine right up until I rebooted my computer today. I last rebooted it about a week ago.  When I wrote the script, I codesigned it so that OS X would not re-prompt me with assistive access issues every time I ran it.   It's possible a security update installed since I last rebooted. Not 100% sure, but I know the system has been prompting me for days to manually allow an update to occur (one the required a restart).  strongIssue/strong: Every time I try to use this password pasting app I get the message:  precodePaste Secure Password is not allowed assistive access. System Events got an error: Paste Secure Password is not allowed assistive access. (-25211) /code/pre  At first it was happening the moment I ran it. It would simply not run. I then removed its entry from the Accessibility list in system preferences, and re added it.  After than it would run, but then something very odd happens... as follows:  ul liApp in on the Accessibility list, and is ticked./li liApp runs, and goes through its dialogs asking me to select password, etc./li liIn that time the app entry in Accessibility list changes name. It remains there but has a code name (just now, for instance, it's entry has renamed to 970520065... (Etc), as shown below.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/m4s3k.png" alt="enter image description here"/li liIt stays that way for about 10 seconds./li liThe assistive access error appears./li liAfter about 10 seconds, the app's entry in the Accessibility list reverts back to how it should be, as shown below.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0pcsq.png" alt="enter image description here"/li liIf the Accessibility panel is locked, then when the app's entry reappears, it has reverted to being un-ticked. I have to unlock the panel and re-tick it./li liIssue repeats each time I try to use it. So it is unusable./li /ul  Can anyone suggest how to resolve this? I've done everything I know of.  ul liApp is code signed./li liApp has been added to the Accessibility list, and is ticked./li /ul  Not sure what else to try.
