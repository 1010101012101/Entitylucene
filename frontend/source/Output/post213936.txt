Speaker on when headset plugged in <body> I would like to keep my headset plugged into my iPhone 5S but have the ringer audible from the phone when I don't have the earbuds in my ears.  is this possible?   I don't like to have to hurry up and plug in my headset when a call comes in and I sometimes miss calls when it is plugged in and I don't have the earbuds in my ears.  <answer213938> Yes indeed it is possible. Turn off the silent mode of your iPhone (toggle on the left) then set your ringtone to be audible and voil√†! Your iPhone will ring even with the earphones plugged in.
