What iPhone app will allow one person to track the location of another in real-time? <body> With the permission of the person being tracked, of course!  I'm running in a marathon and want my family and friends to be able to see my location on a map in real-time (or very close to it).   Are there any apps that can do this?    I'd also like to be able to turn on and off the "broadcast" of my location.  <answer105504> Find my Friends by Apple.  More info here.
