NTFS appears every time <body> Every time I boot my Mac, an "NTFS for Mac OS X" window appears. In the settings I can't change this. Here is the window img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/tmu3x.png" alt="enter image description here"  I have El capitan 10.11.4  I found this:      To resolve the issue you need to delete the service which is starting Preferences Panel with NTFS for Mac OS X.      ol   liGo to Applications - Utilities/li   liOpen Terminal/li   liType in/li   /ol      sudo rm /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.paragon.NTFS.notify.plist      ol start="4"   liPress Enter and provide Administrator password/li   liPress Enter again/li   /ol      Preferences pane will not pop up again.   But the file emcom.paragon.NTFS.notify.plist/em does not exist.  Any solution?  PS: sorry for my english, im from Argentina  PPS: It does not appear as part of the Login Items  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/s5ptK.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer237500> Try this:  ol liGo to System Settings - Users and Groups/li liCLick the Login Items tab./li liIf the program is listed here, you should be able to hide it when logging in by check the box next to the program item or if you don't want it to open automatically (in case you don't need to access NTFS formatted drives) you can highlight the item and click the minus in the bottom og the window right under the list of items./li /ol  <comment290667> Please add a screenshot, your system version and any additional useful information to your question by editing it! <comment290686> When exactly during the boot process does the window/message appear (before or after user login)? Do you have any third party NTFS driver installed? <comment290853> @patrix after user login. I do not install anything else. When i said "a window appears" i mean the program itself <comment290858> You (or somebody else) at least installed Paragon NTFS (which is.a 3rd party app). Do you need to access any NTFS formatted drives? <comment291048> Paragon NTFS does not appear in the list <comment291050> @patrix sorry i didnt know what 3rd party means. Yes i want to keep the app if it is what you mean. I use an external hard drive in NTFS format <comment291051> @AgustinLuques Do "System Preferences" appear in the list?
