Picture thumbnail is not the correct one <body> I've the issue with a few pictures : the thumbnail isn't a smaller version of the picture but a total different picture. As you can see here :  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3bmrN.png" alt="screenshot"  As you can see, the thumbnail is mainly orange whereas the picture is a drop of water on grass... Any idea ?  <comment161825> I can see anything ? <comment161843> @Buscar웃 Sorry but I don't understand what you mean... <comment161846> can you magnify the icon <comment161854> @Buscar웃, well, this is a bad picture of me, so unless it's absolutely necessary, I prefer not to ;) <comment161856> ok, I trust you with the oranges :) so what software do you use to import photos, it was take by Nikon... <comment161866> @Buscar웃 I put the SD card in the mac then copy paste the pictures
