Lion: background of the login screen <body> I just updated to Lion and I'm wondering why the background of the locked screen (login screen) seem to be different everytime I look at it: it is either the grey texture, the default desktop background or a plain black background.  Why isn't it the same background all the time ?  <answer20652> If you are logging in fresh, it is grey linen.  If you are waking from sleep or display sleep without a screen saver enabled, it is the desktop background.  If you are waking from a screen saver, it is the screen saver itself.  Finally, if you are waking from display sleep or sleep after a screen saver has been ended by display sleep or sleep, it is a black background.  There does not appear to be a way to change this, but keep your eye on apps like Secrets.  If anyone's going to figure it out, it's them.  <comment22733> What do you mean "screen saver has finished" ? <comment22741> Sorry that wasn't clear.  I've edited the post. <comment67579> For me, sometimes its linen; other times its the galaxy background; and my desktop background is set to a solid grey color. No consistent behavior of the login background.
