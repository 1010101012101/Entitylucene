TextMate launch configuration <body> Is it possible to configure TextMate to launch the program I am currently writing (using the Command+R shortcut) with some command line parameters?  <answer156935> What language are you writing the program in? I'll use Python as an example.  Go to Bundles menu  Edit Bundles. Find and click on codePython/code in the lefthand column. Click on codeMenu Actions/code in the middle column, then codeRun Script/code in the righthand column.  At the bottom of the window you will see the script that is run each time you use kbdâŒ˜/kbd+kbdR/kbd. Look for the line that begins with codeTextMate::Executor.run/code.  Right now, it appears for me as this:  precodeTextMate::Executor.run(ENV["TM_PYTHON"] || "python", "-u", ENV["TM_FILEPATH"], :create_error_pipe =&gt; true, :use_hashbang =&gt; !ENV.has_key?('TM_PYTHON')) do |str, type| /code/pre  Change it to this:  precodeTextMate::Executor.run(ENV["TM_PYTHON"] || "python", "-u", ENV["TM_FILEPATH"], :create_error_pipe =&gt; true, :script_args =&gt; ["-arg1", "-arg2"], :use_hashbang =&gt; !ENV.has_key?('TM_PYTHON')) do |str, type| /code/pre  Note the addition of code:script_args =&gt; ["-arg1", "-arg2"]/code. Change the arguments in the parentheses to the arguments you want passed.  You can find other options to be used with codeTextMate::Executor.run/code in the source file on GitHub.
