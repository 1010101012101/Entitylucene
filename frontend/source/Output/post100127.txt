Search within opened file in Xcode without Apple keyboard <body> Is there a way to search within opened file (only!) in Xcode when I can not use Apple keyboard (because I am connecting remotely via LogMeIn from a PC)? I guess there was a search icon just above the text editor in Xcode 4.3 but I can not find it in 4.6.  <answer100131> One way to do this is to access the search function through the strongEdit/strong menu. Select strongEdit  Find  Find.../strong  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/S2ABZ.png" alt="enter image description here"  The search box will appear for the currently selected file:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fU3JL.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment117893> Can you elaborate on how an Apple keyboard affects it?
