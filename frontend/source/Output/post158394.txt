iMovie Help: Updating old iMovie Projects to Mac (10.9) <body> Hoping for some advice..   Our previous Mac died and our old iMovie files are now on an external drive. I have been looking around for threads on updating projects, but decided to try and ask here. I don't know exactly which version of iMovie they were created on, but file "info" says the projects were created in 2012. We now have iMovie 9. Couple of questions..   ol liI read that I might need (at least) iMovie 10 to successfully update old iMovie projects? Is that correct? /li liWould the projects be safely loaded? (Such as the effects &amp; sounds, etc.) Is there a way to make sure they'll remain intact? /li liWent to update my iMovie version and it prompted me to install iLife â€™11. Is that a good way to go??  /li /ol  I would love any advice on how to best do this! Really hoping our files can be saved.   Thanks in advance, :)br Lana
