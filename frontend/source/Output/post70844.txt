Change the shortcut of cmd+Q for all applications <body> I use kbdcmd/kbd+kbdtab/kbd, kbdcmd/kbd+kbdW/kbd, kbdcmd/kbd+kbdA/kbd a lot and I don't remember how many times I hit kbdcmd/kbd+kbdQ/kbd accidentally.  Is it possible to change the shortcut for quitting applications from kbdcmd/kbd+kbdQ/kbd to something else (not to disallow using keyboard to quit applications), ideally for applications all at once (not to do it for individual application one by one)?  <answer70864> Howtogeek devoted a whole article about this subject and they provided an excellent tutorial on how to do this. Basically it comes down to override the default function.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6z9Vi.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  strongBUT/strong there is a (huge) disadvantage, if you do it that way, you'll have to do this for EVERY application you use, which might work a bit confusing...br So they provide a work-around rather then a solid solution.  <answer70954> This should change the shortcut to ⇧⌘Q for most currently installed applications:  codedefaults write -g NSUserKeyEquivalents -dict-add $(mdfind kMDItemContentType==com.apple.application-bundle | grep -v { | sed 's/.*\//Quit /g;s/\.app$//g;'"s/'/\\''\\'/g;s/^/'/g;s/$/' '\$@q'/g" | uniq | tr '\n' ' ')/code  You could also use KeyRemap4MacBook to change ⌘Q to some other key combination or require holding or pressing it twice to quit an application.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YwPoj.png" alt=""  <comment82299> I thought changing it in the Keyboard section of System Preferences, under Keyboard Shortcuts might work, but it didn't here. Unless I need to reboot to see the change. <comment82381> My question mentions that "for applications all at once (not to do it for individual application one by one)".
