Window and Menu IDs <body> There's a tool on OS X, and I can't remember what it is for the life of me, that will display what the menu and window IDs are of a selected tab, window, or checkbox. Can anyone refresh my memory?!  <answer84551> Are you thinking of UIElementInspector ?  <comment97319> Are you thinking of [UI Browser](http://pfiddlesoft.com/uibrowser/) ? <comment97320> it's not UI Browser. exactly the same idea, but free and I think it comes in the Developer Tools <comment97352> The version that comes bundled with *Xcode* is called *Accessibility Inspector*.
