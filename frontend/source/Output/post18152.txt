Can i change the default Mac App Store install folder? <body> I prefer to have all applications installed per-user, to code~/Applications//code rather than globally. The default location for apps installed from the Mac App Store is the global applications folder located at code/Applications//code.  Is there a codedefaults write com.apple.AppStore/code command I can run in the terminal, or perhaps a code.plist/code file I can edit manually, to change this default preference?  <answer19434> Here is an option, while it is not exactly what you asked for, it will accomplish most of your goals:  ol liCreate a new folder at the root of your boot drive and name it PubApplications, duplicate the permissions of the Applications Folder./li liCopy (Option Drag) strongDon't Move/strong all applications that you want publicly accessible to that folder. /li liCopy strongDon't Move/strong the apps you want in your ~/Applications folder to that folder. /li liRename /Applications to /Applications.bak or /.Applications.bak if you want it hidden. /li liCreate a symlink in your root folder named Applications, pointing to the Applications folder in your home directory.  codeln -s /Users/your_name/Applications /Applications/code/li /ol  I am not sure who uses the computer besides you, and I am also not sure exactly what you are trying to accomplish, whether it is to streamline backups, or keep your apps private from others, or if this is simply where you like to install apps.  Note - the above above method will break things for other users if they exist. You could use:  precodeln -s ~/Applications /Applications /code/pre  instead of the previous symlink command, although I have had issues with that and you would need to ensure each user had a ~/Applications folder.  <answer19437> At this point there is no details on this (But I am sure there is a property or .plist) but in the meantime you can create a simple Automator "Folder Actions" workflow, that moves the apps to the folder of your choice. This is simple and mostly happens in the background.  One problem I see with this is how Updates work.   <answer19898> Regarding emMac OS X File System Overview/em, it seems Apple enforcing the standard compliance for developer to follow their rules on application folder which are within /Applications or ~/Applications. The concern is to comply the way Mac App Store deliver the updates.  if you not comfort enough to use default folder, yes you are still able to move the application which you had download from Mac App Store to another folder with two caveats:  ol liYou will be required to enter an administrative password to move the app from the /Applications folder./li liIf an update appears in the MAS for an installed app that has been moved you will get an error message about having apps installed     from another account. To update the app you will have to Delete the     app entirely and then install the updated app or Move the app back to the /Applications folder/li /ol  <answer19912> I usually move all my applications acquired from the MAS in a subfolder, e.g. codeApplications/Games/code or codeApplications/Utilities/code or whatever suits better.br As emwongacid/em said, you will be required an administrative password to perform the move.br I have already had several updates to my apps, so it seems updating moved applications works flawlessly, at least for programs kept within the codeApplications/code folder. I can not be sure about other locations, though.  <comment21704> Knowing why you do **not** prefer `/Applications` might generate some more creative answers â€¦ <comment21706> I offered the bounty because on our shared Mac at home I want the apps I download to only be available for my User. I want to install the apps in ~/Applications. <comment21822> I also want apps bought with my Apple ID only available to my user. Others who have accounts on a shared computer will fill /Applications with their apps and I'll fill it with mine, it's a pain to deal with one huge pile of apps. I like the separation. <comment21945> Plus this would/should/could allow people to use the App Store without System Administrator permissions: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/6065/do-i-need-to-have-system-administrator-permissions-to-install-from-the-mac-app-st <comment22369> I was hoping there was a solution for this but you've provided the best explanation and the annoyances of executing this customization. +50
