Console flooded with FileStatsAgent error <body> Approximately every 30 seconds my console spits out an error message like this:     6/10/16 11:43:34,611 FileStatsAgent[26676]: Failed to enumerate:   (null), error: Error Domain=NSCocoaErrorDomain Code=260 "The file   “Backup” couldn’t be opened because there is no such file."   UserInfo={NSURL=file:///Users/me/Library/Application%20Support/MobileSync/Backup/,   NSFilePath=/Users/me/Library/Application Support/MobileSync/Backup,   NSUnderlyingError=0x7fb17b416190 {Error Domain=NSPOSIXErrorDomain   Code=2 "No such file or directory"}}   And immediately after:     6/10/16 11:43:34,614 FileStatsAgent[26676]: Metadata.framework   [Error]: couldn't get the client port   The file "Backup" doesn't exist and neither does the "MobileSync" folder within "Application Support".  After some research I conclude it's something related to Spotlight. This Mac works a local server, so I turned off Spotlight but perhaps a related process remains running.  I can't see FileStatsAgent in Activity Monitor, so I would like to know  from this process is called and how to stop it and its persistent error messages.  <comment319287> Did you try the Spotlight fix at https://discussions.apple.com/thread/5537027?tstart=0 ? though with the first error being at MobileSync, I'm not sure that's it. MobileSync is for iPhone/iCloud backups etc afaik. Maybe try generating the expected file structure in App Support & see what happens
