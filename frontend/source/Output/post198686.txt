Are "Favorites" and edits synced with Photos for Mac/iOS? <body> I'm using the latest version of Photos on both of my iMacs, my iPhone, and two iPads.  I'm also using iCloud for storage and syncing.  So far - everything seems to work - when I take a photo on my iPhone, it shows up on all my Macs and devices.  However - what happens when I edit a photo in Photos on one of my iMacs? Does the edited photo show up on my other Mac and other devices? Also - if I "favorite" a photo in Photos - should that show up on my other devices?  <comment237860> so did you try it and what happened ?
