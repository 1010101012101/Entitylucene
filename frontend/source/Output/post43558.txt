Will the Logitech Bluetooth Keyboard Case "for ipad2" work with the new ipad? <body> I have an ipad2, and I have this keyboard case: http://www.logitech.com/en-us/1222/8213  Will the "new ipad" fit nicely into this case, physically? Or, if I get one of the new ipads, will I need to get a keyboard case specifically "for new ipad"?  <answer43562> Yes, it fits. I bought the iPad 2 case and it fits my third gen iPad...$20 cheaper too :)  The latest generation iPad is slightly thicker then the iPad 2.  The iPad "2" is 0.34" (8.6 mm) depthbr / The iPad "3" is 0.37" (9.4 mm) depth  Otherwise they are precisely the same width/height.  While I don't have the case/keyboard you mentioned, it looks like it emmay/em fit in there. If the case has a solid nook for the iPad to fit into, it likely will get (noticably) tighter - but it entirely depends on how much gap is provided. Obviously since the new iPad hasn't been physically sold yet, there wouldn't be a way to actually test - other then measure with something like a micrometer.  <answer44315> Answering my own question emfrom/em the new iPad at the Apple Store. Definitively yes.  <comment49493> Full disclosure, in case it isn't obvious: Part of the incentive behind this question is whether or not I would sell my ipad2 + keyboard-case as a package deal or not. <comment49500> Well, another factor is if there are buttons or ports in places on the ipad3 that aren't on the ipad2, which would interfere with a "snug fit". <comment49502> That is a great point. My understanding is that other then the depth, the external physics are the same (and according to this article - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad)
