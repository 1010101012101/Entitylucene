How can 3 different Apple Music users share the same Apple TV? (family or not family plan) <body> I have a 4th generation Apple TV, and listen to Apple Music on my watch (with bluetooth) and my iPhone.   I want to prevent anyone who uses the Apple TV from playing or saving music that changes my "For You" playlist on the TV. (this seems to be a curated list of songs that is based on my past listening history).  How can I separate users on a shared Apple TV?  ... or is Apple TV supposed to be used for a single person?   <answer276786> You can set up multiple Apple ID's on the Apple TV and have each user switch every time they use it.     strongHow to add multiple accounts to Apple TV/strong      Before you can use multiple accounts, you need to log into any and all   additional accounts you want available.
