How can I use Atom as the default editor for "open"? <body> I would like to set Atom as my default editor for codeopen/code.  In order to do this, I set in my code.bashrc/code:  precodeexport EDITOR="atom -nw" /code/pre  and reload the file with codesource .bashrc/code. Anyway, when I try to open a text file through codeopen filename/code, it always opens it with TextEdit.  I also tried variations of the above, such as codeexport EDITOR=atom/code, or exporting codeVISUAL/code.  I am sure that code.bashrc/code gets loaded on login.  What am I missing/doing wrong?  <answer140775> The codeopen/code command is part of OS X and uses Finder's default “Open With…” application to open the file, just like double-clicking it in Finder. code$EDITOR/code is used for things like codefc/code where it is used as the default command-line editor (a replacement for codevim/code or codeemacs/code).  To use Atom with the codeopen/code command, you can select a file of the type you want in Finder, press kbd⌘ command/kbd+kbdcodeI/code/kbd for “Get Info”, and then change “Open With:” to Atom, and click “Change All…”.  Alternatively you can define an alias like  precodealias e="atom -nw" /code/pre  in your code.bashrc/code and then run codee file-to-edit.txt/code whenever you want to edit a file in Atom.  <answer163674> Following this answer on Stackoverflow, the following command should work:  precodedefaults write com.apple.LaunchServices LSHandlers -array-add '{LSHandlerContentType=public.plain-text;LSHandlerRoleAll=com.github.atom;}' /code/pre  I am not sure how fare this works through. For me, codeopen /etc/hosts/code opened the file in Atom as expected, but codeopen demo.properties/code did not.  Edit: Might not work on Yosemite and above, see this answer for a modified version.   <answer228711> thee's answer doesn't work for Yosemite and El Capitan - use this one instead:  precodedefaults write com.apple.LaunchServices/com.apple.launchservices.secure LSHandlers -array-add '{LSHandlerContentType=public.plain-text;LSHandlerRoleAll=com.github.atom;}' /code/pre  <answer247086> Just right (or control) click a file of the type you want to change and:  "Get Info" - "Open with:" - (Select your program of choice) - "Change All"  You'll have to do this once for each extension (.txt, .rtf, etc.) you wish to update.  <answer270495> The actual answer is:  codeexport EDITOR="/Applications/Atom.app/Contents/MacOS/Atom -nw"/code  <comment165869> Thank you. I guess I will stick to opening  atom through the command line explicitly. <comment191671> demo.properties possibly is not registered as a text file <comment192013> Really nice hack, thank you! <comment279765> Didn't work for me
