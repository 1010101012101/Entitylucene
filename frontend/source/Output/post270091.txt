Reset/change Emoji color for human features <body> I inadvertently hit the wrong color for a human emoji.  Holding it down does nothing and I really need this particular emoji to be correct.  <answer271714> It's only a workaround, but one way to let you input the correct emoji in MacOS would be to go to this page, copy the emoji with the color you want, and set up a text replacement for it in system preferences/keyboard/text/replace with  In iOS you could do the same thing using its own text replacement setting.  <comment339400> What device are you using? Do you want to reset all of the emojis? Or just one? <comment355747> Is this for iOS or a Mac?
