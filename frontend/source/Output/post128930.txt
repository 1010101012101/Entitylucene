iMovie 10 Project Lost <body> I created a new iMovie 10 project and there was no option to associate it with an event when I created it, which there is when I create one now. I have not updated iMovie since I created the project. After working on the project for a day, I quit iMovie and opened it back up. The project was missing. How do I get it back?  <answer128931> I had the same problem and this fixed it. File == Update Projects and Events  <answer128932> Make sure that it shows nothing over here: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Dv2xp.png" alt="screenshot" under today's date or the title that you have given it. If there is indeed nothing, then try File  Update Projects and Events. If it still doesn't show up, then your only hope is that you have a time machine and that you backed it up.   Just asking, what version of iMovie are you using?  <comment150963> I have already done this and nothing works. I know that the files of the project that was lost were saved in the wrong place in the iMovie library and were unable to load after iMovie was quit. I am using iMovie 10.0.2
