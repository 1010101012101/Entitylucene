Does Mail.app send or can request read receipts? <body> I was wondering whether Mail.app is able to send read receipts (or maybe it does silently?) or create emails that require those?  I know such a feature is available in Outlook.  <answer38138> I tested this using Mail on Snow Leopard connected to Exchange 2005.  There is no ability to set a request to receive read receipts.  Reading an email sent from Outlook in Windows to mail on Snow Leopard with a read recipt requested, does not send a read receipt.  Lion may vary.  <answer168517> strongMail.app/strong can be told to ask for read receipts, you can use Mail Receipt to set up the required custom headers:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qQVXk.png" alt="Screen shot of Miln Mail Request"  h2How Read Receipts work/h2  To ask for a read receipt an additional header needs to be added to your outgoing e-mails. strongMail.app/strong supports custom headers through a default called codeUserHeaders/code.  When changing defaults, be sure to quit strongMail.app/strong before altering the default. Afterwards relaunch strongMail.app/strong and test any changes.  h2Setting a Read Receipt Header/h2  Customise and use the following strongTerminal.app/strong command to set a codeDisposition-Notification-To/code header:    precodedefaults write com.apple.mail UserHeaders '{"Disposition-Notification-To" = "YOUR NAME &lt;YOUR@EMAILADDRESS.COM&gt;"; }' /code/pre  h3Removing Custom Headers/h3  To stop asking for read receipts, delete the codeUserHeaders/code preferences with the command:  precodedefaults delete com.apple.mail UserHeaders /code/pre  <comment51046> I have tested with newer Exchange servers on Lion and it seems to be consistent across the range - Mail.app neither request nor sends back read receipts. <comment197821> However any other mail app can refuse to respond to the notification request so you cannot rely on it (e.g. I would always tun it off as I would only reply if I read it also I know of people with 100s unread email so receipt is not a useful criteria)
