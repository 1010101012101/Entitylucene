iTunes connect renewal will not allow iAd contract to complete because of a banking page bug! <body> So we've renewed our iTunes connect developer acccount. Now it says that all our APPS are on hold until we complete the iAd contract. So I try to do the bank bit (note that all our details have ALREADY been submitted) and I can't save to complete this step. It says you must change somthing. But I DO NOT WANT TO CHANGE THE BANK DETAILS. In the meantime, we are not selling APPs. What do we do!?  <answer122874> You seem to be able to make some progress, by adding another bank account. Presumably you can then switch back to the original bank account.  <answer122882> For a problem with accounting forms and it's not clear to you whether submitting paperwork would delay sales of your app, I would call Developer Support directly:  ul lihttps://developer.apple.com/contact//li /ul  Choose the strongEnrollment and Account/strong link and sign in to get your options.
