Can I turn the display off without putting the computer to sleep? <body> I use rMBP with the latest Mavericks 10.9.2.   I often download something in background, so I can't just press "poweroff" button, because these downloads stop working in sleep mode. However, I have checked "disable sleep mode when display is off" in energy saving settings.   How can I turn display off without putting system into sleep mode? I only found a way just to leave macbook and don't touch it, it turns off just as selected in energy saving settings.  <answer125509> You can use Hot Corners to put your display to sleep instantly. This article on OSXDaily walks through the steps, Quickly Sleep the Display in Mac OS X with a Hot Corner.  ol liLaunch System Preferences and click on “Mission Control”/li liClick on “Hot Corners…” in the lower left corner/li liSet the screen corners you want to use to “Put Display to Sleep”/li liClose out of System Preferences and test the Hot Corner by sliding your cursor into that screens corner/li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4CbRZ.png" alt="Hot Corners in OS X 10.9"  <answer125549> I believe you can also use the short cut CTRL + Shift + Eject. On a Retina MacBook Pro there is no eject key, if I recall you use the power button instead?   Someone correct me I'm wrong.  Also the lowest brightness setting turns the screen off (again, someone correct me I'm wrong).  <answer125573> If your keyboard has an eject or power key, you can press control-shift-eject or control-shift-power. control-shift-power only works in 10.8 and later though.  Another option in 10.9 and later is to run  precodepmset displaysleep now /code/pre  If your keyboard does not have an eject key or a power key, you can assign a shortcut to codepmset displaysleep now/code with for example Alfred:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/06amV.png" alt=""  Or use a private.xml like this with KeyRemap4MacBook:  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt; &lt;root&gt;   &lt;item&gt;     &lt;name&gt;control_shift_esc_to_display_sleep&lt;/name&gt;     &lt;identifier&gt;control_shift_esc_to_display_sleep&lt;/identifier&gt;     &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::ESCAPE, VK_CONTROL | VK_SHIFT | ModifierFlag::NONE, KeyCode::VK_CONSUMERKEY_EJECT, ModifierFlag::CONTROL_L | ModifierFlag::SHIFT_L&lt;/autogen&gt;   &lt;/item&gt; &lt;/root&gt; /code/pre  <answer206645> I used kbdShift ⇧/kbd + kbdControl ⌃/kbd + kbdPower/kbd button for putting my displays to sleep. Please check Mac keyboard shortcuts.  <comment146947> Substituting a power key for eject (with a retina MacBook Pro or a MacBook Air) does work but only in 10.8 and later. Setting the brightness to zero bars sets the brightness to maybe 1% on my MacBook Air and to maybe 10% on my iMac. <comment147587> @pknz does not look like it is turned of on lowest brightness but not far off. Usually the way I go. <comment166789> According to [Manual pages of pmset](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/pmset.1.html), it should be `pmset displaysleepnow`. <comment185209> You can get the displaysleepnow command to work in Mountain Lion by taking a copy of pmset file from Mavericks(/usr/bin/pmset), renaming it pmset2, and putting that in the /usr/bin of your Mountain Lion Mac. The call of course changes to "pmset2 displaysleepnow". I tried, but this trick will not work on OS  10.5 <comment258648> that did the job well.
