How to simulate slow internet connections on the mac <body> What's a good software solution to slow down internet connections on the mac for testing and simulations?  My primary need is when testing code in the iPhone / iOS simulator, so slowing down the connection for specific applications or processes would be great.  <answer24071> If you only need throttling for Web development, I can wholeheartedly recommend Charles. It's an excellent tool for debugging HTTP applications anyway, and among its many features, it's got a Throttle option. The software isn't cheap, but it does an excellent job.  <answer24078> Apple has made a very handy official tool to slow down the network connections on you Mac for testing purposes.  The strongNetwork Link Conditioner/strong preference is a free download from within Xcode (for Lion and later OS). Additionally, iOS has similar function accessible from within Xcode and iOS 6 or later.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jOUUI.png" alt="enter image description here"  Older versions of Xcode before version 4.3.2 embedded a copy of this tool. Now, you use Xcode to download it directly in a similar manner to the iOS simulators and developer documentation.  There are 11 built in profiles from a Lossy Edge network with 400ms delay to a cable modem. If you need other limits, you can create custom profiles with your own settings or you can also use codeipfw/code yourself as described in Craig Hockenberry's article slow ride, make it easy It also mentions the Speed Limit panel by Mike Schrag that is a smaller download than Xcode, but has fewer options than Apple's tool.   It slows down the entire network stack, so you can't throttle on a per app basis without doing things like install lion in a virtual machine and set that VM with a throttled stack.  <answer24079> Speed Limit is a System Preferences pane for intentionally and selectively slowing down specific ports and domains.  <answer24398> You can also use ipfw piping to slow down your network.  First, setup a virtual "pipe" to limit throughput to 800KBit/sec:  precodeipfw pipe 1 config bw 800Kbit /code/pre  Then you can setup rules to push traffic through that pipe (pipe 1). (ports 6881-6890 being bittorrent traffic)  precodeipfw add 10 pipe 1 tcp from any to me 6881-6890 ipfw add 11 pipe 1 tcp from any 6881-6890 to me /code/pre  Here's another example to limit traffic down to 10Kbit/sec from a specific IP address:  precodeipfw pipe 2 config bw 10Kbit ipfw add 15 pipe 2 ip from me to 64.81.84.114 /code/pre  supsub(Source)/sub/sup  <answer46378> OS X 10.9 and earlier provide codeipfw/code and it allows you to define custom firewall rules. Create a empipe with limited bandwidth/em using codeipfw/code and you can run your tests and simulations.  ol liCreate a pipe "1" limited to 500KBytes/s via  precodesudo ipfw pipe 1 config bw 500KByte/s /code/pre/li liGuide all network traffic of port 80 through pipe "1" using  precodesudo ipfw add 1 pipe 1 src-port 80 /code/pre/li liWhen you don't need the pipe anymore, remove it from the port using  precodesudo ipfw delete 1 /code/pre/li /ol  h3Other/h3  ul liIf you want to set higher traffic barriers, you can use codeMByte/s/code/li liPort code80/code: standard port for unencrypted codehttp/code traffic.

Go to https://developer.apple.com/downloads and search for "Network Link Conditioner" or "Hardware IO Tools for XCode", the latter being the name of the package it's found in.  To download it via Xcode 8.x:  ul liClick on the Xcode menu/li liGo to Open Developer Tool  More Developer Tools.../li liThis will open a page at developer.apple.com (Note: you may need to log in first)/li liClick on the '+' sign next to Additional Tools for Xcode 8.x/li liClick on the download URL/li /ul  <comment26904> I actually need it for the iPhone simulator.. and testing connections to a server <comment26947> :O I even have Xcode and didn't know about this <comment27239> Be sure to shut it off after you're done testing! <comment27509> I like that it's more granular than the XCode tool mentioned in the accepted answer. Thanks for the suggestion. <comment56340> Clarification: you actually have to download the hardware IO tools from Apple. See [Installing Apples Network Link Conditioner Tool](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9659382/installing-apples-network-link-conditioner-tool) <comment56527> Speed Limit mentioned below works **excellently**. I'm using it now for localhost:8888 on MAMP. <comment56528> Thanks, this works REALLY great for localhost. <comment69460> Absolutely ridiculous question but is this available for Snow Leopard?  I don't see the same menus in XCode to download sadly... *feeling very left out*  :( <comment69465> @longda - if you can get an older version of Xcode by nature of historical downloads from apple developer, this should be available on most hardware on OS 10.6 <comment83886> Also note that iOS 6 has the network link conditioner for testing on the device. Access it via Settings-Developer under the "Network Link Conditioner" section. <comment88476> Slowing down DNS resolution is a very bad way to simulate a slow internet connection. Not only do most routers cache DNS results, the system also caches these results so you would only be slowing the initial connection to a new computer - and not the traffic being sent back/forth once the simulation is up and running. <comment111470> Now I can experience a simulation of what StarCraft II is like over dial up! The lag in multiplayer leads me to believe that it's a common occurrence. <comment130006> seems like it's not working for localhost-type traffic. i see someone reported it worked when using localhost:8888 with MAMP, but i am connecting to a Windows VM over port 8888. <comment133855> Welcome to Ask Different!
