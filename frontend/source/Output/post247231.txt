Terminal won't find any file/directory with the suffix "~/." or "~/" <body> my terminal isn't capable of finding any file or directory if I type in the name of the file or directory which start with "~/." or "~/".   I have OS El Capitan, XCode 8 is installed, so is XCode Command Lines Tools.  Edit  As requested, this is the full command line I put( I tried several):  precode   cd ~/.bash_profile_common    cd ~/usr    cd ~/local    cd ~/bin  /code/pre  And finder doesn't seem to find them either.    After typing  precode   echo $HOME /code/pre  I get  precode   /Users/myname   /code/pre  <answer247233> code~/code (tilde) expands to the value of the variable codeHOME/code which is set by the process codelogin/code or to the value set in one of your shell's config files.   From the man pages:      strongHOME/strong - The home directory of the current user; the default argument for the cd builtin command. The value of this variable is also used when performing tilde expansion.      strongTilde Expansion/strong - If a word begins with an unquoted tilde character (`~'), all of the characters preceding  the first unquoted  slash (or all characters, if there is no unquoted slash) are considered a strongemtilde-prefix/em/strong. If none of the characters in the tilde-prefix are quoted, the characters in the tilde-prefix following the tilde are treated as a possible strongemlogin name/em/strong. If this login name is the null string, the tilde is replaced with the value of the shell parameter strongHOME/strong. If strongHOME/strong is unset, the home directory of the user executing the shell is substituted instead. Otherwise, the tilde-prefix is replaced with the home directory associated with the specified login name.   In your case (assuming you have not changed codeHOME/code), using code~/bin/code, code~/usr/code, code~/local/code is expanding them to code/Users/myname/bin/code, code/Users/myname/usr/code, code/Users/myname/local/code.  If what you want is in the root folder of your system, don't put the code~/code (leave just code//code at the front).   References: man page for bash/codeman bash/code  <answer247283> You can also find a good explanation of the standard Unix directory layout with codeman hier/code at the shell prompt.  <comment305048> I see my mistake. It now definitely works, thank you! But it is still unable to find the bash_profile_common file,what could I do! <comment305049> @Edward that is not a standard file. Did you create it? <comment305050> No, I never created. It was suggested that I should edit it, due to some compilation  problems. I assumed it would be created during the installation of the compiler. I think I will head towards stackoverflow forum and ask if it's normal that I am unable to find this file. <comment305052> Where was that suggestion - you are going to need to quote it for any chance that your question won't be closed on SO and even then I expect it his off topic there. <comment305107> @edward please ask a new question about the bash_profile_common thing. Be sure to include links etc to the instructions you are following. Or just use `~/.bash_profile` instead :-) <comment305117> @Edward bash and the finder will hide any file that begins with a '.' (unix conventions) use ls -a to list from the bash prompt
