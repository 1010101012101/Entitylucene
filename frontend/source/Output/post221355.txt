iTunes 12.2 keeps duplicating playlists <body> Greetings Mac Friends,  Assume a playlist named codeX/code exist in iTunes.br Assume I manually sync playlist codeX/code to my iPhone.    Then, I frequently observe iTunes now has playlist codeX/code and playlist codeX 1/code and sometimes even playlist codeX 2/code.    Sometimes Playlist codeX/code is identical to playlist codeX 1/code, sometimes playlist codeX 1/code is a subset of playlist codeX/code.  There is a relevant threads on discussions.apple, namely:  https://discussions.apple.com/thread/7110593  My questions:  (1) In playlist codeX/code in the top right corner there is a drop down that is selected as codeSongs/code while in playlist codeX 1/code the corresponding drop down is selected as codePlaylist/code. Why is the selection in the drop down different/is this some feature that I am misunderstanding as a bug?  (2) Can anyone vouch for the solution proposed by kalifornia in the apple discussion thread previously aforementioned.  (3) Any advice to help resolve this would be appreciated.  emDisclaimers/Notes/embr I personally don't use iTunes - I am just (unsuccessfully) helping someone out..  There is ~30GB of free space available on the phone.  Neither iTunes match or iCloud is enabled.  Automatic sync is disabled on all devices.
