Remove VIP mail box from sidebar in Mac Mail <body> I accidentally set one of my contacts to be a VIP in Mac Mail, it then added this folder in the image below into the sidebar, when i removed the VIP status of that contact the VIP folder still remained in the sidebar.. any idea how i can remove it ?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/AVnbV.png" alt="VIP MAC MAIL"  <answer98313> I found what worked was:  ol liRemove all VIP contacts/li liClose Mail/li liReboot the machine/li /ol  Upon reopening Mail, the VIP section in the sidebar is now gone.   UPDATE - At the time of writing this initial post i was running OSX 10.9.  <answer139174> The way in which to remove a favourite from Mail is simple, highlight the account, for instance if John Smith was a favourite, highlight their name, click on the little settings bar below, thats next to the new mailbox icon, and then click 'Remove from VIP's'.   <answer182741> Got this working in OS X 10.10, Yosemite:  ol liClose Mail.app./li liGo to code~/Library/Mail/V2/MailData//code./li liEdit codeVIPSenders.plist/code and remove all the senders./li liSave the file./li liSelect the file and press kbdCommand/kbd + kbdi/kbd to see information about the file./li liCheck emLocked/em under general info./li liReopen Mail.app./li /ol  <answer258330> What worked for me:  ol liGo to Library/Mail and (depending on your system, V2 or V3) one and find Data and then VPIs.plist and delete it./li liCreate a new mailbox and rename it whatever then simply select that dummy mailbox and quit Mail./li liReopen Mail and the VIPs mailbox should ne be there. Delete the dummy Mailbox./li /ol  <comment115394> Comment not answer because I am not sure if this will work, but can you not just drag the folder away? <comment115395> I tried that but it didnt work, found the answer though, once there a no contact in VIP if you close down your machine, reopen it and reopen mail.app the VIP goes <comment115396> Excellent - you can answer your own question with that (there may be a delay before it allows this) but it's worth including it when you are allowed. <comment352646> Not working on Sierra 10.12.4
