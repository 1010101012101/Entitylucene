Symlinking Fonts and Messages folders to 2nd HDD does not seem to work <body> h1Issue:/h1  After symlinking the codeFonts/code and codeMessages/code directories from code~/Library/code to a secondary encrypted harddrive, OSX does not recognize user fonts, and Messages does not display images/videos.  hr  h1Background/h1  I have a MBP with a small 64GB SSD, so I have symbolic links for most of the directories in codehome/code pointing to a secondary 500GB drive that is installed where the optical drive used to be.  Along with the codehome/code folders, I also created symbolic links for codeFonts/code, codeMail/code, and codeMessages/code in code~/Library/code. I have had success with Mail, but can't get the second two to work.  Specifically:  ul liUser fonts are not available in any application, and don't show up in Font Book. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2ni25.png" alt="Fonts are in directory, but not recognized by Font Book"/li liMessages seems to be able to access the actual text messages, but cannot load the images or videos that are sent or received. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gANNG.png" alt="Images do not appear in Messages app"/li /ul  hr  h1Troubleshooting/h1  I thought maybe it was a permissions issue, or that the links were broken, but it looks alright to me:  precode$: ls -l ~/Library/{Fonts,Mail,Messages}  lrwxr-xr-x 1 coffeecola staff 34 Nov 16 14:44 /Users/coffeecola/Library/Fonts -&gt; /Volumes/2nd_HDD/lib_items/Fonts lrwxr-xr-x 1 coffeecola staff  33 Nov 16 14:21 /Users/coffeecola/Library/Mail -&gt; /Volumes/2nd_HDD/lib_items/Mail lrwxr-xr-x 1 coffeecola staff  37 Nov 16 11:53 /Users/coffeecola/Library/Messages -&gt; /Volumes/2nd_HDD/lib_items/Messages   $ ls -l /Volumes/2nd_HDD/lib_items/  drwxr-xr-x 22 coffeecola staff 748 Nov 16 15:32 Fonts drwxr-xr-x  4 coffeecola staff 136 Nov 16 14:18 Mail drwx------  7 coffeecola staff 238 Nov 24 20:32 Messages /code/pre  I haven't run in to any issues with the other symbolic links, so I am a little perplexed as to why this isn't working for these two folders.  I am not sure if it is relevant, but both the boot drive and the secondary drive are encrypted.  Can anyone think of a why this might be happening?  (Also, should this be divided into two questions?)
