Selectively restore from a time machine backup created on snow leopard to a different machine running mountain lion <body> I have a current time machine backup on USB from an older machine running snow leopard 10.6. How can I selectively restore applications and data from this time machine disk to a new mac running Mountain Lion 10.8?  <answer65654> You can just copy folders and files from code/Volumes/*/Backups.backupdb//code normally. Finder and codecp/code don't preserve hard links.  <comment77481> Also found that I need to use `vsdbutil` from http://superuser.com/a/276526/4324 to resolve permission issues
