Deleted drafts trying to fix iPhone email app crashing <body> I had the issue where launching the mail app (default) crashes it after a second or two. I removed and readded my email accounts. The problem was kit fixed, but all my draft outlook emails are gone (Comcast one's still there). Then I put the phone on airplane mode to remove a pending outbound email (short video clip). That fixed the original problem but my drafts are missing. Amy way to recover them? Thanks for any help!
