How do you stop iPhoto/Aperture launching when you sync an iPad? <body> How do you stop iPhoto/Aperture launching when you sync an iPad?  <answer2684> Open Image Capture, connect the iPad, select it when it appears in the list on the left.  On the lower left will be a selector for what app to open when it connects, you can pick None.  <answer2686> http://www.tech-recipes.com/rx/4183/how-to-prevent-iphoto-09-from-opening-when-camera-is-connected/  These are the directions for blocking iPhoto.    <comment2368> FWIW, I've never had iPhoto launch when I sync my iPad. <comment2403> I knew this from previous OS versions but when I searched for Image Capture I couldn't find it so I assumed it had been removed. I searched for "imagecapture" :(
