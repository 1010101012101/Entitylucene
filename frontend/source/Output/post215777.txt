How to prevent iOS from dimming or changing the screen brightness <body> I have the "Display &amp; Brightness" feature of iOS disabled, and yet the device still dims to a brightness level that is unreadable after about 10secs of inactivity.. How do I turn this off?  <answer215785> iOS dims the display just before the Auto-Lock period.  You can set this period in Settings → General → Auto-Lock.  However, if Settings → Battery → Low Power Mode is set to on, the regular auto-lock setting is disregarded.   <answer287053> You can't. I have my autolock set on after 5 minutes and it auto dims the screen after about a minute, unless I'm watching a video. But if my phone is plugged in, I don't have a problem with the screen dimming.  <comment260788> No probs! The very short amount of time that @erikvold mentioned made me suspect that low power mode might be the culprit - it sets the auto lock to 30 seconds.
