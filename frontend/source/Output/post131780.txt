How to reset trackpad after pinch to zoom stops working <body> It seems like whenever I use a device that's not made by Apple (USB mouse, bluetooth speakers) invariably the pinch to zoom and rotate features on the Magic Trackpad will stop working after awhile in all apps. I tried to disconnect and re pair trackpad, disable and enable the features in settings, close all apps. The only thing that will make pinch to zoom come back is resetting the computer.  Is there any other way (terminal, etc) to make the trackpad work correctly without resetting the computer? I really dislike ruining my uptime.  This is on a recent iMac with Magic Mouse, Wireless Keyboard and Magic Trackpad on OS X 10.9.3.
