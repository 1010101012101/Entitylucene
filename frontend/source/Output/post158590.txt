My MacBook Pro periodically displays ads in a banner on the top right that says "Breaking Apple News" <body> I have OSX 10.9.5.  It seems to happen once or twice within a few minutes after I come out of sleep.  A smallish banner on the top right kind of slides in place.  It's always text that starts with "Breaking Apple News" and then it advertises something.  Is this Malware, or did Apple really stoop to this level?  If it's really Apple SW doing this, is it at least optional to disable it?  I paid for my MacBook Pro.  I don't think slide in ads are appropriate here.  <answer158603> You may have accidentally allowed a website to send you push notifications. If you use Safari, go into Preferences  Notifications, and see if you've allowed any sites to give you notifications.  <comment188061> Well I did indeed have a push notification allowed according to this menu.  It had a little icon that looked like the same one that keeps appearing in these ads.  I gave you an up vote because your hypothesis is helpful whether or not is solves my problem.  In a day or 2 if no more ads appear I'll give you the check mark as well.  ;)
