Why does my iMac have one name under sharing, but then say 'new-host3.home' as well? <body> In Sharing, my iMac is called 'iMac Quad'. But right below it, its now saying new-host-3.home as well.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Fgod6.png" alt="sharing"  This also appears that it would then be on two domains - .local and .home.   How do I correct this? If I change the computer name, it won't change this.   <answer45487> Unfortunately the computer name and host name can get out of sync.  Open a terminal window and use  precodesudo hostname &lt;new hostname&gt; /code/pre  to change the hostname.  Once executed, it changes the system configuration, so the new hostname will be there when you reboot.  Also, be aware that some DHCP servers will assign a hostname.  Depending on the network you attach to and the DHCP server configuration you may have to work with the network administrator if you need to use a different hostname.  You don't have to worry about this for most consumer grade routers.  <comment51832> This is on a home computer, with a Verizon FiOS router and then an Airport Extreme. I am familiar with hostname, just trying to find out how to trace what happened here. <comment51835> @jmlumpkin I haven't figured out the sequence of events that occurs that causes them to diverge.  They are used for different things, so while OS X seems to make an effort to keep them the same, it doesn't force them to be the same, and I suppose there are situations where one might want them to diverge. <comment52274> I finally got a chance to do this. I think part of the hostname was due to some network changes I was doing to test Find My Mac. And then I found the config in my router for the domain.
