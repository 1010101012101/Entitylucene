How to exit Assembler back to Applesoft Basic on Apple II GS <body> When writing in Applesoft Basic on my Apple II GS, a crashed program occasionally dumps me not at the Applesoft Basic prompt (code]/code), but at the assembler prompt instead (code*/code). How can I get out of the Assembler and back to Basic (no pun intended)?  <answer37547> Type code3D0G/code at the assembler prompt. This will cause the computer to goto/execute the instructions starting at memory address 3D0 Hex/976 decimal, which is the address for the Applesoft Basic interpreter.  <answer38305> You can just type Ctrl-C.  (Or Ctrl-B if you don't care about wiping any Applesoft program in memory. Also, "" is the Integer Basic prompt. The monitor prompt is "*".)  <comment43392> 'Doh. You're right. Editing. <comment44122> Um, Daniel, I may be wrong, but isn't it called the Apple II GS? [Wiki article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_IIGS) <comment44124> Apple had various ways of rendering the Roman numeral two in stylized ASCII... the boot screen, the case of its various products, etc. // and ][ were both used in place of II. <comment44126> Ok. When writing the tag wiki, I saw Apple IIGS, so was wondering... <comment164731> This only works if you have DOS or ProDOS loaded.  Nick Westgate's answer above works without DOS.
