Mac OSX microphone input volume level auto-adjusts - can it be disabled? <body> I've found this issue and various discussions online about this, but no obvious "just do this", so I'm wandering over here from ServerFault to ask this.  Is there a way to disable or hard-set the input level on a mic?  In the codeSound/code preferences on the codeInput/code tab if I click on the device and set a level and then start talking it picks up the sound and then start to auto-adjust the mic input level.  This causes issues when talking with someone on Lync/Skype/etc because one minute the sound is fine and then if you raise your voice for a second and then lower it back down (or shift around in your chair) the auto-adjust causes the other party to think your whispering or yelling.  I'd like to be able to disable the auto-adjust if possible.  Yes/No?   NOTE: The issue is emsimilar/em this one: iMac OSX 10.8.4 Volume adjusts by itself but rather on the input side and not the output side for me.  <answer97819> Skype has a Microphone adjustment in Preference Audio Video.  There you can disable the Auto setting.  I do not know about Lync.  <answer100149> Turns out that the auto-adjusting mic level was not MacOS, but rather Skype (Version 6.6.0.467).  There is a check box in Skype Preferences to enable/disable it, and once I turned it off the level stays where I set it.  The problem is that, apparently, Skype's notion of auto adjusting the mic volume is simply to crank it up to max, no matter what -- even when no call is active.  At around 90% the mic starts picking up background noise, probably the Mac disk or fan, and by 100% that background noise is overwhelming.  I found that on my MacBook Pro (c. 2008) the mic level at about 75% was good, and I also found it helpful to check the "Use ambient noise reduction" check box (just below the mic level slider in the System Preferences/Audio).  <answer101612> Found the file for Google Talk/Hangouts in code~/Library/Preferences/com.google.GoogleTalkPluginD.plist/code.  Edit the file with a preference editor (Xcode, TextWrangler, Pref Setter, etc.) and change the codeaudio-flags/code setting to code0/code.  Seems to be a per-application setting.  I just tried this out on my 2011 Mac with OS X 10.8.4 and it worked. It's been driving me crazy for 2 years.  <answer151634> You can set it via the command line:  precodeosascript -e "set volume input volume 100" /code/pre  I have found that OSX Polycom RealPresence Desktop has a similar annoying "feature" that adjusts the mic input volume down, but never back up.  My workaround is to have this line in my crontab:  precode# Check every minute for mic input &lt; 100%; if it is, dial it up elegantly * * * * * while (( `osascript -e "input volume of (get volume settings)"` &lt; 100 )); do osascript -e "set volume input volume (input volume of (get volume settings) + 3)"; sleep 0.1; done; /code/pre  The loops just makes the slider "slide" up over a second or so, rather then a hard volume jump.  <answer224177> I figured it out! I called Mac support and they had me start my computer while pressing kbdCmd/kbd + kbdOpt/kbd + kbdP/kbd + kbdR/kbd and it resets some things that fixes the problem. Hope this works for everyone like it did for me!  <answer230073> strongMacOS itself doesn't have auto-adjust option for mic, so there applications which are doing this./strong You need to check, which applications, which potentially are working with camera/mic have this auto-adjust option and to turn it off.  I found that it's some glitch in Skype, which appears from time to time. strongTo disable automatic gain control for mic in Skype you need/strong:  ul liClick codeTools/code at the top of Skype window/li liSelect codeOptions/code/li liselect codeAudio Settings/code/li liUnder codeMicrophone/code, uncheck codeAutomatically adjust Microphone settings/code/li /ul  There's also the option to strongdisable it manually in the config/strong:  ol liQuit all the instances of Skype/li liGo to skype directory, or in terminal execute the command:  code$ cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/Skype//code/li liOpen the file called codeshared.xml/code for editing, full path to the file is  code~/Library/Application\ Support/Skype/shared.xml/code/li liSearch for the line code&lt;VoiceEng&gt;/code and extend that file like this:  code&lt;VoiceEng&gt;     &lt;AGC&gt;0&lt;/AGC&gt; ... &lt;/VoiceEng&gt;/code   there could be some extra lines like code&lt;MicVolume../code, etc, leave them there, no changes.

Enjoy! /li /ol  <answer236425> For me the problem application is Citrix GoToMeeting, which I have to use for work. I'm using a variation of @thetoolman's solution to emlower/em the volume to 49 - 50 every second (no cron job, I just start this whenever I have a meeting):  precodewhile true ; do     while (( `osascript -e "input volume of (get volume settings)"` &gt; 50 )); do         osascript -e "set volume input volume (input volume of (get volume settings) - 2)";         sleep 0.01;     done;     sleep 1; done;  /code/pre  <comment114791> Nothing like that in Lync and Skype isn't installed.  Problem is that it affects not only the input mic on the mac but also Parallels.  I keep thinking it is an OS setting, but nothing definitive yet. <comment114794> We are talking about the build in mic ? <comment114795> It's a Mac Pro...so no built-in mic (except line in)...it's the external Apple monitor with a bult-in Mic (shows up on Sounds as External Mic USB) <comment184494> That was the issue for me as well. The odd thing was that I was using GoToMeeting at time. This seems to happen in the background whether you're on a call or not. <comment292896> This was happening w/ Zoom as well.  Once I cleared the flag it was fine and stayed in one spot.
