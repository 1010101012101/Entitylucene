Creating a Installpackage for mac <body> I have a lot of Programms that i always need to install to a new mac. I wanted to simplify this process through an installpackage. I allready tried Iceberg with some success but have a specific error. What i want to do with iceberg is to unpack all the packages and start a script to install it and delete the packages after. I can make a package that unpacks the packages in my destination but the iceberg Programm wont execute the script i add in postinstall. the script itself works fine when i use it through terminal. the Script i am using is  precode##!/usr/bin/env bash sudo installer -pkg /Library/Virtualbox.pkg -target / /code/pre  iceberg packs the script in the programm but never uses it.  <answer239327> There is an error in the codepostinstall/code script. The first line should contain only one hash (#):  precode#!/usr/bin/env bash /code/pre  If the code.pkg/code works with codeinstaller/code and strongInstaller.app/strong, then it is a correct package. All other tools are made by third parties and may not support the latest codepkg/code formats and features.  h2Lacking Permission?/h2  Using codesudo/code in your package script may cause the script to pause forever or instantly fail. How will the codesudo/code command interact with the user to get the super user's credentials?  Remove codesudo/code and make your script test for permission to install before continuing, otherwise print an error and exit:  precodeif [[ $EUID -ne 0 ]]; then   echo "You must be a root to run this script" 2&gt;&amp;1   exit 1 fi /code/pre  It is the responsibility of codeinstaller/code to gain the appropriate authorisation rights and run the package's scripts using those rights. Within your package, specify that it needs administrator rights to ensure this happens.  h2Logs and Errors/h2  Use the codeverbose/code flag with codeinstaller/code to see each step of the installation process and to see errors:  precodesudo installer -verbose -pkg /Library/Virtualbox.pkg -target / /code/pre  h2Apple Package Tools/h2  Installer packages on OS X are typically built with the tools codepkgbuild/code and codeproductbuild/code. These two Apple tools support pre and post scripts; see the code--scripts/code flag.  h1AutoPkg/h1  Mac system administrators often use the open source codeautopkg/code tool to create packages:     AutoPkg is an automation framework for OS X software packaging and distribution, oriented towards the tasks one would normally perform manually to prepare third-party software for mass deployment to managed clients.   You may find AutoPkg is a better approach to simplifying the setting up of new Macs.  <comment293675> will do, thank you for the hint <comment293767> even with the changes to the code still dosent work. Iceberg wont execute it in postinstall <comment293772> What output or error do you see when using the `-verbose` flag with `installer`? Try `sudo installer -verbose -pkg /Library/Virtualbox.pkg -target /` <comment293773> there is no error. if i use installer in terminal in does what it is made to do. my problem is that iceberg or packages or Packagemaker dont execute the script in postinstall. <comment293774> PackageMaker is no longer supported by Apple; only `Installer.app` and `installer` are supported by Apple on OS X. <comment293775> but Iceberg and packages are still supportet? <comment293776> [Iceberg](http://s.sudre.free.fr/Software/Iceberg.html) is a third party product and I am not sure what packages is. Apple's developer tools now only include `productbuild` and `pkgbuild`. I have expanded my answer. <comment293821> but as far as i learned about autopkg is that it is an deployment tool and not a pkg genarating tool. I need to bundle all the pkg and app files to a pkg an execute it from a stick for example. Am I right about autopkg or am i just too stupid to find the right code to do so <comment293835> AutoPkg is very capable but may be too much for your needs. See https://github.com/autopkg/autopkg/wiki/Getting-Started to get started. <comment293983> do i need to install autopkg or git on a new mac to use a recipe. If so than no matter how good i will write the recipe the whole thing is useless to me. What I need is a prepackaged bundle that works even without an Internetconnection.
