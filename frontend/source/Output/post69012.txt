How to download youtube videos in Safari? <body> I am looking for free alternatives to download youtube videos in Safari.  <answer69014> You can try Save Tube.  It is Java based and it is safe (see here for more deatails)  <answer69022> There are a few extensions that will add a nice download button to the Youtube video page, and give you the option to download in various resolutions.  ul liYoutube Video Downloader/li liFastesttube/li liYouTubeDownloader/li /ul  You can also try ClickToPlugin, which does a lot more than just offer a download link, but it does that, and it's one of my favourite extensions. Makes watching web video much nicer.  <answer69029> Although not a safari plugin, a good alternative is the youtube-dl python script which works everywhere.   It can be downloaded on this github page.  If you want to use this directly from Safari then you could create a Service like this with automator (the path to the python script should be modified accordingly)  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HnefI.png" alt="Automator script to download selected YouTube URL"  With this service you can select a URL in Safari (for example in the address bar) and access it from the right click menu or the Services menu.
