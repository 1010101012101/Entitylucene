Can't connect to internet with cellular data after resetting settings on iPhone 4 <body> I'm using iPhone 4. Recently I have reset my iPhone settings. After that the cellular data doesn't work and I cannot connect to the internet at all although it shows 3G. Before I reset the settings, it worked well.  I have tried to reset the network setting but it doesn't work any better. Internet connection works well using wifi. Any ideas how to fix this?  <comment205171> What carrier do you have? Do you have access to the APN settings (`Settings app`  `Cellular`  `Cellular Data Network`)? It sounds like your data settings got reset when you reset your phone. <comment205237> My provider always automatically sends a 'service update' of some sort [been a while, don't remember what it's titled] if I ever reset a phone. Maybe give them a ring, see if they'll send one through.
