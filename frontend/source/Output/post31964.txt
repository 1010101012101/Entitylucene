Resetting user permissions to their default mode <body> I'm on Mac OS X 10.7.2 with a serious permissions issue that affects most items in my Documents folder, which now require my password for modifications like renaming. The concerned files and folders also seem hidden from Spotlight and therefore do not show up in searches. Both issues are seriously problematic for everyday use.  This is what codels -l/code gives me for folders:  precodedrwxr-xr-x  109 fr  staff  3706 Nov 22 14:43 Notes drwxr-xr-x+  16 fr  staff   544 Nov 22 14:51 Bibliography /code/pre  While the codeNotes/code folder is showing fine in searches and allows for password-free renaming, the codeBibliography/code folder does not. My understanding is that the code+/code sign indicates what is wrong here.  strongEdit:/strong tentative solution below, by removing all ACLs.  <answer31973> Here's the tentative solution I have found to my own problem:  ul liprint initial state: codels -l/code/li liremove ACL permissions: codechmod -R -N /Users/fr//code/li liequalize all permissions: codechmod -R 755 /Users/fr//code/li lirebuild Spotlight index: codesudo mdutil -E //code/li liprint new state: codels -l/code/li /ul  The code-N/code option, which is well hidden in the codeman chmod/code documentation but mentioned here, removes the code+/code sign that indicate ACLs, just like code@/code indicates a hidden file extension or a custom icon (as far as I can tell). Using Repair Utilities on ACLs should have done that but did not.  By using codechmod/code with the code755/code mode, I lost all custom permissions in the process, but did not need any. Rebuilding the Spotlight index then guarantees that all files get properly indexed. That solution worked, through without explaining how the initial problem emerged.  <answer37874> If I understand your question correctly, you're attempting to reset the permissions on a user's home directory. This is easily accomplished by resetting ACLs on the desired home directly by using the strongReset Password Utility/strong in the Recovery Partition:  ol listrongRestart/strong your computer from the recovery partition (if running Lion) or the gray disk (if not running Lion). /li liOpen strongDisk Utility/strong and run a permissions repair on your startup volume. After this is complete, close Disk Utility. We're doing this just for good measure./li liOpen strongTerminal/strong from the Utilities menu. Type in coderesetpassword/code and select your user account (NOT System Administrator/root) from the drop down menu. /li liClick the strongReset/strong button at the bottom of the window in the Reset home folder permissions and ACLs section. /li listrongQuit/strong the Password Utility and go back to the main recovery screen. /li liOn your keyboard, hit kbd&#8984;/kbd + kbdQ/kbd and restart your computer. It's emvery/em important that you don't hold down the power button to exit the recovery session, or the ACL reset won't occur./li /ol  Good luck!  <comment36647> For renaming the permissions that matter are the directory ones and not the files - so what does ls -l give in the directory above <comment36648> I have copied the `ls -l` information for two folders under "Problem with folders". DO you need a different listing? <comment43630> It went alright with the solution I posted above because I have a preference for a method without restarting. My remaining issue is that I still don't understand how I generated the issue in the first place. I previously had two user sessions and transfered files between them through the Public folder. Errors seem to have occurred at several points when doing so.
