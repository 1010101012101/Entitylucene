How do I make messages on iPad stop interrupting my music <body> I use messages on my mac and enable it on my ipad as well. When I play music (spotify) on ipad, it keeps getting interrupted by the iMessage. The interruption is the dimming of the sound. This is very annoying. How do I stop that?  Note that I don't want to stop imessage from coming in. But on the iPhone, when the phone is on silent and I am playing music, new messages don't disturb my music. I want that same functionality with the iPad.  Thanks.  <answer84677> You do this by turning the iPad onto silent in a similar manner to iPhone. The difference is the side switch is configurable on iPad.  If you have the side switch set to "Lock Rotation" then:  ol liDouble tap the home button./li liSwipe right./li liTap the sound icon to mute the device./li /ol  If you have the side switch set to "Mute" then:  ol liToggle the side switch like you do on iPhone./li /ol  You can change the side switch configuration in Settings.app - General.
