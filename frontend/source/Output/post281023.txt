Why does my Apple Music app delete my music immediately after I downloaded it? <body> I'm having this problem where Apple Music app on my ZTE Blade S7 Android phone is deleting the music immediately after I click on the download button.  I do not have this problem on my Macbook Pro iTunes software, only Apple Music on my Android phone.
