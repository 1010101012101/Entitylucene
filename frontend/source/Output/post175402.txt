Record click action and replay via command line? <body> Every few minutes I need to click a button on Yosemite's menu bar and select an option. I'd like to automate this task by somehow recording this action and scheduling it to execute via cron / command line.  I've tried creating an Automator workflow using the "Watch Me Do" feature, but although it executes fine inside Automator, when I run codeautomator myclicks.workflow/code in the Terminal, it gives me this cryptic error message:  codeThe action encountered an error./code  How can I get automator action to work?  <answer201717> So this might be an Accessibility issue. I was able to resolve it by going to System PreferencesSecurity &amp; PrivacyAccessibility and then making sure Terminal had a check in the checkbox under Privacy.   This link does a great job of explaining it. Automator in Terminal  And by the way console can be very useful in getting meaningful error messages.   Hope this helped.  <comment206794> Welcome. I've edited this to have one question. If you want to ask a second question about [tag:software-recommendations] feel free to link here and explain you want an alternative to Automator. Also, please edit this to show the "cryptic" error message or upload a link to the photo (imgur works well) <comment206798> Not sure how much help can be given without seeing the actual myclicks.workflow file, however do you get any more helpful output if you run with debugging enabled? E.g.:  `automator -debug myclicks.workflow` <comment206840> @user3439894 the -debug didn't return anything meaningful, thanks anyway
