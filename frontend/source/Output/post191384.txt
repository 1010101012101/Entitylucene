Is it possible to chat with a Facebook group using a desktop app on macOS? <body> I would like to chat with my groups on Facebook using a desktop app.  So far I've tried:  ol liAdium, it is quite nice, but it doesn't support group conversations./li liNative Messages app doesn't seem to support the Facebook group chat as well./li /ol  Is there any way to configure these or any other free applications so that I can chat on my group conversation?  I'm looking for any solution. I'd prefer to use Messages.app but if it is not possible, I'd like to know if there is any other app that can handle group conversations from Facebook.  <answer191405> I have not used it, but Current for Facebook claims to support group chats.  <answer203229> Messenger for Facebook does it.  Its an application in the Appstore.    https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/messenger-for-facebook-chat/id1009179228?mt=12  <answer262776> The Goofy app is an awesome solution. The app is a simple wrapper of the messenger.com website.  I really enjoy using it. This is what I was looking for.  The source code is available here on GitHub: https://github.com/danielbuechele/goofy.  <comment227286> Your title and body seem contradictory on what you're looking for in an answer? Are you looking for a [tag:software-recommendation] (which the body would suggest but you haven't tagged as such) for software that will allow this, or software that will integrate Facebook group chat with Messages.app, or just a first-party solution in OS X? <comment227287> @grgarside, I'm looking for any solution. I'd prefer to use Messages.app but if it is not possible, I'd like to know if there is any other app that can handle group conversations from Facebook. <comment227506> To be fair, it's $3. <comment312585> This app is no longer available.
