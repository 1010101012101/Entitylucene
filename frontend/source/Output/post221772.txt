Help me to understand this /Users/username/sites/website1 <body> Can anyone help me to understand the logic behind placing my /sites folder like this strong/Users/username/sites/website1/strong How do I find the Users folder? I am using OS X El Capitan Thank you  <answer221774> The folder em/Users/em usually is in the root of your boot volume. The folder em/Users/em usually contains all user folders of the (non-system) accounts configured in OS X and a emShared/em folder. The name of a user folder usually is identical with the short name of the user account.  To see/access em/Users/em either open your boot volume or bring emFinder/em to the foreground and in the menubar navigate to strongGo To/strong - strongGo To Folder.../strong, enter code//code and hit the OK button (then you will see the folder emUsers/em) or enter code/Users/code and hit the OK button (then you will see the content of the folder emUsers/em).  In strong/Users/username/sites/website1/strong emusername/em is just a place holder for your (OS X) short name. So in em/Users/em open the folder with your OS X short name (your user or home folder is also indicated by its icon: a little house) and you are in your user folder.  To immediately jump into your user folder use the shortcut kbdshift/kbdkbdcmd/kbdkbdH/kbd in the Finder.  <answer221852> There are several ways to navigate to folders in the Finder.  h2Method 1: Navigate to the folder/h2  Open a new Finder window and use kbdCmd/kbd+kbdUp/kbd arrow key to move up until you get to a common parent folder of the folder you want to find (so you will get all the way up to the computer). Then find the folder you want.  h2Method 2: Go to folder/h2  Press kbdShift/kbd+kbdCmd/kbd+kbdG/kbd or click Go menu  Go to folder... and enter the path to the folder you want. Press Go. You will automatically be brought to that folder. For the Users folder, enter  precode/Users /code/pre  Note that it isn't case sensitive. You can also press kbdTab/kbd to autocomplete folder names. If you have a folder at the path code~/Documents/MyFolderName/code you can type code~/Documents/MyFol/code and press kbdTab/kbd and the first folder that starts with codeMyFol/code (in alphabetical order) will be autocompleted.  h2Method 3: Common shortcuts/h2  This isn't available for code/Users/code, but it's useful to know. In the Go menu, there are various folders that you can quickly access. You can press kbdShift/kbd+kbdCmd/kbd+kbdH/kbd to go to your Home folder and press kbdCmd/kbd+kbdUp/kbd to get to code/Users/code because your home folder is code/Users/username/code.  <comment268602> You have 2 questions: "why is `/sites` in my home folder" and "how do I find `Users` folder". Which is the problem you are having? <comment268607> Hello. My question is how do I find my Users folder. I think I have the set up correct. My sites folder within the Home Name folder that I find under All My Files. So I guess I have it right. <comment268608> Sigh... I just realized I have two Sites folders. I want to place the one that has my website folders into my /user directory and get rid of the one I have there. I guess it's just a matter of overwriting the original one there. How do I find my /user folder? Thanks. <comment268609> Does this render the original question moot?
