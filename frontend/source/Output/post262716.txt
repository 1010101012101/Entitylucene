Safari crashes when I open it <body> After restarting my MacBook, I want to open Safari. Safari asks me if I want re-open my windows or just restart Safari.  Whatever I do, Safari crashes and i can't open it.  I have tried to create a new session in my MacBook, and in this session Safari works.  I've been looking for the "com.apple.safari.plist" file but i can not find it...  I have checked and repaired my partitions in Disk Utility and tried to clean everything with Onyx, but nothing works.  My Macbook Pro is running on MacOS 10.10.5 version.  Any ideas ?   <answer262785> Launch Safari with kbdSHIFT/KBD held down. This is a kind of Safari "Safe Mode."  If that works you can then clear caches, change home pages and delete extensions.
