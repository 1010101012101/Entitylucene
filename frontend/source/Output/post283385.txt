macOS Sierra - VNC Logs IP Address <body> I'm looking for attempts from someone that accessed one of my MACs on a previous day. I have remote management running and allow VNC access. I see the attempts they made, but there's no IP address logged. strongWhere can I see this?/strong  Example log from my console system.log.0 (backed up last day). Also, I don't have a secure.log.  I have tons of these logs from when they were connected:  (com.apple.screensharing[2323232]): Endpoint has been activated through legacy launch (3) API's  There is no other logged info.  All else, I just want to know what IPs were connected to my Mac during a specific timeframe. Is there any other log or info in macOS Sierra I could harvest for this.   <comment362708> I'm not sure if you've found any solutions, but I've began combing through this https://www.mac4n6.com/blog/2016/11/13/new-macos-sierra-1012-forensic-artifacts-introducing-unified-logging but haven't had the time to figure out how to log / monitor VNC connections
