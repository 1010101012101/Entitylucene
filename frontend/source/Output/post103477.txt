Is there a clever way import my Mail.app rules to iCloud? <body> I have a lot of rules in my Mail.app but when my computer is off my inbox fills up with junk and it's hard to read from the phone. I want to set up the rules on iCloud but don't see a way of uploading/importing them into iCloud. Am I missing something or do I need to set them up again manually?  <answer103615> Try this. Go to iCloud.com and log in.   Select mail.  On the bottom left of the window, there is a cog:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/V1Y6N.png" alt="enter image description here"  Select that, and then Rules:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hAhUh.png" alt="enter image description here"  Finally, a window opens, and you can choose to sync Rules, or add specific rules just for iCloud.com (I think that's right.. not totally sure).  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ATL6z.png" alt="enter image description here"  The help page is also useful.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1I6T4.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment121935> I read through the Help manual for Cloud Mail. I don't see a facility to import mail rules, so probably, my answer isn't too helpful. I'll keep looking. <comment121936> Further reading says you should be careful not to lose your desktop rules. Please see http://www.dafacto.com/2013/05/26/icloud-syncing-of-mail-rules/ There is a suggestion at the bottom on how to avoid this. (You may also want to make a copy of your ~/Library/Mail folder.) <comment121960> Thanks for the warning and the link!
