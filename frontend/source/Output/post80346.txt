What documentation exists to explain TheVolumeSettingsFolder on OS X? <body> Searching Google for the following I only found uninformed crap. What is this?  precodelooris@Palace-of-the-Nine-Moons:/tmp $ tree /TheVolumeSettingsFolder/ /TheVolumeSettingsFolder/ └── HFSExtentTables     └── OVDBHDR4R6PVQJPJRE6QTLCBNS         ├── 8PHMGCTSVNFUN915KNSCRDST3K         └── UBNUIHU3QNGCTMAO8ECAQ65960  2 directories, 2 files /code/pre  The two files are binary data (codefile/code just says "data" and codestrings/code returns nothing useful).  If they are, as the name would imply, actually "volume settings", how can I know which volume they refer to?  <comment93237> I couldn't find any definitive documentation, either. The term "HFS extent tables" refers to the data organization scheme of the HFS filesystem, but I don't understand why those would exist as file data instead of metadata. What's the format of your root drive? Do you share the volume over the network? <comment93270> @jmk format is HFS+ journaled, and only the public folders of each user are shared.
