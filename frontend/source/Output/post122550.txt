All user-related data gone <body> My Mac crashed yesterday, no idea why.  Now in the morning emGoogle Drive/em asked me to enter a login and pass and refused to use the already existing emGD/em folder. Then I've noticed that emCyberDuck/em's bookmarks are missing. And now it turns out that my Address Book is empty. Any idea what can be wrong? Is there any directory that holds all this data and could get corrupted?  Thank you in advance  <comment143020> If you right-click and choose **Get Info** on your home folder, is **Locked** checked? Also, in **Sharing & Permissions**, does your user have *Read & Write* privilege? <comment143022> @Lasse It's not Locked and I have read and write permissions on my home. Should it be locked? <comment143024> No. I just wanted to exclude that as the source of your problems. Could've been that the file permissions got messed up when OS X crashed. You don't happen to have a Time Machine backup to restore to? You should also check if you're logged in to iCloud in **System Preferences**  **iCloud** *might* be why Address Book is empty <comment143026> BTW: If you feel up to the challenge, try opening **Disk Utility**, selecting your main HDD partion and clicking **Verify Disk** to see if it turns up any errors. If so, **Repair Disk** would be appropriate to run next :) <comment143031> @Lasse wow, you were partially right. Address Book was the only one thing unchecked in iClouds preferences. And I have iCloud backup. The problem is that I don't know how should I restore bookmarks of Cyber Duck and what's worse, I don't know what else can be missing. Is there one place where could all the stuff be? <comment143033> Great, that's at least progress. Usually much of the data is located in the hidden **Library** folder. In Finder, try pressing ⇧+⌘+G and pasting `~/Library/Application Support/Cyberduck` — Is there a file in that location called `Favorites.plist`? <comment143038> @Lasse No, there is no plist. But they use some special data files, and there is one for bookmarks (because I've created it) but History and other directories are empty. It's a strange situation. Doesn't look like **Application Support** was wiped. <comment143043> let us [continue this discussion in chat](http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/13296/discussion-between-uko-and-lasse)
