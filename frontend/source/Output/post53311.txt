Help me determine what runs when I open a new Terminal window <body> I noticed that when I started a Terminal window by accident and tried to close it quickly by pressing the X on the window, I got a dialog box like this:  precode"Closing this window will terminate the running processes: login, bash, bash, perl." /code/pre  My computer was under heavy load at the time and slow. I hit cancel, and tried it again, it closed quietly.  This leads me to believe that there is a Perl script loading every-time I start up my terminal. I have been unable to re-create the issue so far. How I can check exactly what scripts are being run when I open the Terminal?  precode1 /etc/profile  # System-wide .profile for sh(1)  if [ -x /usr/libexec/path_helper ]; then     eval `/usr/libexec/path_helper -s` fi  if [ "${BASH-no}" != "no" ]; then     [ -r /etc/bashrc ] &amp;&amp; . /etc/bashrc fi  2 ~/.profile (just user defined aliases)  3 ~/.bash_profile      # Setting PATH for MacPython 2.5     # The orginal version is saved in .bash_profile.pysave     PATH="/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/Current/bin:${PATH}"     export PATH      test -r /sw/bin/init.sh &amp;&amp; . /sw/bin/init.sh      ##     # Your previous /Users/USERNAME/.bash_profile file was backed up as /Users/USERNAME/.bash_profile.macports-saved_2010-04-04_at_17:07:45     ##      # MacPorts Installer addition on 2010-04-04_at_17:07:45: adding an appropriate PATH variable for use with MacPorts.     export PATH=/opt/local/bin:/opt/local/sbin:$PATH     # Finished adapting your PATH environment variable for use with MacPorts.       # MacPorts Installer addition on 2010-04-04_at_17:07:45: adding an appropriate MANPATH variable for use with MacPorts.     export MANPATH=/opt/local/share/man:$MANPATH     # Finished adapting your MANPATH environment variable for use with MacPorts.  #Add Some Color to "ls"     export CLICOLOR=1     export LSCOLORS=ExFxCxDxBxegedabagacad      ##     # Your previous /Users/USERNAME/.bash_profile file was backed up as /Users/USERNAME/.bash_profile.macports-saved_2011-09-23_at_23:15:01     ##      # MacPorts Installer addition on 2011-09-23_at_23:15:01: adding an appropriate PATH variable for use with MacPorts.     export PATH=/opt/local/bin:/opt/local/sbin:$PATH     # Finished adapting your PATH environment variable for use with MacPorts.      # My Aliases     (REMOVED ALIASES)      4 ~/.bashrc (FILE DOESN'T EXIST) /code/pre  <answer53313> At startup codebash/code executes (in that order)  ol licode/etc/profile/code/li licode~/.profile/code/li licode~/.bash_profile/code/li licode~/.bashrc/code/li /ol  So any unexpected code should be called from one of these scripts (or a script called from one of them etc.).  <answer53538> Perl is running because you have Fink installed.  In code~/.bash_profile/code you have:  precodetest -r /sw/bin/init.sh &amp;&amp; . /sw/bin/init.sh /code/pre  and in code/sw/bin/init.sh/code you have:  precodeperlversion=`/usr/bin/perl -e 'printf("%vd\n", $^V)'` /code/pre  or something similar.  <comment60954> It just seems suspicious that a perl script would be running on every terminal startup <comment60955> Not really. If it's part of the configuration scripts, it **will** be run for every shell. How it got there in the first place is a question we can answer once we know what it is. Maybe you can add a screenshot of the terminal window the next time the issue occurs? <comment60958> alright, it seems that /etc/profile was calling eval, which i assume was interpreted by perl. <comment60959> Actually eval seems to be part of bash. So again the question of where this perl script is coming from. <comment60961> Please post a screen shot or look at the files mentioned line by line. <comment61236> I've added the requested files in the original post <comment61239> What's in `/sw/bin/init.sh` and in `/etc/bashrc`? And a screenshot would help as well <comment61240> Ah! That's for Fink, a package manager I must have downloaded a while ago.  It has the following line: `/usr/bin/perl -e 'printf("%vd\n", $^V)'`  Which runs perl to get the version number. I must've caught it in the middle. Thanks for helping me out. I'm glad it's not a malicious script being called.
