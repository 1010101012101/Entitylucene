Wineskin - Problem with launching java programs <body> I am trying to launch a Java program that needs JRE 8. I tried installing it onto my wrapper with the installer, but it showed a message in the style of "Oops, no new executables found, maybe the installer failed?". The solution on my other computer was to download the compact version in tar.gz, put the jar into the codejre1.8.0_60\bin/code directory, strongcd/strong to it with the strongCommand Line Shell/strong and then run codejava -jar program.jar/code. I tried the same on my computer, but this error showed up:  precodeC:\Program Files\jre1.8.0_60\bin&gt; java -jar program.jar  # A fatal error has been detected by the Java Runtime Environment: # #  Internal Error (0x80000100), pid=71, tid=49 # # JRE version: Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (8.0_60-b27) (build 1.8.0_60-b27) # Java VM: Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM (25.60-b23 mixed mode windows-x86 ) # Problematic frame: # C  [KERNEL32.dll+0x1d4d2] # # Failed to write core dump.

I put it on Pastebin because of its length.  <comment244125> The error is in the C DLLs that the program calls so we need to know what these are - also being a Java program why run under Wine? <comment244127> @Mark The program is a map editor to a game only available on Windows. If I run the program on a mac, It cannot find the Windows-only game, even if I point to it.
