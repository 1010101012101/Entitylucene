Can I set do not disturb for all my apple devices from one place <body> I'm wondering if there is any way to disable notifications for all apple devices from one place.  I want something like this, for example, telling Siri "do not disturb" from my Apple watch, and notifications will be disabled on my Mac and iPhone as well.  Maybe an Alfred workflow?  I checked google but I could not find something like this.  Any suggestion is appreciated.
