What program can print source code well on OS X? <body> I am looking for an OS X application to nicely format and print source code from a variety of programming languages.  ul liLine numbers would be nice/li liConstant width font/li liPrinting the contents of the clipboard would be a real plus/li /ul  Does something like this exist (besides the obvious programmers' editors), free or reasonably priced?  <answer77739> If you are familiar with the command line you could use a2ps (free and open source) which can be installed via MacPorts (install MacPorts and then codesudo port install a2ps/code) or Homebrew (install Homebrew and then codebrew install a2ps/code).  For example:  precodea2ps -1 --line-numbers=5 -g source.c /code/pre  will print codesource.c/code with syntax highlighting (code-g/code) and line numbers each 5 pages. See the manual page for additional options. It supports a wide variety of source formats.   To print the content of the clipboard:  precodepbpaste | a2ps -1 --line-numbers=5 /code/pre  codepbpaste/code prints the content of the clipboard to standard output which is read by a2ps.  <answer77740> You will find a nice answer over at sister site superuser. It involves a terminal program called enscript which comes with lot's of options and I know at least of one support file for extending its capabilities to print Ruby code.  EDIT:  I just noticed the "clipboard" part of the question. The clipboard content can be accessed from the command line and fed to codeenscript/code using codepbpaste/code as mentioned in Matteo answer.  <answer77743> See also GNU Source-highlight, which supports many input languages and several output formats.  <answer78934> If you don't want to use the terminal for this task and want a mac 'application' you should look at 'Text Wrangler' by Bare Bones Software. It is freeware, which fits your 'low price' request ;)  I use it to print out smaller runs of text, and use it specifically for the line number feature.  <comment91249> If open source apps dont work for you, I recommend TextMate from http://macromates.com <comment91355> You can also get a2ps from Homebrew (http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/).  Some people like it better than MacPorts. <comment91389> @chrish Thanks I updated the answer
