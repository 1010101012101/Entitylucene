Where is "All My Files" folder? <body> I used to think "All My Files" is not a real folder but it turns out otherwise. I accidentally moved some of my files into "All My Files" folder and now they are disappeared! How can I locate "All My Files" folder?  <answer124412> The All My Files is not a real folder unlike others.  Is is simply a collection of all files on your mac.  They come from all kind of different folders.   <answer124425> Actually, All My Files is a folder, but not the way you'd expect it to be. It exists at the path code/System/Library/CoreServices/Finder.app/Contents/Resources/MyLibraries/myDocuments.cannedSearch/code. It is a special type of folder, called a embundle/em, that has an extension. You can usually access the inner part of these by right-clicking and choosing "Show Package Contents", but with All My Files you can't due to Finder's special treatment of it.  The bundle contains a file called codesearch.savedSearch/code which is just a Smart Folder property list. This is a search for all files within your home directory.  In your case, this doesn't matter, because when you drag something into the All My Files folder, it goes to code~/Documents/code. The odd thing about this is it only happens for All My Files, and not other Smart Folders, which don't allow you to drag-and-drop files into them.  <comment145503> Okay never mind, I discovered that All My Files folder is Documents folder. When you move files to this folder they end up in Documents folder. <comment145536> Just because "When you move files to this folder they end up in Documents folder." does not mean "All My Files folder is Documents folder." They're obviously not the same...
