Safari and SharePoint <body> The usual behaviour when opening a Document on SharePoint ist that the document is opened in the corresponding Web App. In my case it is simply downloaded (with Safari).  It was like that with OS X 10.8, than it was OK with some of the 10.9 versions and now is back to download only with 10.10.  It should not be version related as I know of machines with El Capitan where the behaviour is emnormal/em (open in browser).  Any idea what would make my browser act differently?  <comment291542> Is the share point mounted as an Internet drive? <comment291613> No is not mounted <comment291621> Try mounting it instead of accessing it through the webapp. It's not a direct solution, but it should provide some info. <comment291622> Mounting works without problems. I can even download/edit and then upload. But it would be nice to have the default behavior
