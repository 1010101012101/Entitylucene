Deb packages on MacOS <body> I've been trying to run steam, and more specifically Saints Row 3 on my MacBook air, to no avail. I was wondering if there was a way to install Deb packages on Mac so I could run a Linux version of steam? Sort of like Wine.   <answer276245> You can't install/run Debian packages natively, the kernel and a lot of required data structures are vastly different. Usually people who want to run Linux code  ul liset up a VM and install Linux within in. VirtualBox is a (good) cost-free solution here, there are also Parallels and VMware which offer more features but aren't free/li liinstall Linux in a second partition and dual-boot either Linux or macOS. Install instructions depend on Mac hardware, macOS version and Linux distribution. /li /ul  Neither way will compensate for underpowered hardware though (the graphics to run the game in your case).   <comment347607> What makes you think that hacking your system to run a game in Steam within Wine based on Debian packages is easier than fixing whatever problems you had with running the game within the macOS version of Steam? <comment347609> If you want to run Linux, get a VM (e.g. VirtualBox) and proceed from there. <comment347610> Saints Row is not officially supported on MacOS. This seemed like an easier way to go than finding a new computer. <comment347611> I did try dual booting Ubuntu, but I had problems with the built-in graphics (Intel HD 4000 and opengl 4.1 apparently don't play nice.) <comment347612> Booting into Linux will not turn the built-in graphics into a GeForce GT 630 or Radeon HD 685 (which seems to be the minimum for the game) :-) <comment347613> It might not run well, but I'm hoping it'll at least work <comment347615> While not the answer I was looking for, I suppose you're not wrong. Thanks for the help.
