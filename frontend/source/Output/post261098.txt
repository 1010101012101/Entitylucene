Direct USB-to-USB networking? <body> Is there an existent method, a driver, or some software that facilitates direct USB-to-USB networking in macOS similar to FireWire-to-Firewire ethernet or the new Thunderbolt-to-Thunderbolt ethernet networking?  <answer261099> Yes and no. Because of the host-slave relationship USB is built around this requires specific hardware, namely an active cable with electronics. They're cheap enough though, you can get them on Amazon or similar for ~$10 and up.  Just search for "usb bridge cable".  <comment326953> So there is an existing driver built into macOS that will leverage a cable such as [this](https://www.amazon.com/Mediabridge-USB-3-0-Cable-SuperSpeed/dp/B00D8JFNO8/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1479178284&sr=8-2&keywords=usb+bridge+cable) as an ethernet bridge via USB for two Macs? <comment326957> No, that's just a cable, it has no electronics. The fact that a company named "Mediabridge" is selling it does not make it a bridge cable...  From the description, "Transfer or share data from external hard drives and other peripheral devices with a USB A-Female port to your computer or other Host device." <comment326958> In the remarks folks are talking about using it to transfer data between a Mac and PC...  Also see: http://superuser.com/a/945523 -- Now, having said this, it doesn't appear that macOS, or Windows, for that matter, supports networking over USB at the moment...  At least I'm not finding it. <comment326959> It's exceedingly unlikely to be an actual bridge cable, since there appears to be no room for the required electronics, and it isn't advertised as having any. Best case scenario it doesn't work, worst case you blow your usb ports. <comment326961> Oh yeah, that's yet another type of cable, it's crossed-over so it won't blow your ports but it also won't let you transfer files, sadly. <comment326963> It seems as though one will have to have some kind of a kernel extension that would facilitate ethernet transport over the USB crossover, which seems doable, but that no one has yet done... Hmm.
