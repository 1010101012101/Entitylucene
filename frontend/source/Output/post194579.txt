Where has my GarageBand gone? <body> I own a 2011 MBP, which came with GarageBand installed. I am not complaining, but suddenly I don't get updates for it anymore. The AppStore lists GarageBand as having an update, but when I click the update button it tells me that there are no updates for this Apple ID.   Looking at the AppStore page for GarageBand, I can see it available for 4,99 EUR. I don't really mind, since I got it for free and don't use it really, but I am still wondering how this could happen? Did Apple change the terms on when I am eligible for updates?  <answer194591> There is a small print at the bottom of the download info page for the GarageBand ver 10.1.  strong- Requires Apple Music Connect Account/strong  Do you have one ?  But here is the good news. I do not have the Apple Music Connect and was able to get the GarageBand 10.1 update.  I have a MBA 2012 with Mavericks (10.9.5) and here is the process I had to do.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GjrdR.jpg" alt="need to accept this"  need to accept this then continue with download  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jarQo.jpg" alt="paused"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/keXlB.jpg" alt="download"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xwYA1.jpg" alt="installing"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wMOuI.jpg" alt="done"  You will be asked to log in again to complete the download/installation.  And it is ready to go:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4UjL0.jpg" alt="gb ready"  <comment232221> This indeed worked. At some point I got asked to agree to the terms and conditions, and now after a good night's sleep it allows me to upgrade.
