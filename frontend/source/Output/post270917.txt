Number of antennas inside an iPhone 7 <body> I would like to know how many antennas are inside an iPhone 7 for the 4G connection?  Is it possible to have multiple antennas on an iPhone to make the received signal stronger and give better data throughput?  Thanks  <answer271087> Theres nothing you can do to improve significantly the signal, as the iPhone doesn't support hardware or software upgrades that can improve this side of things.
