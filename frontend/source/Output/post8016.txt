HFS+ case-sensitive or case-insensitive -- which type to use for the primary drive partition? <body> What reasons are there for choosing the case-emin/emsensitive version of HFS+ when formatting the primary drive partition? Would case-sensitive not always be the best choice?  <answer8018> One or other can break applications, case-insensitive is the default however.  If you've been using case-insensitive without issues then there are no guarantees that a transition to case-sensitive will go well.  Here's one example from the apple support pages:       ...don’t assume your   third-party software solutions work   correctly with case sensitivity.   Important:  Case-sensitive names do   not ignore Unicode ignorable   characters. This means that a single   directory can have several names that   are considered equivalent using   Unicode comparison rules, but they are   considered distinct on a   case-sensitive HFSX volume.   <answer8028> Use the default (case-insensitive) unless you both a) know what you're doing and b) you absolutely have to. There are several programs (Norton Antivirus comes to mind) that won't work properly on a case-sensitive file system.  HFS is, by default, case-insensitive but case-preserving (i.e. it doesn't care what you type for comparison purposes, but it will remember what you type).   <answer26832> There are some significant applications that will not work correctly with case sensitive. And there's really no reason to do it. I'm assuming since you're asking that you really don't have a reason to do it. You're definitely better off not doing it unless you have a specific reason, and don't care that many applications don't work right with it.  <answer91891> There is a good reason to choose a case sensitive file system. If you are concerned by the quality and the security of the applications you run you might be interested by any early mechanism which may discriminate badly programmed applications.  An application which at one time create a file named codeconf/code and later try to open the same file with the name codeCONF/code is at least poorly written. This is just plain bad programming practice. This kind of application is filled with vulnerabilities with the same average probability all over its code length. This is a dangerous application.  This dangerous application will most probably crash on a strongcase sensitive/strong file system.  This dangerous application will not crash on a strongcase insensitive/strong file system.  (Some applications will crash on both, but we are not highly motivated to sort out these ones.)  Hence a strongcase sensitive/strong file system may be considered as a good tool to early detect and block poorly programmed applications.  On the other hand, this level of strongprogramming quality control/strong is far from sufficient to ensure that you don't have any other vulnerability.  <answer234843> One good reason to use case sensitive file system is using git repositories. Syncing them to the repo causes problems again and again, if not using case.  But I suggest adding another partition using HFS+ formatted case sensitive for such an application and link the directories you need to that partition. My system partition is still case insensitive not because I kwow why but just because I'm afraid.  <answer293375> Adobe Creative Cloud apps will not run on a case sensitive system, and can be a major problem  <comment8653> So what's the standard then? Case-insensitive? <comment8654> Case-insensitive is standard, and is almost always the better option. <comment8659> @CajunLuke: Thanks! <comment79477> See http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/46322/what-programs-have-trouble-with-case-sensitive-hfsx-filesystems-and-how-to-fi for a list of programs with HSFX issues and (possible) fixes. <comment107934> So basically you are saying that as a developer/tester one should use a case sensitive filesystem, and as a mere user a case insensitive one? <comment107944> → Patrix: I would advise every user to use **case sensitive** filesystem. No need to discriminate users. Better fight poorly written applications which are the roots of all security vulnerabilities. <comment107945> It doesn't help the user if he needs to use an application which expects filesystems to be case insensitive (Adobe still has issues there for instance). <comment107946> → Patrix: how right you are "Adobe still has **issues** there". Meanwhile, Adobe is sometimes able to make applications which are cleanly programmed and which run without a glitch on nearly every OS on the marketplace (Adobe reader). <comment287255> Apparently there's nothing to fear. OS X will run fine on case-sensitive HFS+. Though some applications may not. And I agree: git is a very good reason to do this.
