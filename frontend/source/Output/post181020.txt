Get nick name of current user <body> I want to get the nickname of the currently logged in OS X user via Apple Script. Currently can only retrieve the full name or the nickname of a contact, I wasn't able to combine the two scripts.  precodetell application "System Events"     get full name of current user end tell /code/pre  Returns my full name.  codetell application "Contacts" to get nickname of person "My Name"/code  Returns my nickname.  I'd like to get the nickname of the vcard of the currently logged in user.  <answer181024> I've managed to solve it quite o.k.  precodetell application "Contacts"     tell application "System Events"         set theName to full name of current user     end tell     set theNick to nickname of person theName     if theNick is not missing value then         return theNick     else         return word 1 of theName     end if end tell /code/pre  It would be better to select the vcard associated with the user account and not just match the name. But I couldn't find out how to do this.  <answer182861> By nickname do you mean the short user name of the logged in user? Nickname seems to be only available in contacts and the user might not have set his contact card. You can get short user name by getting system info  precodeset _info to system info set _nickname to short user name of _info /code/pre
