Email Space usage too much <body> Why does my iPad 2 version 7.1.2 show mail usage 1.4 GB when I have only four emails in all boxes? I have erased all mail from my computer mailboxes also...  <answer156582> Please check:   ul liIf you start the Mail.app, you get a list of Shortcuts (in the upper left corner)/li liBelow that you should see a list of your accounts. If you click on one of your accounts, you get a list of all your Folders/Mailboxes (i hope i translated it correctly). /li liCheck if the Trash-Folder is empty or if there are still Mails marked for deletion. /li liRepeat that for all your Mailaccounts and check other Folders like the  'Draft'-Folder too./li /ul  Alternative Option: If you have all Mail-Account Credentials, delete all Accounts and re-create them. Perhaps that will change the Usage. Please check before re-creating them.  <comment184046> Where is the Usage shown? In iTunes on your Mac? <comment184074> Thanks--on my iPad: general settings/usage. <comment184095> Did you configure your Mail-Account as an IMAP- or to a POP-Account? <comment184382> A pop account... <comment184761> Thanks JC, I had already done that...that's why I'm dumbfounded about the 1,4 GB! But thanks for answering <comment184765> Hi Anna. I have added an alternative approach in my answer.
