iOS: How can I overdub an m4a email attachment? <body> My friend has sent me a rough recording to overdub, sent as an m4a over email.   What app(s) can I use to do this without syncing the song to my music library? GarageBand doesn't seem to let me import a song as a track, even from the library.   I wonder if I can somehow use inter app audio to achieve this, but don't know what to search for in the App Store.   Anyone know if this is possible?  <comment266478> Have you tried just transcoding it to .wav & importing it that way? Use [XLD](http://sourceforge.net/projects/xld/) if you don't already have an app that will do it <comment266538> @Tetsujin just to be clear, I am talking about doing this on iOS, not OS X. (Not sure a wav would be any easier to overdub) <comment266553> ah, sorry. No I hadn't grokked that. Sorry, I've never done audio work on iOS, only ever on desktop OSes.
