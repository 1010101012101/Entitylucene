How to fix a distorted "File and Folder" view after upgrading to Mountain Lion and deletng Houdini? <body> When I had Lion, I used Houdini to show hidden files and folders. But after I upgraded my OS to Mountain Lion, it seems like Houdini is not working correctly. So I deleted Houdini.  But now it seems like my files and folders in Finder are distorted em(see image below)/em. I'm not sure if this because of Houdini or because of Mountain Lion bugs.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/CY4bx.png" alt="enter image description here"  I already tried sort by name, it sorted at the moment. But when I reopened the same folder, the file back distorted.  How can I fix it?  <answer59590> The files are not "distorted"; they just are not arranged in rows. When you have the files in icon view, you can arrange them however you like.  If you want to have a particular window arranged by name, you can press kbdâŒ˜/kbdkbdJ/kbd to bring up the inspector pane, then select the criteria you want to "sort by"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yMMig.png" alt="enter image description here"   <comment68658> yes i mean not arranged. sorry for my bad english. Will try it soon. the effect usually back when i restart my mac or idle for some hours. <comment68689> @GusDeCooL I'm not quibbling about your choice of words; my point is that you might not want your icons to look like that, but that isn't broken; it's just arranged in a way that's different than you'd like it to be. <comment68690> [A related question at Super User](http://superuser.com/a/456362). You could try deleting all .DS_Store files and then setting sorting by name as the default in the view options. <comment68949> No it is broken. before i upgrade to Mountain Lion. There is no problem like this. <comment75648> @LauriRanta Already do it. but not working.
