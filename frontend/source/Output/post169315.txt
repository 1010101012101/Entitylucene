Device enrollment returns 500 error in OS X Server <body> I'm currently working with OS X Server (Yosemite) to try and create profiles for certain devices.  It appears that I have configured the server correctly, and I have assigned a domain to it.  When I try to enroll an iOS device and click "Enroll", I get a 500 Internal Server Error.  Same thing happens on the Mac.  Is this a common issue, or is there something I forgot to configure?  <answer169398> Completely reset OS X Server and all my certificates.  Apparently there was an issue with my self-signed certificate, so enrollment is working now.  <comment215502> Same issue here. How did you manage to completely reset server and certificates? Please describe it explicitly to me. Thanks a lot! Andreas
