prevent mac from renaming downloads' extensions <body> Sometimes I download something, and OS X (or Chrome, not sure) decides that the file extension must be changed.   Is it possible to completely disable this feature? How?  I guess this is a Google Chrome issue, but triggered in OS X because it hides file extensions by default? I'm not sure how it works and what triggers this, but I'd just like to have the downloaded file's name not to be messed with.  You're offered the option of which extension to use, but sometimes, even if you choose the right extension, it still screws up the filename.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3lclj.png" alt="Screenshot - sometimes, even if you choose the right extension, it still screws up the filename"  <answer104063> OS X does not change extension of your downloaded file. Do you have any example (i.e., link) where Chrome does this?  <comment122553> This is not a function of OS X that I am aware of. Can you provide an example? <comment122554> I added a screenshot that illustrates the problem. <comment122555> And that little icon on the left of the dialog means ... <comment122556> I guess it's a chrome feature, instead of os x's? <comment122560> check the screenshot <comment122561> I used http://www.ubuntu.com/start-download?distro=desktop&bits=64&release=lts it doesn't happen. File is saved as .iso <comment122562> try downloading the torrent, e.g., http://releases.ubuntu.com/precise/ubuntu-12.04.3-server-amd64.iso.torrent  this only happens to certain file types <comment122564> Chrome is most likely reading the headers accompanying the file download and making assumptions based on that. Only thing I can think of. This is not an OS X feature.
