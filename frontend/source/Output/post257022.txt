sox can't find mp3 handler <body> Downloaded the latest sox macosx binary and tried to convert .aiff to .mp3  no mp3 handler  audacity and Amadeus are able to use it.  built LAME from source and installed in /usr/local/lib; still didn't work.  Didn't help to preset LD_LIBRARY_PATH, DY LD_LIBRARY_PATH, or LTLD_LIBRARY_PATH.  Downloaded sox source and configured with the option to have LAME dynamic instead of static.  Still no good.  Suggestions?  <comment321178> I tried a few other things, none worked.  Finally used six to do the effect I wanted, then LAME to do the conversion.  The aiff came from "say" which was not able to do several formats it claimed to support.  (mp3 was not even claimed.)
