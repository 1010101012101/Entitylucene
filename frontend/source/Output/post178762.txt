Using applescript to create spaces and launch apps <body> So the end goal of what I am looking to do is this:   When I am at work I use an external monitor with my MBP.  I have a consistent set of spaces and apps that I setup everyday.  What I would like to do is create an applescript or combination of applescript &amp; automator application that once launched will create the needed number of spaces on each monitor and open then the appropriate apps into each space.  I don't know if this is best accomplished completely in applescript or as I said using a combination of applescript to create the spaces and automator to open the bulk of the applications and browser windows that I use.  <answer180729> To add one Desktop Space to each monitor/display:  precodedo shell script "/Applications/Mission\\ Control.app/Contents/MacOS/Mission\\ Control" delay 0.5 tell application "System Events" to click (every button whose value of attribute "AXDescription" is "add desktop") of group 1 of process "Dock" delay 0.5 do shell script "/Applications/Mission\\ Control.app/Contents/MacOS/Mission\\ Control 1" /code/pre  One can modify the code to add more desktops.  To switch to a particular desktop / fullscreen app in a dual display setting, e.g. Desktop 3:  precodedo shell script "/Applications/Mission\\ Control.app/Contents/MacOS/Mission\\ Control" delay 0.5 try     tell application "System Events" to click (first button whose value of attribute "AXDescription" is "exit to Desktop 3") of list 1 of group 1 of process "Dock" on error     tell application "System Events" to click (first button whose value of attribute "AXDescription" is "exit to Desktop 3") of list 2 of group 1 of process "Dock"  end try /code/pre  There are discussions out there about turning an app to fullscreen mode with script.  <comment211810> not an answer, but there's a wealth of Applescript/Spaces routines at http://macscripter.net/viewtopic.php?id=23453
