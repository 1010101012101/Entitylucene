iOS iPhone news app - are saved articles backed up? I'm replacing my device <body> I'm using the latest version of iOS on an iPhone 7+. Yesterday my device was dropped on the ground, in an otter-box, and the front facing glass shattered into a million pieces. This is my first iPhone and I'm surprised how easily the glass cracks.   I use the news app pretty often to save articles - I'm a writer. As I await my Asurian replacement, I'm wondering if my 'saved' articles will be restored from a backup made in iTunes.    <comment335519> There's no real rhyme or reason as to why it sometimes breaks & sometimes doesn't. I've seen the glass break on a 2ft fall onto carpet yet survive repeated drops onto concrete/tarmac. Best guess is if it hits at the wrong angle or hits some hard protrusion etc. I'm on my 5th iPhone & only ever managed to crack the glass [or in fact break anything on one] once; on my first one. <comment335521> The saved articles should be in your iTunes backup, i've never used the news app but it's like any iOS app. you'll be able to recover your saved articles.
