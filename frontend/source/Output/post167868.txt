Can't make more than two partitions <body> I want to multiboot my MacBook Pro, I'm trying to make partitions but in Disk Utility I can't make my partitions, only can divide by 2? Why? strongIt's a normal SSD/strong not a fusion drive (SSD+HD).  Now I'm fresh installing my Mac with internet recovery... (Second time) but this time in Disk Utility by internet recovery instead click on strongerase/strong I clicked in partitions and make a partition named strongMacintosh HD/strong.  What I'm doing wrong?

That info would show at bottom left in Disk Utility. If so, see http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/154964/resizing-or-expanding-a-corestorage-volume?lq=1 <comment196851> I can't know now but in 2014 I already made more than 2 partitions. I don't know why disk utility don't let me partition the disk now, something I do wrong? <comment196852> depends entirely on whether it's core storage or not <comment196863> I Installed new OS X Mavericks from Internet Recovery, but when I upgraded to Yosemite modified from Solid State Disk to Logical Volume Group... How do I reverse??? <comment196864> See the link I posted, klanomath's answer is as good as answers get on the subject <comment196870> Didn't worked that link <comment196871> that was quick;) what error did you get <comment196872> Resizing to same size it can't <comment196873> when I issue: **diskutil cs resizeStack [UUID] 0g** give me that error <comment196878> done... edited and posted the results of diskutil list, diskutil cs list and sudo gpt -r -vv show disk0 <comment196880> @DiogoSaraiva What kind of multi-boot environment do you need? <comment196886> @klanomath See here please: http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/179626/same-swap-partition-in-multi-boot <comment196892> I will try, then I post here... Thanks <comment196895> Thanks it worked.... Thank you very much.... By the way is there a editor to publish in stack exchange? How do you type/write the keys and how you make new lines without using br tag. Thanks again <comment196896> And sorry for I don't left you a vote up, I can't yet I have not 15 reputation <comment196897> @DiogoSaraiva Please check [editing-help](http://apple.stackexchange.com/editing-help). - keys: kbdkey/kbd - new line: two trailing spaces <comment196898> @DiogoSaraiva BTW It's gonna be hard to create a 5-systems-boot environment. I don't know if it's even possible. Maybe you should consider VMware or Parallels... <comment196899> @klanomath - glad to see you in on this one; it's above my pay grade;) <comment196975> FWIW, I've got a MB with 10.6 thru 10.10 all installed, as well as another partition with the 10.6 installer disk. Option-booting, with all the recovery partitions etc, is a screen full of hdd icons. <comment196976> @Kent The 5 systems are Mac OS X, Windows 8.1, Debian, Ubuntu and Arch Linux! <comment196980> Yikes!  Completely different scenario. I'd also be interested to see if that could even be done. <comment197355> My final choices were: MAC OS X, Windows 8.1, Ubuntu 14.04.1, SlackWare and ArchLinux... But Slackware don't boot well: stops in "mousedev ps/2 mouse device common for all mice" and ArchLinux is a little difficult for me to install... <comment197357> @DiogoSaraiva Can you please ask a question regarding this 5x-boot and answer it as well (that's explicitly allowed!) with a proper walk-through? <comment197361> @klanomath Should I post here or in "Unix & Linux", that question of slackware <comment197365> @DiogoSaraiva To get Slackware or ArchLinux running should probably be one question - i don't know if here or at U&L (i assume here because it's running on Apple hardware). The multi-boot environment install should be a second question here. I'm really curious how you got that working... <comment197370> @klanomath With rEFInd....  I Initially make partition for OS X and used your help (answer) and make partitions for Windows 8.1, Ubuntu and Ubuntu Swap in Fat32... Next installed windows (i had to format fat32 partition to ntfs in windows installer) and when installed Ubuntu choose Ubuntu choosed "one more thing" to choose partitions... I had to make a few changes in refind configuration file too...
