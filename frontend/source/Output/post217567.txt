I just overwrote my folder while mounting a hard disk drive. How do I undo/recover it? <body> I was trying to mount a Linux filesystem on a Mac and accidentally mounted it to my code~/Documents/code folder using a utility ext4fuse.  Below command is the issued command:  precodesudo ext4fuse /dev/disk2s7 ~/Documents /code/pre  And after that, I can't access my code~/Documents/code folder. Is it there or gone forever?  <answer217570> All the files are still there, you just can't get at them since the mount point has changed the system's ability to resolve files in /Users/whatever (a.k.a.~)  Going forward, try mounting the drive under /Volumes (as in codesudo ext4fuse /dev/disk2s7 /Volumes/myDrive/code)  You should probably reboot the Mac since many programs will have issues saving work to the home folder. If you are working on some important documents, maybe save them to /Users/Shared if you wish, but hopefully you have a good backup system in case this messed things up more than expected.  <comment263045> I'm not familiar with Mac. Does rebooting automatically unmount drives? <comment263046> @NateKerkhofs Yes - this manual mount command doesn't write a command to mount it forevermore it's just a one time event. <comment263078> Reboot, really? Why not just unmount?
