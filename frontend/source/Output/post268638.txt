Using command line to create bootable OS X USB drive <body> I am trying to create a bootable USB flash drive. I need help understanding this command in details.  precodesudo /Applications/Install\ OS\ X\ Yosemite.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/Untitled --applicationpath /Applications/Install\ OS\ X\ Yosemite.app --nointeraction /code/pre  The "Install OS X Yosemite.app" (5.73 GB) is currently on an external HDD and I don't have enough space on my Mac because I ignorantly installed OS Yosemite on only 15 GB of partitioned system drive. This is the current state now.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mNj5A.jpg" alt="" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GoBaj.jpg" alt=""  Now, I think I need to make changes to the command line to change the directory since I cannot copy the "Install OS X Yosemite.app" back into the Flash storage "OS Yosemite" and run the command. But I don't know how and help will be much appreciated.   precodesudo /Volumes/MacBook/OS\ OS\ X\ Yosemite.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/Untitled --applicationpath /Volumes/MacBook/OS\ OS\ X\ Yosemite.app --nointeraction /code/pre  Will this do?  <answer268641> The copy/paste bits are fine, but you got your app path wrong...   codesudo /Volumes/MacBook/OS\ OS\ X\ Yosemite.app/codebr should bebr codesudo /Volumes/MacBook/OS/Install\ OS\ X\ Yosemite.app/code  To be certain you have the correct path, Terminal allows drag &amp; drop.   ol liType sudo, then space.  /li liDrag your Installer app to the Terminal  /li liHit backspace once [terminal adds a space to your dropped path]/li licopy/paste the rest of the line code/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/Untitled --applicationpath/code  /li liDrag your Installer again [NO backspace this time]  /li licopy/paste code--nointeraction/code/li /ol
