Can I download 3rd party songs on the iPad and add them to iTunes Match? <body> I wonder if i can buy and download songs e.g. via Bandcamp in Safari, and then add them to my iTunes match right on my iPad?  I know how to do that with iTunes on the Mac, but it would be neat to have this also on the iPad.  <answer113982> Nope. You won't be able to add the in iTunes and thus you won't be able to add them to iTunes match.
