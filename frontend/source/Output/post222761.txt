OSX 10.5.8: spurious "cannot be copied because there is not enough free space" <body> I'm trying to rehabilitate my G5 tower  ul liOSX 10.5.8/li litwo HD in the bays./li /ul  The problem:  ul liBoth the boot disk (1TB) and the second disk (300GB) have a lot of space on them.  /li liThe 1TB has 800GB free, the other has nothing on it (290+GB free)./li /ul  Yet when I drag a file "foo" from the 1TB to the empty drive, it fails with:     The item "foo" cannot be copied because there is not enough free space   Copying from the 1TB to the same 1TB drive (in another place) works fine!  I've run Disk Utility on both and repaired all the permissions, but I still get this error.  What is the deal?  Any ideas?    I'm willing to erase the startup volume, but I have to find a Leopard disk somewhere!  <answer222873> I still don't know what caused this.  But the workaround was:  ul lireformat the hard drive again, as Journaled/li liset the Trash preference to "zero" (it was previously set to the less-secure "do nothing"/li lireboot/li /ul  Our speculation is that some deep-in-the-filesystem thing was messed up on the device.  <comment269952> What size if "foo" and what is it, a file or a folder and its content? <comment270092> it's literally anything, even a simple file. <comment270095> I'd hardly call a destructive process a workaround. :) <comment270891> I know, bummer huh?  I'll be happy to take suggestions on what this was.
