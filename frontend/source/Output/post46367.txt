Is it possible to open in default browser a URL from command line reusing same tab? <body> I know that I can use codeopen/code command to open a URL in a default browser like:  precode$ open http://google.com /code/pre  But what I would like is to execute a similar or same command to open different URLs one after the other, but reusing the same tab of the browser.  Something similar to the HTML version of what I'm trying to achieve:  precode&lt;a href="http://google.com" target="my_target_window"&gt;Same tab&lt;/a&gt; /code/pre  <answer46369> You can do this with some AppleScript. For Google Chrome it looks like:  precodeon run argv   tell application "Google Chrome"     set URL of active tab of window 1 to item 1 of argv     activate   end tell end run /code/pre  You'd save that as a script file (code.scpt/code) on disk and then call it with osascript from the command line. For example, if you saved that as code~/bin/chrome.scpt/code you'd do:  precodeosascript ~/bin/chrome.scpt https://apple.stackexchange.com/ /code/pre  to open https://apple.stackexchange.com/ in the first Chrome window's currently active tab. If you wanted to make it a little simpler you could prefix the script with code#!/code so it can be executed directly from your shell like so:  pre class="lang-sh prettyprint-override"code#!/usr/bin/env osascript  on run argv   tell application "Google Chrome"     set URL of active tab of window 1 to item 1 of argv     activate   end tell end run /code/pre  And then save that as code~/bin/chrome/code and codechmod u+x ~/bin/chrome/code and call it like so:  precode~/bin/chrome https://apple.stackexchange.com/ /code/pre
