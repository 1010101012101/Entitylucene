Safari Reading list disappeared on Mac <body> Suddenly, my Safari Reading List is completely empty on my Mac (OS X 10.10.2 Yosemite, Safari 8.0.4).  I already tried turning iCloud syncing for Safari on and off again, clearing the Safari cache,...  On my iPhone, the reading list is still filled with items.  Does anyone has a solution for this problem?  <answer178379> The file that houses your reading list (and bookmarks) is called Bookmarks.plist and it is located in ~/Library/Safari/. You could restore it via TimeMachine or any other backup you are (hopefully) running.  <answer218486> The list just comes back be patient.  <comment211373> I hadn't thought of Time Machine yet, will try this out tonight, thanks for the suggestion! <comment211480> I was able to restore the missing items, but iCould synchronization is still spotty. <comment211481> Perhaps try to throw out all devices and enable it again after that. Make sur e to delete the items from all device but one first so you don't end up with everything double or tripple. <comment264142> Sadly, this fixes many iCloud issues I have experienced personally. Either make a cup of tea and check in 25 minutes or wait until tomorrow are both great options if you haven't given it time to catch up to the cloud changes (on occasion when things get stuck).
