How to change keyboard layout via keyboard shortcut? <body> I like to use both US and German keyboard layout but I find the process of switching between them via mouse tiresome. I want a keyboard-only solution.  Is there a predefined shortcut to change between multiple keyboard layouts, or if not, how could I define such a shortcut?  <answer135888> See this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/eSkh1.jpg" alt="input source"  codePref panel =&gt; Keyboard =&gt; shortcuts =&gt; Input Sources/code then set your shortcut  If you have conflict a small yellow triangle will appear guiding you to the conflict shortcut. (disable or change it)  If the Spotlight appears, disable its shortcut.  <comment161108> @Buscar Thanks ! <comment161111> Select next source in input menue is exactly what I was looking for. I prefer for Cmd Space to launch spotlight, so I reverted that command. (That one also uses an overlay I do not want to use.)
