AppleScript referencing tabs suddently breaking on Chrome <body> I've been successfully using a script for a long time, which uses Chrome to calculate execute some javascript and return the result.  precodetell application "Google Chrome"     tell window 1         tell tab 1             [do something here]         end tell     end tell end tell /code/pre  Today, after many months, I tried editing the script but the AppleScript Editor is refusing to save it (even without any changes, e.g. after typing a space and then deleting it...), showing an error message:  precodeSyntax Error Expected end of line but found number. /code/pre  while highlighting the code1/code of codetab 1/code as being the offender...  What is wrong with the latest version of the applescript editor or of Chrome? Any ideas how to work around this problem?  <answer168209> I can actually get your example to work with no problems, just doing something simple:  precodetell application "Google Chrome"   tell window 1     tell tab 1         get URL     end tell   end tell end tell /code/pre  That makes me think the problem might be in the "do something here" section of your scriptâ€”I've never found Applescript's error messages to be very reliable.  That said, you could also try shortening your code:  precodetell application "Google Chrome"   tell active tab of first window     [do something here]   end tell end tell /code/pre  Using my earlier, super simple example, this works for me:  precodetell application "Google Chrome"   get URL of active tab of first window end tell /code/pre  I should also note that I'm using Script Editor 2.7 (176) on Yosemite 10.10.1  <comment197375> Using script editor 2.7 and Google Chrome 39.0.2171.99 (64-bit) on OS X 10.10.1 and your script runs fine (using `activate` instead of "[do something here]"). <comment207610> Which version of OS X are you running?
