How to partition an SSD that fails with error 69888 - couldn't unmount disk? <body> I erased the SSD drive in my MacBook and was reinstalling Lion when it failed about 75% through the install. Now in Disk Utility, sometimes I see the SSD drive and sometimes I boot and it's not there but I can never erase or partition it. I get an "error 6988 couldn't unmount disk".  When I attempt to run codefdisk/code to correct the MBR. codefdisk/code doesn't do anything.  Any ideas how to fix a disk that is this severely screwed?  precode-bash-3.2# diskutil list /dev/disk0    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:                                                   *64.0 GB    disk0 /dev/disk1    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:     FDisk_partition_scheme                        *31.9 GB    disk1    1:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk1s1 /dev/disk2    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:     Apple_partition_scheme                        *1.3 GB     disk2    1:        Apple_partition_map                         30.7 KB    disk2s1    2:                  Apple_HFS Mac OS X Base System    1.3 GB     disk2s2 /dev/disk3    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:                            untitled               *524.3 KB   disk3 /dev/disk4    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:                            untitled               *524.3 KB   disk4 /dev/disk5    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:                            untitled               *524.3 KB   disk5 /dev/disk6    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:                            untitled               *524.3 KB   disk6 /dev/disk7    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:                            untitled               *524.3 KB   disk7 /dev/disk8    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:                            untitled               *6.3 MB     disk8 /dev/disk9    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:                            untitled               *2.1 MB     disk9 /dev/disk10    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:                            untitled               *1.0 MB     disk10 /dev/disk11    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:                            untitled               *524.3 KB   disk11 /dev/disk12    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:                            untitled               *524.3 KB   disk12 /dev/disk13    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:                            untitled               *1.0 MB     disk13 -bash-3.2# diskutil info /dev/disk0    Device Identifier:        disk0    Device Node:              /dev/disk0    Part of Whole:            disk0    Device / Media Name:      Corsair Performance3 SSD Media     Volume Name:              Not applicable (no file system)     Mounted:                  Not applicable (no file system)     File System:              None     Content (IOContent):      None    OS Can Be Installed:      No    Media Type:               Generic    Protocol:                 SATA    SMART Status:             Verified     Total Size:               64.0 GB (64023257088 Bytes) (exactly 125045424 512-Byte-Blocks)    Volume Free Space:        Not applicable (no file system)    Device Block Size:        512 Bytes     Read-Only Media:          No    Read-Only Volume:         Not applicable (no file system)    Ejectable:                No     Whole:                    Yes    Internal:                 Yes    Solid State:              Yes    OS 9 Drivers:             No    Low Level Format:         Not supported  -bash-3.2# fdisk -u /dev/disk0 fdisk: could not open MBR file /usr/standalone/i386/boot0: No such file or directory      -----------------------------------------------------     ------ ATTENTION - UPDATING MASTER BOOT RECORD ------     -----------------------------------------------------  Do you wish to write new MBR? [n] y -bash-3.2#  /code/pre  <answer89040> I can't test it but I think that if you erase the MBR (with dd instead of fdisk) and the partition table record you should be able to re-format you ssd. Boot from cd or external hd and open terminal  this code erase the MBR:  precode# dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/disk0 bs=446 count=1 /code/pre  this one erase the partition table also:  precode# dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/disk0 bs=512 count=1 /code/pre  If you erase just the mbr you could use testdisk to attempt to recover data (in case you don't have erased the disk label).  <answer106427> I got the same "error 6988 couldn't unmount disk" message. It was due to unclosed references to the drive/partition - particularly I had a terminal window open and the PWD was on that volume. Close that window and close all Finder windows that has reference to that volume (or simply codecd/code to a different directory outside of the mounted disk tree), redo the steps, it should work.  <comment273855> Thanks a lot for your hint. It saved my day! For me a `cd /` solved this problem. <comment274125> @Bodo yup. Change path to other directory would work also. :)
