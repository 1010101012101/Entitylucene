Missing 'man' entries after upgrade <body> Having upgraded from Snow Leopard to Mountain Lion a few days ago, I find that most of the 'man' entries from section 3 (programming functions) are missing.  For example:  precodephillip-millss-macbook-pro:etc phil$ man fopen No manual entry for fopen /code/pre  Exploring with the terminal shows me that all that remains in man3 directories within the 'man' search path are things related to Perl.  Is there something extra that I should be installing to get the reference information back?  <comment68381> Have you installed Xcode or the command line tools package from its preferences or https://developer.apple.com/downloads/? <comment68389> I have the new Xcode installed and working fine.  (I suppose it's possible **that's** what caused the 'man' problem.)  Even though the auxiliary tools description doesn't mention documentation, I'll try installing that from the link you provided.  Thanks.
