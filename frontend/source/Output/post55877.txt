When "there is a user sharing this computer" shows during ShutDown, how to find out more info about it? <body> During a Mac's ShutDown, a window shows:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/07hpj.png" alt="enter image description here"  Is there a way to find out more info, such as who the user is (username), the IP of that user, and machine name?   The Terminal app can show some info by using codew/code or codewho/code, but only another username is shown.  Can more info be obtained by using another command line or another app?  (correction: seems like codew/code and codewho/code are showing the local users only)  <comment64161> As far as I know, `w` and `who` will report users who are logged in via `ssh`. But if they are sharing files (or other resources?) on your computer, you won't find them that way.
