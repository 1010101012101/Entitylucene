USB keyboard temporarily not responding after wake from sleep <body> I have a USB Keyboard connected to my 2012 MacBook Air running OS X 10.9.5. I use the computer in closed-lid mode and connected to a monitor. Often, but not always, when I wake the computer from sleep, I have to repeatedly tap keys on the keyboard before the keyboard starts responding. The sequence of events is as follows:  ol liI wake the computer from sleep by pressing a key on the keyboard./li liI attempt to type, and nothing happens. Not even the caps lock key on the keyboard works to illuminate the caps lock light./li liI rapidly press random keys (or a single key) on the keyboard, and the keyboard begins to respond after a while./li /ol  The USB keyboard is connected with a powered USB hub between the keyboard and the computer. Using a different hub does not solve the problem. The keyboard does still show up under USB devices in System Information when it is not responding.  Is there a solution to this annoyance?  UPDATE: When the keyboard is not responding, I can make the caps lock light on the keyboard illuminate by pressing the caps lock button with the mouse in the OS X keyboard viewer. Doing so does not restore the keyboard to a responsive state though. I still have to repeatedly tap keys before the keyboard starts responding.  UPDATE: The problem remains under OS X 10.11.6.
