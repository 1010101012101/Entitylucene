How to Lock / Restore Window Positions? <body> I'm looking for a way to lock the screen positions of the various windows I have open.  I've tried the "Stay" app and the "Disktility" app.  The former worked sporadically and the latter kept crashing.  I'd just like a quick way to save the position of open windows, be able to move them around, and then have a quick way to restore them to their original saved positions.  Any way to do this?  Thanks!
