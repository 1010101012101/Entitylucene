How to edit the hosts to block IP address? <body> I know how to block certain website, like if I want to block google I can use this line in the host  precode0.0.0.0 www.google.com.hk         www.google.com.hk /code/pre  But my question is how can I block certain IP address? Like how can I block certain IP address like 17.154.66.79?  <answer154414> Technically, OS X can make use of code/etc/hosts.allow/code and code/etc/hosts.deny/code files that will  work with standard resolvable hostnames. For blocking IP addresses, using codeiptables/code is the usual method but apparently Apple deprecated its use beginning with Lion and switched to codepf/code for this function. Check and read the links in this thread on SuperUser for info on using codepf/code and perhaps a GUI front-end for it.  <answer154488> You may execute a reverse DNS lookup to determine a hostname you want to block. Use a web service like reverse DNS lookup or 'nslookup' to get a hostname.  nslookup:    ol liStart codeTerminal.app/code and enter codenslookup/code/li liAt the prompt enter codeserver 8.8.8.8/code (this defines which dns-server to use to do the reverse DNS lookup. 8.8.8.8 is a google name server)/li liAt the next prompt enter an ip-address/li liNow you'll get the host name you need for your codehosts/code file/li /ol  Example output:  precodeuser$ nslookup &gt; server 8.8.8.8 Default server: 8.8.8.8 Address: 8.8.8.8#53 &gt; 93.220.102.55 Server:     8.8.8.8 Address:    8.8.8.8#53  Non-authoritative answer: 55.102.220.93.in-addr.arpa  name = p5DDC6637.dip0.t-ipconnect.de. /code/pre  If you add code127.0.0.1   p5DDC6637.dip0.t-ipconnect.de/code to your codehosts/code file you will prevent your computer accessing my web server.  Caveats:    A lot of ip-addresses and correspondent host names can't be tied to a special computer/host. Mine change at least every 24 hours.  A today hazardous site/hostname might be a valuable one in the future but unaccessible for you.  Some ip-addresses are tied to several hostnames with the consequence that you won't be able to detect the name you actually want to block.  <answer154522> Little Snitch (or similar) blocks IP addresses &amp; IP Ranges for both outgoing &amp; incoming connections.   <comment181664> you need to know the URL ! <comment181666> @Buscarì›ƒ That's the question... I don't know how to get URL like this. <comment181738> hosts.allow and hosts.deny restrict access to your **own** Unix or Linux machine - even fine-grained to single services. [Source](http://its.virginia.edu/unixsys/sec/hosts.html) <comment181739> @klanomath Certainly, using something like `deny tcp .google.com` to block TCP connections. `iptables` has fine-grained functions as well. <comment181740> iftables/pf are effective means but hosts.allow/deny doesn't help much blocking **outgoing** traffic <comment181747> @klanomath Yes, that would be better addressed through the router or external firewall. But it will kill the incoming response. <comment293779> this is answering a different question: how to block access to a host-name or domain name. It will NOT work if someone will use the IP address directly (in the browser, or any other software that makes the TCP/IP connection, <comment367915> juan cena!!!!!!! <comment367916> do do do do do do
