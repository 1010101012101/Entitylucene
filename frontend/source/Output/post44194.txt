What is the ⌥ key? <body> Is this key the same as shift?  If so, why don't people just call it shift? I spent a long time looking around for what this key means. Google returned no results. My MacBook Air keyboard does not have this symbol either.  <answer44195> That is the Option key (Alt on Windows). It's not the same as shift - it's generally used as a secondary modifier for keyboard shortcuts (Command being the primary modifier) and for shortcuts that don't perform an action (Option-8 is a bullet point code•/code and Option-Shift-8 is a degree symbol code°/code).   <answer62019> The first symbol is the option key, located between the command and control keys on a typical Mac keyboard.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/z51Ez.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <comment50238> It is indeed interesting to note that that symbol isn't used on some keyboard layouts, like those of a MBA. Instead it has `option` written out in full. <comment50245> @Gerry (New) US keyboards don't use the symbols as much as new European ones or older keyboards. <comment53550> Shift is called shift, because historically it shifted parts of the type writer up or down to provide stamps of the uppercase or lowercase letters. <comment53597> Great question. I wondered this too for a while, and there are no clues on the keyboard, or the shape of the symbol. <comment53646> But even if you have a US keyboard, with "option" written out, you will see menu shortcuts with that funny symbol in them...  Same for "shift" and "control". <comment71634> Here is a list of all these symbols... http://support.apple.com/kb/PH3669
