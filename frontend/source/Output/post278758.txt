How to recover a deleted Outlook 2016 Mac profile? <body> My Calendar was malfunctioning after updating to Outlook 2016.  I was given the advice to delete my profile and recreate it.  I did so.  Now the calendar works!  Yay!  However, the contents of my "On My Computer" have disappeared, an outcome I didn't expect.  Is it possible to recover that?
