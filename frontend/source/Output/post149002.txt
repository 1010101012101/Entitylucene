Run old applescript in automator <body> I want to use automator to extract text from mail. The applescript used to do that is an old version of the scripting language. My mac will accept only the latest. Is it possible that I can run the old program in the automator?  The Code -  precodeon run {input, parameters}      using terms from application "Mail"     on run {input, parameters}         set mailContents to {}         repeat with aMessage in input             set end of mailContents to subject of aMessage             set end of mailContents to sender of aMessage         end repeat         return mailContents     end run end using terms from  end run /code/pre  <comment175523> Can you show us the script! <comment175524> Automator won't fix an old AppleScript, but maybe we can if you post the code. <comment176839> @Buscarì›ƒ I have posted the code. <comment176840> @0942v8653 I have posted the code. <comment176842> Thank you, let see what we can do for you. We have some gurus in scripting (sorry that's not me). Is it specific text you want to extract from email ?
