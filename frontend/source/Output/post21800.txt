Connect my Windows XP to Mac OS X Internet Sharing <body> I have Internet Sharing enabled: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mx7TT.png" alt="enter image description here" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jXK9S.png" alt="enter image description here"  The WEP password is codeaaaaa/code. I understand that my MacBook Pro now acts as a wireless access point. My Windows XP PC can see this. However, when I enter codeaaaaa/code as a password, I can't connect code:(/code  Am I missing something? I've read about WEP being seriously outdated, that WiFi device manufacturers hadn't yet agreed on a unified way to treat passwords through WEP.  So I did some experiments. As a control setup, I'll hold my Mac password to codeaaaaa/code or codeAAAAA/code at all times. I've tried the following passwords on my Windows:  Mac password: codeaaaaa/codebr codeaaaaa/code - Failbr code6161616161/code - Fail (code61/code is the hex ASCII code for codea/code)  Mac password: codeAAAAA/codebr codeAAAAA/code - Failbr code4141414141/code - Fail (code41/code is the hex ASCII code for codeA/code)  h1UPDATE/h1  Yes, I also tried using 128-bit WEP, trying out the same experiments above for codeaaaaaaaaaaaaa/code and codeAAAAAAAAAAAAA/code. It still fails.  <answer21803> Have you tried using 128bit WEP? Even though it says 40 bit is more compatible, switching might work.  Also, make sure that any drivers on the XP machine are up to date. If the XP machine has a vendor-specific networking application, try connecting using that instead of XP's built-in wireless menu, and vice versa.  <answer21809> Try 40-bit WEP with password length of 10 characters. My MBP WEP key is  1234567890 and it works.  hr  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/SNRYR.png" alt="enter image description here"  I disabled my internet sharing in this pic.  <answer21894> On the Mac:  -- Use 128-bit encryption. (Windows has 64 and 128, Apple has 40 and 128.)  -- Use a 13-character password.  On the PC:  -- Under "Wireless Security Type", select "Use Static WEP keys".  -- And finally, under "Access Point Authentication:", select "Shared".  <answer61237> WOOHOO! think I finally solved the problem.  From the taskbar I right-clicked on the MacOSX network and hit configure...(which now shows up as properties...) and saw that the security type had defaulted to none even though encryption type was still set to WEP.  I changed the security type to Shared and it now works.  It took a few minutes to register the network and only once I changed it to a home network did the internet connectivity kick in.  A 40bit wep key works fine, ABC12 or 4142433131...  <answer119137> Finally worked Mac Shared to Windows XP.  Frustrating.  The problem I was having is that the key HAS to be 13  numbers with no spaces or letters.    Example - (4253648725908) Key is Not (Barney1233254) or (cb2535734825c)  hr  Mac Setup  System Preferences - Sharing - Internet Sharing - Airport - Airport Options  Channel Automatic  Check on Enable Encryption  Password is (13 NUMBERS) only.. no letters (kept trying to put a letter in the key and Windows will not connect with a letter in the password under any circumstance)  WEP key length is 128-bit  Click OK and Start Internet Sharing with Internet Sharing check box  hr  Windows XP PC  Bring up Wireless Connections window showing nearby wifi networks.  Click on Change the Order of Preferred Networks (not what I would think)  A new unfamiliar window opens called Wireless Network Connection Properties; this is correct  Click on the ADD button and a new window called Wireless Network Properties appears  Association Tab  Type the exact name of Mac Wifi network in Network Name SSID  Select Network Authentication as Shared  Select Data Encryption as WEP  Uncheck the Key is provided for me and the Network Key line turns on  Type the Network Key of (13 numbers) in the Network Key line  Retype the Network Key of (13 numbers) in the Confirm Network Key line  DO NOT check the ad-hoc network check box - leave blank  Click OK and Click OK again  Bring up Wireless Connections window showing nearby wifi networks.  Click on your Mac network which should show in the wifi list.  It should work straightaway.    <comment23995> Have you been able to connect with anything else? <comment24005> Yes, I also tried 128-bit WEP. Still to no avail :( <comment24012> How did you input the password on your MBP? `1234567890`, `$1234567890`, or `0x1234567890`? <comment24026> One layer at a time: Get it working without any encryption first.  When that works, then add encryption. <comment24028> @JRobert, yes, I got it working without encryption before I posted this question :) <comment24062> Good, that's useful to know. Is there another security mode than WEP available to both machines, that you can try? <comment24067> just 1234567890 NO prefixes <comment24088> @JRobert, Mac OS X sharing supports only WEP (40-bit and 128-bit). I have also successfully connected a smartphone. I think Windows and Mac haven't come to terms with how to treat WEP passwords (hex, plaintext, or otherwise)
