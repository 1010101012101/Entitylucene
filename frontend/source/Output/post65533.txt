How to lock MacBook with a keyboard shortcut? <body>    strongPossible Duplicate:/strongbr   Is there a quick way to lock my Mac?       I am familiar with using Automator, but I do not know what code should be used to accomplish the feature. Can anyone provide the code used to lock my retina MacBook Pro? I want a function similar to the one in Windows when you press kbdWindows/kbd+kbdL/kbd.  <answer65539> If it helps, on 10.7 Lion, I just use a global two-key shortcut in BetterTouchTool (free/donationware) to start the screen saver and lock my Mac. You'll also need "Require password for sleep and screen saver" set to "immediately" in System Preferences  Security &amp; Privacy  General. The shortcut shown here is kbd⌘/kbd + kbdL/kbd which I prefer to other solutions as its virtually the same key positions for my Windows and Mac machines!  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dRiPn.png" alt="enter image description here"  Alternatively, you can also use kbdCtrl/kbd + kbd⇧/kbd + kbd⏏/kbd/kbd⌽/kbd (eject key, or power key on Macbook Air) to put the display to sleep immediately (this also requires "Require password for sleep and screen saver" set to "immediately" in System Preferences  Security &amp; Privacy  General).   <comment77049> Perfect. I always had BTT but never thought they had the option for `Switch to Login Screen` which does the exact thing !! <comment77051> What sort of "macbook" you mean matters here, as well as what you mean by "lock" it. What hardware do you have, and what do you hope locking the machine will accomplish? <comment164483> Not the exact thing: the login screen disconnects wifi, the lock screen does not.
