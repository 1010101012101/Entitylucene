iPhone on a budget <body> My old iPod touch finally gave up the ghost after about 10 years. I would like to join Instagram and several other sites...but, living on social security, I can't afford a smart phone - it's not the phone it's the monthly service charge. So, my idea was to buy a used iPhone and use it wherever there is Wi-Fi for internet access.  Would this work? Also could I use something like Skype or some other Apple program to make calls or would it be internet only?  <answer215465> If you want an iPhone without the phone, Apple recently updated the iPod Touch with the internals of the iPhone 6. It still has only a 4-inch screen size, but with the updated hardware, it makes a decent iPhone without the phone. It costs $199 for the 16GB model, $249 for 32GB, $299 for 64GB, and $399 for 128GB.  <comment260261> And don't forget, you can FaceTime or iMessage, which is _almost_ as good as calling (unavailable in some territories).
