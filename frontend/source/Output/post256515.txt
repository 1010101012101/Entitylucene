How to prevent Gimp's script-fu from showing in the dock? <body> Whenever I start Gimp, it launches script-fu and its icon (which looks like terminal), shows up in the dock.   I found this answer: How can I prevent an application from showing on the Dock?  However, there are two executables that start, the main Gimp executable which I want to keep in the dock, and this one which I want to remove:  precode/Applications/GIMP.app/Contents/Resources/lib/gimp/2.0/plug-ins/script-fu /code/pre  Thanks.  <comment320017> Using Gimp from [gimp-2.8.18-x86_64.dmg](https://www.gimp.org/downloads/),  I cannot reproduce your issue while Gimp is opening. The only thing I'm seeing on the screen is the Gimp splash screen and in the Dock the Gimp Dock Tile, no other Gimp associated Dock Tile is showing while Gimp is opening. What version of Gimp and where was it acquired? Also what version of Mac OS are you running on what Apple hardware, e.g Early 2013 15" MacBook Pro with Retina Display.
