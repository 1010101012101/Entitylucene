Highlight parts of a 2D Line Chart in Numbers <body> I'm using the latest version of Numbers (4.2) and am looking to plot a Line Graph, with a few sections highlighted in a color as shown:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jlCQw.png" alt="Highlight Example"  Any leads on how to do the same?  <answer288413> Ah! Nevermind! I managed a workaround. Since I found no solution online I'll answer myself here in case it helps anyone.  Under Chart's Background &amp; Border Style, select "strongAdvanced Gradient Fill/strong" as shown in strongImage 1/strong  Then change the Gradient angle to 180Ëš. If you hover just below the  Gradient Slider, you should see a strong+/strong symbol. Use that to add more stops.  In the example below, I have 8 stops. (4 for each highlight zone). Each highlight zone would need 4 stops (in this order):   precodeWhite (Chart Background Color), Red (Highlight Color), Red (Highlight Color), and White (Chart Background Color).  /code/pre  They are almost overlapping in pairs, and hence you can't see all 8 here. (strongShown in Image 2/strong)  The end result is shown in strongImage 3/strong.  emSidenote: Had to club all 3 images into 1 image since strongyou need at least 10 rep to post more than 2 links/strong.
