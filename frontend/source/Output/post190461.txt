What are all these partitions on my Mac? <body> I know the purpose of "EFI", "Boot OS X", and "Recovery HD" partitions. But why are there three different "Macintosh HD" partitions? And should there be two EFI partitions?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0Mpyb.png" alt="enter image description here"  UPDATE  Here is what codedisktutil list/code reports  precode/dev/disk0    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *121.3 GB   disk0    1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1    2:          Apple_CoreStorage                         121.0 GB   disk0s2    3:                 Apple_Boot Boot OS X               134.2 MB   disk0s3 /dev/disk1    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *3.0 TB     disk1    1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk1s1    2:          Apple_CoreStorage                         2.7 TB     disk1s2    3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.1 MB   disk1s3    4:                  Apple_HFS Data                    326.8 GB   disk1s4 /dev/disk2    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:                  Apple_HFS Macintosh HD           *2.8 TB     disk2                                  Logical Volume on disk0s2, disk1s2                                  03BC8817-F05E-4FC3-9A5C-50130CDAB3AB                                  Unencrypted Fusion Drive /code/pre  <answer190468> disk0 EFI is the partition with the EFI specifics of this mac disk1 is the Recovery Partition disk3 is your startup disk partition. So you start from disk3, you can use the RecoveryPartition to "recover" (start up while holding CMD+R) You can not access the EFI partition. LexS  <answer190474> The reason it shows three "Macintosh HD" drives, is because it's trying to obfuscate the "CoreStorage" partitions you're seeing with the command you used. It helpfully (or not so much) tells you what volume those CoreStorage volumes are a part of (in this case "Macintosh HD"). Then it also shows you the mounted "Macintosh HD". The EFI partitions are required as a part of the GPT spec, and so any disk formatted with a GUID Partition Table is expected to have one.  <answer190475> Your internal disk is a Fusion Drive combining an SSD (disk0) and a HDD (disk1). It uses a Core Storage partition scheme.  The superior "Macintosh HD" is the name of the Logical Volume Group build by the compound of the two Physical Volumes (disk0s2/disk1s2) of your Fusion Drive. It's used instead of the name of the physical device in a non-Core Storage partition layout.  The first inferior "Macintosh HD" in black is the name of the Logical Volume (disk2) as well as the HFS volume.  The two inferior "Macintosh HD" in grey are the "names" of the single Physical Volumes (disk0s2/disk1s2) contributing to the Logical Volume Group.  To get the all necessary informations about your Core Storage Volume Group(s) just enter codediskutil cs list/code in Terminal.app.  Example:  precodeCoreStorage logical volume groups (1 found) | +-- Logical Volume Group 47F9D6B1-F8F2-4E64-8AD4-9F2E2BD78E29     =========================================================     Name:         Macintosh HD     Status:       Online     Size:         3120722075648 B (3.1 TB)     Free Space:   114688 B (114.7 KB)     |     +-&lt; Physical Volume ABF9D6B1-F8F2-4E64-8AD4-9F2E2BD78E29     |   ----------------------------------------------------     |   Index:    0     |   Disk:     disk0s2     |   Status:   Online     |   Size:     120988852224 B (121.0 GB)     |     +-&lt; Physical Volume DE0BE70D-F8F2-4E64-8AD4-994F887A7BC1     |   ----------------------------------------------------     |   Index:    1     |   Disk:     disk1s2     |   Status:   Online     |   Size:     2999733223424 B (3.0 TB)     |     +-&gt; Logical Volume Family 63FFE3F6-F9FE-48A6-923A-994F887A7BC1         ----------------------------------------------------------         Encryption Status:       Unlocked         Encryption Type:         None         Conversion Status:       NoConversion         Conversion Direction:    -none-         Has Encrypted Extents:   No         Fully Secure:            No         Passphrase Required:     No         |         +-&gt; Logical Volume FC7B83AA-E787-4E65-8C7E-2A62CDBB948C             ---------------------------------------------------             Disk:                  disk2             Status:                Online             Size (Total):          3106191572992 B (3.1 TB)             Conversion Progress:   -none-             Revertible:            No             LV Name:               Macintosh HD             Volume Name:           Macintosh HD             Content Hint:          Apple_HFS /code/pre  The two EFI partitions on your two physical devices are necessary and may contain the boot loader programs for some installed operating systems (e.g. rEFInd). Additionally the EFI partition is used as a staging area for (Apple-) firmware updates.  <comment226128> and you did not make those ? run "diskutil list" in terminal and publish the result. <comment226131> @Buscarì›ƒSD Updated question with results <comment226135> Do you have a mac with a fusion drive or not? <comment226162> The EFI partitions do not contain the boot loader. Apple doesn't use them for much of anything actually. <comment226179> @iProgram Yes. I have a Fusion Drive. I forgot to mention that. <comment226207> @Froggard Thanx for the hint
