Leopard won't remember default programs <body> Everytime I restart/boot my mac and open up a mail application (thunderbird) or a web browser (firefox or chrome) I am always asked if I want to make it the default. This happens even if I click yes.  So, for some reason osx isn't remembering what I set as the default mail or web browser. I have already repaired disk permissions which didn't fix the problem.  Any ideas?  <answer25165> Tyr setting it within the Safari or Mail preferences as described here: http://support.apple.com/kb/ht1637   <answer26822> Try to set default apps with RCDefaultApp  <answer31642> The problem was I was using the root user. Creating a new user sorted everything out!  <comment28320> The permissions was a very long shot for this issue - but do reboot into safe mode (or run a repair of the filesystem using fsck/Disk Utility) and report back. Another thing to try is to make a new user account and see if things stick there better. I'd guess a corrupt preference file is hosed, but you might have to be systematic about troubleshooting this to find the glitch on your mac ... <comment28324> Definitely try that! <comment34673> Are you using FileVault, by chance?
