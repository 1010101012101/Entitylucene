How to permently delete images from Photos? <body> I've read online to delete images from a mac which you have imported through the Photo's app that you must  ol liLaunch the Photos app on your Mac./li liGo to the File  Show recently deleted menu item./li liClick on the pictures or videos you want to permanently delete./li liClick on the Delete button at the top right./li /ol  But I do not seem to have the option to emShow recently deleted menu item/em.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fd6fR.png" alt="enter image description here"  Also when I check in the terminal I can see the photos still exist in the below folders      precode$ ls Pictures/Photos\ Library.photoslibrary/Masters/2016/03/27/20160327-09 20160327-090437/ 20160327-091640/ 20160327-093058/  $ ls Pictures/Photos\ Library.photoslibrary/Masters/2016/03/27/20160327-090437/ ./            IMG_0073.JPG  IMG_0176.JPG  IMG_0286.JPG  IMG_0372.JPG  IMG_0481.JPG  IMG_0565.JPG  IMG_0643.JPG  IMG_0689.JPG  IMG_0758.JPG  IMG_0803.JPG  IMG_0832.AAE ../           IMG_0075.JPG  IMG_0182.JPG  IMG_0288.JPG  IMG_0376.JPG  IMG_0482.JPG  IMG_0566.JPG  IMG_0644.JPG  IMG_0690.JPG  IMG_0759.JPG  IMG_0804.AAE  IMG_0832.JPG /code/pre  I could just delete them from the terminal but their must be a better way?  If I delete them in the terminal am I missing other places were they need to be deleted.  <answer232786> Figured it out, seems recent versions of OSX put deleted photos into a emDeleted Photos/em Album.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rASkt.png" alt="enter image description here"  You need to click into this album and select emDelete All/em in the top right hand corner.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ktz4c.png" alt="enter image description here"  Once I did this all the images were removed, I doubled checked in the terminal and confirmed they were deleted.
