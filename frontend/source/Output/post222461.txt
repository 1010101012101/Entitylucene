List Local and Global Key Bindings in Mac OS X <body> Can someone help with a solution to list key bindings being used by an OS X application, as well as global bindings being used by all applications.  Ideally, there would be a way to specify bindings for a single key combination, such as:  codeCtl-P/code or codeOpt-Cmd-Z/code  as well as getting a comprehensive text dump of current bindings for all keys.  For my purposes this doesn't need to be fancy: A Bash or AppleScript would be fine. Of course a dedicated GUI utility would be great, if such a thing exists.  <comment322386> not sure if this is what you're looking for https://www.mediaatelier.com/CheatSheet/ but this displays all hotkeys per application
