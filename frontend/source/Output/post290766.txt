Why does my mac lose internet when I connect my iPhone? <body> I'm using wifi for internet access, but when I connect my iPhone via lightning cable all my internet activity comes back as "destination unreachable" or similar errors.  How do I troubleshoot and correct this issue so the mac stays online using the wifi when I connect my iphone?  <answer290921> Goto codeSettings -&gt; Networks/code and check that your strongconnected/strong iPhone is not first on the list.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QCLGO.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment367701> Thanks, that was the issue.  For those seeking out this problem later, click the gear icon below the list and choose "Set Service Order" to move items on the list so the iPhone is below wifi.
