MacBook not able to connect to IRC server over Airport <body> I have a MacBook Air connected to an Airport Express and I am trying to connect to an IRC server.  I am able to connect to the IRC server down the street at the cafe.  I am able to connect to the IRC server over LTE when tethered to my phone.  I contacted my ISP and they were able to connect to the IRC server.  Hence, I believe there is some setting with the Airport Express that needs to be adjusted.  Here is output from nmap, traceroute, ping:  precode$ nmap -sT -p 6697,6667 irc.xxxx.com  Starting Nmap 6.46 ( http://nmap.org ) at 2014-05-14 09:23 PDT Note: Host seems down.

Is the Airport Express acting as a DHCP server?  Is the novuscom device also acting as a DHCP server?  Problem might be the double NAT.  If so does putting the Airport Express into bridge mode fix the problem?  This discussion also looks promising:  precodeApple's routers do not use UPnP.  They do offer a similar type of feature, which is called NAT-PMP, or NAT Port Mapping Protocol  Open AirPort Utility - Click Manual Setup Click the Internet icon Click the NAT tab below the icons Insure that there is a check mark next to Enable NAT Port Mapping Protocol  Click the Configure Port Mappings button if you need to specify specific ports to use and set them up on the next window that appears /code/pre  <comment153389> The Airport is DHCPing out IPs to my Macbook, iPhone, etc.  The novuscom device is a Cisco router in my building owned by the ISP.  I can't really admin it.  I already have "Enable NAT Port Mapping Protocol" toggled on. <comment153390> Right and the Airport connects to what exactly on the WAN side? <comment153391> Sorry, edited last comment.  The WAN side is the novuscom router owned by my ISP. <comment153392> Can you network the Mac directly to the Cisco router?  Either wirelessly or ethernet?  And does that configuration allow you to connect to IRC?  If not you know the issue is not in the Airport. <comment153393> Nope.  I only get the ethernet outlet in my apartment.  I'll try to plug my old MBP directly into the ethernet port and see what happens.
