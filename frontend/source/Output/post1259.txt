Why my Time Capsule shared drive keeps refreshing? <body> I use my Time Capsule to share files across my machines.  On my MacBook, when I open the shared disk in Finder, and expand some folders, it starts to "refresh" after a few seconds again and again.  If I click on a file, it loses the selection, and the directory tree disappear and appear, like being unmounted and mounted quickly.  Edit: I realized that what was causing that was some folders with accent in their names (like: MÃºsica). Once I removed the accent, this behavior stopped. Is this a known bug?  <answer5796> It seems to be a known (or at least widely observed) bug with the Finder trying to display files with non-latin characters in their names on an AFP server (like the Time Capsule) -- see http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?threadID=2426415 for example.  <comment4395> Can you load the console app and see if there are any relevant Finder or backupd error messages under 'All Messages'? Nice profile pic btw - reboot? <comment6014> I edited the question with more relevant information, and yes, reboot :) <comment6024> Thanks, that is exactly what I'm observing. <comment182682> Broken link now.
