Terminal command that gives the type of computer you're on <body> I am running MATLAB code on two different computers, both with the same username.   I would like to strongdistinguish between the two Macs/strong by having the code identify that one system is a desktop, and the other a laptop.   Is there a Terminal command that will print the type of computer I am using (so I can implement the relevant function?)  <answer212879> This command should work for you:  precodesysctl hw.model /code/pre  This will return the Model Identifier for your machine. The below is an example for a mid-2012 Retina MacBook Pro:  precodeMachine123:~ username$ sysctl hw.model hw.model: MacBookPro10,1 /code/pre  Below are some references on Apple's site that describe Model Identifiers - there doesn't seem to be a single reference:  MacBook Pro Model Identifiers  MacBook Model Identifiers  MacBook Air Model Identifiers  iMac Model Identifers  Mac Pro Model Identifiers  Mac Mini Model Identifiers  <answer212925> Simply check if your Mac contains a battery, a smart battery manager or a clamshell mode to distinguish between laptop and desktop.  Check the output of codeioreg -l &gt; ~/Desktop/ioreg.txt/code for proper strings.  E.g. on Lion (10.7.5) and probably newer operating systems you can use:  precodeioreg -l | grep SMB0 /code/pre  (SMB0 probably means strongSM/strongartstrongB/strongattery)  or  precodeioreg -l | grep AppleClamshellCausesSleep /code/pre  On a desktop you get strongno/strong output and on a laptop you get an output similar to this:  precode    | +-o SMB0  &lt;class IOACPIPlatformDevice, id 0x100000166, registered, matched, active, busy 0 (35 ms), retain 9&gt; /code/pre  or  precode    | | |   "AppleClamshellCausesSleep" = Yes /code/pre  <comment257065> This'll give you one of Apple's machine-readable strings, same as in _System Information - Hardware - Overview - Model Identifier_. If you want to _reliably_ distinguish between desktops and laptops, you'll need to maintain a current and exhaustive list of Apple's model-ID prefixes (`PowerBook`, `MacBook`, `MacBookAir`, `MacBookPro` vs. `PowerMac`, `iMac`, `Macmini`, `MacPro`). <comment257091> @BlacklightShining You should edit that information into the answer <comment257107> @Mark No, _Scot_ should edit that information into the answer. The edit would add meaning, rather than just clarifying. <comment257124> @BlacklightShining If you can improve the answer by editing an answer, please do so. This is how the site works. <comment257248> Perfect answer! <comment257252> @BlacklightShining Thank you for the comment - I've edited my answer a bit to provide more information about what this command is returning...
