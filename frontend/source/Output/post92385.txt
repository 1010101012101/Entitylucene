Can I sort songs by Apple ID? <body> I have about 300 songs that were purchased with my ex-wifes account.  I can't play them because they have a different Apple ID and were purchased by her account.  Does anyone know how to "sort" for those songs so I can deleter them?  <answer92413> Doug's AppleScripts for iTunes contains a script that should be useful for you. The Track Down Purchases script can sort your purchases into playlists separated by account name, which should make it easy for you to find and subsequently delete songs not on your account.
