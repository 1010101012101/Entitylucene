I can't make or receive calls on my IPhone 5c iOS 8.1 <body> I have a new problem with my iPhone 5c, I can't make any calls from it, but when I use my SIM on other phone it has no problem, and when I put another SIM it can't receive calls either, so obviously the problem is the phone itself. What can I do?  Thanks  <answer205052> You should try to restore your iPhone to factory settings and completely wipe the software. Make sure you back up everything you need, e.g. your photos or contacts, since everything will be overwritten during this process. Then make sure you have the latest version of iTunes installed on your computer, if you have a Windows Machine, search for "Apple Software Update" in your Applications, or download the latest version of iTunes from the Apple Homepage https://apple.com/itunes. On a Mac you'd just have to check "Software Update" (in the Apple menu at the top left) until OS X 10.6., or the App Store (from OS X 10.7). Then connect your device, open it in iTunes and click "Restore Firmware". It will do a complete software update, follow the onscreen instructions, and everything should be fine afterwards.  <answer205082> Apple Support: If you can‘t make or receive calls on your iPhone     strongCheck your iPhone settings/strong      ol   liTurn airplane mode on and off.

I turned it off and back on and it is fine.  <answer277177> My iPhone 5 was not receiving or making calls and I noticed that my TTY was turned on (phone icon in top right corner). I turned TTY off by going to Settings  General  Accessibility  TTY. You will need to turn off both Software and Hardware TTY buttons. My phone had also somehow (we will not speculate how) got International Roaming turned on and I never travel outside the country, and no children have been playing with my phone. But I turned this off by going into Settings  Cellular  Cellular Data Options  Turn off Roaming/International Roaming.  The combination of these two things fixed my iPhone 5 and I can now call and be called. There was no unusual activity on my phone or no one playing with it when all of a sudden one day I woke up and my phone wouldn't call out or get calls. After 36 hours of searching and reading and resetting and a million other things nothing worked but this. Again, still don't know how they got turned on but they are now off.  <answer295604> I had this problem recently, I fixed it by resetting the network settings.  <comment247242> Ring your carrier. <comment247245> Suppose you could try a reset too... Not many options here, reset, Apple Store, your carrier, 3rd party repair shop <comment312724> @Tetsujin but the phone doesn't work... ¯\_(ツ)_/¯. (Unless the OP has another phone, like a home phone.) <comment312726> @Angelplayer - time for a rousing chorus of "There's a hole in my bucket" I guess... :/ <comment336025> We're looking for long answers that provide some explanation and context.
