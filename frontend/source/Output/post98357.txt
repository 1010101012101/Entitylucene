European Time capsule in Canada <body> Is it possible to use a (European/French)Time Capsule in Canada ? If yes, is there any particular configuration to apply ?  Thank You.  <answer98361> Yes, from my experience you can do that. I lived in the UK and currently use mine in the US. No special configuration required, just configure it to your new router.   <comment115463> did you try it? what was the problem (if any)?
