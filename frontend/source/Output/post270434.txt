Using Apple Diagnostics on a Mac that ships with Apple Hardware test <body> I just came back from an Apple store to try to solve some issues I'm having with my mac.  The interesting stuff is that they used Apple Diagnostics on my Mac that is a Mid 2010 Mac Book Pro that is supposed to run AHT.   Is it possible to run Apple Diagnostics on Mac Book Pro Mid 2010 and similar old models?   <comment339926> There isn't really a question here, just some speculation. Please edit it to make it into an actual question that can be answered.
