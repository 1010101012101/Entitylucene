Keyboard shortcut for toggling between Fn and F keys <body> Is there a keyboard shortcut for toggling between Function and classic F keys?  <answer5625> There might be an easier way, but the following comes to mind:  ul liTurn on Universal Access./li liCreate an AppleScript or Automator App that toggles this via the UI./li liBind that app to a key combo./li /ul  <answer5633> Depending on what you're trying to do, you may be able to cut out the keyboard shortcuts altogether and completely automate this.  KeyRemap4MacBook allows you to set key re-mappings based on what application you're currently using.    I am using a setting that switches kbdF1/kbd through kbdF12/kbd to standard Function keys whenever I'm using RDC (Windows Remote Desktop).  Any other time they operate like their icons (brightness, volume, play, etc).  <answer64737> I believe you can use the kbdFN/kbd key in combination with your desired kbdF1/kbd through kbdF12/kbd keys, to use the standard F key functionality.   <answer191244> You can create application specific shortcuts by creating a custom setting in your codeprivate.xml/code file. Check out the reference documentation for details, or my example below where I'm rebinding the Consumer keys back to Function keys when in PhpStorm (to use the debugger).  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt; &lt;root&gt;     &lt;!-- PhpStorm &amp; EAP Version --&gt;     &lt;appdef&gt;         &lt;appname&gt;PHPSTORM&lt;/appname&gt;         &lt;equal&gt;com.jetbrains.PhpStorm-EAP&lt;/equal&gt;         &lt;equal&gt;com.jetbrains.PhpStorm&lt;/equal&gt;     &lt;/appdef&gt;     &lt;!-- ============================================================ --&gt;     &lt;item&gt;         &lt;name&gt;Switch to normal function keys when in PhpStorm&lt;/name&gt;         &lt;appendix&gt;Change consumer keys to function keys in PhpStorm&lt;/appendix&gt;         &lt;identifier&gt;private.app_phpstorm_switch_consumer_to_fn&lt;/identifier&gt;         &lt;only&gt;PHPSTORM&lt;/only&gt;         &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::BRIGHTNESS_DOWN, KeyCode::F1&lt;/autogen&gt;         &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::BRIGHTNESS_UP, KeyCode::F2&lt;/autogen&gt;         &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::EXPOSE_ALL, KeyCode::F3&lt;/autogen&gt;         &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::LAUNCHPAD, KeyCode::F4&lt;/autogen&gt;         &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::VK_CONSUMERKEY_KEYBOARDLIGHT_LOW, KeyCode::F5&lt;/autogen&gt;         &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::VK_CONSUMERKEY_KEYBOARDLIGHT_HIGH, KeyCode::F6&lt;/autogen&gt;         &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToKey__ ConsumerKeyCode::MUSIC_PREV, KeyCode::F7&lt;/autogen&gt;         &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToKey__ ConsumerKeyCode::MUSIC_PLAY, KeyCode::F8&lt;/autogen&gt;         &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToKey__ ConsumerKeyCode::MUSIC_NEXT, KeyCode::F9&lt;/autogen&gt;     &lt;!-- I want to use these while in PhpStorm         &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToKey__ ConsumerKeyCode::VOLUME_MUTE, KeyCode::F10&lt;/autogen&gt;         &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToKey__ ConsumerKeyCode::VOLUME_DOWN, KeyCode::F11&lt;/autogen&gt;         &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToKey__ ConsumerKeyCode::VOLUME_UP, KeyCode::F12&lt;/autogen&gt;     --&gt;     &lt;/item&gt; &lt;/root&gt; /code/pre  <answer288498> There is now an app for this: https://github.com/Pyroh/Fluor  It lets you specify the kbdfn/kbd key behaviour depending on a rules engine, and also switches between one behaviour and the other when you press the kbdfn/kbd key.  <comment27351> This was just want I was looking for. <comment76096> Related questions: [Toggle "Use all F1, F2 as standard keys" via script](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/59178/toggle-use-all-f1-f2-as-standard-keys-via-script), [Can you toggle function keys on / off with a keyboard shortcut on OS X?](http://superuser.com/questions/243682/can-you-toggle-function-keys-on-off-with-a-keyboard-shortcut-on-osx), [Way to switch F keys to 'application' keys and back on mac via terminal?](http://superuser.com/questions/424921/way-to-switch-f-keys-to-application-keys-and-back-on-mac-via-terminal-10-6) <comment85888> how can you make these settings application depending?

I did have to make a few changes on my system: F1 is ConsumerKeyCode::BRIGHTNESS_DOWN, F2 is ConsumerKeyCode::BRIGHTNESS_UP, F5 is ConsumerKeyCode::KEYBOARDLIGHT_LOW, and F6 is ConsumerKeyCode::KEYBOARDLIGHT_HIGH.  All discovered using Karabiner's event viewer. <comment325064> This is just great! <comment336259> Doesn't work on Sierra
