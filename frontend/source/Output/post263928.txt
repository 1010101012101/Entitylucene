Finder Save As dialog not working when clicking existing file to copy name <body> I'm struggling since my finder decided to act up and not allow me to copy an existing file name to the name of the file to be saved:  Whenever I create a new file (say Excel file) and click Save, I was able to click any file and get it's name to populate the codeSave As:/code text field (specially useful for example for monthly reports, which may have long names and you just click the last one and change the date). For some reason it has stopped working. I've tried relaunching the Finder and restarting my Mac but have had no success.  I'm running macOS Sierra 10.12.1  Any ideas?   <comment335057> Maybe it's triggered by a third party application? We must both have this application if that's the case. I had a look at the console and found a lot of errors with the process "FinderSyncExt" which is added by Setapp. Also repeatedly "SFBrowserCallBack" directly from "Finder". Do you see these too?
