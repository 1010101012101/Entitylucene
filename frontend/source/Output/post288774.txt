Less free space after securely erasing free space? <body> I use a mid-13 13-inches Retina MBP 256gb with macOS Sierra 10.12.2.  I recently decided to securely erase free space using the following terminal command:  precodediskutil secureErase freespace 1 /Volumes/HD /code/pre  After completing its task, I got 50GB of free space instead of the 80GB I had before the operation.   Could it be a remaining temporary file used by secureErase?  <answer288781> That's it. Do you have external SSD and FileVault enabled? Having SSD drive, codeSecure Erase/code and codeErasing Free Space/code commands aren't needed for SSD drives 'cause a regular erase command makes it difficult to recover data from an SSD.  Also, if you don’t include codefreespace/code word, codediskutil/code will start securely erasing the strongentire disk/strong, instead of just the free space! code1/code means single-pass method run of random numbers.   precodediskutil secureErase freespace 1 /Volumes/SSD /code/pre  strongBe careful with it/strong. codeSecurely erased/code means there’s no chance you’ll be able to recover the data.  Read this useful AD post: Why is a secure erase 'not necessary' for SSD ?  <comment364792> The issue is having less space after wiping free space. I think it has something to do with some temp dummy files that haven't been removed properly after secureErase.
