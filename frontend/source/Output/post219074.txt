time on MBP doesnot update <body> I am using MBP running yosemite(10.10.1) retina 15inch mid 2014, it is not showing correct time. It just started time from the time i closed the lid. even why do auto synch with time server or apple time server. it doesn't.  <answer219213> I have this problem on my work laptop occasionally. By looking at the system log in Console I found that SystemUIServer had hung. Going into Activity Monitor showed that SystemUIServer was not responding &amp; force quitting the process instantly fixed the issue for me and my menu bar clock began keeping the correct time again. See if that works for you.   <comment265057> Can you please run `sudo grep ntpd /var/log/system.log` (or, if this doesn't show anything, `sudo zgrep ntpd /var/log/system.log*`, `cat /etc/ntp.conf` and `ps aux|grep  ntp` and then use the **edit** link below the question to add the output to the post? A screenshot showing the Preferences window for Time settings would be helpful as well.
