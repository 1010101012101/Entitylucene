I just upgraded to Mountain Lion. Now I can't share files with the Snow Leopard on my network <body> Before the upgrade, I could pull files from the other laptop on to mine with apple file sharing. Now I can't see any machines in the network view. How can I pull files from the Snow Leopard laptop onto my Mountain Lion laptop? Steps I've taken:  ol liFiles were put into the snow leopard's shared folder/li liOn the mountain lion laptop, opened Finder and looked in Network. There are no computers listed./li /ol  <answer69899> Some troubleshooting steps to take:  ol liOpen the strongSharing Preferences/strong on the Snow Leopard Mac, and make sure that File Sharing is checked. Then click strongOptions…*/strong and make sure emShare Files and Folders using AFP/em is checked./li liOn the Mountain Lion Mac, open Finder and click strongGo → Connect to Server…/strong (or press ⌘K). In the server address box, enter codeafp:///code followed by the IP address of the Snow Leopard Mac, then click strongConnect/strong. ul liIf you don't know the IP, you can find it by using Network Utility on the Snow Leopard Mac./li /ul/li liIf that still doesn't work, open strongTerminal/strong on the Mountain Lion Mac, and enter codeping/code followed by a space and the IP of the Snow Leopard Mac.  ul liIf successful, you should see output like this:  precode64 bytes from 192.168.1.10: icmp_seq=0 ttl=64 time=0.249 ms 64 bytes from 192.168.1.10: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.207 ms /code/pre  In which case, there's something wrong with the file sharing set up./li liIf it's not successful, you'll likely get codeRequest timeout/code errors, and it's a network issue./li /ul/li /ol  Try those steps and post the results, and I'll update my answer with some more suggestions.  <comment81177> Ok, using afp://ip address worked. Thank you! Shouldn't they have just been able to find each other via the magic of bonjour/magic/rounded corners? <comment81179> Yes, emphasis on *should*. Bonjour gets wonky sometimes, although in my experience it usually resolves itself. You could try [restarting the Bonjour service](http://linuxtoosx.blogspot.ca/2011/10/restart-mdnsresponder.html), or use [this Bonjour Browser](http://www.tildesoft.com) to see if the service is showing up at all. <comment81180> Thanks very much for your help. <comment149618> I tried the afp idea and I can connect from MacBookPro (10.8) to iMac (10.6). When I try to drag a file over, it asks for password (of the MBP account, not the iMac) and then says file exists: overwrite, keep both copies... If I say overwrite, it creates a zero MB file. Never before did it ask for my home password. Oh- if I click "keep both" then it goes into a loop creating many many zero size files.
