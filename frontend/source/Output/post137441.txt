Macfusion not working <body> I would like to mount an SFTP drive on OS X. I tried MacFUSION but it doesn't seem to work, always gives "Could not mount filesystem: Mount process has terminated unexpectedly". According to Can MacFusion be used under Mountain Lion?, MacFUSION no longer works. Are there any alternatives or workarounds?  <answer137444> If your looking for recommendations for anything FTP and SFTP, I would recommend either Fetch, or Transmit.  I don't know if there's a workaround to getting MacFUSION to work on Mavericks, sorry.
