How do I type the prime and double prime characters on OS X? <body> When typing in feet and inches, the prime code′/code and double prime code″/code symbols are used, e.g. code5′ 5″/code. How do I type these characters?  <answer55192> I don't know if it's the easiest way, but here's one way:  In the "International" system preferences, turn on the keyboard layout called "Unicode Hex Input".  When you need to type a prime, type kbdcommand/kbdkbdspace/kbd to switch to this keyboard layout, and then hold down kbdoption/kbd and type kbd2/kbd kbd0/kbd kbd3/kbd kbd2/kbd.  For double prime, it's kbd2/kbd kbd0/kbd kbd3/kbd kbd3/kbd.  <answer85478> strongCharacter Palette/strong  hr  ´ (prime): code2032/code  ˝ (double-prime): code2033/code  (thanks to Paul Berkowitz)  strongUnicode Hex Input Keyboard/strong  hr  ´ (prime): kbdoption/kbd kbd2/kbd kbd0/kbd kbd3/kbd kbd2/kbd  ˝ (double-prime): kbdoption/kbd kbd2/kbd kbd0/kbd kbd3/kbd kbd3/kbd  (thanks to @Ken's answer)  <answer103389> On my new MacBook Air 2013 running Mountain Lion…  Press kbd⌥ alt/option/kbd + kbdE/kbd to get single prime. code´/code  Press kbd⇧ shift/kbd + kbd⌥ alt/option/kbd and kbdG/kbd to get double prime. code˝/code  <answer112076> Using the Character Viewer, search for "Prime". You can then click "Add to Favorites" for more convenient access.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/E3BtJ.png" alt="enter image description here"  In Mavericks, the following shortcut is helpful to bring up the character viewer:      Control + Command + Spacebar   Click the button in the top right corner to switch between the "Characters" window and "Character Viewer". Note: to get that button or the search bar to appear, you'll need to scroll up.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/tCTS7.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer112229> Using the character palate is definitely the way forward, but instead of typing "prime" in the search box, which presented me with accented apostrophes, I found typing "apostrophe" gave me exactly what I needed.  <answer112259> h2Modify the Press &amp; Hold keys/h2  For entering special characters such as the primes, I prefer the Press &amp; Hold method since it's easy to remember and really quick if you shorten the Press &amp; Hold time.  ol liNavigate to codeSystem/Library/Input Methods/PressAndHold.app/Contents/Resources//code./li liBackup the codeKeyboard-en.plist/code file./li liAppend the following to the codeKeyboard-en.plist/code file (before the closing code&lt;/dict&gt;&lt;/plist&gt;/code).  precode&lt;key&gt;Roman-Accent-t&lt;/key&gt; &lt;dict&gt;     &lt;key&gt;Direction&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;string&gt;right&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;key&gt;Keycaps&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;string&gt;t ′ ″ ‴&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;key&gt;Strings&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;string&gt;t ′ ″ ‴&lt;/string&gt; &lt;/dict&gt; /code/pre/li /ol  Feel free to change the codeRoman-Accent-t/code to any character you wish, providing it does not already have Press &amp; Hold keys assigned.  <answer126334> ul likbdOpt-e/kbd PRIME ´/li likbdOpt-j/kbd DOUBLE PRIME ˝/li /ul  <comment63332> the ` is officially known as a [grave accent](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grave_accent) <comment63333> Really? I thought ' and " were feet and inches. <comment63334> (With ‘’ and “” for quotes.) <comment63346> The character viewer could help with this as well. <comment63359> @davisgeek  I think your comment must have been intended for some other question? <comment63360> @timothymh ' and " are "straight" or ascii quotes, the others you mention are "curly".  Wikipedia entries for feet and inches explain that prime/double prime is the most correct symbol for these. <comment63366> @TomGewecke OK! You learn something new every day I guess. :) <comment98512> The keyboard shortcuts are wrong.  These give you the acute accent and the double acute accent (00B4,02DD) and not prime and double prime. <comment98654> @TomGewecke care to provide the correct answer? <comment98682> It's already here in the answer provided by Ken and the comment there.  There isn't any keyboard shortcut, you have to use the Unicode Hex layout or Character Viewer. <comment98954> @TomGewecke ah, I see. It was unclear which part was incorrect. Also, it's nice to have a single consolidated correct answer. <comment98957> Yes, good idea. <comment131772> You can't get the prime symbol by typing apostrophe, so why are you posting this as an answer to a question about how to get the prime symbol?  What did you use your apostrophe for? <comment147930> I tried it and it really works. <comment147936> Sorry, no, they may look the same to you, but these are not the right characters.  option-e produces the acute accent, option-j (US Extended layout) produces double accute accent. <comment147937> These are not the prime characters but the acute accent and the double accute accent. <comment148002> Actually, you don’t *need* to scroll up. Typing in the character viewer bring up the search field automatically. <comment165751> The character viewer is definitely the way to go!  On my machine it's Command + Option + T though.
