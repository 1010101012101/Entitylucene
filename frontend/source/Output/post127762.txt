Video plays in QuickTime but not in Itunes <body> This video plays just fine in Quicktime but in Itunes the video plays but the screen stays black. The audio however, does play just fine. I think my video has the right codec?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/VUpMT.jpg" alt="Video specs"  <comment149683> Could you try VLC? <comment149715> Yeah it works fine in VLC Mediaplayer too, nothing wrong, just not in itunes. I do have to say it was original a mkv file but i converted it with handbrake to mp4
