How can I open the .dmg install window on top of everything? <body>    strongPossible Duplicate:/strongbr   When opening a DMG file, how do I get it to open up in front of the windows?       Whenever I open up a .dmg file, it just gets opened, but it stays under everything that I've got open.br Right now I would have to launch Mission Control to see the opened .dmg window and then click on it, to become visible at the top.  How can I set it up to behave in a way, that when I open up a .dmg file, it gets displayed on top of everything?  <answer33785> That's a Finder (on Lion) issue and as such, there are no settings to tweak for your problem.  A faster way to reach the mount window is to simply click the Finder icon in your Dock.  <comment38563> Thanks for the answer. So you wanna tell me the devs didn't think that a .dmg that i WANT to open , should be in the front for me to see after I click it ?? And rather have me going to some other place first, even if I clicked the icon so I can install it ?? <comment38564> Not really, I would consider it a Lion related bug. A dev overlook. <comment38565> Ok. I hope I can find a fix for it. <comment38573> This isn't a Lion bug, this issue was in Snow Leopard too. <comment40265> Only in Lion for me.
