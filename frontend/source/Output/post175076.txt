But everytime I double click on the file it keeps giving this message:  Cannot start source application for this object. There may not be enough space in memory.  How can I open the .zip file? I have downloaded the unarchiver and also OpenXMLConvertor.But I dont know how to use them to extract the file.   I have Microsoft Excel 2011 (Version 14.0.0) and MAC OS X mountain lion, 64 bit , macbook air (2013). Kindly help   <answer175078> The thing is - all Microsoft Office documents are ZIP files containing XML files. I would try this:  ul licopy the XLSX to another location/li liRename the copy by addin ".zip" to it (ignore the warnings)/li liunzip the copy with your favourite tool (Unarchiver or terminal "unzip ")/li lilook through the folder structure and find your zip file./li /ul  <comment206485> Hi I did as you said. Within the folder structure I got an embeddings folder , opened that and unzipped the file. But now I have a compObj and native file. What should I do now?How do I make it readable?? :( <comment207161> I have Office 365 mac 2011 edition and I didn't find any possibility to add a ZIP file as an embedded object to replay your problem. :-(  Sorry for that. So my help is a deadend. :-(
