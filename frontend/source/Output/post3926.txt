iPhone 4 - sound only comes out of one speaker <body> I have notices that sound only comes out of one speaker on the bottom of my phone. Is it playing in mono or is the other "speaker" actually a microphone?  <answer3928> The iPhone 4 only has one speaker. The matching screen on the other side of the phone is for the microphone.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/TzIMB.jpg" alt="alt text"  <comment3742> This is also the case for the iPhone 2G, 3G and 3Gs. <comment3746> We learn something new every day. Thank you :) <comment3748> iPhone 2G, 3G, 3GS are **almost** the same: on those, the speaker is left and the mic is right. <comment141601> I've had an iPhone 4 for over three years and somehow never noticed this until just a few days ago. I thought I had damaged it somehow â€“ that's a relief!
