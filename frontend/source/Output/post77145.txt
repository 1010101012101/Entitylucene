Customize Change Spaces Shortcut in Mountain Lion <body> I have a Logitech mouse that is supposedly "unsupported", but I'd like to be able to click the mouse wheel left and right to switch spaces left and right. I figured out that Mountain Lion is interpreting these clicks as codecontrol + page up/code (click mouse wheel left) and codecontrol + page down/code (click mouse wheel right), because my IDE (Eclipse) switches text editor tabs when I click left and right. (See https://stackoverflow.com/a/2332440).  How can I map kbdcontrol/kbd + kbdpage up/kbd / kbdcontrol/kbd + kbdpage down/kbd to change spaces left and right?   There isn't a clear way to do this in System Preferences. I'm comfortable doing some codedefaults writes/code from Terminal, but I don't know where to start.  <answer77147> Have you tried BetterTouchTool to achieve it?  <comment89474> Nope. I hadn't heard of it, but it is exactly what I was looking for!
