How can I set up a keyboard shortcut for switching input source? <body> I have to change my language option very often. It is hard when I write something with combination of both "emEnglish/em" &amp; "emBangla/em", because I have to change that option rapidly.  Is there any way to set a keyboard shortcut, so that I can change my language option by it while typing?  I am using MacBook Pro with OS X.   Here is a screen shot:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/IRT6d.jpg" alt=""  Screen Shot of my Preference:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lA2gm.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer135373> Go to strongSystem Preferences/strong → strongKeyboard/strong → strongShortcuts/strong → strongInput Sources/strong and define a keyboard shortcut there. As you only have two sources, set a single shortcut for one of the options, then pressing the shortcut will toggle the input sources.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zVL7t.png" alt=""  <answer171879> If you are using Apple's Bangla keyboard, you can type English by holding down the Option/alt key.  If you are using Bangla Qwerty, you can do this by pressing the Caps Lock key.  <answer191994> Here is the official answer from Apple: https://support.apple.com/kb/PH18448  <answer243962> Open System Preference and click language and text instead of keyboard. You can find input source there.   <answer266298> grgarside's answer was great.  Here is an another solution for multilingual user. If you want to switch among three or more input methods quickly or switching to a specific input method by shortcut directly, you may try IMEShortcuts (disclaimer: I'm the IMEShortcuts creator)  It allows you map a shortcut to a input method. You can switch to a specific method immediately by you-defined shortcut without using cmd+space to rotate input methods. It works well on OSX 10.9 ~ 10.12.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ODjch.png" alt="enter image description here"  Please have a try, I'm glad to hear your feedback. Thanks  <comment160446> Thanks for your comment. :) But unfortunate thing is there is no **"Input Sources"** option in my "Keyboard" section, in preference. :( Watching your interface it seems like you are not using OSX 10, isn't it? Can you have any solution for OSX 10?  I am attaching the screen shot of "Preference" to my main question. Please take have a look. <comment160447> @Tulon X means 10 in OS X. I am running OS X 10.10 Yosemite but the interface is the same in OS X 10.9 Mavericks. What version of OS X are you running? <comment160448> Ahh, ok....Yes, It's 10.8.5. :( <comment160449> @Tulon In Mountain Lion, the default keyboard shortcut for switching input sources is predefined as ⌥⌘Space. Going from memory, I believe the way to change it on 10.8 is in System Preferences → Language & Text → Input Sources → Input source shortcuts. <comment160455> Yes, i got it. After going to: `Preferences → Language & Text → Input Sources → Input source shortcuts` I see that the remain 2 options there: 01. "Select previous input source ⌘Space" & 02. "Select next input source in menu ⌥⌘Space"  are disabled. Because these two shortcut was used for **"Searching Spot light"**. After change this shortcut now it's working. Thanks a lot @George Garside. Have a nice day. Take my hug. :) <comment202290> I got it. Thanks for your answer. :) <comment228202> While this link may answer the question, it is better to include the essential parts of the answer here and provide the link for reference. Link-only answers can become invalid if the linked page changes. <comment228238> Wrong OS version, wrong language.  Delete it. <comment234161> @Tulon, any particular reason why you've chosen to not upgrade to the latest and greatest version of OSX? <comment235021> @PerLundberg I am not sure why you ask this question, but I always upgrade my OSX version whenever apple release a new one. Like right now I am using the latest one I am pretty comfortable with the solution of this particular post. - Thanks <comment235718> @Tulon, alright. I was just wondering since it looked like you were still running 10.8 even though Mavericks and Yosemite had been released. <comment235834> @PerLundberg Ohk...Take have a look on post date of this question. 18th June 2014. :) <comment237496> @Tulon Sorry, good point. :) Yosemite wasn't out yet, but Mavericks had been released for half a year. Anyway, this is clearly a "side track" so we can close it now if you like. Cheers. :) <comment300528> Welcome to Ask Different.  We like answers to be more than just a single line.

[Karabiner](https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/), [MLSwitcher](https://bluezbox.com/mlswitcher2.html) are both great input method switcher. <comment360848> Karabiner is no longer working on Sierra.
