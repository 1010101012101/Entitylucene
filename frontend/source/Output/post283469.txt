What does the phone icon in call logs on iOS mean? <body> In this screenshot, the number marked in red has an icon. Is this a Incoming or an outgoing call?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/XCHiB.png" alt=""  <answer283470> See the little phone icon (with the arrow going out) next to the number?  That indicates it was an outgoing call.    strongAn incoming call will have no icon./strong  I can't tell you how the call was made.  Even calls that contain errors (mis-dialed numbers) will be in this list so maybe it was someone calling the wrong number?  <comment357399> Ok, clear, so there is nopossibility this is an incoming or incoming cancelled call ? Just to be sure .... <comment357419> The icon _indicates it was an outgoing call. An incoming call will have no icon_. This is fact, not conjecture.
