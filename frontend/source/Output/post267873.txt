External disk won't mount on a Mac <body> I have a Samsung M3 Portable External Drive that I use for Time Machine only. All of a sudden it refused to mount and Disk Utility cannot see it. Disk Warrior can see it but refuses to repair it as it reports a hardware fault with the drive. But when I plug the drive into my Chromebook it mounts immediately and I can look at all the files on it.   I'm running OS X El Capitan 10.11.6 on a Mac mini. What can I do to get this disk to mount on my Mac?  <comment336188> The OS on a Chromebook may not be as stringent about mounting defective block devices as OS X is and why it mounts on it and no longer under OS X. Back in my Windows days I used to recover data from Windows HDD's that wouldn't mount any more under Windows but would under Linux because it was less stringent about mounting defective block devices compared to Windows. I'd recover any data that's important to you before the device fails completely.
