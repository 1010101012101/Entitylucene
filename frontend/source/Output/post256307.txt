How can I open NotesV4.storedata in latest Notes app 4.2? <body> My Mac is OS X El Capitan.br My Notes App version is 4.2 (555.10.42).br I have NotesV4.storedata file(with -shm, -wal files) which comes from my previous old Mac machine.br I hope to open old Notes app data in my current Notes App on my new Mac OS X El Capitan machine.br When I visit /Users/~/Library/Containers/com.apple.Notes/Data/Library/Notes folder, I can see NotesV6.storedata file.br So I renamed my NotesV4.storedata file to NotesV6.storedata and store it in above folder.br Then I opened the Notes app, but I cannot see any data.br Any advice?  <comment319640> Are you getting any errors?  What's the output in Console, does it show anything that can help?
