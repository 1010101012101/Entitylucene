I've tried that so many times but never recieved any email from apple for me to reset the password.  Anyone please help! I've check the spams and everything but nothing at all from apple.   <answer57347> The best and easiest way, shoot a mail to the Apple support team.  They will revert back to you asking a couple of personal information questions, and once they are convinced you are the rightful owner of the account, they can enable/unlock your account.  <answer87675> All you do is go to https://iforgot.apple.com and you can go through several paths to attempt to reset your password.  <comment102517> What mail address is the "Apple support team" and does it change for accounts in different countries? <comment102518> What's the apple email for support?
