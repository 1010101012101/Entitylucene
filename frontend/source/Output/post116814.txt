CPU lights Xserve 2009 Mavericks Server <body> I have a 2009 Xserve and just upgraded from snow leopard server to mavericks server.  The CPU lights on the front of the unit are no longer functioning.  I have tried the steps that are listed in this post:  Xserve CPU Status LED&#39;s under Mountain Lion  but to no avail.  Does anyone know if it's possible to bring back their functionality?
