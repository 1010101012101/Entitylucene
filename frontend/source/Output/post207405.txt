as a designated ipad 3 with Cellular <body> I downloaded iOS 9.0 on website Apple. There is one iOS 9 for iPad 3, it for iPad 3 with wi-fi, but I need iOS for iPad 3 Wi-Fi with Cellular. Where can I download it?   <comment250133> Download: as in to a device other than the iPad?  On the iPad just use Software Update in the settings app. Is this for developing?  Please clarify your question. <comment250134> @bjbk I need simple iOS 9.0.1 but I face with problem that my iPad is restarting itself after 5 minutes or 2 minutes due to this I cannot update it in the iTunes or by Wi-Fi. <comment250135> @bjbk http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/207134/ipad-3-with-cellular-itself-is-restarting <comment250136> I see.
