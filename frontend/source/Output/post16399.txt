How can I find out what is deleting my ~/.Trash folder? <body> Some application or action is deleting my ~/.Trash directory. I obviously don't know when this happens, save for the "Are you sure you want to delete..." dialog box.   I can restore the Trash, by restarting the Finder, as per this question, but I would like to figure out what is doing this.  Is there a way to monitor a directory (i.e., .Trash) and determine when it changes? So when my Trash is deleted, I'll know.  <answer16402> you can do this from the Terminal.app  precodesudo fs_usage -f filesys | grep ~/.Trash /code/pre  will list all processes what accessing Trash - try it - enough click on the Trash icon and you will get tens of line for "Finder".  <answer16405> ul liOpen Terminal.app/li liType in (or better copy-paste ;): codecurl https://raw.github.com/gist/1043757/9b55d3ae174ea40a1ff3b031fec7f87c5a58aa0d/gistfile1.d &gt; usage.d/code /li liExecute codesudo dtrace -s usage.d/code/li /ul  This will display every file deletion on your system. If you want to only display the deletion of "~/.Trash", add code| grep .Trash/code to the last command.  <comment17924> Do I start this process and leave it running? Then wait for .Trash to show up? <comment17933> Yes, you need to keep this running. <comment233485> This link is dead, making this answer useless, can anyone update it?
