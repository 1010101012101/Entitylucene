What is this key, and where is it on a MacBook Air? <body> This is a picture of a tooltip from IntelliJ IDEA. Does anyone know what key is being referred to? I don't have anything like it on my MacBook Air.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/axiZq.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer105512> It is the symbol used for the escape key (kbdesc/kbd), located on the upper left corner of pretty much any keyboard, MacBook Air included.
