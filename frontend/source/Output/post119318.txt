OS X 10.9.1, Mail 7.1; Mail: Mail rules reset with restart <body> I am trying to use junk mail custom actions to add additional tags to mail identified as junk. I also unset the "Sender of message is in my Previous Recipients" option. I am finding that each time I close and then restart Mail my custom actions are reset and, also, the "Sender of message is in my Previous Recipients" option is set back to on. This happens reliably. * How can I reliably diagnose and/or fix this problem?   <answer134669> Uncheck the box marked strongDocuments &amp; Data/strong in the iCloud preference pane.  Then try to set up the rules and test it again.
