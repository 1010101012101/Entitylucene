Can I safely remove /usr/bin/java from Mountain Lion 10.8.2? <body> If I do so, will something, such as a service, break?   <answer82383> Mac App Store apps and OS X core applications and services don't depend on Java, but some 3rd party applications (like LibreOffice) do, and they will break if you delete code/usr/bin/java/code.  Since code/usr/bin/java/code is a symlink:  precode/usr/bin/java -&gt; /System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions/Current/Commands/java /code/pre  if you notice that an application complains about missing Java or fails to start after deleting code/usr/bin/java/code simply recreate it like this:  ol liOpen ApplicationsUtilitiesTerminal/li liMake the symlink (type your password if asked):  precode$ sudo ln -s /System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions/Current/Commands/java /usr/bin/java /code/pre/li /ol  <comment94991> It's safe provided you also remove any plist in Application Support and Preferences folders that reference /usr/bin/java. <comment94995> Why would you need/want to remove it? <comment97412> However removing just /usr/bin/java will not add to any form of security as many apps use the /System/.../java path <comment97589> It is still unclear why the OP wants to remove `/usr/bin/java`, but if it is security related and many apps use the `/System/Library/...` path as you say (could you provide some more information about that? is it an Apple recommendation?), then no, it won't increase security much.
