Can MacBook iSight camera be turned on without light on new MacBook 2015 edition? <body> With previous MacBooks, the light can be turned off while the camera is on. With new MacBook Pros, like the 2015 edition, is it possible to turn on camera without light. Is it hardwired? Should I be worried if avast scan reported: JS:ScriptPE-inf[Trj] which I removed. Can it access webcam feed, and if so then how easily? I'm getting paranoid.
