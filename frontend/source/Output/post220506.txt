consequences of `sudo rm` apps that shipped with the OS (like Photos, Messages, Mail) <body> I've got numerous OSes installed on my Macintosh laptop for certain reasons. So I'd like to be as lightweight in my OS X as possible. What are the consequences of codesudo rm -rf/code'ing  the following application that are allegedly unmodifiable/deletable because emit’s required by OS X/em?  I am not a photographer so I don't really need  precodePhotos.app Maps.app "Image Capture.app" "Photo Booth.app" /code/pre  For communication I use emails mainly and I much prefer mutt so I'd like to get rid of  precodeMail.app Messages.app Contacts.app /code/pre  I use vim mainly (and atom &amp; Xcode occasionally) so I'd also like to get rid of   precodeTextEdit.app Notes.app "Utilities/Script Editor.app" /code/pre  I also don't see myself ever using  precodeCalculator.app Calendar.app Dashboard.app "DVD player.app" "Game Center.app"  iBooks.app Reminders.app Stickies.app "Time Machine.app" /code/pre  These are what I use OS X mainly for   ol liiOS development (sometimes)/li liWeb development: mainly to test browser compatibility/li liUpdating the firmware/li /ol  So would I break anything important if I delete all the applications mentioned above?  <answer220522> I wouldn't expect deleting the applications from the "/Applications" folder to break anything for you. Mostly because any part of these applications that is used by other applications will be stored in other locations like the "/Library" or "/System/Library" folder.  Having said this, I don't see any real benefit to deleting these applications. When Apple release an update for the operating system there is a good chance that it will restore a good portion of the files that you've deleted.  If you aren't using these applications the only benefit I can see to deleting these files is getting you back a little bit of hard drive space. I would recommend not deleting them from "/Applications", and just in case, I would strongSTRONGLY/strong recommend against deleting anything from the "/Library" or "/System/Library" folders.  <comment266917> The applications you've listed use about 200 MB in /Applications, so it's probably not worth the trouble anyway. <comment266922> Glad to discover a mutt user on Mac OS X ;). Great professional tool! <comment266923> You don't risk anything removing the exact applications you indicated. Be warned Apple Update will restore them unless you let impossible to remove empty files with the expected name. <comment266929> @danielAzuelos I see. Thanks
