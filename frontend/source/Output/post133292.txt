No Filter in Pixelmator <body> I have been reading tutorials on Pixelmator where "Filter" is used. On all tutorials I have read there is a "Filter" option in the menu tab, but on mine "Filter" is missing. I tried searching for "Filter" in the help menu but there are no results.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wbWUF.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer133293> Pixelmator filters can now be found in the Effects browser -- see this thread for more information.  <answer133294> The Filter menu changed location in the recent update from v2 to v3. The filters are now in the strongEffects Browser/strong.  A thread on Pixelmator's support site mentions the change.  <comment157947> did you check the preferences?
