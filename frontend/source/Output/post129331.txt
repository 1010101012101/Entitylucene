Remove accepted self-signed certificate from iOS Safari <body> I was experimenting with self-signed certificates and while viewing my website from Safari on an iPhone I first got the warning that it is an untrusted site and I could review the details of the certificate. I then tapped the "Accept" button in the top right corner and continued to browse the site. Now Safari is not asking me again when visiting my site. No matter if I clear history or go to Safari settings and choose emClear Cookies and Data/em and even If I restart my phone.    Obviously there is an option to completely reset all iPhone settings but that is highly inconvenient to just remove a certificate you no longer need.    Am I missing something? Is there a way to remove that particular certificate?  <comment151377> did you look for it in your keychain ? <comment151380> I do not use iCloud keychain. So is there a place or method on the iPhone to view its built-in keychain? <comment151390> Settings - General - Profiles <comment151392> Not there... :-/ I only see "iOS Team Provisioning" listed there.
