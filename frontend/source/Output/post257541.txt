Bash Script which calls osascript stops working when run by launchd <body> I am trying to troubleshoot a problem with a bash script that gets called  by launchd.  Here's a quick summary  ul liCalling the script manually by itself works fine with no errors.  /li liWithin the bash script it calls an AppleScript that posts a notification  That AppleScript works fine./li liThe code.plist/code gets loaded and kicks off at the correct interval and calls the bash script.  So that works properly/li liThe code.plist/code is called from code/Library/LaunchDaemons/code (so it can run regardless if anyone is logged in or not).  strongThis means everything is run as root./strong/li /ul  The problem occurs within the bash script which calls an AppleScript to post a notification - it just never happens.  precode#!/bin/bash # ------------------------------------------------------------------   sleep 11                            echo "This is a test" &gt; test.txt    /usr/bin/osascript /Users/allan/Documents/Scripts/AppleScript/notify.scpt "This is a test" "-Test Test Test" "nosound"  exit 0 /code/pre  That's it.  A quick summary of what I am doing:  ol licodesleep 11/code - launchd needs a min. of 10 seconds of program execution time by default.  I just put this in here to accommodate launchd/li licodeecho "This is a test"/code - I just write a simple string to a text file to make sure the bash script is getting called.  emThis file gets created with the expected string/em; this works./li licode/usr/bin/osascript /Users......blah blah blah.../code strongthis fails/strong.  This is just a simple AppleScript that takes three arguments (body, title, and sound) to provide a notification.  /li /ol  Running by itself or bash script that calls it, it works:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Wb3Rs.png" alt="enter image description here"  When the bash script is called from launchd it seems to just not work.  Can anyone point me in the right direction?  What am I missing?  (OS X 10.11.6)  hr  This is the code.plist/code I am using (yes I know it's set for a 45 second interval...I'm testing)  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt; &lt;!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"&gt; &lt;plist version="1.0"&gt; &lt;dict&gt;     &lt;key&gt;Label&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;string&gt;com.user.podcastCleanup&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;key&gt;Program&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;string&gt;/Users/allan/Documents/Scripts/Unix/podcastCleanup.sh&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;key&gt;StartInterval&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;integer&gt;45&lt;/integer&gt;     &lt;key&gt;WorkingDirectory&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;string&gt;/Users/allan/Documents&lt;/string&gt; &lt;/dict&gt; &lt;/plist&gt; /code/pre  hr Following is the codenotify.scpt/code AppleScript that is used to generate the notification.  precodeon run argv      set Message to item 1 of argv     set Title to item 2 of argv     set aud to item 3 of argv     set STitle to "Terminal"     set Snd to "Blow.aiff"       if (aud = "sound") then          display notification Message with title Title subtitle STitle sound name Snd     else         display notification Message with title Title subtitle STitle     end if  end run /code/pre  <answer257550> h1Graphical User Session Required/h1  The error occurs because the commands in your codeosascript/code require a graphical user session. AppleScript requires a graphical user session to work.  The codelaunchd/code job is running as the coderoot/code user in a non-graphical user session.  h2Alternative Approach/h2  In these situations, the typical approach is to split daemons in two parts â€“ one computer wide and another within each graphical user session. A pipe or socket is frequently used to communicate.  Even as coderoot/code user, there are barriers that can not be crossed in macOS.  <comment321632> Please add the scpt and the plist. I'm too lazy to create it! <comment321648> No problem to get this running in 10.11.6 as ~/Lib/LaunchAgent - even with sleep set to 1 and StartInterval to 10 without any error. Please check the paths in the plist and is the sh executable? <comment321652> As /Lib/LaunchDaemon the launchd error is "osascript[12982:35171] CFPasteboardRef CFPasteboardCreate(CFAllocatorRef, CFStringRef) : failed to create global data" <comment321657> @Allan to fix it please try to load it from ~/Library/LaunchAgents/ <comment321681> @klanomath - Tested as `Library/LaunchAgent` and it works fine, but I need  it to run regardless if I am logged in or not. <comment321684> This makes sense now that you explain it.  Since I need it to run regardless if I am logged in or not, I can't do what @MateuszSzlosek suggested.  What I will do is write the "result" to a text file that will be processed by another script that generates notifications when  I am  logged in...or something to that effect.
