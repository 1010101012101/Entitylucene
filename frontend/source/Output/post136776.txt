Amazon Music App <body> I downloaded two albums from Amazon to the Amazon music app on my iphone. I realise now I can only play them back with a network connection.   My iTunes is version 11.2 and I run Windows XP.  Is there any way I can transfer them to my computer/itunes library?  <answer136806> If you go to your Amazon Music Library and log in, you should be able to select tracks and a download button will appear.  There is an app you will have to download, I'm not sure if it will run on Windows XP though.  <comment162376> What OS and version is your computer and iTunes? <comment162377> Just upgraded by itunes to the latest version and Windows XP
