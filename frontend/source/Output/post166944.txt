Navigate directly to particular elapsed time into movie using iMovie? <body> I have video of my son's sports games.  During each game, when he makes a good play, I note the elapsed time (like 3:17, or 3 minutes 17 seconds in).  Later, once I've transferred the videos from the iPad back to my Mac, I want to strongnavigate directly to that instant emwithout scrolling/em/strong.  I just want to say to iMovie, "go to 3:17".  How can I do that?  TIA, Matthew
