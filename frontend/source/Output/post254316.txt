Online restore not working <body> I've got a macbook, with a blank HDD.  I am trying to reinstall OS X Mavericks using recovery mode, but this fails for me.    It starts downloading essentials, and tells me it will restart automatically. When its done downloading, I get back to the main menu, where I can choose to use time machine, disk tool, reinstall etc.    When I check disk manager the HDD is still empty.   Anyone got any ideas?  Using a recovery USB made from another Mac, with a DMG of OS X Mavericks, I get the following:       The installer encountered an error that caused the installation to fail. Contact the software manufacturer for assistance   <comment316580> Using what tool did you mount OS X Mavericks image on your USB drive? Do you remain stable connection for all the time during online recovery? <comment316582> I used restore from Disk Utility <comment316586> Are the HDD and HDD cable tested and known good? <comment316592> I am currently running bad blocks from a Ubuntu live USB, no errors at 94% <comment316602> Bad blocks found no errors <comment316608> Can you just use Internet Recover to install a clean version of Mavericks then restore from the USB? <comment316610> Yeah, internet recovery may be the way to go. If not, perhaps use target disk mode to install from the other Mac? <comment316625> Internet recovery downloads what it needs, then returns to the main menu without installing anything. I tried to install ubuntu, which also failed.. it seems to be a harddisk problem ( at least i ruled it as such), based on ubuntu install having problems making partitions, and cleaning files of the partitions. Either way i will not be looking more into this now, as the macbook is rather old :) Thanks for your help anyways!
