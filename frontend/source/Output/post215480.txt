Using Configurator 2, Prepare Device Without Changing iOS Version <body> I essentially have an updated version of this question: How do I prepare a new device in Configurator without updating the device iOS?  I have an iOS 9.0.2 device. I want to Prepare and Supervise it with Configurator 2, but do not want to update the device to iOS 9.1. With the old Configurator, this was possible (see answer to linked question).  Does anyone know if there is a similar way to do this with the new Configurator 2?  <answer217657> It seems that the way Apple wants you to do this is described here:     strongUpdate iOS beta software/strong br/br/   You can use Apple Configurator 2 to install beta versions of iOS software.      ul   liTo install iOS beta software on a device, select the device in the    device browser and drag the .ipsw file onto the device./li   /ul   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wKv7D.png" alt="enter image description here"  However, the specific use case described is for embeta/em versions of iOS. In my case, I wanted to install an emolder/em (than the newest public) version of iOS. It looks like the UI is the same for doing either.   When I attempted to prepare my device this way, the process failed with error codes:      Personalization failed: 4027 br/    Personalization failed: 3194   I am not clear whether this is because updating a device to less than the newest version is unsupported ... or there is some other problem. Therefore, I'm leaving this answer, but not accepting it as solved, should someone else have more to add.
