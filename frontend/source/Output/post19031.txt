Why do I have Apple certificates in my keychain? <body> Today, i looked over my codekeychain/code and was surprised to find out that i have several apple certificates as part of it. I wonder .. what is the significance of them and how could i have possibly gotten them?

They are used to verify things like software updates.  You can find them published on apple.com at the url below.  https://www.apple.com/certificateauthority/
