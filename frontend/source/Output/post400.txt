If you go the manual method, delete the preferences file as well./li libeg, steal or borrow a copy of OS 10.6. Most regular Mac users will have one archived (I have Mac OS's back to 6.5, although I am sad)./li lidrag a copy of Text Edit 1.7.1 (or earlier - 1.6 should work from OS 10.5) to your current applications folder./li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DPQrj.png" alt="enter image description here"  ul liSelect any text edit document, get info (CMD + I) and set Text Edit 1.7.1 as the default application to open this type of file. /li /ul  strongNote:/strong you may get an error message from Text Edit stating that it cannot save the file due to a permissions error. Don't worry, the file is being saved OK under OS 10.7+ and the false flag is due to an Apple change in the way newer versions of Text Edit auto-save. To suspend this reporting, you can soft hack Text Edit 1.7.1's behavior in terminal with the following command.  defaults write -app textedit ApplePersistence -bool false  defaults write -app textedit AutosavingDelay -int 0  Hope you find this tip helpful.  <answer277499> When I migrated from Windows to Mac OS X, what I really missed is the ability to emmove/em files with cut (kbdCtrl/kbd + kbdX/kbd) and paste (kbdCtrl/kbd + kbdV/kbd) (as opposed to emcopy/em and paste).  It turns out Finder has this capability as well, but it's more like 'copy and move': kbdCmd/kbd + kbdC/kbd and then kbdAlt/kbd + kbdCmd/kbd + kbdV/kbd.  <answer277500> Since El Capitan (OS X 10.10), the green button in the top left of a window does not resize the window as it used to, but instead turns it into full-screen mode.  To get the old behavior back, hold down the kbd⌥/kbd key, which will turn the green button's symbol from the resizer to a code+/code as it used to be.  <answer277501> Pressing kbd⇧/kbd + kbd⌘/kbd + kbdW/kbd will close all windows of an application at once, in most apps.  <answer289142> You can drag-drop Finder objects (or any document window's proxy icons) strongemwhile/em/strong doing any of the following:  ul liApp-Switching (kbd⌘/kbd+kbdTab/kbd or kbd⌘/kbd+kbd⇧/kbd+kbdTab/kbd), /li liSpaces (kbd⌃/kbd+kbd→/kbd or kbd⌃/kbd+kbd←/kbd), /li liShow Desktop (kbd⌘/kbd+kbdF3/kbd), or /li liMission Control (kbd⌃/kbd+kbd↑/kbd)./li /ul  Combined with dropping into open/save dialogues, this means you'll never have to navigate to a file in one app and then navigate to the same file again in the open/save dialog. You'll also never have move windows around in order to drop a file into Safari.  Eg. I have an image open in Preview, and want to send it as an attachment in gmail.  ul liGmail pops open the "select attachment" file dialogue: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7Cf5k.png" alt="gmail file dialogue"/li liStart dragging the proxy Icon from Preview - don't let go of it img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rcqYt.jpg" alt="start dragging proxy icon"/li liWhile emcontinuing to drag the file/em, switch apps with kbd⌘/kbd+kbdTab/kbd.  ul liKeep holding kbd⌘/kbd, but release/hit kbdTab/kbd or kbd⇧/kbd+kbdTab/kbd repeatedly to get to codeSafari/code./li liLet go of kbd⌘/kbd once Safari is selected, to bring it to the front. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Q46D2.jpg" alt="App-Switcher while dragging"/li /ul/li liDrop the file onto the file dialogue, and it'll become selected. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/eqM9B.jpg" alt="drop icon into file dialogue" File is selected and ready to send. kbdReturn/kbd to finish selecting the file. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/eU8if.png" alt="file is selected and ready to send"/li /ul  If you save screenshots to the desktop, then a similar trick is useful with the "Show Desktop" keyboard shortcut (kbd⌘/kbd+kbdF3/kbd).  <answer289145> Quickly insert weird characters into text by setting Text-Replacement Keyboard Shortcuts for any characters you find in the "Emoji &amp; Symbols" panel.  I personally use LaTeX-style shortcuts, so typing code\arrowright/code gets replaced with →. Type a kbdSpace/kbd after the code\arrowright/code to do the replacement.  Set your shortcuts in codeSysPrefs/code  codeKeyboard/code  codeText/code img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ScaTK.png" alt="enter image description here"  You can copy/paste characters from anywhere into the codeReplace With.../code column. I prefer to double-click characters from the codeEmoji &amp; Symbols/code pane, so I know they're in the standard font packages. The codeEmoji &amp; Symbols/code pane can be enabled by selecting  codeSysPrefs/code  codeKeyboard/code  codeKeyboard (tab)/code  codeShow Keyboard and Emoji Viewers in menu bar/code  and then choosing codeEmoji &amp; Symbols/code in the resulting menu item: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qnAoT.jpg" alt="show emoji &amp; symbols"  <answer289146> Ever downloaded an app that Mac OS won't let you open because it's "emfrom an unidentified developer/em"?  Instead of completely disabling this security feature (via SysPrefsSecurity), try the following:  ul liRight-click the .app file/li lihold kbdShift/kbd while clicking codeOpen/code.  /li liThe resulting warning now has an code[Open]/code button, click it./li liThe warning is circumvented for this app only, but still enabled system-wide.

Gives very quick access to a google search.  I assume the search setting in Safari determines which search engine is used.  <comment399> +1 I really love this 3rs-party. <comment440> http://mac.finerthingsin.com/ is a great source of hidden gems on the Mac. <comment443> ya I really love this features, but it is not so hidden. <comment526> I'd rather describe it as "Having pressed cmd+shift+4, you can toggle between a crosshair snap and a full-window snap using spacebar". <comment538> Not working form me on a MacBook Pro with 10.5.8 <comment539> Can't up-vote enough! <comment636> How would you get it back into the dashboard? Would you have to delete it and then add again? <comment638> no click it and press f4 (show dashboard) and release widget. <comment739> And once you get used to this great feature, the Windows way of scrolling makes you mad (you have to click on the window so that it gets focus) <comment937> Thanks, I've always wanted this. <comment958> This is a great feature.  Using Command + Click you can even open Firefox links in new tabs without giving it focus. <comment1069> I didn't know about the "space" aspect -- very nice! <comment1070> Also useful in general for open/save dialogs. <comment1165> Related to this tip, option+any volume key will open the sound system preference pane, and shift+vol up/down will change volume silently (without the little plink sound.) <comment1246> Under the View menu, there's the "Show Path Bar" option which achieves a nice result. <comment1260> Yes, but having the POSIX in the title does away with the icons and extra space that get in the way of longer paths. Usually, I only see the icon folders and the names are either truncated or left out completely. Not terribly useful, really. <comment1321> Katmouse will do this for you on Windows.  I installed it a few years back and have been using it ever since. <comment1366> I wonder if the "Terminal Tips and Tricks For Mac OS X" thread from SU can be ported over: http://superuser.com/questions/52483/terminal-tips-and-tricks-for-mac-os-x <comment1370> @3rdparty, that would probably happen only after this site is out of beta... (though I don't know what the exact plan is with regard to these overlapping sites). <comment1372> Tried to add a few more but wouldn't fit as a comment - OP feel free to edit your answer: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/400/mac-os-x-hidden-features-and-nice-tips-tricks/1534#1534 <comment1375> more of the same here http://superuser.com/questions/15646/underused-mac-os-x-gui-features <comment1376> Holy crap. That is seriously a hidden gem. <comment1378> Following up on ghoppe, if you've turned off the preference for the little plink sound using Shift + Volume Up/Down will change the volume with the sound effects. <comment1379> Typing / or ~ in an open/save dialog will also trigger the file path text field to appear. <comment1385> I use this shortcut all the time for quick lookup of English word definitions (from the built-in New Oxford American Dictionary) <comment1386> I learned this from [dbr at Super User](http://superuser.com/questions/10676/permanently-deleting-files-on-mac-os/33164#33164), so props to him <comment1395> +1 for web forms with drag and drop. SUPER handy! <comment1396> Note: This is a Snow Leopard feature.  For Leopard users, you can use the quicklook droplet: http://www.macosxautomation.com/applescript/quickviewer/index.html <comment1397> Some systems have Dashboard tied to F12.  So basically, enable the feature, open Dashboard, select tool, then close Dashboard. You can "stow away" by clicking the widget while opening Dashboard. <comment1410> +1 I really love option trick to raise minimize I don't know this. <comment1411> @calavera Katmouse is awesome! You just made my day. <comment1419> This also works in open/save windows <comment1434> The same on the WiFi logo: displays more information about the hotspot you're connected to. <comment1436> Yeah, active corners are useful! Personally I also like to have Dashboard bound to one corner and screen blanking (Put Display to Sleep) to another. <comment1437> Funny, I checked the same thing when playing around with `say` yesterday... <comment1438> certainly a nice usability feat! <comment1444> You can also drag it into Terminal. <comment1930> I love this behavior and hate that in windows, if you try it, the file is moved to the folder that was showing in the dialog. Stupid! <comment1953> Unfortunately, the widget then appears above all Windows, which makes this not very useful <comment1965> Nice one! Really saves precious seconds. <comment1984> The link you gave (to Apple Human Interface Guidelines) is useful. Lots of interesting details to be learned from there (this was new to me: a dot in the (red) close button means there are unsaved changes). <comment1999> This works for the screen brightness as well: Option + Shift + Brightness Up/Down <comment2008> +1 - I use a mouse, but this is still my most used shortcut. <comment2165> You can also drag & drop files into File Open dialogs, and it will navigate to the appropriate dialog and highlight the file. <comment2166> I use "say" a fair amount -- scripts tell me when they're done, for example.  Handy. <comment2167> Option to raise minimize -- this only works for me if the application has no non-minimized windows.  I wonder if this is intentional behavior or a side-effect of something else? <comment2299> To my delight I just noticed that cmd + click (or cmd + enter) in Spotlight search results (and some other places) follows the same logic (= show in Finder instead of opening) <comment2300> Note that the shortcut for launching Spotlight is configurable in System Prefs. To my understanding the default is **Cmd + space**, not opt + space. <comment2312> This basically works like the command line `cd` command. Type `/...` to go to absolute paths, `~/...` for paths relative to the user directory and `...` for directories relative to the current directory. Great for opening hidden directories. <comment2313> @r00fus `Space` has always been the Quick Look launcher, even on 10.5. <comment2325> Same goes for the audio symbol and the bluetooth symbol. <comment2391> I find this quiet anoying - it there a way to cancel this behaviour. I see why it can be useful - yet I dont like it. <comment2582> The `Shift` trick can be used to slow down many kinds of animations, too. <comment2583> Here’s an example of the details that the speech engine gets correct http://daringfireball.net/linked/2007/10/28/alex <comment2680> +1 it's nice but it's not a real OS X hidden features it's good 3rd-party apps. <comment2681> @shaun can you put it's photo I can't find this in my OS X 10.6.4 <comment2684> I figured it would fall into the "nice tips & tricks" part of the thread :) <comment2685> Maybe is should have been... System Preferences = Keyboard = Keyboard Shortcuts Tab = set Full Keyboard Access to All Controls See: http://i.awe.to/HRA3 <comment2701> I cannot live without this...absolutely essential! <comment2853> That's neither a feature nor a nice tip or trick. <comment2854> Interesting, I use Wizmouse on my Windows PC <comment2866> deceze, correct, I mistakenly referred to a special use case, the "Find file Dialog"... had to use droplet in 10.5, but Space works fine in Snow Leopard. <comment3018> It's a nice trick <comment3040> Do you know of any updated icons for Snow Leopard? Love the functionality, but the icon is ugly next to the others. <comment3358> I don't understand rationale behind "Text boxes and lists only" setting being default. <comment3411> AppleDisplayScaleFactor http://www.macworld.com/article/142173/2009/08/scaleapps.html <comment3970> WOW!!!! I never knew this trick, thanks!!! <comment3976> Very very important to know! <comment3977> Great tip! Also, [Caffeine](http://lightheadsw.com/caffeine/) does the same thing but in a button in the menu bar, and can also prevent sleeping for a certain amount of time (and it's free). <comment3978> Wow, why didn't I find out about this sooner!? Thanks!! <comment3979> It's alt+shift+K on an English (American) keyboard. <comment4735> I wish I could double vote up. That's awesome. <comment4807> + 1 Awesome and funny trick. I like it ! <comment5902> After having been away from the Mac for a while (well, basically since OS9), the feature was initially confusing. Now I love it, but I had the wrong thing scroll for quite a while. <comment5903> OH MY GOD THIS IS AMAZING. I had no idea this existed! <comment6395> This doesn't work for me, I have to use Cmd+option <comment6436> Or for MacBooks where to press F5 you have to press the Fn key as well, you could just use the Esc button. (This is cool though, thanks for bringing it to my attention :)) <comment6524> You can achieve the same effect without using TinkerTool by entering this string `defaults write com.apple.dock no-glass -boolean YES` in the terminal. <comment6550> +1 Because I had to just come seek this out. <comment6583> One of my personal favourites - I use this *all the time*! <comment7978> I just test this, WOW I really love this one. <comment8004> `say -vz Droid` is deliciously ironic. XD <comment8736> these are emacs shortcuts more than they are bash i believe <comment9523> I don't get that behavior with Shift. Did you have to change an option to get hiding to work like that? <comment9533> @seh - No I didn't...at least I don't remember changing anything like this. This is on OS X 10.6.6, but I'm not sure if it's version related. Could also be that I've changed something while working on this SL installation, I haven't reinstalled since SL came out. <comment9556> Doesn't work for me (Leopard 10.5.8) <comment10480> `Esc` works too, but it more unsafe due to `Esc` usually having another function. But it works :). <comment10481> It's stunning how many people don't know about this. Of course, I remember when I was complaining about "how bad OSX's Alt Tab is, because it doesn't show all windows". Then I learned how to do it better. <comment10482> And it won't. This is Snow Leopard only. For Leopard I suggest checking out SoundSource: http://www.rogueamoeba.com/freebies/ <comment10483> Holding Alt/Option in the `Virtual Machine` window on VMWare Fusion gives you options to explicitly/forcefully kill the selected Virtual Machine. Instead of gracefully. (Read: Pull the plug instead of pushing the power button.) <comment10484> You know, I've never tried special clicks on the drag box. Thanks! <comment11150> Proxy icons are like the best thing ever. +1! <comment11154> Even better: If you type `killall Dock` in Terminal, without hitting enter, do this, then go back to Terminal and hit enter, the Dock is quit while the window is minimizing, leaving it in its animated state until next time you minimize it. <comment11156> Anything can be added to the Finder's toolbar. Mine contains a couple of applications and my trash. <comment11158> That is the default when staying on the same hard drive. Use option to copy on the same drive, and command and option to create an alias. <comment11164> This is awesome. <comment11223> On the tiny aluminium wireless keyboard - fn + backspace gives you del. fn + alt + backspace will delete the whole next word in that case. <comment11766> Alt: no such button. <comment11767> Too bad I never use the desktop for anything but storage devices. <comment11768> `ls | say` to say a list of files <comment11769> YES and NO are also possible instead of 1 and 0. <comment11770> You can also drag it to the app's Dock icon and Exposé will pop up with only that app's windows. <comment11771> Note that if you use it on a second display the colors may not be correct. <comment11772> I am actually typing this comment in a stuck window :p <comment11773> Wait, Adobe actually **did** read the HIG? <comment11774> Most of those are not Mac OS X-specific. <comment11775> @Radek: There is also Cmd+H for your home directory. <comment11845> it didn't work for me <comment11848> it's a nice trick <comment11849> Sorry, it’s Command not Option. Maybe it’s Snow Leopard only? <comment11850> I have snow leopard too but with command it didn't work either <comment11867> Works for me on 10.6.7, but maybe it's keyboard dependent? I have a Norwegian keyboard layout, where shift+period=colon. <comment11880> Yes, some old version of windows got that but then lost it forever, it's great <comment11881> A downside to this method, the space keystroke is actually sent to the active window, so once I tried to capture a window, pressed space, and that made the window change because of the space key and then my screenshot opportunity was ruined. There's a little chance that the window changed automatically in the exact moment I hit the space and everything I said is pure bullshit, so I don't know. <comment11882> @khedron this was an extremely great functionality I discovered just after switching from windoze. It's one of those features you don't know, but when you try them, they work as they should, as common sense would dictate. <comment11883> can the speech synth be used from a shortcut, as a service or otherwise than just form terminal? <comment11885> Wow the inverting shortcut is amazing! <comment11886> "I avoid using the mouse" Really? on the platform that *virtually* gave birth to the mouse? really? <comment11887> "OSX mouse doesnt feel quite as good as the windows mouse" ?? Heresy! <comment11888> If you [shift][command][G] on finder, you can type the hidden folder's path and browse it in finder as a normal visible folder. <comment11889> Shift . doesn't correspond to : in the US keyboard, maybe another distribution? <comment11891> the `say` command is a wrapper over the API to use it from Cocoa (see http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Cocoa/Reference/ApplicationKit/Classes/NSSpeechSynthesizer_Class/Reference/Reference.html) so I don't see see why it couldn't be used in a service. Also, the accessibility services (VoiceOver) use it as well <comment11905> Thanks!  BTW, I meant "navigate to the appropriate directory", not dialog.  Glad it was still useful. :-) <comment11924> Ah THAT's where it is! I set it in OS 10.4 and haven't been able to find it since! thanks :) <comment11936> That actually makes sense. If you turn on Keyboard Viewer and hold down kbdCommand/kbd, you will notice that also holding down shift, or not, does not make a difference. Hence the correct description of the keystroke is kbdCommand/kbd+kbdShift/kbd+kbd./kbd in all cases. I suggest you amend your answer accordingly. <comment11944> Heh. I forgot about the community wiki feature. I edited it myself. <comment11948> I use this all the time in combination with DTerm.  As well as "touch file.ext" to make text-based files quickly. <comment11954> Great. Hope some other people will notice it. <comment11960> This is not limited to OS X - this is a feature in many window managers on Linux / Unix - including the one I'm using right now :P <comment11990> I have this behaviour when I hold the Alt key instead. <comment12169> Those are indeed Emacs bindings; bash uses libreadline, which defaults to Emacs style. There are plenty of other bindings: CTRL+f / CTRL+b to move back and forward by character, and OPT+f / OPT+b to move by word (super useful!). Similarly, CTRL+d deletes the character to the right, and OPT+Delete deletes the word to the left. <comment12170> Legacy feature from NeXTStep. Thank you Apple. <comment12180> Hmmm the System Preferences need to have a option to choose vim bindings. <comment12181> I think I can remember the shortcut, then I just open Grab: CMD+SPACE, then type 'grab' and hit enter. <comment12182> I have to say, I turned off the genie effect almost immediately. <comment12184> I once read 'Option-click everything' <comment12185> I used Docker to get the little triangles back. I'm not a fan of the glowing orb. <comment12186> Gigabit Ethernet is great in not needing crossover cables for direct connections. <comment12187> I use it occasionally. I wished it was possible to disable antialiasing... To count pixels ;) <comment12188> Hmmm could it be possible that works only because first button is focused which is not the default OSX option? <comment12193> @Will Hardy `set -o vi` <comment12201> I think I love you. <comment12202> Doesn't work in FF4 ;) <comment12224> If you want the tiniest little bit of sound, you can turn the sound all the way down with "Volume Down" and then hit the "Mute" key to turn it up just a little bit. <comment12363> @Bluu: Instant Nerdgasm. 3 <comment12365> For this particular type of sheet, you can also press ⌘D to choose the Don't Save option. Unlike the space bar this works whether or not you have Full Keyboard Access enabled. <comment12368> Hacker News'd: http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2436198 <comment12371> @kyle since this news added the question's view grow so fast <comment12377> It's not a Safari thing: it's supported by any native text control. To name a random few: Spotlight search field, TextEdit, even Stickies. <comment12382> Unfortunately this doesn't seem to support special characters. For example, if I try to autocomplete a path that contains "ö", it doesn't work. If I write the whole path myself, it works just fine. <comment12383> Also, does anyone know how to use autocomplete without the focus jumping to OK if there was no match? <comment12398> Ubuntu also has this feature. <comment12400> Holy crap, this rocks! <comment12404> This also works for the network control (in snow). I'm not on my mac right now, can't add cap. <comment12405> When using the `open -a` construct with apps in the `/Applications` folder, also note that you don't need the `.app` extension nor do you need to match case. E.g., `open -a textedit` <comment12410> This one is my favorite. It's like a command line for the application. <comment12419> I've been using soundsource this whole time! Thank you so much for letting me clear up some oh-so-valuable space in my 15" macbook menu bar! <comment12420> This is also how you can change the icons for apps & other files in Finder.  Highlight a file, press Cmd-I, and drag a new icon onto the well. <comment12421> Also, if you click on the image well you can use Cmd-C and Cmd-V to copy the image for use elsewhere or paste a new image in. <comment12422> In the Finder it's Cmd-Shift-D to go to the Desktop. <comment12427> The only annoying bit is that you see the .DS_Store files EVERYWHERE, like on your desktop. <comment12430> really nice tricks <comment12434> @PCheese: Nice to know! <comment12435> @Petruza: The EditSpeech menu is found in most Cocoa apps. <comment12438> My button says alt on it. I know it's option, but it doesn't say that on it anymore. <comment12439> It's emacs feature and it's available on almost all operating systems http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/EmacsDoctor <comment12466> I believe you can also connect via a Firewire cable and network over that connection. (Not using one machine as a drive, but actually networking.) <comment12467> So glad people liked my work on Command-Comma. :) <comment12468> This is incorrect; space only performs "Don't Save" because it is highlighted, which will only happen if you have [full keyboard access](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/400/mac-os-x-hidden-features-and-nice-tips-tricks/3028#3028) enabled. Pressing the kbdtab/kbd key move focus elsewhere, and space will then perform that action. <comment12474> If you have a multitouch trackpad, you can also scroll horizontally by swiping two fingers left and right. <comment12475> This is the only reason I continue to use Safari rather than Chrome. <comment12480> If you hold CTRL while taking the shot, it is placed in your clipboard. <comment12481> In Finder:  **CMD-Shift-D**: Desktop **CMD-Shift-A**: Applications **CMD-SHift-H**: Home directory <comment12482> @Gordon: you are right, Ubuntu also has this feature. <comment12489> Uninstalling SoundSource… <comment12518> You can also use this to turn rich text (HTML/RTF/etc) into plain-text; just "pbpaste | pbcopy". <comment12540> `open -a AppName` also works for applications in `~/Applications`, or subfolders of either Applications directory. <comment12541> `cmd + \`` (not tilde, which requires shift) can also be used when the task switcher (cmd + tab) is active (continue to hold cmd), selecting the previous application rather than the next. <comment12542> When using cmd + tab, what option does is the equivalent of clicking the application's icon in the Dock. Typically, if the application has windows open and visible, it will simply switch to that application; if it only has minimized windows open, it will raise the most recently accessed window; if no window is open, it will open either a new document or the application's default window. <comment12572> @Lri All posts in this tread are community wikis. That means that anyone can edit them to improve them. Why don't you make an edit with the correction? <comment12578> thanks for the correction @eyelidlessness - it's actually not tilde, as that is only activated with shift.  updated the answer. <comment12589> I so wish this feature existed in the Finder itself, and not just the Open/Save dialog. I would LOVE to be able to enable hidden files temporarily, on-the-fly, as it were. <comment12597> It exists in the Finder plugin [TotalFinder](http://totalfinder.binaryage.com/). Maybe there are other plugins which do nothing else but add that feature. <comment12692> Annoying, but just realized/found out that I had a .htaccess file sitting on my desktop, so useful as well, even if temporary. <comment12878> Note that this only affects whether a 32 or 64 bit kernel is used. Both can still run 32 or 64 bit applications, and 64 bit applications are always the default if the processor is 64 bit. However, the default kernel is 32 bit because, as you have seen, some third-party extensions don't work with a 64-bit kernel yet. <comment13080> Not really a OS X tip, but an emacs tip. <comment13081> If you are a command line hacker, having caps lock as control is pretty essential in my book. <comment13151> For what? A little more explanation of how this is a tip or stick might make this a better tip <comment14230> Can it be removed like any other app? By drag 'n' dropping it off the dock? <comment14263> This is such a good feature. I remember when I first got my Mac and I was like, FINALLY scrolling that makes sense. Especially when you have dual screens and you don't want to have to click to activate a window just to scroll down a couple ticks. <comment14264> You just blew my mind. There have been times where I wished something like that opiton-drag thing worked but I figured no one would ever implement it. Now I need to remember what I would use this for :) <comment14285> This is especially useful for non-webkit based browsers for uploading files. <comment14298> If you have a Magic Mouse, you can also scroll horizontally by swiping one finger left and right. <comment14299> Why do your tabbar items and windows look so, different? <comment14300> @Danny Staple same for laptops and wired aluminum keyboards. <comment14334> You can also command-click to move a window without giving it focus. <comment14335> Works on 10.6 for me. <comment14339> That's quite awesome! <comment14378> Probably had something ugly like SnowTunes installed http://cristomac24.deviantart.com/art/SnowTunes-iTunes-OS-X-theme-141310715 Cant remember <comment14383> Drag and drop on OS X is just amazing. Pretty much works everwhere. <comment14485> One of the reasons to love OSX :D <comment15569> You can use alt+cmd+H too, without having to move the mouse <comment15659> I wish all programs implemented this key combination consistently. Evernote decided they needed to be "special" and use Cmd + Shift + V for paste-without-style. Grrrr. <comment15660> I would vote this up 10 times if I could. <comment15671> This is called Quick Look and is already posted: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/400/mac-os-x-hidden-features-and-nice-tips-tricks/573#573 <comment15672> It is Option/Alt key, not Shift. <comment15793> haha thanks! Indeed its one of my favourites too. I use it all the time! <comment16050> I didn't realize emacs was installed by default.  Thanks. <comment16135> @Redbeard0x0A: `say -v cellos droid` <comment18972> Also, you can hold alt over the widget to delete it. <comment21794> In Lion it's now in the context menu, plus you can double-tap with three fingers on a multitouch trackpad. <comment21796> Or right-click. <comment21837> Yeah I believe this is for Lion only. Nice tip though. <comment21869> I had it posted on the Lion tips & tricks thread (now deleted from the thread) - http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/18677/what-hidden-features-or-tips-tricks-are-in-mac-os-x-10-7-lion - (I couldn't remember if it was possible on Snow Leopard) - BUT there this comment was written "This was in snow leopard as well" - so I don't now what right and wrong, because I don't have Snow Leopard anymore for testing - what I know is that it is working as described in Lion. <comment21902> what determines which apps handle this? <comment21903> @vincent you can disable AA by first zooming then pressing option + command + \ but that has since been rendered obsolete in lion <comment21904> lol i used to invert the screen colours (control + option + command + 8) so that the flash is inverted to dark black rather than bright white <comment21907> Theres also a service to summarize text by right clicking a text clipping file or selected text. A wonderful replacement for word <comment22258> Quick Look in Lion handles both .textClipping and .pictClipping files with Apple-provided generators alone. <comment25468> @loic-wolff Yeah, they act just like an app without picture <comment25477> That's (negative) letter spacing or tracking. Kerning means adjusting the distance between pairs of characters specified by the font. <comment25529> @Lri thank you, fixed. I'm not a DTP guy :) <comment25558> I had no idea :D <comment26972> As of Mac OS X Lion 10.7, Terminal provides Services to do this. Enable **New Terminal at Folder** in **System Preferences  Keyboard  Keyboard Shortcuts  Services**. The quickest way to get there is to choose **[Application Menu]  Services  Services Preferences…**. There's also **New Terminal Tab at Folder**. These operate on folders in Finder, as well as pathnames selected in text in any application. You can also drag folders (and pathnames) onto the Terminal application icon in the Dock, or onto the tab bar of a terminal window to add a new tab. <comment26974> You can also use Copy/Paste instead of Drag & Drop. And since Terminal knows you copied a folder/file, it knows to automatically escape special characters for pasting into the shell. <comment26975> As of Mac OS X Lion 10.7, if you drag a folder or pathname onto a tab (rather than into the terminal view) it will automatically execute a complete "cd" command. <comment27142> Amazing! I didn't know about this one. <comment27143> Whoa!! Cool! I will definitely use this rather than SoundSource. <comment27144> I like the display sleeping one. Didn't know that! <comment27145> Great tip! I will probably keep that one handy. <comment27146> I love this one!! <comment29959> I use Alfred instead, I should try spotlight if it remembers things liek Alfred does. <comment32754> @Chris: Nice to know about new Lion functionality.  I still use the "cd to.app" tool to provide a button in the Finder window to make this fast, but it's good to have alternatives. <comment32755> @claytron: I have three control keys on my keyboard this way!  As a heavy emacs user, I think it's fantastic. <comment32756> Google Docs also deals with this weirdly.  In general, though, I find it very handy. <comment32920> Too bad this doesn't work in Chrome. :-( <comment33096> @khedron: Terminal will also open a terminal if you tell it to open a folder. So the script can be simplified to just `tell application "Terminal" to open ...` and all the stuff about checking whether it's running and issuing a `cd` command can be removed. <comment33682> Absolute lifesaver. <comment34364> Ctrl-Shift-Eject does this without filling your menubar. <comment35178> @bot47 Not exactly the same. Ctrl-Shift-Eject simply puts the display to sleep. Therefore (1) the password lock does not kick in until the Security time delay is reached (if password is even enabled in the first place) and (2) the display goes to sleep instead of screen saver mode, which as of Lion requires a keyboard button press or mouse click to awaken and takes slightly longer to respond to user input. <comment38982> You can execute the selected item by hitting Return. <comment38984> You can drag a folder to the dock icon too. <comment39255> And ⌘. should choose Cancel <comment40048> That is super useful to get things such as directory listings, listings filtered by grep, etc. Love it. <comment42311> This doesn't work for me. Is there something special you have to do first? <comment42822> This isn't a feature of OSX it is a plugin. <comment47064> And Quick Look supports animated gifs by default on Lion anyway. <comment50008> This doesn't work for me. <comment51766> `ls -alR / | say` <comment52420> From `man purge`: “force disk cache to be purged (flushed and emptied). Purge can be used to approximate initial boot conditions with a cold disk buffer cache for performance analysis. It does not affect anonymous memory that has been allocated through `malloc`, `vm_allocate`, etc.” <comment52421> I cannot get this to work either. Tested with Finder.app and Terminal.app windows. <comment52996> This is especially useful when typing FFFFFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUU, etc. <comment54360> `open -R file` to reveal the file in Finder <comment55481> Isn't the default keyboard command Ctrl+Space in recent versions of OS X? <comment57200> It's a trade-off.  I find it more irritating than helpful because it often makes it lots more keystrokes to get to the text boxes. <comment57203> Wow! Love being able to turn the volume up quietly!!!! <comment57204> Great for screencasts when you need to zoom in! <comment57205> Works in Google Chrome, but not in Firefox <comment70708> Instead of eject, you can use the power button. Useful for MacBook Airs that don't have an eject button. <comment93837> @LessPop_MoreFizz It can even handle a bit more than simple division, try `sqrt(10)`, `cos(10)` and so on. <comment93838> It's Alt+A on a Norwegian keyboard :) <comment95286> This is awesome!! <comment95287> Amazing!! I have used macbook for over a year and I don't even know it! <comment95291> great to hide window ! <comment106022> My collection of OS X tweaks (hidden or not) can be found here: http://mths.be/osx <comment107964> This is cool. Thanks :) <comment111085> @Vincent you can disable AA in Mac OS X 10.7+ by going to System Preferences - Accessibility - Zoom - Un-tick "Smooth Images". As XAleXOwnZX says, it used to be a very handy shortcut key for pixel-counting graphic designers, I want it back. <comment111091> This is equivalent to `start` on Windows <comment111103> caffeinate was recently added.. `man caffeinate` for more info <comment111104> This is NOT a hidden / useful feature. <comment111108> `ls -al ~ | say`, I think, is equivalently funny and wouldn't hang =) <comment111110> Three-finger-double-tap is incredibly buggy for me in Lion: doesn't work on most sites in Chrome, for example. <comment111114> Holding OPTION when over a hidden or minimised application will bring it back to the foreground when you let go. <comment111125> I always forget which one reboots, sleeps or shuts down. I just know that if I press everything, it shuts down. <comment111126> @simeon Thanks, been using that for a while now. More recently I (re)discovered xScope, which is way way much better to count pixels that this trick. *(and has also many other nice features..)* <comment111127> Cmd + Shift + V makes a hell of a lot more sense than Apple's ridiculous "claw" hotkey. <comment111131> This is amazing. <comment111138> omg, I think you just gave me a good tip to annoy my co-workers ;) <comment111146> Best part of this is to navigate faster in text files, e.g. hjkl in visual mode in vi. <comment111154> I installed Quicksilver and use ⌘+space for it instead. I haven't used Spotlight in a year or so. <comment111159> For a user who doesn't like taking their hands off the keyboard, I use this feature all the time. <comment111186> This is also possible with representations of files in most applications, you can for example drag a file from the download bar at the bottom of Chrome straight to an upload field. <comment111213> YOU ARE A GOD! This is amaze. <comment111226> @scubbo You can always ask a jeopardy question if you want to share an answer. In this case, you could ask as someone who wants a keyboard control for quitting an app rather than using the mouse. Your answer here (and the entire question) is buried inside "tips" and someone searching for this answer can't easily find it by how the site indexes questions over answers. <comment111253> This is handy, but I think it's too ugly to justify it's constant presence. I'll stick to the path bar. <comment111261> nice one, I didn't know that <comment112175> In a similar manner, you can press the "1" key to show all of the open windows of the highlighted application. <comment112176> Cmd-Delete will also activate the most destructive action — in this case, Don't Save. <comment112178> You can also do this with the "1" key while ⌘-tabbing. <comment112179> Looks like this has become ⌘+⌥+S as of Lion. <comment112180> Fantastical is the only third-party app that supports this, as far as I know. You have to download a "menu extra" from their website's [FAQ page](http://flexibits.com/fantastical/faq) to enable it. <comment112187> To put it more bluntly, `purge`-ing your disk caches can actually slow you down. <comment112227> If you hold Option while rect-dragging, it affects all four corners - handy when your start position was slightly off. <comment112317> Note that if you have multiple keyboard layouts enabled on your Mac, Command-Space might switch between those layouts instead (see "Input Sources" section of "Language & Text" control panel). As I never got into the habit of using Spotlight, I don't mind. <comment112852> You can also drag and drop a folder on the Open/Save dialog to change the current path to that location. So useful! This is one of my favorite little features in OS X. <comment113199> Removing this key kbd⇪/kbd is suppressing a lot of stupid errors with password entering windows (when this key is accidentally pressed).   Some of these password entering windows aren't intelligent enough to show this trap to the user. <comment114285> Well it's not Mac specific. The reverse-i-search is available all over. <comment114288> For swedish keyboards: ShiftCMD + Ö/Ä <comment114326> I really liked the copy pasting part <comment114523> Actually, I like this command: `ls -al ~ | say -v cellos`.  Remove the -al if you want :) <comment134762> Does iOS count? I'm sure most people know, but if you pull the camera thingy on the lock screen in iOS 7 up about 2/3 of the screen and then quickly flick it back down again, it will bounce up high enough to trigger the camera! <comment152963> I was bothered for about 3 years that there is no way to move a file in Finder via the keyboard, until I finally heard from a former colleague about CMD-C + CMD-OPT-V. This answer deserves more upvotes! <comment152965> I can't remember all these combinations, I simply use CTRL-EJECT to get the window to select from Restart, Sleep, and Shutdown. As I mostly shutdown, I simply press enter next. <comment153350> Alt + & in a french one <comment153556> This is a common behaviour in code editor. <comment153964> Thank you for sharing these shortcuts. Not all characters are recognised by my iPad though, maybe add a plain text description? <comment153971> @Petruza `say` is an AppleScript command as well. <comment153999> What about Snow Leopard? <comment162845> In Mavericks you have to enable the "Use scroll gesture" option in System Preferences  Accessibility  Zoom <comment166181> Does it still work in Mavericks? I can't seem to get it to work. <comment166447> Few of these seem to work in TextEdit. <comment166450> What version of Safari are you using? It doesn't seem to work in 10.9.4 <comment166452> TM = Time Machine? <comment166460> Any way to make it work with other languages? <comment166464> Works in Mavericks, too. <comment168047> How about running it in VMWare Workstation on a PC? <comment178784> If you type quickly you can usually type the whole thing in (or until it's unique) to select it. <comment179932> They're frustratingly inconsistent, though; they work in some apps but not all. <comment180511> Safari tip longer works as of Mavericks and Safari versions thenceforth <comment183782> You sir, are a gentlemen and a scholar. <comment193610> `open -n` is possibly one of my personal favorites. It lets me open more than one copy of an app, which I actually use a lot with Eclipse and Firefox. <comment205002> To toggle "Do Not Disturb" `option+click` the notification-center icon http://support.apple.com/kb/PH18740 <comment207360> @WillHardy install Karabiner <comment209908> not working in yosemite? <comment223247> Really cool! Only app it doesn't work for is Finder. <comment223248> You can change cmd+space to something else, via System prefs  Spotlight  Keyboard shortcuts  Spotlight. I like f10. <comment224636> now I'm stuck in emacs... <comment226308> The order in which it suggests words depends on the context.  Just selecting the first that comes up, repeatedly, gives me "I love you so much fun and I think it’s a good day to be a good day to be a good day" etc. :-) <comment236141> This one was really cool, thanks <comment236144> Additionally, you can **option + long click** on a dock icon to reveal a menu with force quit <comment236146> Most of those actions can also be done using cmd, shift and option keys which is way more easier to remember:  cmd for skipping to the end/beginning of the line, option for moving word by word,  shift for selecting the characters while moving the cursor <comment247186> This is amazing! <comment248403> Works for me in Yosemite... <comment256352> Wow I had NO idea and I've owned macs for 6 years! <comment256359> I so often need to open dirs from the terminal that I assigned it an alias - ```alias o="open ."```. Also, slightly related but ```cd to``` is an incredibly useful add for the finder Toolbar which opens the current directory in the Terminal. <comment256362> @khedron You just changed my life. <comment262899> I use this. Beware that this will be a slight annoyance when you use other people's computers, since you will find yourself toggling caps lock whenever you mean to use the ctrl key. <comment262902> This doesn't work for me. <comment262904> This doesn't seem to work any more in El Capitan. <comment263979> So the follow up to this is how to change escaping to use another format, such as quotations (`"/my path has spaces"` vs `/my\ path\ has\ spaces`)? See: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/218361/how-to-customize-drag-n-drop-to-terminal-path-escaping-results <comment267148> https://xkcd.com/530/ <comment267200> And if you move your spotlight field with a force touch trackpad, you can feel a little "tick" when it's centered. <comment267201> If you have a force touch trackpad, you can also force click on an element to bring the quick look ! <comment267205> With the new force touch trackpad, you just have to force click on a word to achieve that, it's way more precise than three finger double tap. <comment267210> Well, this doesn't seems to work in El Captain. <comment267369> Doesn't work on El Capitan <comment267530> @Sam, I suspect the "nor do you need to match case" is only true if you use the Apple default filesystem format—which is case insensitive but case *preserving*.  Much much better idea is to use "Mac OS Extended (Case-sensitive, Journaled)" rather than the default "Mac OS Extended (Journaled)". <comment267531> My bet is caffeinate was added to copy the functionality of Caffeine.  On 10.7.4 I don't have caffeinate but I use Caffeine. <comment273123> If the volume change sound is off holding Shift while pressing volume buttons will temporarily reenable it. <comment273124> Note that the quarter increment brightness will not work between the lowest normal increment of brightness and turning the display off for MacBooks.  However the quarter increments for volume will still work. <comment288747> Wish I had known this the last 15 years. Amazing. <comment288765> On some non-US keyboards it seems to be Alt N for ‘, Alt M for ’, Shift-Alt N for “ and Shift-Alt M for ”. <comment305962> Woah, I never knew this worked for brightness, too! Thanks, @Florin! <comment305963> To be clear, @DavidBarry's tip (⌘-click interaction with background programs and windows) works for *any* interaction, in almost any app. (I use ⌘-click on Messages while it's in the background, so I can read messages from someone without foregrounding the app, and thus sending Read Receipts. ;) <comment314137> FYI, the screen inversion shortcut didn't work for me here in 2016 under Yosemite 10.10.5. <comment331450> I like cheatsheet (https://cheatsheetapp.com/LandingCheatSheet/). Hold down ⌘ for a moment and you get a popover showing all shortcuts. <comment339277> Note also that if you want the window *without* the drop shadow, you can Alt-click the window to capture, instead of clicking it. <comment344724> If you hold `Shit` you also can cycle to the previous window. Pretty useful! <comment349259> Duplicate of [this answer](http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/14510/121968). <comment349261> Shouldn't this work in almost any (Cocoa/ObjC based) application? It's basically the same as changing a menu shortcut via the Keyboard / Shortcuts System Prefs, isn't it? <comment365151> [Command]-click on nearly anything in Finder will *show* the file/folder rather than opening it.  That includes Dock menus, spotlight searches and Proxy Icons. <comment365152> `open -e` (for 'edit') opens in TextEdit. <comment365153> [command] clicking in any background window allows you to interact with that window without bringing it to the front.  You can also [command]-scroll a background window - especially useful when manually copying between docs or following instructions! <comment365154> [Escape] is always cancel.  So you often have three shortcuts for the dialog, and [tab]+[space] (or [shift]-[tab] for reverse order) to choose anything not assigned to [return] & [esc] <comment365156> exists in 10.12 Sierra as well, neat! <comment365216> "H" also hides apps. <comment365217> This might also unhide hidden apps and un-minimize minimized windows. <comment365239> There are many useful tips hidden all the way on Page 5, because new answers (with votes=0) are unlikely to get voted up when they're hidden way back there! Wish there was a sort by "random" option or something.
