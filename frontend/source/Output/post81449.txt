App for remembering different mouses' tracking speeds? <body> I'm just wondering if there is an app/prefpane to remember different tracking speeds for different mouses when you have a Macbook and are switching between mouses constantly?  Thanks for any suggestions.  <answer81464> According to this article, Steermouse will allow you to save different profiles on the mouses (among other things).      h2Build Profiles/h2      One of the best features of Steermouse is the ability   to have multiple profiles. This works well if you have multiple people   using a mouse that all prefer different settings, if you have more   than once mouse that you use on a regular basis, or if you would   prefer to use different mouse settings for different tasks, workflows,   games, etc.
