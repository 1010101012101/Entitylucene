What is the InterCheck process that occasionally uses 96% CPU on my Mac? <body> I heard my computer's fan spinning fast, so I checked Activity Monitor and saw that a process called InterCheck was using close to 96% CPU. What is this process and why's it using so much CPU?  In the Inspect window, it said that the parent process is launchd.  <answer44741> It's a real-time scanning process by strongSophos Anti-Virus/strong that scans your computer's running processes in the background.  The parent process is codelaunchd/code so that when you accidentally kill the codeIntercheck/code process, it gets restarted.  <comment242561> Sophos has a utility that lets you look at the various logs that might cause Sophos to misbehave and use all of your processor. Take a look at it here: https://www.sophos.com/en-us/support/knowledgebase/33533.aspx#macgeneral It might be useful for the next time InterCheck acts out. <comment261199> If anyone wants to temporarily disable it, go to Preferences, then the "On-Access" tab (far left), and turn the on-access scanner off. If this setting is greyed out, you'll need to unlock this panel by clicking the lock in the lower-left corner and entering your password. When you're finished doing whatever (installing a lot of stuff usually does it for me), you can turn it back on at your leisure.
