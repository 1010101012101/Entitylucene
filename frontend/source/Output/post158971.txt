Use Launchpad while downloading from AppStore <body> I am just getting set up with my first mac. The current annoyance is that I am downloading xcode from AppStore (2.5 GB!!), and every app in the Launchpad is hidden - there is just the downloading progress of xcode.  Do I really have to wait an hour while the download finishes, until I can launch anything not already in the dock?? I cant believe that!  (OSX Yosemite)  <answer158972> You can open Finder and go to your Applications folder to access all your apps.  <answer158973> If Launchpad will not run for any reason, you can access many of your Applications via the Finder. In the Finder, press kbdCommand/kbdkbdShift/kbdkbdA/kbd, or go to the strongGo/strong menu and select strongApplications/strong.  <answer159096> Or you can use Spotlight to find an app and launch it.  <comment187073> I found out what was happening. The launcher page was full, so it just took a new page to show the downloading app. I only realised this after the download completed, as I thought the download had put launcher into a locked state.
