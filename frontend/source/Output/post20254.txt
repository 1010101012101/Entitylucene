Can I change the URL for RSS feed in NetNewsWire? <body> Is it possible to change the URL of a RSS feed in NetNewsWire? And if so, how?  I am using NetNewsWire ver. 3.2.15  <answer20282> The feed URL can only be edited if Google Reader sync is off.  Select the feed in the left column and press âŒ˜I to bring up the feed info window.  Click on the triangle next to the emURLs/em entry and you will get a text box that will allow you to edit the feed URL.  There are a bunch of other setting there that allow you to do things like specify how often a particular feed is updated, how long articles are kept, etc.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hYFzy.png" alt="NNW Window"  <comment22497> That field is not editable. <comment22500> @Alex It is for me, at least for the feed I checked. <comment22504> What version do you have? <comment22559> I'm using NetNewsWire 3.2.15, and I can edit the Feed URL field. I have always been able to do so, and it works as expected. Is this possibly related to having Google Reader sync enabled (I don't)? <comment22689> @Kevin Reid That is indeed true, if the sync is disabled, you can edit the Feed URL field. I just tested it.
