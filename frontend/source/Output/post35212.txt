Can my iPhone have more than one iCloud account on it at a time? <body> Can I add more than one iCloud account to an iPhone?  For example if I set my wife and I both up with an iCloud account, could I get her calander and mine on my phone?  <answer35215> Yes but the non primary account is limited to only a few services. Simply add a new account to the mail, contacts and calendars section of settings, and tap iCloud  <answer35218> h2No - the strongiCloud/strong section of the Settings app only allows for one account on iOS 5./h2  You can however add as many iCloud accounts to the strongMail, Contacts, Calendars/strong as you have time to set up. You will see that you can enable the majority of the services on each subsequent non-main iCloud account.  The following items work only on the main account:  ul listrongBackup/strong/li listrongDocuments &amp; Data/strong/li listrongPhoto Stream/strong/li /ul  The following item is exclusive - any one (but only one) account can have:  ul listrongFind My iPhone/strong/li /ul  For example, I use one iCloud account as my primary personal account and have a second account for a consulting business. Here is what that non-main account looks like when set up.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/whDyE.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer35523> If all you want to do is to share iCloud calendars, you can easily do this from the iCloud calendar web app. Each calendar in the sidebar has a "share" icon next to it. Simply click this and enter the name of the person you want to share with.
