Is a long-running, intensive process going to cause damage to my MBP? <body> I've written a script which uses Python and Rails to process millions of XML files and convert them into a format that I require. Due to the intense nature of the processing (which includes lots of requests and posts to the database), the script has been running for days, with days more expected.  It's working well, but I notice that it's using a lot of processing power. The fan is often whirring, and SMC Fan Control shows me that the temperature hovers above 90 degrees celcius.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qA4QK.png" alt="enter image description here"  My question is, is this likely to cause damage to my MacBook Pro (the retina model with an SSD)? Or is it within the bounds of expected usage, and the fact that the fan is running means everything is under control?  <comment344168> I'm not qualified to answer this question but I read that over 70 degrees is dangerous over a long period of time.
