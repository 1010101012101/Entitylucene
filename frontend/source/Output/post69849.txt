Can I run a program whenever I open the lid of my MacBook Air? <body>    strongPossible Duplicate:/strongbr   Run AppleScript after waking from Sleep?       I have a program, InstantShot!, set to launch at logon and start taking a screen shot every 10 seconds.  Unfortunately, when I close the lid, it stops taking screenshots, rather than just being suspended, so I have to manually have it start doing so again each time I reopen the lid.  I'd like to create an automator app or Apple Script that would do that automatically every time I open the lid.  Can that be done?  <answer69859> Use SleepWatcher. After downloading, read the ReadMe. It says how to install and use.  <comment81113> Sleepwatcher is what you need, as per this related question/answer: http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/45296/106
