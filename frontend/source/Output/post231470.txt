Opened applications log <body> Is there any way, such as an application or a terminal command, to display a log of every application that has been running on the computer? A bit like a keylogger, but for applications instead of keyboard. I did not find anything on the internet.  If it does not exist, do you think that programming such a tool would be possible?  Thank you for your help  <answer231489> There is an application called Time Sink ($5, free trial available) which can track time spent in an application in the foreground. I believe it also tracks background time too.  For a native and more techy solution, you can run this terminal command:  precodetop -d 5 -b &gt; /var/log/top.txt /code/pre  This command will run top every 5 seconds as defined by -d, -b is for batch mode and this is used for sending output to a file. You wouldn't want to have this running all the time unless you're compressing the log file or using logrotate, as the log file would get large.  <comment282712> Thank you ! What is logrotate? Is it better to use it or to compress the file? And how to compress it automatically? <comment283091> @MarinD Logrotate is a unix utility program used to, well, [rotate logs](https://support.rackspace.com/how-to/understanding-logrotate-utility/). :) It can also handle automatic compression of old files. Rackspace has a [good support page](https://support.rackspace.com/how-to/sample-logrotate-configuration-and-troubleshooting/) showing sample configurations.
