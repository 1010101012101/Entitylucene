OSX: Spotlight shows the content of locked notes <body> When I search in the spotlight for a locked note, I can see the content of that looked note. I went ahead and rebuilt the spotlight index, but still showing the content. Am I missing something here or is it a bug? OSX-ELCapitan 10.11.5  <answer243571> strongYou need to close your notes/strong  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ykpQC.png" alt="enter image description here"  I justed tested this in OS 10.11.5 and the contents of the note don't show, just the title.  I created a note and titled it for which it would be easy for Spotlight to find:  "Smattering test note"  (I have no other instance of "Smattering" on my system).  Here is what it looks like after I have emlocked/em and emclosed/em the note.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xjjf1.png" alt="enter image description here"  Doing a Spotlight search for "Smattering" yields this result:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zdrDX.png" alt="enter image description here"  It autocompletes the note title (ligher grey text) and clicking on it opens the Notes App.  Until I unlock the note with my password, the contents are not visible.  strongIf I don't emlock and close/em my notes, if I do a Spotlight search, the contents will be visible/strong  <comment300071> Thank you for the details. So I see what the issue is, I went ahead and renamed the existing locked note, but the spotlight is still showing the old version of the locked note that doesn't exist in notes anymore. It seems that I have duplicate of old notes somewhere and even if I lock it, it will show the other old version. Where can I find them? <comment300081> When you do a spotlight search, look at the very bottom of the left column of sources.  Click on "Show All in Finder".  It will bring them up for you <comment300086> Thank you a bunch!
