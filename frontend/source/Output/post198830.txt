Upgrade to Yosemite failed - MBR and GPT don't match? <body> Upgrading to Yosemite so I can install the newest version of xCode.br Shortly after starting I get this error:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KqWSa.jpg" alt="A mismatch between the MBR and GPT partition maps is not supported with this operation. Quit the installer to restart your computer and try again."  I've tried going into Disk Utility and repairing permissions, but even though it says it's repairing things, when I run it again the same errors show up.  Not sure what to do here.

Please adapt them accordingly.  <comment238079> so you are able to boot your previous system right now? <comment238082> What are you upgrading from and how is the disk partitioned?  What OSes are installed if more then whatever version of OS X you're trying to upgrade from? Are you running a third party boot manager? <comment238084> @user3439894 Upgrading from 10.9.5. I have a bootcamp partition with windows 8.1 on it. I'm just using the boot manager that came with the OS. I'm adding a screenshot of disk manager <comment238090> @n1000 Yeah, I was able to quit the installer and choose to boot to the old OS. <comment238092> Please add to the OP the output of the following two commands in aTerminal. Copy and paste as one command then press Enter: `sudo gpt -r -vv show disk0; sudo fdisk /dev/disk0` <comment238093> Before doing this make sure you are properly backed up! :) <comment238094> @user3439894 good point :) <comment238109> @user3439894 Ok, done <comment238110> Is the some reason you had to post a graphics image instead of just copying and pasting the output from the Terminal?  Although without proper output from the `gpt` command it's somewhat moot. <comment238238> @user3439894 Uploading the image was just easier. The output from the terminal formatting was getting messed up when I put it in as text. What am I doing wrong with the gpt command? <comment238274> With step 4, `r` takes you into `recovery and transformation options (experts only)` mode, and step 5 `m` takes you back into normal mode. I posted the output of `v`, as well as the two help menus in case what I downloaded is different than what you have... <comment238502> Figured it out. Steps 4 and 5 were missing the parts where print tables was actually chosen, instead of just entering the menu and then leaving it again. I updated the instructions to put the necessary commands. <comment238552> @AndyD273 Does that mean you were able to upgrade to Yosemite? Great! <comment238719> Yup! I was just getting hung up with showing the tables `o` and `p`. I kept deleting the partition and then putting the wrong numbers from `p` back in, instead of the correct numbers from `o`. Took me a little bit to figure out what I was doing wrong, and then it just worked. <comment238728> @AndyD273 Feel free to edit the answer or let me know how to improve it. <comment238737> Already edited it. You were missing a couple steps from the link you posted '[This post](https://forums.developer.apple.com/thread/3467)', so I just fixed steps 4 and 5 and put in a new 6 to explain what to look for. For future people with the same problem, just in case the Apple forum thread ever disappears.
