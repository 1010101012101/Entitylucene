Is there an iPad mail app where you can see messages list full screen - without having a preview panel <body> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/s7w89.jpg" alt="enter image description here" I want it so I can see all of my inbox messages in full screen and when I tap on one it brings it up in full screen. Kind of like in the iPhone version  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vBeCM.png" alt="enter image description here"  I want it to look something like the picture below. It is from Google Inbox app (which sadly doesnâ€™t support iCloud mail)  I have tried the 10 most popular mail apps and non of them seem to have this feature.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fiCfG.jpg" alt="enter image description here"
