Looking for a program similar to Alfred and Keyboard Maestro <body> Despite Alfred and Keyboard Maestro being able to trigger many things by shortcut, they both require you to use a modifier and key to work. Though Alfred does support a double tap of shift, option and command, it appears to stop there. x What I'd like is an application to detect patterns like: double tap command followed by a double tap of option. Which then opens whatever you choose.  Anyone know if such application exists?  Thanks.  <answer111235> I didn't figure out any way to do that with KeyRemap4MacBook, but this would make pressing command twice and then pressing option open Finder:  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt; &lt;root&gt;   &lt;vkopenurldef&gt;      &lt;name&gt;KeyCode::VK_OPEN_URL_FINDER&lt;/name&gt;      &lt;url&gt;file:///System/Library/CoreServices/Finder.app&lt;/url&gt;   &lt;/vkopenurldef&gt;   &lt;item&gt;     &lt;name&gt;test&lt;/name&gt;     &lt;identifier&gt;test&lt;/identifier&gt;     &lt;autogen&gt;__DoublePressModifier__ KeyCode::COMMAND_L,     KeyCode::COMMAND_L, KeyCode::VK_STICKY_EXTRA1&lt;/autogen&gt;     &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::OPTION_L, ModifierFlag::EXTRA1,     KeyCode::VK_OPEN_URL_FINDER&lt;/autogen&gt;   &lt;/item&gt; &lt;/root&gt; /code/pre  See https://raw.github.com/tekezo/KeyRemap4MacBook/master/Tests/lib/string/data/checkbox.xml or http://osxnotes.net/keyremap4macbook.html for more examples.  <answer111238> Just as a direction, as I don't really have time to make sure this does what you want. Typinator (http://www.ergonis.com/products/typinator/features.html) is a keystroke replacement program that can also run scripts. So you can in theory set any combination of keys to trigger a script and that in turn could open a program, take over the world or whatever. Might be worth a shot.  <answer111434> Keyboard Maestro can do this in a number of ways.  An entirely extensible way is to make a sequence of self-disabling macros, something like this:  precodeMacro: First Command Key Trigger: Device Key Command Key Actions: Disable Macro "First Command Key" Enable "Second Command Key" Pause 3 Seconds &lt;- adjust as necessary Disable Macro "Second Command Key" Enable Macro "First Command Key" /code/pre  and then  precodeMacro: Second Command Key Trigger: Device Key Command Key Actions: Disable Macro "Second Command Key" Enable "Second Command First Option Key" Pause 3 Seconds &lt;- adjust as necessary Disable Macro "Second Command First Option Key" /code/pre  and then  precodeMacro: Second Command First Option Key Trigger: Device Key Option Key Actions: Disable Macro "Second Command First Option Key" Enable "Second Command Second Option Key" Pause 3 Seconds &lt;- adjust as necessary Disable Macro "Second Command Second Option Key" /code/pre  and then  precodeMacro: Second Command Second Option Key Trigger: Device Key Option Key Actions: Disable Macro "Second Command Second Option Key" Perform whatever actions desired. /code/pre  etc  It'll take a couple minutes to set up, but you can configure it any way you like.  <comment131005> Excellent idea (and example). I do use KeyRemap4Macbook often but it never occurred to me to use it for double tap combinations. Truly a wonderful application. <comment131123> There are a few [articles](http://elasticthreads.tumblr.com/post/3627610765/put-your-macs-caps-lock-key-to-better-use) out there about using the caps lock key to trigger Alfred. Depending on how much you'll use caps lock... might be worth a try.
