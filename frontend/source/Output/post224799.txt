Internet sharing option "to computers using iPhone USB" <body> Under System Preferences  Sharing, there is an option to share your connection from wherever "to computers using: iPhone USB":  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Lp9x5.png" alt="screenshot"  At first glance, this looks to me like:  precode               [Mac]               [iDevice] --&gt;--(LAN)--&gt;--˄   ˅--&gt;--(USB)--&gt;--˄ /code/pre  i.e. reverse tethering over USB.br However, according to these two answers, reverse tethering is not possible over USB with a vanilla iOS.br Three other sources describe a way to do it on a jailbroken iOS, but although stated otherwise, this seems to work only with a Windows PC.  Also, I'm pretty sure that the above option is strongneither/strong "normal" tethering, like  precode                  [iDevice]               [Mac] --&gt;--(Mobile)--&gt;--˄       ˅--&gt;--(USB)--&gt;--˄ /code/pre  which would be under "Network":  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/T3JPR.png" alt="screenshot"  strongnor/strong sharing a connection from an iDevice to something else, like  precode                  [iDevice]               [Mac]               [Whatever] --&gt;--(Mobile)--&gt;--˄       ˅--&gt;--(USB)--&gt;--˄   ˅--&gt;--(USB)--&gt;--˄ /code/pre  which would be in the "from" field on internet sharing:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HpzIt.png" alt="screenshot"  So, about the option shown in the first picture:br Evidently it cannot be used to tether to vanilla iDevices, and there's no way Apple would put it there for jailbroken devices, on which it emalso/em doesn't seem to work.  So what does it actually do, and what can it be used for?  <answer224802> I believe in Internet Sharing settings, OS X is just listing all of the network interfaces. iPhone USB is listed there for that reason, even though it's not a meaningful option.   <comment272645> I have to admit, I didn't think about that... doesn't sound like Apple, but now that you mention it... <comment272667> Well, the dialog is just iterating over the list of interfaces…
