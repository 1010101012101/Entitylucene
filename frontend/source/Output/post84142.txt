Sorry for my english.  <comment96818> I see you jailbreak exclusively to pirate from hard working developers. And you want help with that? <comment96825> Im sorry, i can't get help for this? <comment96826> Actually I just want to learn the code, I'm learning from my phone. This is the best example I can get because I don't have any Linux OS installed on my computer. <comment96841> This crosses the piracy line on the [FAQ] so feel free to ask a question on the [meta] side of the site or show up in chat once you've gotten some rep to do those actions.
