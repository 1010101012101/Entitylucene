How do you show only complete albums in iTunes 11? <body> iTunes 11 seems to revolve around the screen that shows you all of the different albums that you own.  However, the vast majority of the albums iTunes is showing me are albums from which I own only one song, and it is making it difficult to find those albums that are actually complete.  In iTunes 11, how do you filter the albums displayed in the Albums pane?  <answer84435> There's no way to do that, alas. This hint shows an AppleScript that can make playlists from all complete albums, but if you have a lot of albums, it might be overwhelming.  <answer92936> You can't. Write a suggestion to Apple at:  http://www.apple.com/feedback/itunesapp.html  <answer207753> You can create a playlist that contains all full albums in your library using AppleScript. The code below is just a small modification to the script linked in Kirk's answer so that it creates one playlist instead of one per album. It's slow (takes maybe 5 minutes to run through my library) and is very sensitive to any metadata inaccuracies, but it works for me.  precode-- Creates one playlist of all full albums you have in iTunes -- Set the playlistPrefix and playlistSuffix as desired before running  -- Original script by duozmo on Ask Different -- http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20130201061128257 -- http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/77626  -- Based on code by Brad Campbell -- http://www.bradcampbell.com/2009/05/26/make-a-whole-album-playlist-in-itunes/  tell application "iTunes"     set albumPlaylistName to "Full Albums"     -- Create playlist     if user playlist albumPlaylistName exists then         try             delete tracks of user playlist albumPlaylistName         end try     else         make new user playlist with properties {name:albumPlaylistName}     end if      set albumBuckets to {} as list     set allSongs to (every track of library playlist 1 whose enabled is true and podcast is false and kind contains "audio") as list      -- Find all partial albums in iTunes     repeat with currentTrack in allSongs         set albumName to album of currentTrack as text         set artistName to artist of currentTrack as text          -- First check for missing values, then perform integer comparison         -- Zero is on the left to force interger type coercion, just in case         if album of currentTrack is not missing value and 0 is less than length of albumName then             if artist of currentTrack is not missing value and 0 is less than length of artistName then                 if track number of currentTrack is not missing value and 0 is less than track number of currentTrack then                     if track count of currentTrack is not missing value and 0 is less than track count of currentTrack then                         if albumBuckets does not contain album of currentTrack then                             copy album of currentTrack to the end of albumBuckets                         end if                     end if                 end if             end if         end if      end repeat      repeat with currentAlbum in albumBuckets         set albumSongs to (every track of library playlist 1 whose album is currentAlbum)         set firstTrack to first item of albumSongs          -- Filter album list to act only on full albums         if (count of albumSongs) is equal to track count of first item of albumSongs and 1 is less than (count of albumSongs) then             -- This is a full album, construct the playlist              -- Sort tracks by track number             set albumSongsSorted to {} as list             repeat with i from 1 to (count of albumSongs)                 repeat with trk in albumSongs                     if track number of trk is i then                         set nextSong to trk                         copy nextSong to the end of albumSongsSorted                     end if                 end repeat             end repeat              try                 repeat with trk in albumSongsSorted                     duplicate trk to user playlist albumPlaylistName                 end repeat             end try         end if     end repeat      display dialog albumPlaylistName &amp; " playlist created!" end tell /code/pre  Another option would be to use Doug's Random Full Albums script if you just want iTunes to act like a CD changer on album shuffle mode.  <answer254501> Make a smart playlist with the following filter - Comments contains Full Album.  For each album I want to add, I click on Get Info and add Full Album to the comments field  <comment97747> It's unfortunate that there's not an easier way to do this.  Thanks for the response.
