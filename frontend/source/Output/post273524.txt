How to access continuity through applescript or command line <body> Goal: I want to handoff my localhost site to my phone for testing. I can access my localhost by going to codehttp://my.ip.add.ress/localhost/code on my iphone. Of course, on my computer the actual address is just codehttp://localhost/code. Instead of typing that address I want to trigger a script that will "handoff" the concatenation of my computer's ip address + codelocalhost/page/code.   My question is if I can trigger a "handoff" through applescript or command-line. Is there a handoff API?  I'm emnot/em asking about how to get my computer's ip address.  <answer273526> You can probably avoid all the hassle by just using one nice service - http://xip.io  Instead of browsing to http://localhost - look up your IP and browse to http://192.168.12.13.xip.io/  Of course, your actual IP address for the local host is needed unless your router was set up to assign your test Mac 192.168.12.13 - even though you aren't asking how to get your IP, that's the key to making this easy for safari to hand off the session from macOS to iOS.  hr     strongDoes xip.io cost anything?/strong      Nope! xip.io is a free service from Basecamp, the   creators of Pow. We were tired of jumping through hoops   to test our apps on other devices and decided to solve   the problem once and for all.   <comment343871> After writing this I searched "handoff API" and found these docs: https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/Handoff/HandoffFundamentals/HandoffFundamentals.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014338-CH3-SW1, way more complicated than I was hoping for. <comment343874> What about just using `http://my.ip.add.ress/localhost/page`  or `servername.local/page` instead of `localhost` on your computer? Handoff will work automatically then..
