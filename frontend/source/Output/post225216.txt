Change installed AppleScript version <body> Is there any way to change the installed version of AppleScript?  After mistakenly identifying my version of AppleScript as 1.0 by using a 15 year old script (turns out that just checks the version of the script you are currently running, which is implicitly 1.0) and trying to figure out how to upgrade, I was wondering how/if it's possible to change the installed version of AppleScript?  <answer225217> You can not change the version of AppleScript installed with OS X. AppleScript is a core part of the operating system.  If you are running the latest version of OS X, then you have the latest AppleScript.  <answer225221> The linked script to get the AppleScript version is bogus. To get your current AppleScript version open AppleScript-Editor/Script -Editor.  In the menubar got to Script-Editor-About Script-Editor  The current AppleScript version is just below the AppleScript-Editor/Script -Editor version number.  Examples:  ul liMavericks 10.9.5:       AppleScript 2.3.2  /li liEl Capitan 10.11.3:     AppleScript 2.5/li /ul
