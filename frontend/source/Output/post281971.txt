YouTube player shrinks in fullscreen <body> When I am watching YouTube on my Mac, sometimes when I'm in fullscreen it'll shrink the video to 1/4 of the screen, nested in the top-right corner. What causes this?  MacBook Pro 2016 13" Touchbar model macOS 10.12.4 (16E195) Using Safari  <comment354951> Have you tried to see if the symptoms are present in different browsers like  Chrome or Firefox? <comment354957> @Allan no- it is infrequent but I will use these browsers over the next few days and see if anything changes.
