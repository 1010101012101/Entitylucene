How to launch a file in vifm <body> I installed vifm through macports.  If I press enter on a file, it just opens it for editing.  How can I launch a file with it's associated program?  i.e. if I have a file highlighted, is there a key I can press so that it does the same thing as   precodeopen %c /code/pre  Where %c is the name of the file that's highlighted?  <answer41714> Using codei/code will open the selected file with its associated program. This is per the online documentation from the Vifm site. I am not sure how or if you can alter which application opens a file from within vi; that might have to be switched elsewhere.   <answer62885> I almost accidentally saw this question and decided to provide an answer in case you're still didn't find one in the documentation.  To open files with associated programs you need to add the following command to your code~/.vifm/vifmrc/code file:  precodefiletype * open %c /code/pre  Then both codel/code and codei/code keys will work for you as expected. See help on code:filetype/code and code:filextype/code in the documentation.  This doesn't work out of the box, since different systems have different codeopen/code commands and the default behavior is to open all files with Vim. Maybe new version will contain a set of codeopen/code commands for different systems in sample codevifmrc/code file, so it will work from the beginning.  <comment47326> Actually open /mp3/file/to/play works just fine. The problem is getting vifm to do this. <comment47340> I misunderstood your question - sorry about that. I edited my answer to hopefully offer the correct information and possibly solution. <comment47398> i doesn't do anything. I also tried it in Linux and it doesn't work there either.
