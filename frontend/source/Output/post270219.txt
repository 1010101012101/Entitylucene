What is this menubar icon with NW-SE double-headed arrow? <body> What is this menubar icon? I don't remember seeing it before, and it doesn't seem to offer any explanation of what it is.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/U6U2I.png" alt="menubar icon with NW-SE double-headed arrow"  The inverted triangle (▼) in the upper left doesn't do anything when clicked. Typing in the [Search] box only changes [All Programs ▶] to [◀ Back].  <answer270221> Apparently it's emVMware Fusion Start Menu/em.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vj4Bn.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment339536> That's an app you have installed. If you mouse over the icon (while it's not expanded) and wait a second, a dialog of which app it is from should appear. <comment339537> @owlswipe That doesn't work for this particular icon, but thanks for the tip! <comment339572> Yes. You can go into VMWare's settings and disable it if you'd like.
