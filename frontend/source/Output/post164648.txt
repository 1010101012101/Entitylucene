Apple air mac charger <body> I had tried everything on here. And it still doesn't work. And I can't do anything cause my computer is dead. I even tried to reset it, but it does not work. what do i do now?  <answer164650> Replace the charger. I see them die all the time. All that can really be done is getting a replacement.  <comment193071> But I already did that.I wanna take it in to get fixed but if I do that, Everything I have on here would be erased. <comment193072> Is it under warranty? Take the computer to an Apple store and explain the situation. They will be able to help you. You should not have to lose data unless there is something physically wrong with your ssd. <comment193073> ok ill try it. thanks. <comment193075> Maybe while your there, inquire about getting a Time Machine backup drive. ;)
