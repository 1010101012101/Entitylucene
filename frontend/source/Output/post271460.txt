What is the reason of sound from the attached file? <body> From time to time I hear this sound without any visible notification: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwUf1IftWc6YUk1BWDFoQ1A2SW8/view  What is the reason of it?  Usually I have the following apps opened: Chrome, Skype, Telegram, Sublime Text, IntelliJ, iTerm, Commander One, Postman.br macOS 10.12.3  <answer271955> James P, Thanks for the hint! It was Skype indeed.  To turn off this sound I went to Skype - Preferences - Notifications - Overview and unchecked "Play sounds related to contact availability"    <comment341797> I'm pretty sure that's Skype, either someone logging in or leaving a message.
