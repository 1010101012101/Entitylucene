Parallels Desktop: Run windows application with command line arguments <body> I'm running on MacOS with Sierra and I have a Windows VM running on Parallels 12.  I want to run an application that is installed on the Windows VM and I want to run it with arguments, in the same way that I can do it on Windows with cmd.  An example: I have an app in Windows VM called bestApp.exe that need two arguments like "bestApp.exe -r "C:\PathFolder\"  Looking on internet I found something here. The answer is quite old and I'm interested on the second approach but seems that I need the Pro version of Parallels to try it.  My question is: how I can run my app, on Windows-Parallels, from Mac with arguments? That approach is valid and, also, it is the only one?  EDIT: I found that I can open a Windows app from Mac running the "open" command on terminal but if I use "--args" to pass arguments it doesn't work...  Example. "open myApp.exe --args -blabla" open my app on VM but without arguments  <answer271295> Install, configure and launch Bitvise SSH Server (Personal Edition is free but has some restrictions compared to the licensed server) in the Windows VM.  Launch Terminal on the OS X host, ssh to the ssh server and execute any command required.  hr  I also tried PowerShell which allows Win2Win remote access after enabling it on the hosts, but the OS X version still lacks this feature.  <comment341095> Mmm maybe can be a solution. I hope there is something else more simple...
