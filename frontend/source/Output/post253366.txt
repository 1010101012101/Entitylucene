iOS 10 face recognition - Merge people? <body> My photo app shows two separate sets of the same person, but iOS thinks they are different people, even if the name is the same. Is there any way I can manually "merge" two separate people?  <answer253376> Ok, found it: in the Photos app... - go to "People" - Click on "Select" in the upper right corner of the screen - Then click on the "Merge" button in the lower right corner of the screen.
