Is Siri's audio wave a correlogram? <body> Back in the days of the Macintosh IIfx, when Dylan was going to be the Next Big Lanugage, I saw a video of a research program on voice recognition at Apple.   The research claimed that the key to doing voice recognition was using a statistical match called a correlogram - which has a corresponding audio diagram. This diagram looks similar to the 'speech wave' we see when speaking to Siri.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/BCHOJ.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GXFvD.png" alt="enter image description here"  My question is: strongIs Siri's audio bubble a correlogram?/strong
