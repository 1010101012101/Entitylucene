Lots of weird stuff happening today <body> So I'll just list the symptoms I've experienced in the last few hours, so far I can't seem to find a pattern, suffice to say the macbook is virtually unusable for my purposes. It's a 2010 Macbook white:  ul liCan't open Chrome/li liRefuses to remember wifi password each time I reconnect/li liMail.app thinks it's offline/li liTime keeps resetting to 12:00am/li liTurns off randomly/li /ul  I'm leaning towards blaming the battery, given the power loss and time resetting, however shouldn't there be a watch battery keeping time? Also I don't think I could explain the other issues blaming the battery. I suppose it's possible multiple things broke all at once. Thought I'd ask however and see if this isn't a known issue.  Thanks for any advice.  <answer115798> Turns out it was the battery. Got it tested for free at the Genius Bar, and they did the replacement for the cost of the battery.  <comment133591> do a hard reboot. Try again while plugged into auxiliary power. <comment135461> Does Apple Hardware Test report anything?  (See http://support.apple.com/kb/ht1509;  I am guessing for a 2010 MacBook you will need the disc that came with the computer.) <comment135495> ended up taking it to the Genius Bar and they did the Network Boot Test thingy and said the battery was kaput. New battery has fixed all.
