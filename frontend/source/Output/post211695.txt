What is the radio frequency of Airdrop transmission? <body> I know the Airdrop uses WiFi direct to send the packet, but what is the radio frequency of it? 2.4Ghz? 5Ghz? or both?  <answer211965> The protocol is called AWDL, trying googling that.  Here's a starter  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19587701/what-is-awdl-apple-wireless-direct-link-and-how-does-it-work  <comment255567> You mean transmission rate, not radio frequency. <comment255572> No, because I want to capture the packet of Airdrop. If the radio frequency is 5GHz, I cannot capture it because I only have 2.4Ghz Wireless Usb Adapter.
