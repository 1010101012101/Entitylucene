Running actions when I disconnect external monitor <body> I would love to auto start Bartender (by the way, excellent app that hides some of your notification area icons) when I unplug my external monitor from my Mac.  Is there any app or script that could do that?  <answer73507> Try ControlPlane. It allows you to trigger various actions, including launching applications, based on a variety of "evidence sources" (which include which monitors are connected). Have a look at the full feature list, but it should accomplish what you're looking for.  <comment85402> This is PERFECT. Managed to implement what I wanted in a few minutes after installing. Thanks!
