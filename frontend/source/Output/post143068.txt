Is there a way to simulate shake on iPhone? <body> I am NOT talking about the simulator. I was wondering if I could simulate a shake on my actual iphone (by plugging it into computer and connected to xcode).  Is there a way to do this?  <answer143070> There are two ways:  ul liSearch the App Store to see if there are any apps that do this (see Google Search)/li liWrite an App that does it (see StackOverflow)/li /ul  <answer143079> ul liOpen System Preferences/li liGo to General  Accessibility  Assistive Touch /li liTurn assistive touch on/li liThen, an icon that looks like: /li /ul  img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/38ib4b0m3o7jsqg/Screen%20Shot%202014-08-24%20at%206.09.48%20PM.png?dl=1" alt="assistive touch"  Will pop up somewhere on you screen. Tap it. Then:  ul liTap device/li liTap more/li liand finally tap shake/li /ul  Hope that helps!  <comment168524> Given the answer by Edward, are you seeking the Shake gesture or making the phone vibrate?  I assumed shake gesture until I read him telling how to make it vibrate. <comment168602> In my opinion, this is not a very good answer and is not particularly helpful.
