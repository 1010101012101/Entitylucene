Google Calendar app (not iPhone calendar) on iPhone 7 - How to see Google "Other Calendars" from desktop <body> I have been using Google calendar for many years, and I don't want to switch to Apple's calendar.  I have been able to get the iPhone version of the Google Calendar app to work properly on my iPhone 7, with one exception:  The PC/Mac version of my Google calendar includes several "other calendars" (Google's term).  For me, the other calendars are schedules for several sports teams, holidays and weather.  How can I get these other calendars to appear in the Google Calendar app on my iPhone.  Thanks!
