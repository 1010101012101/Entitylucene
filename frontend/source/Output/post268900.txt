Is there is any solution or additional settings needed?  <answer268910> Sometimes you need to turn off and back on AirDrop on both the Mac and the iPhone, while at it you should do the same for Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, that should solve the problem, it works every time for me.  <comment337739> Are both devices connected to the same WiFi network? Is Bluetooth enabled on both? <comment337740> yes both phone are connected on same wifi and bluetooth on and also airdrop is active on phone. <comment337741> There are a whole bunch of answers for the questions listed in the "Related" column to the right, want to start with those?
