Unable to use SSD drive <body> My Macbook Pro 2011 is running OS X 10.11.6. I recently replaced the CD drive with a Samsung 850 EVO ssd drive. The new SSD drive is a mSATA so I had to use a mSATA to mac adaptor. After installing the drive, I boot up the computer. The disk utility window opened which said that partition map is not supported. Why did this happen and how can I fix it so I can actually use the hard drive?   <comment318038> What OS are you running and what hardware? <comment318192> Did you try reforming the drive with Disk Utility? <comment318199> How do you reform the drive? I havent been able to do a thing to it in disk utility because it doesn't show up in the left hand pane anymore. <comment318228> Go to terminal. If you type in: "diskutil list", does the device appear to be listed? If so, what does it say? <comment318463> it doesnt come up in the list at all
