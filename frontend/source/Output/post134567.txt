Prevent uninstallation of Cydia tweaks <body> I have GuizmoDNS installed on my iPhone (it can lock in DNS settings for WiFi and Cellular data). This is great for when my kids browse the web, as it can block most inappropriate sites, and the settings themselves are password protected.  But removing the tweak itself is an easy way around this. Is there any way to password protect the removal of Cydia tweaks?  I would very much like to strongnot/strong have to password protect Cydia itself.  <answer135533> A possible solution is as mentioned by @Andrew, according to me there are two other possible things you can do:  ul liinstall iAppLock and lock Cydia so nothing can be changed at all with in Cydia/li liinstall GuestMode and disable Cydia so that, you can see it but can't open it/li /ul  <comment159257> Manually installing the tweak without using `dpkg` or Cydia will do the trick. Cydia won't even know about it.
