Autocomplete not working in Terminal local to folder <body> When I go into any folder via codecd/code and then press codetab/code a whole list of options is displayed. How do I make the autocomplete local to the folder?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vSaSv.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer264937> You're looking for codebash-completion/code. This post describes how to get it (tl;dr - for an easy install you'll need a package manager like Homebrew or MacPorts) for example:  precodebrew install bash_completion /code/pre  With codebash-completion/code, typing codecd/code and then Tab the results you get should be limited to folders.  Out-of-the-box codebash-completion/code covers a wide range of possible completions, but there may be more - check your package manager. For example, on Homebrew try this:  precodebrew search completions /code/pre  This returns additional completions for macOS tools like codeopen/code and codelaunchctl/code, virtualisation tools like codedocker/code and codevagrant/code, and many others.  You emcan/em create your own completions, for example I use this one to show me emonly/em code.png/code files for a script (codepng2icns/code) I hacked together.  precodecomplete -f -X '!*.png' png2icns /code/pre  However this really isn't necessary for most cases - codebash-completion/code will cover all the common uses.  For completeness I need to mention that fans of the codezsh/code shell will no doubt tell you that codezsh/code's support for completion is far superior to codebash/code's! Personally, codebash/code does what I need, albeit with a little help from codebrew/code.
