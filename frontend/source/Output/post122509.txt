QuickLook file associations <body> Typing code$ qlmanage -m plugins/code will give me a list of QuickLook plugins and their associated MIME type (at least I think it's a MIME type):  precodeplugins:   org.openxmlformats.presentationml.slideshow -&gt; /System/Library/QuickLook/Office.qlgenerator (32)   com.adobe.pdf -&gt; /System/Library/QuickLook/PDF.qlgenerator (622.3)   com.apple.localized-pdf-bundle -&gt; /System/Library/QuickLook/LocPDF.qlgenerator (622.3)   com.apple.iwork.keynote.key -&gt; /Library/QuickLook/iWork.qlgenerator (11)   ...   public.script -&gt; /Applications/Development/TextMate 2.app/Contents/Library/QuickLook/TextMateQL.qlgenerator (1.0 - loaded)public.source-code -&gt; /Applications/Development/TextMate 2.app/Contents/Library/QuickLook/TextMateQL.qlgenerator (1.0 - loaded)   public.plain-text -&gt; /Applications/Development/TextMate 2.app/Contents/Library/QuickLook/TextMateQL.qlgenerator (1.0 - loaded)   public.text -&gt; /Applications/Development/TextMate 2.app/Contents/Library/QuickLook/TextMateQL.qlgenerator (1.0 - loaded)   ... /code/pre  Questions:  ul liWhat is the number in parentheses?/li liHow do I know which plugin will be used by a given file?  Is it just the file's extension or is MIME type (e.g. public.plain.text) embedded in the document's metadata?/li liHow do I get AsciiDoc documents associated with one of the plugins that renders plain text?/li liHow do I change plugin associations?  For example, use Sublime Text's plugin instead of Text Mate's./li /ul  <answer122526> The information you are looking for is contained in each Quick Look plug-in's codeInfo.plist/code file. This file is embedded in the Quick Look plug-in bundle: codeContents/Info.plist/code  The number in the parentheses is the bundle version (codeCFBundleShortVersionString/code). This should be a unique identifier for the developer to determine the exact build of the plug-in; compare this to a marketing version of code1.1/code.  The qlmanage manual details how to see associations and the expanded help shows more options:  precodeqlmanage -h /code/pre  For details on how to add or change associated files, see Apple's Quick Look developer documentation. The associations are set out in the Info.plist file's codeCFBundleDocumentTypes/code section.  The MultiMarkdown Quick Look plug-in provides a useful example of the Info.plist settings.
