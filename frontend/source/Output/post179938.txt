Why doesn't the internal microphone of my MacBook Pro work? <body> The internal microphone of my MacBook Pro late 2011 doesn't work. When I try to do an audio recording, the microphone doesn't record.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KagMC.png" alt="System Preferences â†’ Sound"  <comment213536> Can you add screenshots of the audio settings in System Preferences? <comment213581> there you go... <comment213598> Pro Tip:- after Cmd/4 instead of dragging round a window, hit Spacebar instead & click the required window. You get a neat snap of the window itself, complete with drop-shadow. <comment213617> Does the input level show anything when you make noise? <comment213637> nope @KevinGrabher <comment213639> wow, thanks @Tetsujin! <comment213647> Try creating a new user and see if the issue persists. Probably also try a [PRAM/NVRAM Reset](https://support.apple.com/kb/PH14222?locale=en_US) and a [SMC Reset](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201295)
