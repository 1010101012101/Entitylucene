How do I locate applications that drain my battery on a MacBook Pro? <body> I purchased a new Macbook Pro and have since downloaded a ton of applications and add ins.  I think some of these apps are responsible for draining my battery too quickly.  ul liHow do I identify what applications are responsible for this, or otherwise experience what a "clean machine" feels like?/li /ul  Back in the day I used Extensions Manager on OS 7.x to turn off add ins that would slow my machine down.  What is the equivalent in OSX?  <answer65066> Unfortunately there's no real quick and easy answer for this questions, but her are a few tips.  ol liYou can hold down emSHIFT/em at startup to disable non-essential kernel extensions and startup items. However you will lose some functionality (such as graphics acceleration.) See http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1564/li liIf you are using a 15 or 17-inch MacBook Pro, then you can use System Profiler/System Information to see if your programs are turning on the emDiscrete/em graphics card (which uses more power than emIntegrated/em graphics.) See http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4152/li liUse Activity Monitor, located in Applications - Utilities, and check for unusual CPU or Disk Activity. Make sure to click "My Processes" and change to "All Processes." You can click on a column header such as CPU% or Real Mem to sort processes/Applications. Perhaps purchasing a program like iStatMenus (which provides real-time monitoring in the Mac menubar) will be helpful. See http://bjango.com/mac/istatmenus//li /ol  HTH   <answer65071> I would monitor the activity such as CPU. Spinning hard drives that are constantly being accessed cause major battery drain and I would recommend a SSD  if you don't already have one.   <answer65119> The Activity Monitor template in Instruments shows average CPU use over time:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/07z3G.png" alt=""  You can also use codetop -o time/code or Activity Monitor to sort processes by CPU time.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/N0ATD.png" alt=""  CPU time doesn't always correlate with CPU use though. It's reset when a process exits, so the list won't include old mdworker processes or applications that have been quit manually.  <comment80614> I wonder how difficult it would be to use this information more rigorously, i.e. to capture processes that start and stop, and compute a ranking since last boot.
