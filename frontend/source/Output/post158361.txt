PDF "is damaged and can't be opened" on mounted drive <body> I have a late 2013 MBP, OSX v10.10. I have a drive mounted via ssh tunnelling. The basic command looks like:   precodealias mountCS='ssh -f useru@host1 -L port:host2 -N ; sshfs -p port user@localhost:remoteDir /Users/User/mnt/CS' /code/pre  While ssh'ed in to the same remote host I created a pdf from latex. When I try open to take a peek from mounted dir I get the error "“results.pdf” is damaged and can’t be opened. You should eject the disk.". However, this happens with R pdfs too. If I simply copy it to a local directory it opens fine though. Odd right? When I first set this sshfs mount up, it didn't do this.   <answer201687> When this happens to me, I delete the ._results.pdf file, and then I can open it from the mounted directory.  <answer215515> This is related to Files wrongly considered as damaged in encfs volume and probably this bug: https://github.com/osxfuse/osxfuse/issues/162 - so upgrading to a newer version of sshfs should work, but I've found that it works if you start sshfs with code-o allow_root/code, so  codesshfs -o allow_root hostname:path mountpoint/code  Hope that helps!  <comment243194> Yes that's what I've been doing. Just seems like an imperfect solution
