How can I disable the tweet sound when using Click to Tweet in Notification Center? <body> I really like being able to send tweets on Twitter from Notification Center, but I can live without the sound that plays when you click Send. Is there a way to disable or customize the tweet sound?  <answer58056> The "tweet sent" sound file is located at  precode/System/Library/SocialServices/Twitter.socialplugin/Contents/Resources/TwitterSent.caf /code/pre  If you remove or change that file, then the sound should change accordingly.  <comment66813> or, if you don't want to do anything drastic, `chmod 000 /System/Library/SocialServices/Twitter.socialplugin/Contents/Resources/TwitterSent.caf` which makes the file unreadable but doesn't alter its contents. <comment66814> I like the way you think, except that you keep coming up with answers very similar to the ones I'm about to post :-)
