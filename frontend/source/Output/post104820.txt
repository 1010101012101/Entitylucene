"New File" feature for OS X? <body> back in the day (2006-07), before the Intel Mac days, I used an application called NuFile which let me create a "new file" like Windows on the fly. Ever since i've been searching for alternative but have been unsuccessful.   Do you guys know of any new apps that will allow this?  <answer104834> Neu allows you to do this. It's shareware and is currently priced at $10. There is also a fully functional free demo you can use. You can purchase it from MAS or from within the demo version.  About Neu:     Neu is a simple application that makes it easier to create new documents in the Finder, without you having to open an application first.      It does this by adding strong"Create Document..."/strong and strong"Create And Open Document..."/strong menus to various places, including the main menubar, the Dock, and the Services menu that the Finder shows when you right-click on something. You can also trigger Neu from any application using a special key combination.      Neu lets you choose what to make from a list of templates, which are simply existing files. Once you've chosen a template, Neu creates a copy of it, brings the Finder to the front, and selects the new file.      Neu comes with some pre-defined templates, but you can add your own, so you can customise the types of new file available to suit your needs. It can make a blank text file, an empty letter, a shopping list, or anything else that you want. You can have one template, or a hundred - it's up to you.   <answer104837> I'd like to point you to the following answer. Open up Automater and select "Service" in the "Choose your type for your document" Dialog. Afterwards use the apple-script in the linked answer and you can now run the service via: Finder -- Services -- Create new File  Setup in Automator: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1Khm8.png" alt="Automater" Create new file in service menu of finder: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/RNrUI.png" alt="CreateNewFile"
