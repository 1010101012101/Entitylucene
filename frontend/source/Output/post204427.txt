How do I fix "Your Disk Could Not Be Partitioned" isssue with BootCamp Assistant? <body> I'm Alex and I'm attempting to install Windows 10 on my iMac 27" (2012) with 3TB+128GB Fusion Drive, but during install procedure I get the same error "Your Disk Could Not Be Partitioned" without any further explanation. The first time I tried to install Win, I got stuck on Apple Support Software download, so I canceled and I downloaded the software on a pen drive myself. So I uncleared "Download Apple Support Software" and I only cleared the option about installing Windows. The first time the partitioning started, but it got stuck. So I closed BootCamp and I repaired the disk. Since that time, BootCamp never worked anymore. I tried any possible kind of repair and recovery, including:  ul liInternet recovery/li licode/sbin/fsck -fy/code from Single User Mode/li liRepair using Disk Utility in Recovery Mode, which all said codeYour Disk appears to be OK!/code/li /ul  I have also noticed a lag with Safari Smart Bar (I don't know if it has anything to do with this, but I'm totally sure that it shouldn't happen, because I have 16 GB of RAM and a 3.6 GhZ Quad Core Intel CPU, so it MUST have to do with the Fusion Drive.  Before closing this question     Finally!   I'd like to mention that my Fusion has been replaced with another for free due to extreme disk corruption https://www.apple.com/support/imac-harddrive-3tb/ Help will be much appreciated! -Alex  <comment246448> Fusion Drives are real funny about disk partition. <comment246454> What do you mean for "funny"? I know that they have weird properties with partitioning, but they are MADE to work and even if they are not the same thing of HDD they can be partitioned for use with BCA. If they don't, it's Apple doing wrong things, not Fusion Drives :)
