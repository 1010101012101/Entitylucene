How can I verify if SSH is disabled with the Terminal on Sierra? <body> I would like to know the command line to verify the status of SSH on Sierra please.   I tried using systemctl but got a codecommand not found/code.   Thanks !  <answer282739> precodesudo systemsetup -getremotelogin /code/pre  This will return "Remote Login: On" or "Off" depending on the state of the Remote Login option in Sharing.prefpane.  There's no such thing as systemctl on macOS, but systemsetup does many things; check the list with codesudo systemsetup -help/code.  <answer282753> The use of "systemctl" seems with I am conversing with another Linux person crossing over.  I feel your struggle. :)  I would use the same method to check this on both platforms.   Confirm if the port is open. Don't trust the vendor tools, they change, often.  Mac: codenetstat -anl|grep LISTEN|grep "*.22"/code   Linux: codenetstat -anl|grep LISTEN|grep ":22"/code  <answer282775> Besides using codesudo systemsetup -getremotelogin/code you can open OS X System Preferences  Sharing  and make sure strongRemote login/strong is unchecked.  <comment356339> How do you know that the service listening on port 22 is indeed `sshd`? <comment356361> The title of question is "How can I verify if SSH is disabled **with the Terminal** on Sierra?" <comment356391> Thanks though for this extra bit of information. Is it me or macOS activates and deactivates automatically SSH when using it in the command-line ? Here's what I mean, I used it to connect to a device on my network from my Mac, at that time it was unticked in the Sys Pref pane, though I still could use it, do my stuff, quit the terminal. Then when I go back to Sys Pref it's still unticked, even though I used it. Does it turn on and off only when you need it when you run it ? <comment356429> Guys, thank you for the downvotes! My answer is just another alternative solutions to Espressotron questions. grgarside is totally right. @Espressotron you can mark your question as answered. <comment356732> @SAlder Tried this command and it returned nothing does that mean that port 22 is locked ?
