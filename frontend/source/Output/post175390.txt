Error message when copying files over to Mac Server <body> I keep receiving the following error message when copying files, from my iMac and my Macbook, over to my Mac Mini Server.     The Finder can’t complete the operation because some data in   “filename.pdf” can’t be read or written. (Error code -36)   But regardless of the error message, single files will still copy over. Multiple files however, will copy the first file, then kick the error message and stop.   Really a pain when I have a folder with 100's of images and I have to copy each image over individually!  However, when I copy files from a PC Desktop or Laptop to the Mac Server, no error message occurs.  I've been dealing with this issue for months and have not found a solution. I get the same message no matter what type of file it is.....PDF, JPG, DOC, Ai, etc.  Can anybody help??  <answer175397> The Finder can be a problem when you drag huge file &amp; folder structures in the IU.   Try using the codecp/code command in Terminal if you're moving many hundreds of files, as it bypasses all the overhead the Finder imposes when manually dragging:  codecp [source_file] [target_destination]/code  codecp -R ~/Desktop/BigFolderOfFiles /Volumes/&lt;server&gt;/&lt;directory&gt;/code  From codeman cp/code:     -R    If source_file designates a directory, cp copies the directory   and the entire subtree connected              at that point.  If the source_file ends in a /, the contents of the directory are copied rather              than the directory itself.   In Terminal, it is quite easy to do this without a lot of typing. You can drag folder icons into the terminal window and have the paths auto-expand, (and it escapes any spaces for you, too.)  You simply type:  codecp -R/code [space] drag source folder strongon the Mac/strong into Terminal window [space] drag target folder strongon the server/strong into Terminal window, check to make sure it looks OK, then hit return. You can use the code-v/code option to have Terminal list every file transferred.  Its worth a look at codeman cp/code to see the various options.  strongExperiment first/strong to make sure you understand the concepts!  <answer240502> use codedot_clean/code, the directory which is being copied and throwing the Error codeCode 36/code, the basics look like this:  Launch the Terminal (found in code/Applications/Utilities//code or with Spotlight) At the command prompt, type:  precodedot_clean /Path/To/Directory/With/Problem/ /code/pre  When dot_clean is finished, attempt the file copy again and it should succeed with no error code For example, if copying strong~/Documents/FileBackups//strong is the problematic directory, use:  precodedot_clean ~/Documents/FileBackups/ /code/pre  For more info see http://osxdaily.com/2015/02/21/fix-error-code-36-finder-mac-os-x/  <comment206782> Do you get the error when copying files via the Terminal? <comment206915> Thanks for the info! I was hoping for a more user-friendly route. I have minimal work in Terminal, but will give this a shot. You mentioned copying hundreds of files might be an issue, but even when I have a folder with 2 files in, it only ever copies the first, then kicks the error message. <comment206916> I have never tried copying via Terminal. I was hoping for a more user-friendly approach <comment206991> I can appreciate you wanting an easier approach however preforming the same tasks you did in Finder in Terminal is being done for diagnostic purposes, not intended to be a replacement! <comment295619> We try to avoid one line answers. What does this do? How does it work?
