Set aspect ratio to 4:3/li liobserve that, on the very first image, the program has chosen a bad crop. there's uninteresting stuff on the right (next to the text title) and not enough of the left side./li liuse the hand tool to move the image and fix the crop./li liexport to a quicktime movie using 'custom export'/li liplay quicktime movie with quicktime player/li liobserve that cropping is now emdifferent/em -- back more or less to the original./li liimport into iMovie/li liimage is then recropped on the left, resulting in complete frustration./li /ol  Any way out of this? Is there something about aspect ratio that I don't understand, or is iLife 11 just buggier than a new york hotel?  <answer7356> Make sure you have it set to codePreserve Aspect Ratio: Letterbox./code brPhoto in this question.
