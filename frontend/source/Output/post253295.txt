What does this button do in the iTunes device sync status bar? <body> When an iPhone is plugged in and syncing, the status bar shows a message like:     Syncing "Phone" (Step 2 of 6)   On the left side of the bar there is this icon:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7jJcd.png" alt="enter image description here"  It darkens when clicked, which implies that it's a button. If I had to guess from the icon alone, I would say "rotate clockwise", but that doesn't make sense in this context.  Hovering does not display a tooltip. Clicking it does not have any visible effect.  What is this button?  <answer253299> It is the skip button for skipping the current process. The button usually only shows on skippable actions and is most commonly shown for an iOS device iTunes backup.  <comment315205> Makes sense. Any idea why clicking it doesn't skip the current process? <comment315218> @Robert Most likely a bug, in that it shouldn't be shown when it's not possible to skip.
