Sync iOS app using Wi-Fi network in Windows 7 <body> I am using Windows 7 and have the latest version of iTunes installed.  The USB port is disabled for security purposes but I want to sync my iOS device to my PC, so I am thinking that I can use Wi-Fi. How can I do that?  <answer166743> You will need to connect the device over USB the first time before you can use iTunes Wi-Fi Sync.
