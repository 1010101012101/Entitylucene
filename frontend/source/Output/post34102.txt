How can I set up multihoming? <body> I am running Mac OS X Server 10.6 on my iMac and I am wondering how to multihome a Mac. I know it's possible to accomplish this by using both Wi-fi and Ethernet, but I just want to use Ethernet. Any idea how to set this up? Thanks.  <answer34179> Got it. All you have to do is add multiple Ethernet interfaces in Network Preferences. And then just configure each one to the correct settings and you're set to go. I tested this by hosting two different websites on two different IPs by multihoming my iMac and it worked!  ul liSystem Prefs - Network dialog/li liPress the code+/code button and select the interface you want to add to (you may need to go back  and identify which one if you have multiple Ethernet ports)./li liName the service and press "Create"/li liConfigure the new service as you would a static (manual) interface/li liClick "Apply"/li /ul  <comment38902> What do you hope to achieve? Do you have two networks or two internet services that you wish to use? <comment38904> Yes, I would like to run two websites on the server. <comment39005> You can also use [name-based virtual sites](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/vhosts/name-based.html) to avoid the need for multihoming.
