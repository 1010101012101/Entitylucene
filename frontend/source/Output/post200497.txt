MBP 2015 with Iris Pro Only and External Monitor <body> I'm about to buy a MBP edition 2015 (15'').  There are two models:   ul limodel having only Intel Iris Pro  (without dedicated graphic card)/li limodel having Radeon graphic card/li /ul  I don't play video games, and I do not use 3D/video softwares.br Mostly programming softwares.   However, I want to use an Apple Thunderbolt screen of 27'' as external and additional monitor.   Should the model having only Iris Pro be enough to handle this monitor (multiple-displays)?   <answer200498> Graphics and Video support  Intel Iris Pro Graphicsâ€‹ 2.2GHz - 256GB  Intel Iris Pro Graphics 2.5GHz - 512GB  Intel Iris Pro Graphics  precodeAMD Radeon R9 M370X with 2GB GDDR5 memory and automatic graphics switching Dual display and video mirroring: Simultaneously supports full native  resolution on the built-in display and up to 3840 by 2160 pixels on up to two external displays, both at millions of colors /code/pre  Thunderbolt digital video output   precodeNative Mini DisplayPort output DVI, VGA, dual-link DVI and HDMI output supported using Mini DisplayPort adapters (sold separately) Support for up to 5120-by-2880 resolution at 60Hz on a single external display (model with AMD Radeon R9 M370X only) /code/pre  HDMI video output      Support for 1080p resolution at up to 60Hz     Support for 3840-by-2160 resolution at 30Hz     Support for 4096-by-2160 resolution at 24Hz  retrieved from https://support.apple.com/kb/SP719?locale=en_US  <answer207387> I had the 2011 Mac Air and it happily drove the external 27" thunderbolt display (2560x1440) - and it only had a 384MB Intel chip. The MBP is designed for multiple monitors - mine has 2 external 2560x1440 monitors plus its internal screen running at 2880x1800.   <comment241583> what size is the screen? (13 or 15 inch) <comment241584> 15. I updated the post. <comment241585> I am not entirely familiar with Apple's Iris but I have been able to connect and run one of my PC's to an HD television without a dedicated graphics card. <comment241586> Nice! So I can be confident since I don't plan to use a 5120x2880 monitor but one or two 3840x2160. <comment241588> I have asked what they are running at the Apple Stores, and it seems to be a macbook pro (base model) with a 27" thunderbolt display. <comment241589> They have macbook pro linked to external monitor in apple stores? <comment241590> @Mik378 In Canada they do when they are doing training sessions. A few years ago they did in the Upper Canada Mall store. They sometimes use the Macbook Air though. <comment241592> I think they were only running Intel Graphics 4000 too. <comment241594> "Support for up to 5120-by-2880 resolution at 60Hz on a single external display (model with AMD Radeon R9 M370X only)". This line may confirm that with lower resolutions, Intel Iris Pro is supposed to make the job.
