Applescript : Only run the script if specific input is entered <body> Is it possible to run an applescript ONLY if a specific input is inserted If I put in my attempts at the code i might be clearer at what Im getting at  precodeset x to display dialog "What is your password?" default answer "" with hidden answer set y to (text returned of x)   display dialog (text returned of x) display dialog y  if (text returned of y) is 3232 then   display dialog "Hi" buttons ["OK"] end if /code/pre  All the in-between stuff is just testing and making sure everything is working properly   <answer225064> First, you're trying to check against codetext returned of y/code, where codey/code is codetext returned of x/code â€“ a strongstring/strong, not a strongdialog result/strong so codetext returned of y/code won't work. Just use codey/code.  Second, you need to be testing your strongstring/strong stored in codey/code against another strongstring/strong, not a number. Wrap code3232/code in quotes:  precodeset x to display dialog "What is your password?" default answer "" with hidden answer set y to (text returned of x)   display dialog (text returned of x) display dialog y  if y is "3232" then   display dialog "Hi" buttons ["OK"] end if /code/pre
