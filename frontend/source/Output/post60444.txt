Time Machine won't backup with Mountain Lion Server <body> I have a Mac Mini with OS X Mountain Lion Server installed.  I've turned on Time Machine in the server app and selected an internal disk to backup clients to.  On my iMac, I have turned on Time Machine and selected the backup share listed on the server.  But, I recieve the following error dialog box:  Time Machine couldn’t complete the backup to “server”.  Back disk is not available.  I'm clearly able to connect to the server and the Shared Items  Backup folder, which the server created.  I'm also made sure file permissions look right.  Any ideas?  <answer62710> It worked for me as posted here: http://forum.qnap.com/viewtopic.php?p=280705:  ol liOpen a terminal/li liType in the following line:   /li /ol  codesudo tmutil setdestination afp://TimeMachine:password@192.168.10.200/TMBackup/code  (where "password" is your Timemachine password and the IP address is your Time Machine IP Address. The NAS disk ipaddress TMBackup is the Time machine share)  ol liOpen System Preferences/li liClick on TimeMachine/li liChoose select disk.../li liSelect your TimeMachine backup disk (TMBackup)/li /ol  Enjoy backing-up your Mac OSX Mountain Lion.  <answer72511> I kept getting codeBackup not available/code so before doing a codetmutil setdest/code I unmounted the drive and manually mounted using codemount_afp/code, that did the trick for me.
