What will happen if I copy more pictures to my iCloud account than my iPhone has in spare space? <body> I have lots of pictures and videos stored on a NAS (that isn't backed up). I want to move the pictures and videos to my iCloud account since I pay for increased storage on that and it will have better backup rather than anything that I would ever be able to do, and just leave movies on the NAS.  What will happen on my iPhone once I do this? Will it just max out, or is there anyway for it to ignore those? Otherwise what's the point of being able to purchase more iCloud storage than your iPhone has?  <answer252269> In the Photos Settings in the Settings app on your iPhone, you can select optimize storage.  Then will it only save often viewed pictures in full quality, and rarely viewed as a thumbnail, if you're looking at a picture on your iPhone it'll automatically start to download the picture in best quality.  <comment313948> It would be wise to keep at least one local backup in case you: 1) Erase them by mistake 2) Lose access to your iCloud account  3) Apple lose your data
