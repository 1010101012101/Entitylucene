difference between "Development certificate" and "Developer ID certificate" <body> I am reading the pdf (from Apple) named App Distribution Guide. In page 155 it is written that every team member can create a "Developement certificate", that the team admins can create a "Distribution certificate" (which is used to be able to update the app in iTunes Connect) but only the team agent can create "Developer ID certificate". What actually is this?  <answer214264> Page 160: "Developer ID certificates are used to distribute your [Mac] app outside the Mac App Store."
