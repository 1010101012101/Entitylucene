Prevent email signature from being inserted when replying <body> Is there a way to prevent Mail.app on OS X from auto inserting your email signature when replying to a message?  <answer61838> You can set the default signature or "None" for each mail account in Preferences - Signatures  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/IeP2X.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer90880> I believe you can create a template for a new email (which would include you signature) and then leave signatures off everywhere else by setting our signature to none.  The template can be a draft message or a sent message. Either way you have the option of sending them again, which makes them de facto templates.   <answer116069> With MacMail the only way to do this is to set the default to no signature, and then use a program like TextExpander to insert a signature for you.  You CAN do this in Mozilla Thunderbird however.  Good luck B  <comment71862> I want the signature to be auto inserted on new emails, but not when replying.
