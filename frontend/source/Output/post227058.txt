Appreviewtimes.com is a very good site for estimated review times, I have found it to be very accurate.  <answer251228> Apple doesn't say anything about the size of the queue, but they do give this information on review times on the developer website (emphasis mine):     Review times may vary by app. On average, strong50% of apps are reviewed in 24 hours/strong and over strong90% are reviewed in 48 hours/strong. If your submission is incomplete, review times may be further delayed or your app may be rejected.   <comment275805> Thanks. Do you know if weekends are included in the count? <comment275823> Yes, thankfully Apple also reviews apps on the weekend! <comment277408> Thanks. With the lack of any official source, this is probably as good as it gets.
