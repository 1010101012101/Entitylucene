Why is `/etc/sysctl.conf` not determining my `kern.maxfiles` setting? <body> I've been having a persistent "too many open files in system" error on my machine (OSX 10.7.5).  When I run codesysctl kern.maxfiles/code and codesysctl kern.maxfilesperproc/code, both output code2048/code.  This article says those settings default to 12,288 and 10,240, respectively. It says you can permanently change the settings by editing code/etc/sysctl.conf/code.  I've done that. The contents of that file are now:  precodekern.maxfiles=12288 kern.maxfilesperproc=10240 /code/pre  The permissions on it are code-rw-r--r--/code, and it belongs to coderoot/code in the codewheel/code group.  This file stronghas no effect/strong on what my system is doing. After restart, if I check the maxfile settings, they are unchanged.  Is there something else controlling these settings, making my defaults lower than what they should be and overriding my explicit settings?  strongHow can I fix these settings?/strong  hr  h2Update/h2  I've since tried, to no avail:  h3Lower Limits/h3  Setting them to 4000 and 3500 in case the system ignores settings over a certain threshold.  h3Using code/etc/rc.common/code/h3  I put the following, not in code/etc/sysctl.conf/code, but in code/ect/rc.common/code:  precodesysctl -w kern.maxfiles=4000 sysctl -w kern.maxfilesperproc=3500 /code/pre  h3Using my shell's configuration file/h3  I put the same commands as above in my code.zshrc/code, but they don't work without sudo.  <answer74918> h1See code/etc/launchd.conf/code/h1  For some reason, I had this in code/etc/launchd.conf/code:  precodelimit maxfiles 2048 /code/pre  This apparently overrode my settings in code/etc/sysctl.conf/code, either by being considered more important or by being executed later in the bootup process.  After I removed this and rebooted, my settings from code/etc/sysctl.conf/code had taken effect.
