Bug with search in All Apple music <body> I am using Apple music. I try to search some music (artist "drake" for example) in All Apple Music. I see suggestion to visit artist page and Views album page and some other albums and some songs.   If I touch three dots to open menu or left icon to play this everything is ok. But If I touch generally this items there is some bug. For artist - nothing happens. For album â€” empty page opens. I know that it is incorrect behavior. It should show list of songs in album as well, but it does not show it. I can't search music normally because of that!  Yesterday I was so angry that I erased all data and reset all settings. And the bug was solved... For two hours! Now I am angry again.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/VdQOn.png" alt="enter image description here"
