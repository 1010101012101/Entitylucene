OS X: Always have an app open at specific location in the Dock, without permanently keeping it in the Dock? <body> Let's say, I sometimes want to use emApplication XYZ/em, but I strongdon't/strong want to set its Dock Option to strongemKeep in Dock/em/strong so its icon is visible at all time.  When I want to use the application, I open it with Spotlight. It will open and place itself to the right end of the applications in the Dock.   I would prefer it to lie closer to the middle.  Is there a way to place it at a specific location permanently, emwithout/em having to always keep it there, regardless of whether it's active or not?  <answer233597> No. Apps that are not kept in dock when opened will be positioned at the end of the dock.
