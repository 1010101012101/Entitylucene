How do I insert a picture into the Notes app? <body> I use the Notes app for keeping track and sharing the extended notes with fellow physicians in cardiology studies. There are a lot of pros to this app and I would find it very much useful if I could insert pictures into specific areas within Notes. (a video would make it even better). How is it possible to customize this for a such purpose and is there an alternative to this solution?  <answer47043> The iOS Notes app is not able to insert pictures.

You can let the app strongset a link of your photo note into the iPhone calendar/strong - tapping the link will open up the photo note in My Photo Note.
