How to print as PDF using Acrobat 10, when no printer is installed? <body> Preview or Acrobat can both print out individual pages of a PDF file, as a new PDF file containing only those pages, but I think Acrobat 10 probably can print out page 1, 10-12, and 5 -- in any order, while Preview can only print out the "selected page" and must be in ascending page number order.  Preview can do that, but if using Acrobat 10, then going to codeFile -&gt; Print/code will actually trigger a "No printer is installed.  Please install a printer first"...  The thing is, I am really trying to print as a PDF file and there is no printer around... so is there a way to get past that dialog and print the pages as a PDF file?  <answer49721> When you have a file that you want to print as a PDF, go to "Print.." (kbdCommand âŒ˜/kbd + kbdP/kbd) and select "PDF" in the left hand corner:br img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nzAtD.jpg" alt=""  Then select "Save as PDF...":br img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bC0NC.jpg" alt=""br Then, you'll be presented with a save dialog:br img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bJbaG.jpg" alt=""br Using this method, you shouldn't need to have a printer installed.  <comment36138> Have you tried using export rather then print? <comment36271> There isn't an "export" on my Acrobat 10 on the Mac... (Acrobat Reader X (10.1.1)) <comment51558> It should be in the Print dialog under "Print to PDF" in the left-hand corner of the dialog. <comment60573> did you try it with Acrobat 10?  (as in the question, works ok in Preview but not with Acrobat 10) <comment70673> You clearly didn't read the OP =/ <comment84758> Don't you need Adobe Distiller for full PDF printing?
