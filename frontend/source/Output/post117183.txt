Is it important to backup public keys for iOS Developer Certificates? <body> I have read everywhere that you need to backup your strongprivate keys/strong for iOS Developer Certificates on your Mac. I want to know if strongpublic key/strong is important to backup or not. In case if a person just keeps backup of Private keys of all certificates, can public keys be recovered on new OS installation using those old private keys? Or in other words, can I re-use those old backup certificates successfully? So Does it really matter if I do not backup public keys?  May be it's a lame Question, but I want to know about it. Thanks for helping me out..  <answer117184> Yes, it does matter. You can backup if you want to, but I would say it's important.   http://iphonedevsdk.com/forum/iphone-sdk-tutorials/90538-critical-back-up-your-developer-key.html  <answer117301> There's no need of backing up the strongPublic Key/strong as it is strongin/strong the actual emCertificate/em, which can be easily downloaded from the strongiOS Dev Center/strong.    When you manually generate a emCertificate/em, you firstly need to generate a emCertificate Signing Request/em through the strongKeychain Access/strong application. When this is done, both strongPublic/strong and strongPrivate/strong keys are generated. The private one is automatically saved into your Mac, whilst the public key is included in the strongCSR/strong file sent to the emProvisioning Authority/em. One of the items contained strongin/strong the generated certificate sent back from the emProvisioning Authority/em will be this public key.  <comment136947> Thank you but I have already visited this link. It tells about private key backup, not public key. <comment137098> Now this makes some sense. Thanks :)
