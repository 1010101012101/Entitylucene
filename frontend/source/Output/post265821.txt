Also how do I find which key AddressBookSourceSync tries to access? <comment333357> It depends on the trade off you want to make between usability and security but I think you can consider Safari as "safe" and give it access to your local keys. About AddressBookSourceSync, you already know that it need the keychain "iCloud", you can probably deduce the item from the context. <comment333696> Actually, you can't edit access for iCloud items. <comment334615> I tried to reset/recreate default keychain, and tried to change password.
