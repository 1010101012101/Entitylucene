Duplicate calendar events in Outlook 2011 <body> Does someone have a script to merge or delete Outlook 2011 duplicate calendar entries?  <answer236460> If your Outlook client is not crashing when you select calendars, there is a method in the UI to remove blocks of duplicate or outdated events. I can't find the link to give credit, but here is the process:  ol licreate a new calendar categorization, call it 'delete' or something./li ligo to calendars view, in stronglist/strong view not grid./li liCmd-Shift-F 'Advanced Find'/li liSelect 'All Events' button/li liSelect search option 'Date Created' = 'Any Date', or use the criteria to identify your targeted events. Select contiguous blocks by clicking one, and Shift-Click another./li liApply your 'delete' categorization via drag/drop or right-click select 'delete'/li liSelect File/Export...  ul liOutlook for Mac Data File/li liItems in the category: 'delete'/li liNext/li li'Yes, delete items after they are exported'/li liuncheck the box because you definitely want to delete all items in this category./li /ul/li liFinish/li /ol  The genius of this method is it avoids the disastrous 'prompt for delete for each event' cycle.  Sorry its not a script, I would prefer that as well but I could not find one.  <comment273249> Could you elaborate what you are trying to achieve, what method you have tried, and what kind of scripts are you looking for?
