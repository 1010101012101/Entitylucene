Setting hostname via scutil <body> When following various guides on using codescutil/code the following would seem to be correct for setting the hostname:  precode$sudo scutil –-set HostName doriath &gt; /code/pre  But as you can see instead of setting the hostname a prompt code&gt;/code is shown: and the hostname is emnot/em set.  What is wrong here?  I am on codeEl Capitan/code.  <answer263363> Try these additional commands to get your system renamed AND put double quotes around the name in each instance:  precodesudo scutil --set ComputerName "doriath"  sudo scutil --set HostName "doriath"  sudo scutil --set LocalHostName "doriath" /code/pre  This has worked for me several times. Hope it does for you too.  <answer263383> The prompt is the interactive mode of scutil which usually is invoked by the single command codescutil/code without options. To quit the interactive mode enter codequit/code at the prompt.  In your case you are simply using the wrong dash: probably the en-dash (UTF-8: U+2013 - e2 80 93) and a normal dash and your whole command is interpreted as codescutil/code only.  Instead of codesudo scutil –-set HostName doriath/code use codesudo scutil --set HostName doriath/code!  <comment329954> Thx I had tried with quotes already as well and same result as OP <comment329955> The behavior in my case  *is* strange .  I can't understand the failure mode to end up in some kind of completion shell. <comment329958> Try using the su [your username] command string before the other 3 commands. <comment329981> ya - looks like I missed replacing one of the two dashes from the cut and paste.
