Remap iTerm2 Ctrl+A Sequence to Avoid Interfering with Remote tmux <body> Several posts cover the concept of making equivalents of the kbdCtrl/kbd+kbda/kbd shortcut; that is not what I'm trying to do. My issue is I want the functional equivalent of this shortcut in iTerm2 and not have it interfere with tmux in my ssh sessions. As it stands, even if I add a mapping (such as what's suggested here), all I'm doing is adding the equivalent of kbdCtrl/kbd+kbda/kbd, which does not help. I want to move the cursor to the beginning of the line, not press this key combination.  How do I accomplish this?
