Time Machine: restore files from multiple dates <body> my non-TimeMachine-ed drive died and so did my files on this drive. But maybe TimeMachine can still help:  Normally, I'd create an important file in my folder new_creation where it would sit for a few days until I could transfer it to the (now dead) drive. Thus every important file should have been captured by TimeMachine at some point. Then I would delete the file from new_creation. Unfortunately as I'm lazy there were dozens of files old and new in this folder at any time.  Is there any way to restore any file that has ever been in this folder? Without manually comparing hundreds of backups and dates, experiencing the vertigo of opening TimeMachine over and over again?  Thanks!

BackupLoupe had been reading for 10 hours. When I came back I guess TimeMachine had also tried to start a backup. I only saw a "a new backup needs to be created" message from TM. I canceled this. Still my old backup had a lock icon, BackupLoupe wouldn't do anything. I haven't taken it up with the developers because I have already spent 10 days trying to recover files or backups. Now I've given up, created a new TM backup
