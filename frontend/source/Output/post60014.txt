How do I add all Tweets to the Mountain Lion Notification Center? <body> I love the Notification center gesture and would love to be able to glance at my full Twitter stream that way. How can I put all of Twitter into that notification area?  <answer60015> You canâ€™t get your Twitter stream in the Notification Center. Only those tweets that someone sends to you or those of the people you follow are sent to the Notification Center.  <answer63394> You can get the home timeline from the Twitter API and display tweets using terminal-notifier.  precode#!/usr/bin/env ruby -KU -rubygems  require 'twitter' require 'cgi'  Twitter.configure do |config|   config.consumer_key = ""   config.consumer_secret = ""   config.oauth_token = ""   config.oauth_token_secret = "" end  timeline = Twitter.home_timeline first = timeline.first.id previous = `defaults read me.lri.scripts nctwitter 2&gt; /dev/null`.chomp minid = previous == "" ? 0 : previous.to_i + 1 `defaults write me.lri.scripts nctwitter #{first}`  timeline.each do |tweet|   break if tweet.id &lt;= minid   system("terminal-notifier", "-message", CGI.unescapeHTML(tweet.text),   "-title", tweet.user.screen_name)   # system("/usr/local/bin/growlnotify", "-t", tweet.user.screen_name,   # "-m", CGI.unescapeHTML(tweet.text)) end /code/pre  codegrowlnotify/code would stack multiple notifications and not clip the text in long tweets.  The Twitter library can be installed with codesudo gem install twitter/code.  You can run the script every minute by editing the crontab with codeEDITOR=nano crontab -e/code and adding a line like code* * * * * ~/bin/nctwitter/code.  hr  A recent update to Tweetbot added an option to send notifications for all tweets:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/orFBY.png" alt=""  <answer63408> You could also use the Growl app which will show all tweets you are interested in.  <comment73370> Could you elaborate on your answer more? How would one set up Growl to do this, etc? <comment76891> Nice listing! Wondering why you did come up with this when you actually believe it wouldn't make any sense :)
