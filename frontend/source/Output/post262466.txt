OS X El Capitan not working after login <body> My Mac boots up just fine but as soon as I login, the Dock is gone, Finder doesn't respond, nor does it show files or applications other than some default ones and I can't open them or use Spotlight via kbdcommand/kbd-kbdspace/kbd.   I don't have a backup of my Mac. I have tried booting it in safe mode, using OS X Internet Recovery and OS X Recovery to try reinstall the OS but since the OS isn't there and replaced with a new OS it can't download, I've tried resetting PRAM. I've tried booting into single-user mode to enter commands to try installing the new OS but didn't succeed.   While in OS X Recovery, I ran First Aid in Disk Utility and it came back that it was fine and all.   I have no idea what to do to fix this. I'd rather fix the computer in my home than try and bring it to someone who can fix it in a shop.   If it helps for information, my Mac is an iMac 27" (about Mid-2012).
