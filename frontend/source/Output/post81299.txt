Mountain Lion no login field after booting <body> My 2012 MBA (no bootcamp) just shows a bare splash screen without user avatar nor password field after booting. Now I've seen this problem twice, I can type my password and then hit return on keyboard to login, but the login field never shows.  What's the problem here? Any fixes?  <answer85318> The problem is that OS X detects 2 monitors and thinks that the secondary monitor is the main one.  This can happen with a monitor connected to the Thunderbolt port or in your case, as you state in a comment above, using virtual monitor software Air Display.  Apparently, Air Display didn't detect that the built-in MacBook Air monitor was active, so it sent the video signal over WiFi to a peer Air Display device.   As a consequence you only saw the bare splash screen.  <comment93773> Do you have an external display plugged in or are you otherwise using the Thunderbolt port? <comment93897> @jaume No, but you've given me a hint. I have installed Air Display, I think it may be the reason, I'll remove it and see whether it'll happen again. Thanks! <comment93899> Good, try it and report back. <comment98249> @jaume I can now confirm it is caused by Air Display, after un-istalled it this never happens again. Would you please write an answer so that I can close this question? <comment98307> Thanks for your feedback, it's great you could isolate the cause. I added an answer as you requested.
