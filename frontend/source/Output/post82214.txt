hdiutil convert/rsize resource temporarily unavailable <body> When trying to convert or resize a dmg image I get the error:  precodehdiutil: convert failed Resource Temporarily Unavailable error /code/pre  or  precodehdiutil: resize: failed. Resource temporarily unavailable (35). /code/pre  (hdiutil error code 35).  <answer82215> The problem appears to happen when you unmount the image using codeumount/code.   Remount the image (either using codehdiutil attach/code or just double click the image) and use the command codehdiutil detach/code it again. This will unmount and eject the image.   precodehdiutil detach /Volumes/&lt;your image&gt; /code/pre  <answer103138> Another possibility is that the disk image is still mounted (from previous work on it). In this case, just select the eject icon.  Afterwards, the hdiutil convert worked great.   <answer284392> restart your machine and it run it again it should work.  <comment248926> The mounted images still appear in "Disk Utility" when you can remove them. <comment358644> We're looking for long answers that provide some explanation and context.
