URL for Omnifocus Context <body> I would like to use a URL in Launch Pad Pro to open the "Home" context in OmniFocus whenever I get home.   I know to get to a perspective you use:  omnifocus:///perspective/PerspectiveName  But I've tried this for contexts, and it isn't working.  omnifocus:///context/Home  <answer228899> I think this might not be exactly what you want, but it is possible to create a perspective with only the items in your home context, which you could have the url link to. That's the best solution I could find.  <comment279247> That's good enough for me Ethan. I hadn't thought of that. Thanks!
