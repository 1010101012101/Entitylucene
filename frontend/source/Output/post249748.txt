Delete iCloud backup iOS 9 <body> I am using iOS 9. I would like to delete my iCloud backup. So I go to Settings  iCloud  Storage  Manage Storage like the support page says to do.   Unfortunately when I do that I get the message "Cannot delete backup This backup cannot be deleted at this time". What do I need to do next? What is the problem?   <answer249775> There is a solution for that on the internet I believe. http://macreports.com/icloud-this-backup-cannot-be-deleted-at-this-time-error-fix/  Try restarting your phone and reconnecting to the wifi or even logging out and logging back in to your Apple ID.

While on support, they stated that:     Once an iCloud backup restore has been activated for a device, a   restore-block is placed on the backup for 48 hours. During this time,   the backup cannot be deleted.   Prior to discovering this rule they had me:  ol liLogout of icloud/li liRestart the phone/li liLog back into icloud/li liAttempt deletion again/li /ol
