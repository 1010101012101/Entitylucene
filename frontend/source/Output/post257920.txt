How can I disable the macbook keyboard with Shift key held down on a password protected macbook? <body> This question is a bit strange, but here's the scenario:  ul limacbook air laptop with El Capitan Mac OS X/li licurrently logged off any account/li liliquid damage on keyboard has caused shift key to be permanently pressed/li lipassword to admin account has some lowercase letters and numbers/li lirestarting enters "safe mode" /li /ul  The machine has no sensitive data, so I'm happy for a solution even if it wipes out the admin account. I'm also happy to buy a USB keyboard/plug into an external screen if that will help.  How can I disable this pesky shift key? Or disable the built in keyboard all together?  <answer270108> same problem here, thought of changing the keyboard. make your login all CAPS letter and install karabiner software where you can disable left shift key..   <answer271333> Disable keyboard:  precodesudo kextunload /System/Library/Extensions/AppleUSBTopCase.kext/Contents/PlugIns/AppleUSBTCKeyboard.kext/ /code/pre  Enable keyboard:  precodesudo kextload /System/Library/Extensions/AppleUSBTopCase.kext/Contents/PlugIns/AppleUSBTCKeyboard.kext/ /code/pre  For manipulation, you can use the virtual keyboard: System Preferences  Keyboard  Keyboard  Display panel "Keyboard" and "Symbols" in the menu bar  <comment322329> I found this for capslock, but idk how it might be modified for shift - https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles/issues/310 - maybe someone smarter than me can figure it out. [Though it does occur to me that you'd be typing it in all-caps;) <comment339412> Can you elaborate how the OP can make his login name all CAPS, given the state the machine is in as described in the question?
