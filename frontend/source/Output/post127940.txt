How can I purge my iPad's Pending Downloads list? <body> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dVkt4.jpg" alt="134 pending downloads"  I might make gone a bit crazy with the number of free TV show episodes I've purchased. How can I delete everything on this list? When I press the Edit button on the top left, I see outlines of circles next to each item, but I cannot select them for deletion.
