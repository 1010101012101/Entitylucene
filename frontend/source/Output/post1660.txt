How can I make iPhone clock alarms obey vibrate-only mode? <body> In the Clock app, if I use a timer or alarm that goes off while my iPhone is on vibrate mode, the alarm sound still goes off.  Is there a way to make it obey the vibrate mode?  Or a way to tell it whether or not to ignore it?  <answer1661> Calendar alarms obey the mute switch.  Clock alarms do not.    Personally, I consider this a feature and not a bug--but I can understand why you'd at least want the option.  However, short of jailbreaking, there is currently no way to change this behavior in the Apple-provided applications.  <answer3449> You might want to try using a different alarm clock app such as Awaken or Alarm Clock Pro.  These apps WILL obey the iPhones vibrate setting (I think). Even if they don't, they will still let you customize the ringtone of your alarms to make them quieter...  <answer28324> Create a silent ringtone (e.g. a short piece of silence in Garage Band or the ringtone creator of your choice) and set that as the sound for the alarm.  <comment1470> Given the confusion below, you may want to clarify the title ("Make iPhone clock alarm...") <comment1471> I set alarms all the time, and sometimes miss them because I leave my phone on vibrate instead of sound lol. With the Timer, I'm not sure that's an option, but Alarm should obey the vibrate on/off switch. <comment1472> @pinko:  Thanks, I edited in some clarification. <comment3124> Fore sure it is a feature as it is explained in the manual exactly like you write it above.
