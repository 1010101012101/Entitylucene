Background app to send power to dock connector peripherals? <body> Is there an app which runs in the background that will activate the power out on the Apple 30-pin dock connector (or similar Lightning port with adapter) in order to power peripherals?  I have a Griffin Stompbox foot pedal which can send MIDI signals to apps, but it requires power via the iOS device. The app I am trying to use it with does not send power out, so I'm trying to create a workaround to get the communication going.  I know that OnSong can do this, but I am looking for a FREE (or cheap) way of doing it, if possible.
