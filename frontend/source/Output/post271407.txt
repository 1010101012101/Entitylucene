How to increase delay for failed SSH login attempts on OS X? <body> I wish to increase the delay between failed SSH login attempts on my MacBook (OS X 10.9.5). I see around various suggestions for Linux, such as adding a line:  precodeauth       optional   pam_faildelay.so  delay=300000 /code/pre  to code/etc/pam.d/sshd/code, but there is no codepam_delay.so/code on OS X, I think. So what to do?  (I migrated this question from Stack Overflow, where it was not appropriate.)
