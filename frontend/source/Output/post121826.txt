How can I create a bootable USB drive for Ubuntu from OS X? <body> I've decided to switch from OS X to Ubuntu. I'm following the documentation on Ubuntu's site for creating a bootable USD Drive.  I converted the ISO to IMG. I ran codediskutil list/code. I inserted my flash drive and ran codediskutil/code list again. My drive is assigned to code/dev/disk1/code. I ran diskutil unmountDisk /dev/disk1. Then I executed codesudo dd if=/ubuntu-13.10-desktop-amd64.dmg of=/dev/rdisk1 bs=1m/code. Then I ran codediskutil eject /dev/disk1/code. Then I restarted, held the alt/option key. The Boot Manager came up, but my flash drive wasn't coming up as an option.  I tried this again just now and it said "The disk you inserted was not readable by this computer." I've never had an issue with this drive before. I restarted anyway, just to see if it worked and I'm still only getting my main hard drive as an option in Boot Manager.  Where do I go from here?  <answer122121> It sounds like your USB flash drive is not recognized as being bootable?  Try using UNetbootin (http://unetbootin.sourceforge.net/). It should make your USB flash drive bootable.  Download the the version for Mac OS X and simply run it. Follow the prompts and select your USB flash drive, ISO file, or have it download the latest ISO for you. I've used UNetbootin several times under OS X for various Linux distros and it's always worked well.  <answer122282> I have tested what follows on two different MacBook Pros:  ul li13-inch, Mid 2010 (2.66 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo, 8GB RAM, Nvidia GeForce 320M 256MB)/li li13-inch, Late 2011 (2.8 GHz Intel Core i7, 16GB RAM, Intel HD Graphics 3000 512MB)/li /ul  h2Overview/h2  Create Bootable USB Drive using Startup Disk Creator in Ubuntu itself. br/strongNote:/strong I use Ubuntu daily as a Tomcat Web Server and Java Development environment, and I do so in a Virtual Machine. I understand this is not the most ideal arrangement for someone wishing to create a bootable USB disk to boot a Mac to, but it works, and has proven reliable for me. If you are bent on using Ubuntu natively and want to test it first, a VM is one way to do it, and booting to USB is another.

However, VirtualBox is free to download and use and from what I understand, works quite well also.  That said, I created a Bootable USB Stick using Startup Disk Creator in my Ubuntu 13.10 VM, so I will explain here the steps:  ol liInstall Ubuntu 13.10 in Virtual Machine.  ul liIf this does not quell your curiosity as to whether or not to run Ubuntu natively, then proceed.../li /ul/li liDownload the Ubuntu 13.10 Mac image from here  ul liNOTE: There are 3 links to Ubuntu 13.10 for Desktop.

This is due to the fact that Ubuntu defaults to the Open Source drivers for NVidia hardware, and they are not loaded yet. If you choose to install natively, you may want to try the proprietary binary drivers provided by NVidia.  The USB drive you see referenced in that screen shot has Ubuntu 13.10 on it and Boots successfully on the two systems mentioned above.  <comment142133> I have done the same thing. Firstly, it is easier to create a bootable Ubuntu disk from Ubuntu itself. I do that from an Ubuntu VM. This can be done in VMware Fusion or Virtual Box. Then you need to make sure you download the right Ubuntu ISO. There are several builds available for 13.10 for example. Make sure you download the one that includes support for Intel based Macs. Can you post which Ubuntu image/version you downloaded? <comment142667> The USB flash drive is booting now, but I'm receiving an error magic alloc is broken. From a brief search online I found that this is a known issue, so I'm digging through forums trying to find a fix. I tried UNetbootin, but it won't let me create a bootable USB flash drive for Mac, only Windows. I've tried several times and it keeps telling me that it was unable to create a bootable drive for Mac and that it'll only work on Windows. I'm wondering if this could have something to do with Mavericks. Any ideas? <comment142669> I was able to create a bootable USB stick and I'm receiving an error when trying to load Ubuntu that magic alloc is broken. Apparently, this is a known issue when using Mac Linux USB Loader and I'm trying to find a fix. Any ideas? <comment142670> Can you post your setup? Which Mac (13"MacBook Pro Mid 2011 for example), latest firmware updates for the EFI firmware? ... If you have all the latest Mac updates, the answer to that last one is probably 'yes' but it is worth asking. <comment142680> I'm running a late-2007 MacBook (White) and late-2009 iMac. The MacBook is running Mac OS X Tiger. The iMac is running Mac OS X Mavericks 10.9.2. I can't get all of the info for my MacBook right now, but here's the info for my iMac. Model Identifier: iMac10,1 Boot ROM Version: IM101.00CC.B00 SMC Version (system): 1.52f9 <comment142686> I just posted instructions as an Answer. I know creating and firing up a VM is not ideal for you, but it is reliable for creating a bootable USB, and should provide you with alternatives as to how you want to experience Ubuntu before carrying on installing it natively. <comment142892> Hi Chad, This is all new to me, but I'm going to give this a try. <comment143189> I spoke with the creator of the software I have been using and he said what I'm experiencing is a known issue with the software and that he's currently developing a fix. In the meantime, I'm trying to create a bootable USB using Parallels. <comment143195> This is a known issue with the software I used. <comment143196> I formatted my USB stick using MS-DOS FAT. Is this the right format? The drive is mounted in Ubuntu using Parallels, but it's not showing up in Startup Disk Creator in the Disk To Use box. <comment143202> Does the device show up in Ubuntu at /mnt/media/ ? <comment143203> It's displaying in Ubuntu as UNKNOWN, which is the current name associated with that USB stick. I'm trying it in VMWare Fusion now. Is there a way that I can just install Ubuntu using Parallels, VirtualBox or VMWare Fusion as the only operating system on my system? <comment143205> No. VMWare/Parallels/VirtualBox has to have a Host operating system unless you intend to run something like (the very expensive) Enterprise Virtualization on "bare metal" that is offered by VMWare. If it is mounted properly, you should see the device icon pop up in the Launcher bar on the left inside Ubuntu.
