How do I determine which application launched automator service? <body> Is there a way to determine which application launched a Automator Service?   The idea is to check the app that launched the service, with a shell/apple script and react differently depending which app it was.   EDIT:   So when I do something like this...  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MiRQF.png" alt="Launching service"  the service, created in Automator, can tell which application was that it was launched from.  EDIT2:  The solution suggested, to query for the front most app using Applescript, while a possible solution is far from ideal. It seems to me that if the system is busy or there are delays in the launching of the workflow, it could return the wrong app and confuse the workflow.  <answer145081> You can place this Applescript in your workflow:  precodetell application "System Events" to get name of first process whose frontmost is true /code/pre  It will output the name of the current foreground app (you can't really call a service from an inactive application). You can then pass it as a string into another action like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/AWlxg.png" alt="Workflow with the applescript passed into a textedit document"  <answer145090> AppleScript:  precodetell application "System Events"         -- Get App Name     set frontApp to (path to frontmost application as Unicode text)      -- Match App Name     if frontApp ends with "ThisParticular.app:" then         -- Do this and that     end if  end tell /code/pre  <answer145183> Buscar's comment made me check the process hierarchy and it turns out, a service is a sub-sub-sub process of the application that launched it.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/axnVo.jpg" alt="Application and it&#39;s service"  So, even though in many cases, a query for the codefrontmost application/code may be ok, I think looking at the process tree is better.  Here is some sample code from a test Service Workflow that for me appears to work every time...  precodeon run {input, parameters}      set arpid to (do shell script "echo $PPID")     display dialog "Automator Runner PID is: " &amp; arpid      set srpid to (do shell script "ps -o ppid -p " &amp; arpid &amp; " | tail -1")     display dialog "Service Runner PID is: " &amp; srpid      set appid to (do shell script "ps -o ppid -p " &amp; srpid &amp; " | tail -1")     display dialog "Application PID is: '" &amp; first word of appid &amp; "'"      tell application "System Events"         set activeApp to (name of first process whose unix id is (appid as integer))     end tell      display dialog activeApp      return input end run /code/pre  <comment170930> workflow service ? <comment170932> Sorry, yes an automator workflow as service. see my edit. <comment170935> When you run this from a service it will return "Automator runner" not the app that you selected the service from. <comment170939> @markhunte Well I don't know how I missed that. Fixed. <comment170943> try this in terminal sudo opensnoop -n WorkflowService <comment171081> What OS X are you using. Because that does not work on my Mavricks <comment171093> I am using Snow Leopard <comment171106> It Looks like the ppid is retuning the root pid id of 1 in 10.9 <comment171578> @markhunte: Yes correct, on Mavricks its not working. Did you find any way to make it work? <comment171586> No. I did try but could not get anything to work..
