How can I record from my Nikon Coolpix S8200 direct to photobooth? <body> I went to the Nikon site and installed S-VCNXSP-160500MF-ALLIN-ALL, but those are just transfer and editing stuff, I want to record from photobooth the raw live video.  Is it possible?  <answer262360> I think you're probably going to need Camera Control Pro 2 - the only one of their suite that isn't free. Though if you buy it from a retailer, not direct from Nikon, it's about â…“ the price.  I have a Nikon D5500 &amp; also a Logitech HD Pro C920 webcam - neither of which are natively supported by QuickTime.br Using an app called Webcam Settings it can persuade the Logitech to show as a source for QuickTime/Photo Booth etc - but it can't persuade the Nikon to show at all.  It's perfectly happy recording from Camera Control, though, including Live View to the Mac &amp; also file transfer.
