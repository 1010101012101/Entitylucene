Is it possible to temporarily remove margin from iTerm2 window? <body> I just wondering whether its possible to remove the left, right and top margin (or just all margin) temporarily in iTerm2 windows. My goal was to make the vim-airline looks better in iTerm2 by removing those margin. Here's the screenshot of the margin I want to remove..  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qud3p.png" alt="How to remove those margin?"  <answer239383> I think you have to fork and build iterm yourself. Here's a project where somebody did that: https://github.com/jaredculp/iterm2-borderless-padding
