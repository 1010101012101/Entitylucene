macOS Sierra, Security, and Tex Live Utility <body> After a fresh install of macOS Sierra, I installed the macTex distribution without any GUI programs. After that, I installed the latest release of the Tex Live Utility to update my tex distribution via a nice GUI. However, I cannot start the Tex Live Utility because macOS complains about that the program has not been signed by a verified developer. After I tried opening, there is a button under System - Security to open the program anyway, but I keep going to see the same error message. This worked with another piece of software but with Tex Live Utility, this approach fails. Any idea on how to solve it?  <answer254365> They have released a fixed version.  You can update to the newest Tex Live Utility from the command line codetlmgr update --self/code  <comment315455> You can also try changing that setting to the least restrictive ("Anywhere"? I can't remember exactly what it says) temporarily, opening the program as normal and then reenabling the setting. After a programs runs for the first time, that setting no longer affects execution of it. <comment315478> The least restrictive is "App Store and verified Developers". Before Sierra, there was a third option which was basically "Install what you want". This is not there any more... <comment315548> Two possible things to try in the answers to [this question](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/243687/allow-applications-downloaded-from-anywhere-in-macos-sierra). <comment329914> Also see http://tug.org/mactex/sierra.html
