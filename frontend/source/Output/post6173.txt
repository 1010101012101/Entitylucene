Can I play audio from my iPhone on my Mac? <body> Can I attach my iPhone 3GS to my Mac Pro so that the iPhone's audio plays through the Mac Pro's speakers?  I can easily attach my Bose headphones so that the music from the iPhone plays through them… that's cool… but I want others to hear the music through my Mac Pro's speaker system.  <answer6174> h3Sound from Apps/h3  There are probably multiple ways to do this. Perhaps some could use the existing iPhone connector. But certainly if you get a male to male headphone adapter, you could take the audio out of the iPhone and into the audio input (mic) on the desktop, then use Audacity or another program to play the sound from the mic input  h3Music from iPhone/h3  In iTunes, select your iPhone on the left column. Select music. Play.  <answer6194> If your iPhone is running (I think) 4.0 or above, I think most machines should be able to mount the phone and play the music through iTunes.   <answer6196> You can play your iPhone's emmusic/em out your mac via iTunes. You don't even have to be in sync with that iTunes library, just plug it in, navigate to your music, and press play.  If you're talking about like game audio coming out your mac's speakers... I'd take your speakers and plug them straight into the phone. There's no way I know of to use the mac as an audio route from the phone.  <answer111194> The solution is to use Miccuss or some other Bluetooth audio receiver to receive the audio via Bluetooth and pass the signal via cable to the Mac's audio input.  Miccuss works perfectly, the sound is pristine.   I am not sure why Apple can't (or won't) enable Mac's to receive audio from Bluetooth devices even when the service seem to be available in the Bluetooth profile (handsfree gateway). MS Windows Bluetooth support handsfree gateway in a hassle free way which gives it a versatility score in this area over Mac.  <answer143636> The LineIn free app worked great.  To elaborate...  The Rogue Amoeba product LineIn is an excellent free utility for listening to external audio.   With a 1/8" stereo audio cable (male on both ends), one can connect your iPhone directly to the line-in port on your Mac (you may wish to use a USB audio cable with a line-in if your machine does not have a line in and line out).  Anyway, you can plug one end of the 1/8" audio cable into your iPhone, one end into your Mac's line-in, then launch LineIn. After enabling "Play Thru", you should start hearing your iPhone audio through your Mac's speakers (or your headphones).  <answer192603> I know where this question is coming from. I sometimes like to plug my iPhone into the USB cable so it keeps being charged while I also like to play some type of videos like Periscope on the phone at all time. This leads to a problem that the AUX output from the iPhone will have background hiss noise because the USB port being plugged in.  So having the phone playing audio via the USB is the only method that can give you high quality audio output.  But unfortunately there is no commercially available method to create a USB audio receiver on OSX. But, there is an alternative. First, you must enable the iPhone's hotspot via USB. This can be done through purchasing hotspot plan from your wireless carrier or other illegal methods. Second, you must install a wireless audio receiver software like airfoil or airserver on your OSX. Third, you must enable the USB connection on your OSX's system setting under network. The name of such connection can be vary and unpredictable. Take your best guest. Fourth, enabling the audio playback on your iPhone via airplay. If you don't see the airplay, it means the connection isn't established successfully. Repeat the entire process until it does. It might never run successfully because of a number of reasons that can only be explained through a very long essay, of which I would not replicate here and now, and the connection may break after being established.  Note this method will slow down your OSX sometimes quite dramatically.  <answer192904> h1To Play Music/h1  ol liPlug in iPhone to computer via strongUSB/strong/li liOpen strongiTunes/strong/li liClick strongiPhone button/strong in iTunes near the the top left/li liUnder strongSettings/strong on the left there is  strongOn My Device/strong/li liClick strongMusic/strong, you should see all the music on your phone on the right./li liPlay that funky music./li /ol  <answer192910> Simple, and simply surprising:  ol liPlug in your iPhone to your Mac using your Lightning Cable (doesn't work with 30 pin iPhones, sorry.

You do have to be on the same wifi network for this to work.  <comment6459> That may work to get the sound *in* … but how do you turn the Mac's audio input into its audio output? <comment6472> Lots of programs will connect the mic in to the speakers. Try Audacity http://audacity.sourceforge.net/ <comment6473> Do you just want to play music from the phone, or sound from apps? The original question said "app", but has been removed in an edit. There is a major difference between the two. <comment6495> @mankoff - The original said, "music from an iPHONE app" and "music from the app." After your changes and mine, it now says, "iPhone's audio" and "music from the iPhone." What's the difference? My own take: musical output from an iPhone *is* audio output, and given that an app is required for an iPhone to produce audio, all iPhone audio output (musical or otherwise) can be assumed to be via an app. <comment6497> The difference can be seen in the answers below. Music (that could be played through the iPod app) can be played through the USB connector cable and iTunes. Music/sounds from a game require a different solution. <comment6502> @mankoff - sadly, the original question wasn't sufficiently clear enough to be able to make that distinction—i.e., while she said she wants to play music, she didn't include what app produces it. My guess (apparently shared by others) is that she was referring to the iPod app. <comment162025> For any Googlers, this setting is now under "On This iPhone" within iTunes. It doesn't allow you to view or play music from the "Music" tab when you're in the Phone's content settings. <comment169174> Could you expand your answer explaining how this app allows you to solve the problem? <comment237137> I regret that I can only give you one upvote. Awesome! Aparently works for video as well. Who know screen capping an iphone could be so easy?!? <comment280242> My iPhone 5 (IOS 9.2) seems to have an easter egg related to this. When I set the quicktime player audio recording input to the phone, the time at the top of the iPhone's screen changes to 9:41 and the cellular provider's logo changes to a wifi symbol. When I disconnect the phone or change the quicktime audio input to something else, the iPhone's display changes back to normal. <comment282541> I never add comments, but... nice!!! <comment311239> Nice - though it's a bit annoying this disables personal hotspot through USB. Can still use hotspot over WiFi though. <comment330513> sweet, anyway to make use of the wireless iTunes connection to do this? <comment349099> Will Quicktime play audio at the highest bit depth the phone provides? I am using this method to test 24-bit vs 16-bit audio and I want to know whether (1) the iPhone only plays 16-bit audio through USB or (2) Quicktimes only plays back at 16-bit <comment349105> You should ask this as a separate question. In the meantime, this might help:  http://archimago.blogspot.com/2014/10/measurements-apple-iphone-4-iphone-6.html?m=1 <comment367830> This is a great solution, I can just minify the Quicktime window and stream from my phone.
