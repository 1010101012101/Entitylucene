MacBook Pro shows only pointer when external screen is turned on <body> I'm using my MacBook Pro (Retina, Mid 2012) in an office environment connected to an external screen (Fujitsu P27T-6 IPS) using the Thunderbolt port. The lid is closed, so it should be in clamshell mode. I turn the monitor off when I leave the office, and I turn it back on when I'm back.   When I turn the screen back on the screen is black and the only thing I can see is the mouse-pointer.  It seems like the pointer is changing dependent on the context below it.  I open the lid and close it again to reset the screen.   Anyone know of a solution without having to open/close the lid?
