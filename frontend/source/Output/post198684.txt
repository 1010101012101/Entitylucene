About this Mac - Storage information on terminal <body> I am trying to reproduce the About this Mac - Storage window in the terminal.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/f4a9Q.png" alt="About this Mac - Storage window"  Is there any easy way to do this ?  For the moment, the following commands are working (quite fast):  precodemdfind kind:music -0 | xargs -0 du -k | awk '{sum += $1} END {print sum}'  mdfind kind:image -0 | xargs -0 du -k | awk '{sum += $1} END {print sum}' /code/pre  For the Applications, I use the metadata as du is way slower:  precodemdfind kind:application -0 | xargs -0 mdls -n kMDItemFSSize | awk '{sum += $3} END {print sum}' /code/pre  When using the mdls -n kMDItemFSSize command on each application separately, it provides the same result as the Get Info window. However, when running the above command, I don't have the same result as the About this Mac - storage graph.  Also, I did not find any way to get the other types of data (movies, other, backups..)  Do you guys have any idea ?  Thanks !  <answer198694> Yeah try using something like this:  precodedu /Application du /apps /code/pre  etc  Just use the path to where the files/folders of interest are. To find them you can use the codegrep/find/code and cat the results into a txt file or simply pipe the results into your codedu/code. Depends on where all your files/folders of interest are.  <comment237875> That is what I have been doing, but for the Application folder, the "du" command takes a very long time + the results are not consistent with the Storage tab.. Thanks for your answer though ! <comment237945> @zigoingoin I assume the inconsistency surfaces as a "total" less than you were expecting? Is this correct? <comment237981> In fact, I found the problem(s) for part of the question: 1. I forced spotlight to re-index the computer 2. The output is formatted in 512 bytes-blocks So the only remaining problem is how to compute the Application folder size FAST (and accurately).  There is also the "other" tab, but I will use the df command and substract this with the other results <comment240522> @zigoingoin will put more thought into this question... please revisit this week.
