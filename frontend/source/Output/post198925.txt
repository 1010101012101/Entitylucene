OS X Calendar won't sync to iPhone <body> If I put an event in Calendar, on my Mac, in does not sync to my iPhone. However it does sync if I put an event into the iPhone when it will then pick up the previous unsynced events.  <answer199031> I've had this issue recently as well.  One way that seems to force a resync is to first go to the list of Calendars at the bottom of the Calendar app.  Drag the list of calendars down, and the gear will start spinning at the top of the screen while the data is resynced.  This has worked for me so far.  <answer200148> Recent versions of iOS and OS X support many calendar service providers, and within them you may have different calendars for each category: Work, Personal, Family, etc.  Check on all synced devices that the same calendars are activated and visible.  On iOS, open the Calendar app, tap on Calendar, and select those you'd like to be visible.  On OS X, you can do the same on the sidebar.  Check the calendar (Work, Personal, etc.) of the event that won't sync.   Sometimes all it takes is to make the calendar viewable on all devices.  <answer249348> I have found that creating a "dummy" calendar event on my iPhone will unjam synching issues and force OS X and iOS systems to talk to each other. This is not a very elegant method, but it's effective. Simply delete the fake entry when your Mac and iPhone have shared their respective calendars.  <answer266102> This has been driving me crazy too. No matter what I tick in preferences, my iPhone calendar will not update/sync with my iMac. I don't want to use iCloud or bluetooth or whatever - I just want the iPhone to sync when I plug it into my iMac. The method (thanks KENT) outlined below is the only thing that has worked:  "I've had this issue recently as well.

But my phone is backed up to the Mac <comment238277> It must have iCloud or other type of account activated to sync calendars. Please check on System Preferences  Internet accounts on your Mac and on Settings  Mail, Contacts, Calendars on your iPhone and add to your question the information that exists on both. My guess is you are adding events to a different calendar on your Mac, probably a local one. Then again, it may be a synced calendar but you have hidden it on your iPhone. <comment240541> I checked and both were set also the pulling down of screen as below doesn't work. But as soon as I add some thing to my iPhone calendar it syncs <comment240548> They were set how? Please be very specific. <comment240837> On the Mac under system preferencesiCloud the calendar box is checked like wise on my iPhone settingsicloud calendars is on <comment240861> Is there more than one calendar on either? <comment241015> No, just the usual family, work etc <comment241019> So if I go to settingsiCloud then calendar is listed and ticked but if I then click on iCloud options, calendar is not listed as an app that store documents or data <comment241055> If you go to the Calendar app on iOS, and tap on "Calendars" on the bottom of the screen, what do you see? Also, you mention you have "just the usual: family, work, etc."; **each** one of those is a **different calendar**, and they must be checked on both devices in order to be viewable. <comment241173> There was a list of all the calendars:- All iCloud , work calender, Home etc at the top it says "show all calendars" if you click it all the clappers get ticked <comment241174> Select them all on both your computer and iPhone and try again <comment241176> Great it seems to be working now!!! Thank you very much for your help
