Do files copied to an encrypted disk image (dmg) encrypt themselves? <body> Disclaimer: I'm not sure whether or not this belongs in Ask Different or codesecurity.stackexchange.com/code, but I'm using a code.dmg/code and Disk Utility, so I'll put it here. End of disclaimer.  The title says most of it. I created an encrypted code.dmg/code in Disk Utility and I'm wondering: if I copy a file to it, is the file automatically encrypted and locked under the code.dmg/code?  <answer234233> No, not directly (in the sense that the file is protected)  the file that you add to an encrypted disk image will not be encrypted, or locked, until you unmount / eject your disk image. When your disk image is unmounted the entire disk image will re-encrypt itself and by side effect protect the file you added.   <answer234238> It depends on your viewpoint: a file written to an encrypted disk image is immediately written encrypted to the HDD/SSD where the disk image resides.  Since the file system of the strongunlocked/strong disk image is still mounted, the file appears as "unencrypted".  So a user, who can access the raw HDD/SSD only, can't read/decode the file content, but a user with the proper permissions/rights to access the whole file system (including the mounted/unlocked  disk image) still can read the file.  hr  You can test this yourself: Create an encrypted, normal writeable image.dmg as user1 in the root of your file system with 777 permissions and owner user1:staff. Now mount the image as user1 and add a file with some known content (e.g. a text file containing "stackexchange"). The file system of the encrypted disk is mounted to /Volumes with 700 permissions (only user1 can read/write).  Switch to user2 with the image file being still mounted and open/read the file image.dmg with a hex editor - though you probably see the mounted image on your desktop, you can't access it due to missing permissions. Searching for "stackexchange" will reveal strongnothing/strong.  <comment286365> AFAIK that's not really true. A file added to an encrypted disk image is immediately written encrypted to (hard) disk. Since the disk image is still unlocked it occurs as normal file though. <comment286366> I am strictly speaking about the state of the file. The file is 100% in an unencrypted state until the disk image is closed. In every case. <comment286370> My definition of encrypted matches @klanomath - The copy of the file is encrypted when you allocate storage on an encrypted filesystem. Just because the OS has the decryption keys to show it to you while mounted doesn't change the state of the bits on disk. <comment286371> When you say the "file" are you referring to the source? The new copy? What's the scenario or threat model you are worried about? <comment286372> I am not disagreeing with your position explicitly, file encryption *(not the implementation of encryption) implies file protection and while any disk image is mounted, the files are not protected in any sense. While we may be dropping a file into an encrypted container that is mapped to allocated encrypted storage there is absolutely no file  protection while the file is available in a mounted encrypted image.
