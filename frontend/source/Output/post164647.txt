Equivalent key to alt+backspace on Linux <body> In Linux and bash I use kbdalt/kbd + kbdbksp/kbd to remove the word before the cursor.  On mac the kbdoption / alt/kbd + kbddelete/kbd does not work.  e.g If you typed codeaaaa bbbb/code you will get codeaaaa/code afterwards  Any suggestion?  <answer164651> Do you mean like kbdOption/kbd + kbdShift/kbd + kbdDelete/kbd?  <answer164660> this functionality is provide by "readline", http://unixhelp.ed.ac.uk/CGI/man-cgi?readline+3. Most of keys are same as Emacs,  ol liso, you can type kbdcontrol/kbd+kbdw/kbd to delete the word just before the cursor/li lior for example,you can change the preferences of the terminal.app, use option as Meta key. kbdMeta/kbd+kbdDelete/kbd do the same thing /li /ol  <comment193067> Does not work in iTerm2 ... I typed "aaaa bbbb" and pressing that key results in "aaaa bbb" but I expected "aaaa" <comment193069> That may be a limitation of iTerm. I don't have it, so im not sure. Does it work for you in other programs? <comment193093> Cool! I didn't know ^w even when I'm using linux ;-P
