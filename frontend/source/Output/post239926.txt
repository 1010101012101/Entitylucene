Format USB for Samsung TV <body> What's the simplest way to format a USB stick and write some video files to it in order for the Samsung TV to read it? As far as I know Samsung TVs support the FAT format (or maybe ExFAT too), but if I format the USB to FAT then I can't seem to be able to write to it (or even see it in Finder).  PS: I don't have access to a Windows machine  <answer239934> Simply use Disk Utility to format it as FAT, as Macs can indeed read and write to FAT drivesâ€“they just have problems with NTFS drives.  Insert your flash drive. Open Disk Utility (/Applications/Utilities/Disk Utility), select your flash drive in the sidebar, then click "Erase" in the top bar. Select "MS-DOS (FAT)" for your format, and Master Boot Record for your scheme.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/tXLGQ.png" alt="enter image description here"  Note that the FAT file system has a limitation of 4GB file size. If you want to circumvent this whilst still being able to use OS X, format the drive as exFAT (which has a file size limitation of 128 PiB). This option has been recently hidden with 10.11, so it takes a bit more work.  Open Terminal (/Applications/Utilities/Terminal). Run the command codedefaults write com.apple.DiskUtility advanced-image-options 1/code. This gives you access to hidden features within Disk Utility. Open Disk Utility (/Applications/Utilities/Disk Utility), select your flash drive in the sidebar, then click "Erase" in the top bar. Select "ExFAT" for your format, and Master Boot Record for your scheme.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/m4mIV.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment294649> Why `if I format the USB to FAT then I can't seem to be able to write to it`? Did you mean `NTFS`? Because OS X can format, read and write into FAT32 drives. <comment294669> Didn't know about "Master Boot Record". Thanks. <comment294795> @Tetsujin That's only for FAT16. FAT32 supports up to 16TB. OS X supports both. <comment294813> @Tetsujin My bad. Noted. <comment294821> @Tetsujin Sure. Also going to add stuff about exFAT.
