How can I disable kext signing in Mac OS X 10.10 Yosemite? <body> I know the disadvantages of disabling kext signing, but I was wondering how I can actually disable this on Mac OS X 10.10 "Yosemite"?   <answer163060> To disable the kext signing security setting:  precodesudo nvram boot-args=kext-dev-mode=1 /code/pre  After changing this setting you need to restart the computer to have OS X recognize it.  It is important to note that the kext-signing setting is global, if you disable it you should be careful to only install system drivers from sources that you trust.  To reenable again use:  precodesudo nvram -d boot-args /code/pre  <comment190933> so how do you enable it back ON ? <comment194972> Careful: You may already have set other boot-args (I did, to enable old-style external monitor behavior on my Macbook). To check, use the command `nvram boot-args`. If that prints any values (e.g. "iog=0x0"), add them to the above command using a comma, like this: `sudo nvram boot-args=kext-dev-mode=1,iog=0x0`. Then, to disable the kext-dev-mode, do not use the "-d" command but rather omit that part when setting the old boot-args. <comment219021> I have a MacPro 4.1 and the "nvram boot-args=kext-dev-mode=1" command doesn't save the value persistent in the NVRAM. When I look with "nvram -p" directly after setting it, it prints out the value. After a reboot, it's gone. How can that happen, or better, how can that be repaired? <comment219034> Ok, my question is solved: the Mavericks-to-Yosemite upgrade broke the NVRAM. After a NVRAM-reset the boot-args value keeps stored. <comment319299> I've been trying to do this to avoid an issue with my VPN client, but I keep getting `nvram: Error setting variable - 'boot-args': (iokit/common) general error` as an error message.  I can't find what "general error" might mean. Any help would be appreciated.
