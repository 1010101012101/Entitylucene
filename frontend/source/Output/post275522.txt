Unable to load https websites on safari <body> I have an old iMac running OSX 10.7.5/Safari 6.1.6.  Due to some programs on that system &amp; generally slow systems on similar iMacs with more recent OSX version strongI do not want to update to a newer OSX/strong  I have several websites forcing https which I can no longer access as safari says "Safari can not open the page …, as safari can not establish a secure connection to …" (translated from german).  Chrome and Firefox on the same machine are able to open these pages, as are more recent Safaris on more recent machines.   I tried downloading/installing the root certificate in the keychain, but this did not help.  Are there some security updates I'm not getting via normal system updates which could fix this?  For example: www.biblio.lu  <answer275531> what version of safari are you using?  As mentioned on this post by stronggentmatt/strong, it can be a problem with safari's version.  Solution proposed by stronggentmatt/strong was to delete this file:  precode~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.security.plist /code/pre  <answer276382> Safari 6/OS X doesn't support TLSv1.2. Sites only supporting the TLSv1.2 protocol like biblio.lu won't work in Safari 6.  You can cross-check/compare your browser's result at SSL Client Test with the SSL Server Test (e.g. SSL Server Test testing biblio.lu).  No supported protocols overlap between Safari 6.1.6/Mac OS X 10.7.5:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0WDQo.png" alt="enter image description here"  and biblio.lu  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4nxcq.png" alt="enter image description here"  so no https access! Google Chrome 49.0.2623.112 (64-bit) - the last Google Chrome version supporting 10.6/10.7/10.8 works though.  <comment346893> OSX 10.7.5/Safari 6.1.6  None of the solutions proposed in that post helped <comment346928> @Pit, i've found some information and a possible solution here [Solution](http://osxdaily.com/2014/03/26/fix-safari-cant-verify-website-error/). <comment347651> Please add an example https site!
