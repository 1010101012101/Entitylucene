How? Thank you.  <answer258087> Unfortunately, Target Display Mode doesn't work on MacBook Pros. However, this thread here describes various ways to use the MacBook Pro as a screen. In a nutshell, it says to use a third party app such as Air Display or Screen Recycler (both of which, it appears, operate over a network. The thread suggests connecting the two computers with a thunderbolt cable and thunderbolt network to speed up the connection. For more details, see the link above.  <comment322528> Although honestly those are pretty difficult solutions. I would suggest selling the old MBP and buying an external screen. It'll be cheaper and easier. <comment322549> I agree with Noah's comment. If you don't have a need for the older MacBook, sell it and use some of the money for an external display. If you do still need it otherwise, just buy a cheap external display. Either way, that's a much better solution.
