Handoff feature devices requirement <body> Why are supported devices for Handoff feature so strict to a small set of devices?  http://support.apple.com/en-us/HT6555  <answer171168> Handoff requires three things:  ul lispecific bluetooth hardware - this eliminates most of the older devices/li lispecific wireless hardware - this has to do with MIMO antennas and a sophisticated wireless chip. This doesn't eliminate many devices as bluetooth capabilities were upgraded at the same time as wifi as far as I can tell./li lia fast enough CPU/li /ul  Thus the list of devices that support handoff is related directly to new hardware capabilities.
