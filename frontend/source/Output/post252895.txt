Can only print PDFs <body> I have Mac OS X El Capitan 10.11.6, iMac 27 inch late 2013.  I can print any PDF but nothing else. In the print dialog box where I can normally see what I am about to print, it is blank. If I do print I get a blank sheet. If I save to PDF, you get a blank PDF except for a tiny box in the middle.  I have removed and reinstalled the print drivers. I have tried the kbdCommand/kbd+kbdOption/kbd+kbdP/kbd+kbdR/kbd keypresses at startup.   <answer252897> Try resettings CUPS (Common Unix Printing System). To do this right click on the printer in System Preferences and select Reset Printing System. You will need to re-install the printer afterwards but this can fix weird printing issues like the one you describe.  <comment314781> Can you please add a screenshot of the print dialog? Also, does it happen in all applications or only in one? <comment314914> YES, that worked. Thank you so much.  I'm really glad to know about resetting CUPS. <comment314915> I would add a screenshot but that suggestion to reset CUPS worked.   THANK YOU.
