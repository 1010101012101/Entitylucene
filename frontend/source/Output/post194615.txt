What's a normal value for kernel_task RAM usage? <body> Just bought a new MacBook Pro 12.1, early 2015 (Yosemite 10.10.4). I'm observing memory usage from codekernel_task/code varying between 0.8-2.0 GB. Is it normal? Couldn't find a question referring to normal values.  Thanks  <comment232182> Check out what is that `kernel_task` do to get an idea of how much RAM it may need: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/37366/what-exactly-does-kernel-task-do <comment232184> @JaimeSantaCruz, nice link, thank you. Still wondering what people with similar systems are experiencing.
