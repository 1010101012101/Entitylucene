Limit hard drive i/o usage by one process (Dropbox) <body> I'm using only 5% of 1TB given by Dropbox and it regularly chokes my Mac Mini's HDD by "Downloading file list" too often.  I think it's just a poor performance (it started since the last Dropbox version) but Dropbox support does not understand the problem. So I would like to limit reading and writing by the process.  Is it possible?

"Downloading file list" is the standard Dropbox procedure to index files. Please see the I/O stat - I called 93% I/O "choking".
