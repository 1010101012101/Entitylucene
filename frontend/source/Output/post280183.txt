Problems accessing Windows using Vmware fusion after trying to repartition it <body> My husband has VMware Fusion installed on his Macbook Pro. He initially allocated a lot of space to the Windows partition, thinking he would use it. He hasn't needed it, but is out of space on the Mac side, and wanted to change this. I tried to repartition it using what I found in this article How to repartition physical disk space in VMware Fusion  http://masonsklut.com/how-to-repartition-physical-disk-space-in-vmware-fusion/  I followed the steps pretty much exactly, but I did use the download file from above which was gparted live 0.4 which he says is not the right one even though that's the one that is linked, and also this is with Windows 8 x64 not XP. Also I was using this to SHRINK the size of the Windows partition down from around 150Gb to 110Gb. I suspect maybe I chose an arbitrary number that was too small and it damaged some files. Because now when I try to start VMware, it says  PC needs to be repaired, require file is missing or contains errors. Error code 0xc000225, \windows\system32\winload.exe I get the blue screen of death!  What can I do?  <comment352388> I must not understand how VMware fusion works. Couldn't you just repartition using Disk Utility on the Mac? <comment356049> No :(  It doesn't work that way.
