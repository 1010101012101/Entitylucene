Air dropped .avi to iphone lost <body> I just air dropped .avi to my iPhone which had no compatible app to open it, now my iPhone did receive the file but since there was no app to play it nothing happened after receiving it.  Where did that file go ? Is it deleted or stored somewhere ? I dont want it to eat up my memory.
