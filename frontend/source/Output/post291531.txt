How can I stop Safari's address bar from stealing focus after searching? <body> To elaborate:  I am using macOS 10.12.5.  If I want to search the web for some dank memes, I open Safari and hit kbdCmd/kbd + kbdL/kbd to focus the bar, then I type codedank memes/code and hit kbdEnter/kbd.  Then, I see in the Google results page that the 3rd hit is the dankest meme ever and I want to click it.  But alas!  It doesn't respond, because friggin' Safari displays a dropdown from the address bar that steals the focus.  I am forced to click a second time, which as you all surely know is literally the worst possible thing ever.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vQWLp.png" alt="irritating safari behaviour"  Notice that the results page has already loaded, but Safari decides I might want to search again for dank memes.  How can I stop this behaviour?
