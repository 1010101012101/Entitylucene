How to see what files were changed in TimeMachine? <body> I tried TimeTracker, tms and timedog but none of them works with OS X 10.6  Any suggestions?  <answer15718> Since Time Machine uses hardlinks to store unmodified files (and directories), this would mean that changed files in the latest backup will have a link count of 1 since they are unique. Use this together with find to generate a listing:   precodefind /path/to/your/latest/backup -type f -links 1 -print  /code/pre  <answer15732> Lion has come out with the codetmutil/code command and the man page shows that it will crawl a specific backup and report very detailed information on your specific backups. The verbs strongcompare/strong, stronguniquesize/strong, and strongcalculatedrift/strong look most useful if you don't mind the terminal.  I still use BackupLoupe on Lion (as well as on older OS) and have high praise and thanks to the team that built it every time I need to use it. I should probably send them more money, too. It's that good.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0MXLE.png" alt="enter image description here"  It makes it very easy to see what files are taking the most space between backups and also is indispensable for knowing when a specific file has been changed by tracking each time it is saved as a new version going back in time. It works on a local database so you are not crawling the filesystem each and every query - just once each time to collect the deltas for each backup. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/SXf4a.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer17462> The problem with that find command seems to be that HFS allows hard links on directories as well as regular files.  As a result, files that have not been backed up for a while will show up with one link but one of their parent directories may have many links.  <comment17098> This doesn't work. It just displays all files. <comment17114> Actually - this does work for me. I tested several folders with more than 2000 photos, and each time it picked out the 20 or 200 ( or zero) files that were new that backup. I still like http://www.soma-zone.com/BackupLoupe/ but this seems to answer the question as to what's new in a backup with a clever and speedy find command. <comment17148> +1 For this great piece of software! <comment108895> BackupLoupe - great tip.  Solved my problem, too many caches and extra app specific backups inside ~/Libary/Application Support.
