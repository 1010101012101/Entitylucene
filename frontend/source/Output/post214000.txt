Option + E not working <body> Recently my macbook stop displaying the ´ when I hit Option + e. I can't even press the ´ in the keyboard viewer.  The others accents are working without any problems.   Anyone have any ideas to solve this? Is possible to reset all shortcuts on mac?  <comment282479> `Option+E` is controlled by your keyboard layout, it is not a shortcut. It is  possible that some application you have recently installed is using this combination. Did you install any software recently? One check you can do is to go the Settings - Keyboard - Input Sources and check the "show input menu in the menu bar" checkbox and in Settings - Keyboard - Keyboard check the "Show Keyboard, Emoji & Symbol Viewer" option. Then in the menubar click on the keyboard layout icon and select Show Keyboard Viewer. Now if you press option it should highlight all special characters you can type. <comment282516> Double check that this has not somehow gotten selected as the trigger for something in system preferences/dictation & speech
