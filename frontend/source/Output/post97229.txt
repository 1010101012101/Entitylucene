Switch iPhone 4S's provider <body> I have a iPhone 4S and I dropped it in water and can't talk on it now. So my buddy gave me his old iPhone 4S. But the catch is that he has a passed due balance with "Telus". And I need the phone to run on the "Bell" network. How do I do that? I've heard it's possible. I've already jailbroke it.   How can I switch providers?  <answer98525> Just exchange the sim card with a "Bell network" sim card,  or go to settings-carrier-automatic-off-and select Bell
