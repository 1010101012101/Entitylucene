Select outgoing mail folder in Mail.app <body> On my iPhone, I can go to strongSettings  Mail  emAny Account/em  Account  Advanced  Sent Mailbox/strong and select which folder I'd prefer to have my Sent mail stored in. How can I do this in Mail on a Mac? I am trying to change which folder the sent messages are stored in when saving them to the server.  <answer48328> In strongMail/strong select the mailbox you want to use from the list on the left and navigate to the menu emMailbox  Use this Mailbox For/em, then choose the appropriate purpose from the menu:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KuBsv.png" alt="image of Use this Folder For menu"  <answer231369> I've faced this issue in the past.  You want to be sure to be using a single folder for Sent Mail across all devices and email clients. If you use webmail at all, there is a standard arrangement for inboxes and sent items. Christian explains the issue well:     I use Mail to connect to a traditional IMAP server (non-Gmail). I've noticed that all the messages I send are placed in Mail's "Sent" folder and that Mail is translating this folder to a server folder called "Sent Messages". The problem is that on the IMAP server, the real folder meant to store sent messages is called "Sent Mail".      I occasionally send messages using the server's web interface. Because of this, over time I will have my sent messages spread out over "Sent Messages" and "Sent Mail" in the server. If I want to find a sent message, and because these messages are not consolidated, I now have two places I need to search thru.   I would recommend you map Apple Mail's Sent to "Sent Mail" as used by your IMAP webmail client and do the same with your iPhone.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QK2vQ.png" alt="Apple-Mail-mailbox-assignment-for-IMAP"  The same system applies to Drafts, Trash and Junk. Bonus tip: don't use IMAP for drafts as they drafts will multiply across all your computers, becoming unmanageable (up to 25 copies). Instead use a local folder on each of your computers. It's possible that the drafts multiplying like rabbits bug was fixed some time after Apple Mail 4.6 (OS X 10.6.8) but I have no confirmation of a fix.  <comment55378> Wow, that's weird
