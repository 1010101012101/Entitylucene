Preview scrolling speeds? <body> When using Preview (on OS X 10.8 &amp; 10.9) I noticed that the scrolling speed is too fast.  I often read long documents and want to see in advance what are the chapters coming a few pages later. When I scroll forward as slowly as possible I always get much too far and I can't go back to the point I was coming from. I am lost within my document and have to get to the table of contents to recover my reading.  I discovered that kbd⌥/kbd+kbdscroll/kbd permits to achieve a much quieter scroll speed where it is easy to go back to a point left a few seconds ago.  hr Is there a method to make the scrolling speed obtained through the use of the kbd⌥/kbd key the default scrolling speed within Preview?  Is this is a bug?  Is this an error of tuning within one of the System Preferences?
