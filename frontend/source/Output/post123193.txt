Turn off login notification email for Facebook chat on a Mac <body> I have setup Facebook chat in emMessages/em on my Mac. The problem is that every time emMessages/em logs in to chat, I receive an email saying:     It looks like someone logged into "Facebook Chat" on Sunday, March 2,   2014 at 11:07am. If this was you, please disregard this email. If this   wasn't you, please secure your account, as someone else may be   accessing it.   I understand that this is essentially a Facebook security mechanism to warn users about unauthorised access to their account. My question is: Is there a way to mark emMessages/em as an 'authorised application' so that I don't get this notification email every time?  <answer123197> Go to your Facebook  Settings-Security and disable the notifications there  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WgSM9.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment143853> are you logging in from different locations (IP) <comment144013> No. It's always from the same computer... same place. <comment144014> This will turn off all login notifications. I still want notifications for any fraudulent login. I just don't want it for Facebook chat.
