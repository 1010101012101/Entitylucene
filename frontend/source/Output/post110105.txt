Sync iOS iBooks to OS X iBooks <body> Is there a way to sync the iBooks strongthat were not purchased from iTunes/strong on my iOS device with my OS X iBooks? Specifically, I have some PDFS I'd like to sync.  Please note I am seeking to synchronize the books themselves, not just highlights and notes.  <answer110530> I have a similar problem. Non-iBook store epubs don't sync with iOS devices, no matter what options are switched on/off.  Looking at the directory they're now stored on in Mavericks (~/Library/Containers/com.apple.BKAgentService/Data/Documents/iBooks/Books), they seem to have been converted to a different format (from .epub to a folder with xml/html files), and i suspect that's why they don't sync.  Any suggestions on how to sync these would be most appreciated!  emstrongEDIT/em/strong: To answer my own question, check that iTunes is actually syncing emall books/em. It had changed my previous preference to emselected books/em, and preferentially un-ticked all non-iBook store epubs. Changing that fixed the syncing problem for me...  <answer111283> You absolutely can sync notes and highlights for ePubs not purchased from iTunes when using iBooks on your Mac and iOS devices.  Here is how:  ol liPlace your not-purchased ePubs in iBooks on your Mac./li liConnect your iOS device to your Mac./li liOpen iTunes./li liSelect your iOS device in the left column./li liClick Books./li liChoose All Books or Selected Books./li liClick Apply to copy the books to your iOS device./li liRepeat steps 2 to 7 for other iOS devices./li liEnable notes and highlights syncing for iBooks on your Mac and each iOS device./li liMake notes and highlights in any of the ePubs you have copied from iBooks on your Mac to your iOS devices. These notes and highlights sync to all other devices./li /ol  It is very important to use the same version of the book on you Mac and all of your iOS devices. You cannot download an ePub from Gutenberg to your Mac and then download it again to your iOS device and expect notes and highlights to sync. That probably won't happen. If you think it through, this makes sense because iBooks needs to know for sure which files to use for syncing and file name alone is too imprecise.  <answer155192> On OS X copying files from the container below will copy the books from your library.  precode~/Library/Containers/com.apple.BKAgentService/Data/Documents/iBooks/Books /code/pre  To copy the Highlights and Notes you did, you need to copy the files from  precode~/Library/Containers/com.apple.iBooksX/Data/Documents/AEAnnotation /code/pre  <answer269051> I found a simple way to transfer PDFs from iBooks to strongemany/em/strong  computer, or app you have on your iDevice... However, you must be jailbroken for this to work.  Here's how:  In Cydia, download and install a file manager like "Filza" (it's in the BigBoss repo)   ul liNote: your iDevice might respring once installed/li /ul  hr  Solution A) strongemTo your computer:/em/strong   ol liOpen Filza/li liClick settings icon in the right top corner and enable WebDAV server. /li liOpen a browser on your computer and navigate to the address given by Filza/li liYou will find a file manager / ftp like solution.

Long answer and my experience:  strongProblem 1: my own eBooks/PDFs were not visible in iTunes/strong  Reason: on the Mac - System preferences - iCloud - iCloud Drive there is a checkmark for iBooks.app.  When this checkmark is checked, strongiTunes is no longer responsible to synchronise/strong own eBooks/PDFs.   strongProblem 2: I didn't get my own eBooks/PDFs in my iPad/iPhone/strong  Reason: I did not have the iCloud Drive App from Apple on my iPad.  After downloading the iCloud Drive App, there are a few new options in the iOS preferences:  Preferences - iCloud -  ul liiCloud Drive/li liiBooks/li liand many more/li /ul  This strongiBooks option is not available/strong, when the iCloud Drive App is not installed and turned on.  After turning on the iClod Drive option and (after a few seconds) the iBooks option and then starting iBooks, iBooks will ask if you want to use iCloud.  After saying yes, all the own eBooks and PDFs are available for download one by one and controlled from th iOS device.  <comment130178> Do you mean sync as in sync the files or sync the bookmarks and notes? <comment130222> Yep, I've noticed this with my non-store epubs as well. It's a shame, isn't it? Really, it's all that's lacking to eliminate the desire for the Kindle app, etc. for me. <comment130223> @ThomasW Both, but primarily the books/files themselves. <comment130292> At this point I don't know of a way to sync the book files. Apple doesn't support it. This could be a good "third-party opportunity". <comment131079> As I've clarified before, I am looking to sync the books themselves. <comment131159> With the recent changes to iTunes and iBooks, I'm not sure if this is any longer correct. iBooks has been split from iTunes, and the sync processes (computer to computer, computer to device, and computer to cloud), are not yet working. I imagine this will change soon. However, as of now, you have to physically copy the books to the various devices, and manually add them to iBooks. <comment131163> I believe you can simply drag the books into the iBooks window.(I did a search on ePub) and grabbed the books I wanted. Not too elegant but it worked. <comment131860> with the newest version of iBooks, everything is now syncing over the air - i just open any ePub (with iBook as default application) and it's imported to _~/Library/Containers/com.apple.BKAgentService/Data/Documents/iBooks/Books_. It then just syncs... My problem (and the reason it didn't work for me initially) was that iTunes had changed it's syncing preferences from all to only ticked items, with older, non-iBookStore ePubs unticked... <comment353805> Nice rundown. Just as an FYI, the option to sync via iCloud didn't exist when I asked this original question.
