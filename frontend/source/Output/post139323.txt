Pixelmator's Pixel Tool Not Available <body> This is probably a really stupid question, but I can't seem to find an answer anywhere. I want to use the pixel tool in Pixelmator, but I can't find it. Below is a picture of my toolbar. Is there something I'm missing?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/TGTqR.png" alt="My Pixelmator Toolbar"  <answer139328> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/17hy8.jpg" alt="Pixel Tool in Pixelmator"  You need to manually add the strongPixel Tool/strong to the Tools palette first.     You can add it there manually by choosing strongPixelmator  Preferences  Tools  Painting/strong. Then simply drag it onto the Tools palette to place it there.

How is the Red Eye tool default and not the Pencil tool? <comment295239> I created an account just to upvote this. I feel stupid now. Thanks!
