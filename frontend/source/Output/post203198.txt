How can I have iCal email me reminders <body> I have heard of people getting email reminders from iCal, but I can't figure out how to do it. So the obvious question is:  How do I have iCal email me reminders?  As I see now that was removed. In that case is there a widget to let me email reminders to myself?  <answer203207> The email reminder function was removed some time before iCal was renamed to Calendar. Presumably it was a security risk, but I can't find a good link explaining the exploits that used that pathway to harm people.  <answer204390> It seems what you are now looking for is an emAlert/em.  From Yosemite strongCalendar/strong help:     h1Set event alerts and receive notifications/h1      Be notified of an upcoming Calendar event by setting one or more   alerts for it. An alert can place a notification on your screen, send   an email, or open a file.      h3Set an alert for an event/h3      ul   liDouble-click an event, then click the eventâ€™s date./li   liClick next to Alert and do either of the following:      ul   liChoose a time or day from the pop-up menu./li   liChoose Custom and then choose one of the following options:/li   liMessage: Displays a notification on the screen./li   liMessage with sound: Displays a notification on the screen and makes a sound./li   listrongemEmail: Sends you an email./em/strong/li   /ul/li   /ul   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5Utwwm.png" alt="Select Custom"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4AfiBm.png" alt="Choose Email"
