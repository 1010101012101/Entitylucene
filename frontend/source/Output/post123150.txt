I updated to 10.9.2 and now SSL is broken. How do I fix this? <body> As per the title, I upgraded my Mac to Mavericks 10.9.2, and now a bunch of websites which use SSL (aka https) don't work!  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0bFt9.png" alt="enter image description here"  What do I do?  <answer123151> Open Keychain Access and delete the DigiCert certificates, but strongonly the ones in the codelogin/code keychain/strong - not the ones in codeSystem/code or codeSystem Roots/code.  Afterward, you may need to restart your browser and/or network service (switch Airport off and on again, or disable and re-enable Ethernet. If you want to be sure, just restart your computer.  If you're a dummy (like I was) and deleted emall/em the DigiCert entries, you can restore them by manually downloading and installing the 10.9.2 update from Apple.  <comment143984> I can confirm that this worked for me. <comment205846> You can try this solution too: http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/174749/116419.
