How do I stop DVD player from autoplaying? <body> When I insert a movie DVD into my USB superdrive, the DVD player starts.  I want it to stop doing that.  I've tried the following to disable this behaviour:  ul liSystem Preferences - CDs &amp; DVDs - When you insert a video DVD: set to Ignore (actually moved all of them to Ignore)/li liDVD player - Preferences - unchecked "Start playing disc" for when DVD player opens and when a disc is inserted./li /ul  Neither of these made a difference; insert the disc and the DVD player still starts playing it. Any other options?  <answer294495> You might have more success using RCDefaultApp (freeware, old but still functional) if only because it shows a few more choices of precisely what to ignore.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/W3kv5.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment372715> That was really helpful! Seemed to make the difference. Thank you.
