Where is the Skype for Business for Mac Log Location? <body> Microsoft has released the new Skype for Business for Mac product on October 26, 2016, as a replacement for the old Lync for Mac IM client.  On the "General" preferences page, the product contains a "Collect Logs" button. When I click that, nothing happens.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/l0nmL.png" alt="General Preferences"  I'd like to know where the product stores its log files when a user clicks on this button. On previous Lync versions, the log files were stored under code~/Library/Logs/code, but I did not see any Skype for Business log files there after clicking this button.  Where can I find the log files for this new client?  <answer259524> Based on this blog entry, the log location is:  precode~/Library/Containers/com.microsoft.SkypeForBusiness/Data/Library/Logs/com.microsoft.SkypeForBusiness /code/pre  This directory contains a file called codesfbmac.log/code, which has the log information from the Skype for Business for Mac client.
