[pc screenshot img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/a2hoy.png" alt="][1]"  <answer244045> Go into the iCloud Photo Library submenu (from screenshot above) and select "Disable and Delete" to turn off iCloud Photo Library. Delete everything in your Photos app - don't forget to check shared photos and all albums. Then re-enable iCloud Photo Library.  iMessages also takes up space - clear out/delete old messages (the attachment images may be counted toward your photo allotment). May help, may not, but worth a shot.  <comment300389> It may be possible that these pictures are still in your 'Recently Deleted' album on your iPhone. Is there? <comment309315> Does this thread help explain what you might want to do? http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/217065/my-storage-was-not-updated
