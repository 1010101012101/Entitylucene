iPad 4: slideshow software (digital photo frame) <body> I'd like to use my iPad 4 (fully updated) as digital photo frame. Ideal software should allow: - using local NAS as source for files (SMB/NFS/AFS); other option is Google Photos (not instagram, facebook etc.) (mandatory) - automatically add new photos (nice to have) - adjusting slideshow parameters (duration, effects, etc.) (mandatory) - optional nice-to-have: scheduling slideshow for specific time of day (doesn't make sense to work during the night)  I can't seem to find such software, anyone knows something that fits this bill?
