I want to change to hot key(s) for spaces <body> Currently I can switch between spaces using kbdControl/kbd + kbdarrow/kbd. I want to change that to kbdCommand/kbd + kbdarrow/kbd. How would I go about doing that?  <answer13000> In System Preferences, open Expos√© and Spaces, and go to the Spaces tab. Click the menu by "To switch between spaces:" and choose the second option.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xOQxD.png" alt="Image showing location of menu"  <answer13001> go to codeSystem Preferences -&gt; expose &amp; Spaces/code  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/i56qb.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Then select desire keyboard shortcut from "To Switch  between spaces"  <comment13670> oh duh, thank you for stating out the obvious i apparently over looked :P
