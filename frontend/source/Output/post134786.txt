iSight Camera in iPhone 5 , 5s, 5c: Is the image resolution 3264 x 2448 or 3284 x 2448? <body> Apple said iPhone 5, 5s, 5c has 8MP iSight camera.  A website says  pre iSight of 5c & 5s: 3264 x 2448 Pixels  (7.99 MP) http://www.devicespecifications.com/en/comparison/157b258a http://www.devicespecifications.com/en/model/70af28ac  iSight of iPhone 5: 3284 x 2448 Pixels (8.4 MP) http://www.devicespecifications.com/en/comparison/aba74df9 /pre  Don't the iSight of 5, 5c, 5s have the same resolution? Something seems inaccurate here. So what is the exact number?  <answer134794> The iPhone 5 spec given is definitely wrong (2) and the 3 have the same resolution :  3284 * 2448 = 8.4 Mpx.   <comment159638> Just a typo correction required in the answer. The resolution is 3264 x 2448 (not 3284). Source: http://www.anandtech.com/show/7329/some-thoughts-about-the-iphone-5s-camera-improvements <comment159646> so there is no such 3284 x 2448 Pixels existed? <comment159649> Yep. There is no such that.
