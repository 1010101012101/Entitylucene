MacBook Pro won't connect to some web pages <body> Been having this problem for a few months now. A few websites will not load at all on my old MacBook Pro 10.7.5. They hang for ages with "connecting" then I get the usual Google Chrome cannot open webpage. This happens on Safari and Opera as well. I've tried 3 other Wi-Fi connections and same problem.  My iPhone loads it fine as does my brother's tablet, and 2 other Windows laptops, so the problem must be to do with my MacBook. I've tried searching for a virus/trojan, clearing the cache, checking proxies, pretty much everything, and it still doesn't work.  The one main website I notice the problem with is chainreactioncycles.com and it's been ever since they updated their website. It's also happened on a few others but I don't remember which.  <comment125764> Is your MacBook on a VPN connection or something like that? Check the settings in System Prefs, Network. Are the settings in general different from those on your iPhone?
