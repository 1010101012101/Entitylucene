How to fix not working ⌘ ⎋ shortcut in Lion 10.7 <body> I have a new MacBook Pro 15" early 2011 and use Lion.  ol liFor "Launchpad" I can't use the Shortcut F1./li liFor "Move focus to menu bar" I can't use the Shortcut kbdCmd/kbd+kbdEsc/kbd (kbd⌘/kbd+kbd⎋/kbd)./li /ol  Simply said, there are functions, which are not working with one specific Shortcut. I can assign it, but it does not work.  The Shortcuts works for all the other functions and the one function works with all the other Shortcuts.  Sometimes when I wildly clicked around and restarted, the shortcut kbdCmd/kbd+kbdEsc/kbd (kbd⌘/kbd+kbd⎋/kbd) worked with "Move focus to menu bar" one time.  What could I do to fix the bug?  <answer23912> Go to System Preferences - Keyboard - Keyboard Shortcuts - and assign and enable the shortcuts you want.  <answer25858> I've realized that the ctrl-Fn shortcuts only work if I tick the option to use the function keys as "normal function keys". This option is in Systems Preferences  Keyboard  Keyboard.  I believe it is unticked by default (ie the Fn keys work as shortcuts for brightness, sound level, and music playing). Once ticked, Ctrl-F2 works like a charm. Alternatively, you can leave this option unchecked and instead hit CTRL+fn+F2 and the intended function will work fine.  <answer58674> With mountain lion the bug seems to be fixed. Now I have no problem assigning the hotkeys as desired.  <comment21950> I can replicate this bug with my iMac mid-2010. It works when set to ctrl+esc (or any other shortcut), but not cmd+esc. I can use cmd+esc for any other function, but not for this one. <comment23226> There are some bugs where the menu bar doesn't get shortcuts when an app is in full screen. Are your troubles happening when the display isn't in full screen mode? <comment23319> The problem occurs in full screen as well as in normal window mode. The weird thing is: The Shortcut cmd+esc (⌘+⎋) works for the menu bar, IF I activated the menu bar with the Shortcut for MOVE FOCUS TO STATUS MENUS (also here the same in full screen or window mode) right before and a menu icon on the right side of the menu bar is highlighted <comment26714> I've also encountered problems with assigning ⌘+⎋ as a shortcut or as a hotkey within an application in Lion. <comment26715> Your answer works for many shortcuts, but there's something strange about ⌘+⎋ in Lion. <comment26973> Yes. ⌘+⎋ doesn't work with all functions correctly. <comment67528> Yes but F1 is F1 not the "lesser brightness" key. So I used F1, when the same key reduces your brightness then you have to hold down the fn key. The problem didn't go away ;(
