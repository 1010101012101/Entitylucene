dock folders - how to view list/grid/fan on hover & open in finder with 1-click <body> I feel that its slowing my productivity, to have to click on the dock folders to see the list of contents.  Are there any apps or tweaks that will enable me to view the contents automatically when hovering the mouse over the folder.  I would also like to be able to 'open in finder' in 1-click, instead of the 2-step's of clicking on the folder, then selecting 'open in finder'  <answer243694> I don't know of any way to view the contents of a folder when hovering the mouse over it.  To open a folder without having to click then click "Open in Finder", you can Option-Command click on the folder and it will open the folder in Finder. (Another tidbit: Command click on the folder and it will open its enclosing folder in Finder)
