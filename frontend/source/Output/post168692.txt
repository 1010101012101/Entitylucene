Launch console application in iTerm on boot <body> How can I launch some command (console application) in iTerm2 on system boot? There should be only one instance of this application.   <answer168695> Create a script which will run Your app. Something like:  precode#!/bin/bash /path/to/executable /code/pre  Save it, change this to be executable with codechmod +x/code in strongTerminal/strong or strongiTerm2/strong app. Right click on this file and choose strongGet Info/strong, select the prefered app which will open it (in Your case strongiTerm2/strong app). Open Preferences.app, go to strongUsers and Groups/strong - strongLogin/strong and add Your script there. With this once You login Your script will be opened in strongiTerm2/strong app.
