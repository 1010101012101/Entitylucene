Remote login with graphic "ssh"/rdp <body> I would like to permit a login to my MacBook Pro using a Linux PC via Remote Desktop like rdp. I need to use my Mac while a linux user can execute his session on my machine and the session are in parallels both with GUI.  Is this possible?  <answer287829> Yes (probably). macOS supports two simultaneous user graphical sessions. One the local session and a second remote. You get unlimited ssh / xwindows environments.   I would start with two users and your vnc of choice for remote access. The only problem is if your vnc doesnâ€™t work like Apple screen sharing and offer the second user a choice if asking to share the session or create their own.   ul liAre the changes to Lion&#39;s screen sharing documented anywhere publicly?/li liIs there a Windows remote desktop client compatible with Lion&#39;s virtual display feature?/li /ul
