VPN and Wifi start with same 192.168.1.x <body> On my Macbook Pro I have recently added a VPN connection to the server at work. Now, my Wifi network at home uses the following IP block: 192.168.1.x as does the VPN from work.  So when my MBP tries to access 192.168.1.52, it keeps looking on the Wifi network where it will obviously not find the server it's looking for.  How can I get the MBP to look for this specific IP address on the VPN and not the Wifi network?  Thanks in advance.  <comment100631> I managed to find the answer here: http://superuser.com/a/206826/26038  It works great.
