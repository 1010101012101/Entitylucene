How to manage newer Ruby installations in macOS without intervening with the default Ruby installations? <body> macOS comes with some default ruby installations, more here, that I do not want to overwrite by running gems commands as sudo. I tried rbenv, instructed here, but I am getting a permission error in the last command codegem update --system/code such that  precodebrew update brew install ruby echo 'export PATH=/usr/local/Cellar/ruby/2.4.1_1/bin:$PATH' &gt;&gt; ~/.bash_profile #bash brew install rbenv ruby-build echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.rbenv/bin:$PATH"' &gt;&gt; ~/.bash_profile  # bash echo 'eval "$(rbenv init -)"' &gt;&gt; ~/.bash_profile               # bash rbenv install 2.4.1 rbenv local 2.4.1 rbenv global 2.4.1 rbenv rehash gem update --system Updating rubygems-update  ERROR: While executing gem ...

Try to run the commands from coderbenv/code onwards in a newly spawned shell.  <comment363771> The command you mentioned isn't included in the answer you refer to. Can you add the whole sequence of commands you've used? <comment363775> Try to run the commands from `rbenv` onwards in a newly started shell so that the PATH gets set correctly. <comment363778> @patrix I got the command run, by testing the last command in a new shell, but unable to install packages with gem, shown [here](https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/288110/25260), this may be a small pkg-related problem or bigger problem, dunno yet. <comment363822> Thank you for the answer, moved the question about LoadError [here](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/288148/loaderror-in-installing-packages-such-as-oauth-with-ruby-gems-why).
