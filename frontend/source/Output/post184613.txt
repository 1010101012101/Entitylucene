Watch folder for Photos <body> When I'm on my iPhone, pictures downloaded from the Internet are automatically uploaded to my iCloud Photo Library.    I want the same thing to happen for pictures downloaded from the Internet when I'm on my Mac. Let's say I want to upload to the Icloud Photo Library every new image in the folder Downloads.  Is there a way to do it seamlessly ?  <answer184622> ol liAdd Photos actions to Automator using https://photosautomation.com/ /li liConstruct the following Folder Action in Automator img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mLGrm.jpg" alt="enter image description here"/li /ol  I'm still not 100% satisfied, since folder actions are not super robust so I welcome other answers!  <comment218912> Both of those should be relatively easy to account for in AppleScript. Bring a window to the front: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/117421/ Checking a box would require a bit more work, but you would need to know how exactly the window presents itself. <comment218920> Thanks. Your comment put me on the right track.
