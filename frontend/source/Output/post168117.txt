Application switcher not cycling anymore on hold <body> 10.9.5 here  Suddenly my Application Switcher won't cycle anymore on hold. It still can cycle between apps one by one, but if I hold command tab it will stop after reaching the right end of the row. Before that it used to keep cycling until I release command tab.  It's not so much that the loss of this minor feature is annoying, it is emwhy/em it happened in the first place. As far as I know I didn't install any new app nor change anything. I found out that the same is true for any session not just mine. I also tried safe boot to no avail.  Thanks for any hint.  <answer168120> It looks this is a duplicate of this question.  I have the same situation - no cycling beyond endpoints (cycling backwards you can do via Ctrl + Shift + Tab).  <comment197351> Sorry my mistake, although I searched it's clearly a dupe. No answer anyway unfortunately.
