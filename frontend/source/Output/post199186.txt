How much space does Apple music offline songs take up? <body> I have a Macbook Pro with 120 GB storage. As i have limited space i was wondering where the offline songs on Apple music are stored? How much space do they take?  <answer199188> Apple Music offline songs are stored in this directory:  precode/Users/[your-user]/Music/iTunes/iTunes Media/Apple Music /code/pre  A normal Song with a duration between 3:45 min and 5:02 min is about 7MB to 11MB large. rule of thumb is to calculate 10MB per Song and you are on the safe side.   For Example a Maroon 5 song:  precode12 This Summer.m4p (8,5 MB on disk) /Users/bMalum/Music/iTunes/iTunes Media/Apple Music/Maroon 5/V (Deluxe) Duration: 03:44 /code/pre  <comment238636> Thank you..This solves my query!
