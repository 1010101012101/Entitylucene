Exit the recovery mode via:     ol   liHold down the home and power button for about 15 seconds, this shuts   off the iPhone/li   liPress the power button to boot the iPhone/li   /ol   Now it should be rebooting. Connect it again with you Mac/PC and fire up iTunes. Everything should work as it meant to be.  <answer89355> The problem seems to be corruption(I am not sure what else to call it) of file named iTunesCDB in iTunes_Control/iTunes directory in iphone's file system, I used iFunBox to do the delete that file, after that everything seems to sync well with no issues,  courtesy this link  <comment104242> Have you rebooted both your may and your iPhone already? <comment104285> that didn't help, but following link did http://nethead.blogspot.in/2012/12/how-to-fix-itunes-cannot-read-contents.html <comment104822> @VaibhavMishra, so your problem has been fixed?
