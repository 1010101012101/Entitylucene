Youtube audio has echo in Safari on macOS <body> When watching YouTube videos I get a constant audio problems. The audio always sounds far off and it has a bit of echo to it. The problem is safari specific as the same videos work fine in another browser. Anybody know what is causing this and how to fix it?  strongEDIT:/strong The problem appears to occur only when the videos are played at anything other than 1.0x speed.  I'm using safari 10.1.1
