Transfer Health App Data to Computer <body> Is there a way to transfer the step data (ideally, total steps per day) from my iPhone to my computer?   Thanks!  <answer259931> Take a look at this link, for Excel and R: http://www.ryanpraski.com/apple-health-data-how-to-export-analyze-visualize-guide/  <answer259938> In iOS 10 in the Health app   Hit the profile (head icon) in the top right corner.  At the bottom of your profile is Export Health Data. Touching that brings up a dialog and eventually the normal sharing choice e.g. Message, Mail etc  <comment204544> There must be an app for that :) <comment325299> Welcome to Ask Different!
