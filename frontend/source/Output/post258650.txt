How to uninstall SaltyBeer Skype call recorder? <body> I wanted to test SaltyBeer Skype Call recorder. So I downloaded codesaltybeer-mac-installer.pkg/code and installed it on my OS X 10.11.6. Now when I open Skype, it opens SaltyBeer automatically.  Now I want to uninstall it, but no icon is added to code/Applications//code. There is no instruction to uninstall in the product website. I tried AppCleaner, but there was no luck. Also, there is no process named codesaltybeer/code in the running processes:  precode$ ps -ef | grep saltybeer $ /code/pre  How can I uninstall SaltyBeer?  <answer258651> According to this answer:  I found package ID with codepkgutil/code:  precode$ pkgutil --packages | grep saltybeer com.saltybeer.pkg.saltybeer /code/pre  To find out paths of installed payload:  precode$ pkgutil --files com.saltybeer.pkg.saltybeer Contents Contents/Info.plist Contents/MacOS Contents/MacOS/saltybeer plugins plugins/saltybeer.bundle plugins/saltybeer.bundle/Contents plugins/saltybeer.bundle/Contents/Info.plist plugins/saltybeer.bundle/Contents/MacOS plugins/saltybeer.bundle/Contents/MacOS/cocoa_ui plugins/saltybeer.bundle/Contents/Resources plugins/saltybeer.bundle/Contents/Resources/._Info.plist plugins/saltybeer.bundle/Contents/Resources/Assets.car plugins/saltybeer.bundle/Contents/Resources/Info.plist plugins/saltybeer.bundle/Contents/Resources/MainMenu.nib plugins/saltybeer.bundle/Contents/_CodeSignature plugins/saltybeer.bundle/Contents/_CodeSignature/CodeResources /code/pre  Then to find out the location of installation:  precode$ pkgutil --pkg-info com.saltybeer.pkg.saltybeer package-id: com.saltybeer.pkg.saltybeer version: 2.0 volume: / location: Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/HAL/saltybeer.plugin install-time: 1477419357 /code/pre  I changed the current working directory:  precode$ cd /Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/HAL/saltybeer.plugin /code/pre  And deleted installed files:  precode$ pkgutil --only-files --files com.saltybeer.pkg.saltybeer | tr '\n' '\0' | xargs -n 1 -0 sudo rm -if /code/pre  And directories:  precode$ pkgutil --only-dirs --files com.saltybeer.pkg.saltybeer | tail -r | tr '\n' '\0' | xargs -n 1 -0 sudo rmdir /code/pre  Then I removed package receipt:  precode$ sudo pkgutil --forget com.saltybeer.pkg.saltybeer Forgot package 'com.saltybeer.pkg.saltybeer' on '/'. /code/pre  and finally to remove plugin directory:  precode$ cd /Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/HAL $ sudo rm -rf saltybeer.plugin /code/pre  Done!  <comment323414> In addition to your answer there is a great tool with you can inspect contents of packages: [Suspicious package](http://www.mothersruin.com/software/SuspiciousPackage/) <comment323418> Thanks, @dante12. "suspicious package" is useful. Although OS X installer has a "Show Files" feature that shows contents of the package, but not exact paths. Instead, this application provides complete information.
