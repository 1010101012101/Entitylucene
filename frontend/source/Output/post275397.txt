How do I resolve "The iPad could not be restored. An unknown error occurred (-1)"? <body> I've been trying to restore my iPad 3 (A1430) using iOS 9.3.5, but I keep getting the error message.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bfYJB.png" alt="the iPad &quot;iPad&quot; could not be restored. an unknown error occured (-1)"  I should also state that the iPad has not been charging properly it only shows the battery logo and indicates low battery power but does not show any charging progress. Furthermore, the iTunes logo does not come up until after about 40minutes to 1hour after connecting to a PC.
