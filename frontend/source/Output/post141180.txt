Can't save files to Windows SMB share <body> I've been experiencing this since I got my new MacBook...  At my job, we work I'm a Microsoft environment. Our servers use SMB3. Our IT deptartment also doesn't officially support Macs. We also use network/domain user accounts. No local accounts. Therefore, we also mapped my domain drive to the Mac. I have my network drive connect on login and save my files and work directly from that location.  Here's my problem; When I try to save a file from an app, it keeps saying I don't have permission to write in this location. Then the auto-save OS X feature starts saying it can't auto save because the location can't be found. What's crazy is that I check the permissions in the "Get Info" window and I have Read &amp; Write access. I also obviously have access o the location if I'm looking at it in Finder. I can make new folders and files too. I just can't save them?? IT has triple checked my permissions and it should be fine! So weird. Mac should be supporting SMB too. Sigh...

MacBook Pro with Retina display, OS X Mavericks (10.9.4), Using SMB3 Windows share  <comment166366> When you connected the drive, did you connect as "username" & "password" or "domain\username" & "password". I am not added to the domain but my employer does use AD or Domain services but that was required to make my MBP write to the network drives. <comment166387> We've tried both. Still can't save that specific file. Maybe I'll try making a new file and see if the same thing happens eventually. There are quite a few possibilities we're exploring <comment167592> We've tried everything now. It doesn't even like AFP. It must be something with our sever setup... And they don't want to use third-party open source stuff. Looks like we're just going to get a company Time Capsule and connect it to the network.
