Wrong keys in macbook keyboard <body> The keys that were supposed to give tilde and back-tick in the keyboard are giving § ±, respectively. My input source is U.S, as you can see in the image, and my keyboard layout is the following: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2nrz9.jpg" alt="keyboard layout"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/iYcQK.png" alt="enter image description here"  I tried to format my mac but it didn't work as well. What's is the problem that is occurring? Is there a way it can be solved?  Thank you!  <answer286591> It looks like your machine thinks the keyboard is of the ISO type instead of the ANSI type.  ISO keyboards have tilde/backtick on an extra key next to the Z.  See if this note can help:  <comment361679> Thank you, unfortunately there is no keyboardtype.plist  in my Library/Preferences. I ran /System/Library/CoreServices/KeyboardSetupAssistant.app/Contents/MacOS/KeyboardSetupAssistant and nothing's happened. Finnaly I tried to reset the SMC, but again it didn't work. <comment361684> @EduardoHashimoto In addition to karabiner, you could make a custom layout with http://scripts.sil.org/ukelele
