What is the reason for the slow shutdown? <body> I have a recent MacBook Pro. I am very happy with the startup times. However, during shutdown, it stays on the gray screen for a fairly long time. This is supposedly a known issue with Mavericks (see http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2013/10/mavericks-issues-and-fixes/?viewall=false#slideid-234671). The common solution I see is:  precodesudo defaults write /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.coreservices.appleevents ExitTimeOut -int 1 sudo defaults write /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.securityd ExitTimeOut -int 1 sudo defaults write /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.mDNSResponder ExitTimeOut -int 1 sudo defaults write /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.diskarbitrationd ExitTimeOut -int 1 sudo defaults write /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.coreservices.appleid.authentication ExitTimeOut -int 1 /code/pre  Just editing the timeouts seems like the wrong approach. I'd like to know exactly what the computer is waiting for and just nip the problem at the source. Is there a way to monitor the shutdown process to determine what is slowing it down?  On the other and, if this is a known issue, then it must have a very specific cause that someone must've figured out by now. Why is the solution so generic?  <comment135976> The wired.com link also suggests you repair permissions, too. Have you done this step? Have you also looked at the system log files through Console.app to see what errors are present when the delay occurs? Most events in the logs are time-stamped. <comment154042> Did you run those commands to see the results? They didn't work for me. Also, do you have a BootCamp partition? I'm wondering if that might be to blame in my case; see http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/131205/does-bootcamp-cause-os-x-shutdown-to-be-slow.
