What to Remove before selling Macbook? <body> My macbook (feb 2008 white) sold on ebay, but I haven't shipped it yet.  I'm concerned about my privacy.  I can't wipe the hd clean because I sold the computer with valuable software on it.  What files should I remove so that the person who receives the computer can't log into my accounts?  And what other things should I do to ensure my privacy is safe?  <answer69096> Here is one way to do it:  ol liTake a full backup/li liSecure wipe the hard drive. (Software like DBAN should do the job nicely.)/li liReinstall Mac OS/li liRestore apps, but not personal files, from the backup./li /ol  <answer69099> Here is another way to do it:  ol liCreate a new user./li liEncrypt the old user's personal folder with FileVault using an insane random password. (E.g. 100 random characters.)/li liRemove old user and select to remove user data./li /ol  As all the old user's file are encrypted and then erased, even if those files are restored they would be useless without the encryption key.  This solution assumes that no software is installed as "for this user only" as that software would be removed with the old user.  <answer69125> h3The simple solution/h3  Create a new admin account, then use it to delete your personal account(s).  When you delete a user, you have the option of performing a "secure erase" on their home directory:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/J2TPJ.png" alt="enter image description here"  Assuming you haven't stored any personal files outside of your home directory, this will do the trick.  hr  h3The paranoid solution/h3  If you want to be really thorough, the only way to ensure that none of your personal data remains is to securely wipe the drive. You can do this from Disk Utility by clicking "Security Options" on the "Erase" tab:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/V6MyN.png" alt="enter image description here"  After that, reinstall your applications. None of your personal data will remain.  <answer251165> Don't skip the first steps of the process: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201065  Especially signing out of iTunes is very much recommended to avoid running into limitations of the maximum number of the devices active.   <answer264151> A guide from here https://macback.us/sell-macbook-pro/  precode1 - Create a backup 2 - Sign out of iTunes 3 - Sign out of iCloud 4 - Sign out of iMessage 5 - Erase and reinstall OS X /code/pre  <comment80277> thanks.  is there any way I can check to see if the software is installed for multiple users <comment80281> If there was only one user on the system when you installed the apps, the apps were installed for all users. To make sure that the apps are for all users, go into your user’s folder and check if there is an “Applications” folder. If there is, copy the contents to  /Applications and you are good to go. <comment80282> @duci9y my user's applications folder is empty. <comment80294> This may be difficult to do in Lion and newer, as old-style FileVault home directories are being phased out. <comment80295> Disk Utility also has the ability to securely erase drives. <comment80299> @user176105 Then you are good to go! Just to make sure, test all apps using a temporary user account. <comment80316> @jmk Yes, but it doesn't allow you to erase the system drive so that won't help you in this case. <comment80320> Obviously, you need to boot from another drive (DBAN included). All OS X installer/recovery drives come with Disk Utility. <comment88392> How can you do this, if you only have 1 drive, and you're trying to delete all the data on it? <comment93329> You can launch Disk Utility from an OS X installation disc or recovery partition. <comment93421> Sweet!
