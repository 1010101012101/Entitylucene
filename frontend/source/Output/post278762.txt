Limit app switcher to active display <body> When pressing kbd⌘/kbd+kbdtab&nbsp;&nbsp;/kbd, I want to cycle through strongonly/strong the apps on the display that contains the app which currently has focus or contains the cursor. Likewise, when pressing kbd⌘/kbd+kbd&nbsp;`&nbsp;/kbd, I want to limit the windows to the current display.  In my MS Windows environment, I've accomplished this with VistaSwitcher. Is there a similar product or native feature in OS X that makes this possible?
