My terminal keeps printing "emergency" messages <body> I keep getting these broadcast messages being printed to every terminal window, and it's driving me nuts. Does anybody have a clue as to how to turn them off?  precodeBroadcast Message from _usbmuxd@10242-MacBook-Air.local                             (no tty) at 7:23 GMT...                                                  [03/12/2016 07:23:37] [Emergency] [update thread] uncaught exception: easyDNS  Runtime Exception   /code/pre  <answer230749> Look in /var/log/system.log and see if you can get more information about the messages. Also look at the settings in /etc/syslog.conf    <answer230763> Ok, this is what I did.  Like Brian Mc said, I checked my logs at /var/log/system.log. I found a little extra information. This is what the full line in the system log reads:  precodeMar 12 04:43:29 10242-MacBook-Air ddnsd[60]: [03/12/2016 04:43:29] [Emergency] [update thread] uncaught exception: easyDNS Runtime Exception /code/pre  So I was like, huh! What's this "ddnsd" thing? So I looked through my processes for any process with a name like ddns.  I ran   precodeps aux|grep ddns /code/pre  The command came back with:  precodeabudu_h          1142   0.0  0.2  2538864   6496   ??  S     7:24AM   0:01.27 /Users/abudu_h/Library/Application Support/easyDNS/ddnsa.app/Contents/MacOS/ddnsa /code/pre  I thought, I don't really need this program running, why not turn it off. So rather than delete it, what I did was make it non-executable.  precodecd /Users/abudu_h/Library/Application\ Support/easyDNS/ chmod -x ddnsa.app/ /code/pre  And hooray! The messages stopped.   <comment281671> you could make sure easyDNS is up to date correctly configured... <comment282411> It sounds like you were unaware of easyDNS being on your system. Did you just install and forget? <comment282462> I remember installing it in the hopes I could connect MAMP to DNS services, but where to find it was the problem. It wasn't in the main Applications folder, and spotlight search wasn't helpful. I guess I never tried grepping through my entire hard-drive for it...
