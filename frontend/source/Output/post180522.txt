-bash: /Users/[me]/.rvm/scripts/initialize: No such file or directory <body> I was in a directory where I had a ~ and I went to remove it by doing  rm -f ~  for which it said it was a directory. So I made the really silly move of doing  rm -rf ~  and suddenly I get the error  precode-bash: /Users/brent/.rvm/scripts/initialize: No such file or directory /code/pre  See out put  precodecd .. -bash: /Users/brent/.rvm/scripts/initialize: No such file or directory -bash: /Users/brent/.rvm/scripts/hook: No such file or directory /code/pre  Can I restore these?  <comment214421> nope, njet, no, non, nee,  rm-rf  is fatal :) <comment214448> Do you have a backup? If not, and you need any of the files from your home directory, SHUT THE COMPUTER DOWN IMMEDIATELY, then use some other computer to research data recovery options. <comment214540> I stopped the rm quickly and fortunately I didn't do it as sudo. Looks like I just lost my bash folder
