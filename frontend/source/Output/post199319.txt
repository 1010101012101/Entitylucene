Boot MacBook to Linux/Windows from TimeCapsule. <body> I love to run different OSs in my 13" Retina MacBookPro. If I can install Windows/Linux/OSX on the Apple TimeCapsule and can Boot them over network wirelessly It will be awesome. If its possible please let me know how to do that. I will go and get one TimeCapsule.  If https://discussions.apple.com/thread/3816843?start=0&amp;tstart=0 is the solution, Please elaborate it.  <answer199330> Apple TimeCapsule doesn't offer netboot/netinstall services. None of the essential requirements for such services like NFS (Linux/OS X), http(s) (OS X) or tftp (Linux/Windows) run on the Time Capsule.  You need Mac OS X Server, a NAS/Linux server or a Windows Server (I think some pimped Windows Client OSs will do it also) to accomplish this.  <comment238867> Shall I go with Linux Server? <comment238869> I would go Linux, yes: netboot/netinstall of Linux in Linux is trivial, [OS X](http://www.blueboxmoon.com/wordpress/?p=929) and [Windows](http://www.savelono.com/linux/how-to-install-windows-7-over-a-network-using-linux-pxe-dnsmasq-and-samba.html). But I don't know if it's possible to netboot a MacBook (Pro) to Linux/Windows. Probably you have to search here for q/a or ask a second question.
