How do you send mail to Undisclosed Recipients? <body> Not something I really ever need to do often, but just how strongemdo/em/strong you send to Undisclosed Recipients in Mail.app    I've seen them arrive looking like this -br img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/sriTn.png" alt="enter image description here"br but never figured out how I might do it myself  Previously, I've sent to myself, then everybody else as BCC, but is that really the way to do it?  <answer243764> That's the way to do it, yes. You can even leave the To: part empty which then will result in codeUndisclosed recipients:/code.  <comment300295> Ahhh, yes, ty - no To, no CC, **only** BCC & I get that header.
