MacOS crashed four times today <body> h3Further information: unable to get into diagnostics/h3  I tried getting to Apple Diagnostics: shut down computer, press power button, hold D key down: instead of diagnostics I am taken to the usual login screen. According to Apple's site: (https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201257) I should try using Option D. Again, takes me to the login screen not the diagnostics. Not sure what my next step is.  h3Original problem: Kernel Panic/h3  Can anyone help me interpret this? Commenters suggested I try apple diagnostic mode, but see above, I am not able to get there. Here's the dump.  precodeAnonymous UUID:       BBE62DAE-7B75-1109-3481-33104AF1985D  Sun Feb 12 19:59:40 2017  *** Panic Report *** panic(cpu 0 caller 0xffffff80139fcc5d): Kernel trap at 0xffffff7f956e0681, type 13=general protection, registers: CR0: 0x0000000080010033, CR2: 0xffffff8243e9c260, CR3: 0x00000000043bc000, CR4: 0x0000000000002660 RAX: 0x000000000008fff7, RBX: 0x0000000000000002, RCX: 0x0000000000000001, RDX: 0x0000000000000001 RSP: 0xffffff826b0fb9e0, RBP: 0xffffff826b0fba10, RSI: 0x000000000000ffff, RDI: 0xffffff82177d1000 R8:  0xffffff80539a0804, R9:  0x0000000000000000, R10: 0xffffff80539a0608, R11: 0xffffff7f956dbcb6 R12: 0x2a09060d30210102, R13: 0x000000000000ffff, R14: 0x0000000000000001, R15: 0xffffff82177d1000 RFL: 0x0000000000010202, RIP: 0xffffff7f956e0681, CS:  0x0000000000000008, SS:  0x0000000000000010 Fault CR2: 0xffffff8243e9c260, Error code: 0x0000000000000000, Fault CPU: 0x0, PL: 0, VF: 0  Backtrace (CPU 0), Frame : Return Address 0xffffff823fd46c50 : 0xffffff80138   Model: MacPro5,1, BootROM MP51.007F.B03, 4 processors, Quad-Core Intel Xeon, 2.66 GHz, 20 GB, SMC 1.39f5 Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce GT 120, NVIDIA GeForce GT 120, PCIe, 512 MB Memory Module: DIMM 1, 8 GB, DDR3 ECC, 1066 MHz, 0x0000, - Memory Module: DIMM 2, 8 GB, DDR3 ECC, 1066 MHz, 0x0000, - Memory Module: DIMM 3, 2 GB, DDR3 ECC, 1066 MHz, 0x802C, 0x31384A53463235363732415A2D3147314431 Memory Module: DIMM 4, 2 GB, DDR3 ECC, 1066 MHz, 0x802C, 0x31384A53463235363732415A2D3147314431 Bluetooth: Version 5.0.4f10, 3 services, 27 devices, 1 incoming serial ports Network Service: Ethernet 1, Ethernet, en0 Network Service: Ethernet 2, Ethernet, en1 PCI Card: NVIDIA GeForce GT 120, Display Controller, Slot-1 Serial ATA Device: HL-DT-ST DVD-RW GH41N Serial ATA Device: WDC WD6400AAKS-41H2B0, 640.14 GB Serial ATA Device: OCZ-VERTEX2 3.5, 115.03 GB Serial ATA Device: OWC Mercury Electra 3G SSD, 480.1 GB USB Device: USB 2.0 Bus USB Device: Mass Storage Device USB Device: Hub USB Device: CTH-460 USB Device: Apple LED Cinema Display USB Device: Display iSight USB Device: Display Audio USB Device: USB 2.0 Bus USB Device: Hub USB Device: officejet 5500 series USB Device: Fitbit Base Station USB Device: Miscellaneous Device USB Device: Keyboard Hub USB Device: Apple Keyboard USB Device: USB Bus USB Device: USB Bus USB Device: USB Bus USB Device: BRCM2046 Hub USB Device: Bluetooth USB Host Controller USB Device: USB Bus USB Device: USB Bus USB Device: USB Bus FireWire Device: built-in_hub, Up to 800 Mb/sec Thunderbolt Bus:  /code/pre  <comment342900> Have you tried identifying any potential hardware issues using the Apple Hardware Test? Boot your Mac while holding the D key to start the Apple Hardware Test. From there, you can scan your Mac for hardware issues which might be causing these frequent kernel panics. <comment342903> Ah good idea, I didn't know about it. I was blaming it on the new MacOs beta that I just installed but from he trace can you guess if it's a hardware or software problem? <comment342915> Turn Mac off, turn it on, hold D down. Takes me to login screen! Then according to Apple site, try holding Option D down. Takes me to login screen. In other words, it's not getting me to diagnostics. <comment342940> First thing I'd do is remove any 3rd party kexts. They're not listed in your panic report so I can't see which you have. btw, is that a 4,1 with the firmware update? <comment342984> If I am not mistaken, to run AHT, you need to boot it off of Disk 2 of the Install Disks.  The Mac Pro 2010 and 2012 came with 10.6 and 10.7 respectively.
