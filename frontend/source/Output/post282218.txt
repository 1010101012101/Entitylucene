How to put Desktop on External Drive/Non-System Partition? <body> Is it possible to get something like a symbolic link/alias to direct to another folder on an external hard drive and still have the files display on the desktop?  I used:  precodesudo rm -rf ~/Desktop sudo ln -s /Volumes/&lt;partition_label&gt;/Desktop ~/Desktop /code/pre  But the Desktop is just blank, and when I drag files onto the Desktop, they disappear and are copied to code/Volumes/&lt;partition_label&gt;/Desktop/code  I recently tried replacing the Desktop with an alias instead, but I now only get a cancel icon popping up next to the cursor when I drag a file over it.  The partition is exFat so it's compatible with my tri-boot. I'm doing this so files are automatically available on each Desktop.  Any ideas to get this working?  I was also thinking about an alternative, something that automatically moved a file to code/Volumes/&lt;partition_label&gt;/Desktop/&lt;file_name&gt;/code when it was dragged to code~/Desktop/code and replaced with a symbolic link or alias on code~/Desktop/code.  Is that a viable alternative?  <answer282280> You can create a folder hard link using coreutils. Remove the symlink you created and install Homebrew if you don't already have it, then codebrew install coreutils/code and use:  precodesudo gln /Volumes/&lt;partition_label&gt;/Desktop ~/Desktop /code/pre  (Be careful with removing hard links, since the destination will be deleted if you delete normally. To delete a hard link, use codeunlink ~/Desktop/code.)  <answer284085> I figured it out, using bindfs, I believe you need to install OSXFUSE:  ol licodebrew install bindfs/code (if you have homebrew installed - easy way) (or you can build it from source - slightly harder)/li licodecp -R ~/Desktop/  /Volumes/&lt;partition_label&gt;/Desktop//code To move all files from your local Desktop to the partition's Desktop folder./li licoderm -rf ~/Desktop &amp;&amp; mkdir ~/Desktop/code Will delete and create new Desktop folder./li licodebindfs /Volumes/&lt;partition_label&gt;/Desktop ~/Desktop/code Mounts the Desktop folder on the partition to your Desktop folder./li /ol  Note that with this method, all items that are dragged from your system partition to the Desktop are copied-not moved-and that if you delete any files from within the mounted file system, they are not sent to the trash, rather they are permanently deleted.  <comment355534> I just tried that and got: `gln: /Volumes/partition_label/Desktop: hard link not allowed for directory`
