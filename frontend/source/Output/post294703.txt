Can't log in to my 2009 Macbook pro <body> 2009 macbook pro (I know, I know, it's old). I've searched the web for some answers and tried some methods but still can't sign in.  One day I tried to turn on my computer and simply log in, couldn't do it. ***I DO know my password for sure. For the purpose of illustration below, let's say my password is "green" and my hint is "what's your favourite colour".  What I've tried:  ul lisimply logging in. I get the password hint and change password by appleID popup. The password hint makes sense ("what's your favourite colour") but entering "green" doesn't work./li liresetting my password by using my apple ID...i'm able to sign in to my appleID, get to the change password popup and proceed, but it doesn't actually change my password. I know this because the hint is still "what's your favourite colour" and has not changed (even though I changed it when I reset the password)./li listarting up in safe mode. Same thing as above./li listarting up in recovery mode works. I go to utilities - terminal and enter "resetpassword" and go through the motions to change the password. All works there. But then when I reset and try to log in in either regular or safe mode, same as above. The only difference here is that whatever I changed the password hint to is reflected in the regular login page, so it seems to work better than changing the password and hint through appleID./li lireinstalling El Capitan. Not fixed. Was originally running Yosemite or Mavericks. Can't remember./li /ul  I would like to obviously save my data on my computer and would prefer to not do a hard wipe. I have a backup but it's not current.  Any suggestions?  <comment371973> Same answer as the person that broke their log in shell. Make a new admin user.
