Can I delete my iCloud email account? <body> I signed up with iCloud and I see that there is an @me.com email account associated with my account.  I don't have any interest in using email with iCloud - I use gmail for email.  Is there a way to remove email from my iCloud account all together?   Perhaps I am being paranoid, but I am afraid there might be security risks from having another email account around that might be used for Apple account change notifications.  Since I never check that account I wouldn't know if something seemed wrong.  <answer59815> It seem to be impossible to get rid of this account.  What I've done is:  ul liconnect to my iCloud account (with my AppleID, the same for the AppStore and other)/li ligo to mail/li liin codePreferences/code (top right) choose coderulesâ€¦/code/li liadd a rule to redirect all e-mails received at my @me.com adress to my main e-mail./li /ul  It can take several minutes to work, but I don't loose anything like that.  <answer162989> go to Settings, mail, then Icloud, and turn off Mail  <comment68903> That sounds like a good suggestion.  I will also forward me email from there.  Thanks! <comment190764> Perhaps this answer would be more helpful (and, in turn, get a slightly better vote count) if you explained exactly what effect this has and how it fixes busyspin's problem. In general, answers are better if you explain *why* they work.
