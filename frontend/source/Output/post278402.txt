bash producing thousands of console messages per second and draining battery on MacBook Pro <body> Using macOS Sierra on a relatively new (2 months) MacBook Pro.  Sometimes finding my battery draining very quickly- within a couple of hours. Running top shows bash consuming 75% cpu. Running Apple's console program reveals about 20000 related messages per second (!) being generated, all looking like this:     kernel AMFI: allowing exception handler for 'bash' (693) because the handler was set by master-entitled process 'init' (1)   Not sure what this means. Any takers?  Restarting the machine gets rid of the high CPU usage and the messages even with bash open, but only temporarily and I have not been able to figure out what causes the problem it to come back.  <comment350339> Have you tried force quitting the bash process from activity monitor? Sometimes after closing the terminal app, I still have a bash process running. Force quitting it has not caused any problems for me, and stops both the bash process and it's high CPU usage. <comment350373> Are you by any chance using VirtualBox? <comment350398> I do have virtualbox installed, but only use it very rarely. Can virtual box lead to such problems?
