How to schedule running vlc on MacBook? <body> I have created a m3u list file for some mp3 files.  How could I schedule the macbook to play it, e.g. tomorrow 6am?  <answer180782> Open Automator and do something like this.   Use Workflow + Drag New Calendar Event to the right. Choose the time+date. Choose what file to open.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/J721W.jpg" alt="new cal event"  Obviously set the date/time and choose the right file to Open.  <comment214824> You may have to point it to open the m3u file, and not VLC.app.  Maybe. <comment214937> @Buscarì›ƒ I don't get it, after I click Automator, which one shall I choose, Workflow, Application, Service, Print Plugin, Folder Action, iCal Alarm, or Image Capture Plugin? <comment231780> Sorry, I assumed you can see it. If you pay close attention at the top of the screen shot it shows it to be "Workflow".
