Select / move boxes <body> I've imported a document from Word. I have a problem removing the imported page numbers and adding mine. This is what I got:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rPxzn.png" alt="http://i.imgur.com/P548W.png"  The rightmost "6" is the one coming from Word. I can't get to select it (in order to delete it). The other 6 is the one I added as page number, but I don't know how to move the containing box upward.  Any help?  strongEDIT/strong: Here is the file: http://jumpshare.com/v/j7UKl0?b=to1t8  <answer64918> Nice one, see screenshot for option to make the page number from Word editable:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7GboK.png" alt="enter image description here"  The box is actually the footer, to move it upwards open the Info window (kbdOpt-Cmd-I/kbd), go to the Document properties (first icon) and change the footer boundary.  <comment76262> Can you upload the document? Erase all personal content and leave the problematic parts intact. <comment76266> done. thanks for the interest. <comment76272> patrix has already given the correct answer.
