Is it worth to max out a MBP 13"? <body> In the past couple of months I thought about buying a Macbook. Finaly I decided myself for a MBP 13". I will used it primarly for programming/scripting in Python and some WebDev. I also want to use it as mobile office machine. It should be able to run at least 1 virtual machine. At home and at work I've 2 monitors so I don't need a 15" one.  Is it worth to go over 8GB RAM? Is it worth to take an i7 Processor for the extra 1MB of cache? Or should I just go for the 256GB standard edition?  Thanks  <answer118377> In my experience, for the Macbook I sold emyesterday/em, I've had 8GB RAM with an SSD. A SSD will do much good to your Macbook Pro. My MBP had a 2.26Ghz dual core processor and it ran like a charm. I've always used VMWare Fusion to run Windows 7 next to it. Everything was fast, so you don't have to waste your money on it.  <answer118407> Sure why not? Think the VM may do better with more RAM but overall you'll notice more of a diff with SSD. Don't pay apple to do this for you, if you can unscrew something then you can change out your RAM &amp; harddrive. Samsung 840 series are amazing, btw.   <answer118567> You should go with the maxed out version. As you are a developer and also want to run virtual machine, you should have 16 GB RAM. I am running with 8 GB and it fills up so fast when I start IDEs, Safari, Office Suite, Mail at the same time. And mine is i7 Quad. So more is better.  <comment138145> I've also change the HD for an SSD. You have the feeling to have a brand new computer. Huge improvement in performance! Is the first thing I would do. <comment138148> Yes, it's a HUGE difference. <comment138183> The new MBP Retinas all have SSD's so it doesn't matter :-)
