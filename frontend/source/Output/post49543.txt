Is there a way to refresh a Finder file listing? <body> I love my Mac and how things generally just work. Now and again, however, one finds a few annoyances. My latest one is that I cannot find a refresh button anywhere to update a file listing in a Finder window.  Please note that I am aware that refreshing is generally not needed as new files are automatically added to Finder windows. In my case I have a NAS on my network, and to update a file listing in a NAS folder I currently need to change directory to somewhere else and then back again to see new files.  Is there a way to request an updated file listing in a Finder window?  <answer49546> Yes!  A simple AppleScript can tell the Finder to tell its front window to update every item. Such an AppleScript can be saved as an Application and then dragged to the Finder toolbar to give you a refresh button  The AppleScript you need is quite simple:  precode tell application "Finder" to tell front window to update every item /code/pre  <answer136774> I just created the script and then saved as an APP. I then added the app to my toolbar. That way which ever window is active becomes the front window. This does not require that AppleScript be running.  <answer136777> I've noticed that changing the view in Finder seems to refresh the content of the Finder window. What I mean by changing the view is going from e.g. Icon view to List. I've not done any extensive testing, but it did the trick for me last night when I copied a file into the NAS box in the Terminal, while the directory I copied the file into was also open in Finder.   <answer166750> To relaunch the Finder:  ol liHold the Option key and right-click the Finder icon in the Dock, then select Relaunch./li liPress Option-Command-Escape or choose Force Quit from the Apple menu, then select the Finder and click Relaunch./li liLog out and log back in to your user account./li /ol  <answer236198> This worked for me on El Capitan  http://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/24714/refresh-finder  <answer267423> If it's a remote server, sometime one has to reconnect to refresh the file list.  <comment130246> Just as a footnote: In Macericks you need to press [cmd]+[alt] as you drag the app to the Finder toolbar. This is an excelent answer (just used it and works great) <comment139462> Indeed, Daniel's solution works great. Although I wish there was a way to run the script without having the AppleScript open. Also thanks to Barranka for the hint about pression CMD and ALT keys. <comment144006> Thanks for this workaround. Maybe I create a daemon which runs this script once per second (but that's not very power efficient), although that polling approach is not very power efficient, would prefer Finder to automatically properly update based on file system events. Isn't there a fix for this? (Erasing com.apple.finder.plist and .DS_Store in affected folders did not fix it for me). <comment195489> nowhere near as elegant as simply refreshing the window <comment222855> I have tried this example in yosemite with no luck.  Does this still work for you? <comment247535> This should be a comment on the accepted answer, not a separate answer. <comment300454> @chrishough works for me with 10.11. <comment304393> Also this 'applet' doesn't work with El Capitan <comment321663> This sounds insane, I cannot believe this is considered a solution.
