No files with prefix com.apple.security in Library? <body> I have been having issues with Safari not showing https sites.  The best solution I have found googling around seems to be to delete either codecom.apple.security.plist/code or codecom.apple.security.revocation.plist/code, but in codeLibrary/Preferences/code I have no mention of any codecom.apple.security/code file.  I have not found anything that seems applicable to this exact problem.  Could anyone shed light on why this file might be missing, and/or how to restore it?  I have tried the following   ul liResetting Safari/li liRebooting/li liKeychain first aid, no errors/li liExecuting "ls -l ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.*.plist";which showed no file in results./li /ul  <answer159664> On my iMac the codecom.apple.security.plist/code is located in the codePreferences/code folder in the codeLocal Domain/code:  precode    /Library/Preferences /code/pre  but you were looking in the codePreferences/code folder in the codeUser Domain/code:   precode    ~/Library/Preferences   (aka: /Users/[username]/Library Preferences) /code/pre  There was no codecom.apple.security.revocation.plist/code file in any of the  Preferences folders on my iMac. If one did exist I'd expect it to be in the same Preferences folder as the above codeplist/code file.  Check your code/Library/Preferences/code folder for either or both of those codeplist/code files.  If you aren't familiar with domains in OS X and how they affect the use of files then you can see Apple's documentation for an overview: About the OS X File System
