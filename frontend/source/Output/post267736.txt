How do I uninstall Wine? <body> I installed Wine through a .pkg file, and I want to completely remove all traces of Wine.  I've searched around the internet, but I cannot find any way to uninstall wine if you've installed through a .pkg file.

The pkg file itself only installs Wine Staging.app to /Applications, which is self-contained and you can simply delete it.  Almost anything else like user installed apps or libraries reside in the folder em$USER/.wine/em and you can simply delete it. Some files are also added in em$USER/.local/*//em or em$USER/.config/*//em. The .local and .config folders may also be used by other apps like X11 or Wireshark.
