Chrome does not open PDF files <body> I am unable to open pdf files in chrome. I have tried the solutions that are available over the internet (for example (1) enabling plugin, (2) disabling the default viewer in the content settings of the chrome). However the problem persist. I also tried to reset the chrome settings but to no avail. I had this problem two weeks but it got ok automatically. But it happened again now. Any help to solve this problem will be much appreciated.  Thanks in advance.
