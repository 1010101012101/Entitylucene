Is there a way for locking the screen and putting it to sleep/activating the screen saver to be two different events on a MBP? <body> This question is very similar to what I want to accomplish, except for the fact that I also want to be able to put the display to sleep at times without triggering it to ask me for a password. I basically want to be able to do two things:  ul liAt times, lock the screen, much like I do in a PC by hitting kbdWin/kbd+kbdL/kbd. I'm fine with the screen going to sleep at this time, and if this step was all I wanted, hitting kbdcontrol/kbd+kbdshift/kbd+kbdpower/kbd would do the trick if codeRequire password [amount of time] after sleep or screen saver begins/code under codeSystem Preferences &gt; Security/code was checked. However;/li liI also want to be able to, sometimes, just put the display to sleep or let it eventually start the screen saver without it asking for a password afterwards. I could also accomplish this one simply, if I unchecked codeRequire password [amount of time] after sleep or screen saver begins/code under codeSystem Preferences &gt; Security/code, but again that would make me unable to do what I wanted to do above. /li /ul  I can do this all in Windows by enabling the screen saver, and not checking the box that specifies that it'd get me to the login screen when on resume. That way, I can let the screen saver get triggered and the display eventually go to sleep and it won't ask me for a password when I resume; and I can also simply lock the session when I want to by hitting kbdWin/kbd+kbdL/kbd, and then the display will eventually go to sleep.  Is this possible to accomplish in a Mac?   <answer192829> There are a number of posts (here and here) on superuser.sx.   ul liTo lock the screen (actually invoking the "Login Window…" action from the User menu, and a direct analog to the kbdWin/kbd+kbdL/kbd shortcut in Windows):  precode/System/Library/CoreServices/Menu\ Extras/User.menu/Contents/Resources/CGSession -suspend /code/pre/li liTo sleep the display (I use this all the time as part of my last command before bedtime on my home machine):  precodepmset displaysleepnow /code/pre/li /ul  Either of these options can be invoked through a keyboard shortcut by tying a shell script to a shortcut (using Automator (like this), Quicksilver, LaunchBar, Alfred, etc., see this post).   It's worth noting that BetterTouchTool can also perform these actions (directly mapping shortcuts to actions like this), as noted in this answer to one of the prior questions). The developer has been giving the app some love recently, which has been wonderful to see.   <answer192835> here is a solution, with mouse movements (not keyboard shortcuts).   emFOR THE FIRST PART/em  strongGo to user &amp; groups/strong  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gvbVP.png" alt="users groups"  strongEnable fast switching./strong   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FGpXY.png" alt="enter image description here" Whenever you need to activate the login screen click login screen on top right.

Not quite the short cut you looking for, but another option.  I have it set to sc so after activating Alfred, I just type that combination and press enter. <comment228689> The reference to Windows does not help me (I do not have it), but are you asking to have 2 screen saver modes, one with password one without ? and the the way to trigger one or the other. <comment228697> @Buscar웃SD I guess that could be a way to look at it, yes. <comment229622> How does this work for the second part of the question (sleep display or start screensaver without requiring a password)? <comment229694> It doesn't work for the second part of the question. <comment229696> Is there any difference between what you mention in your second bullet point and just hitting `control+shift+power`? <comment229698> As far as I know, Ctrl+Shift+Eject (or Power) actually puts the machine to sleep (`pmset sleepnow`). On the other hand `pmset displaysleepnow` just turns off the screen. As noted below, this action can be tied to a hot corner. Screen locking will occur according to the settings in the Security & Privacy prefpane on displaysleep. <comment229708> According to [this page](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201236), `control+shift+power` should just put the display to sleep. <comment229712> Ahh, noted. Seems that way. I'll have to check this on my iMac at work… it didn't seem to work yesterday. It *does* work just fine on my home MBP (used in clamshell with external Apple keyboard and display). I was only aware of the sleep combo(Cmd+Opt+Eject/Power), so thanks for pointing that out! <comment229794> indeed. i missed 'without' part. i revised my post. @DustinWheeler @JNat♦
