My iPhone's wi-fi receptor is dead. Is there a way to connect to internet on phone via USB or bluetooth? <body> My wi-fi connect button seems to have greyed out. Last time this happened the provider replaced the phone with a refurbished phone but it's not an option anymore as the phone is no longer under warranty.   Is there a way to have internet on my phone without using wi-fi?  <answer246457> I think this web page is really good but I'm not sure you can use it or not: http://smallbusiness.chron.com/share-internet-bluetooth-58494.html  You can share the internet of your laptop with your iPhone. The Link above only explains it on Windows Laptops. For Macs, this link: http://osxdaily.com/2012/01/05/enable-internet-sharing-mac-os-x/  Yes, there's another way but it needs a second iPhone(or any other smart phone with the "Wifi Hotspot" ability) Apple support has an article about it, I just give you the link. [If the second phone is running android, use this link.]  <answer246518> What about this: https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/How+to+Fix+iPhone+4S+Wi-Fi+Grayed+Out/22167  I think you have to change the hardware. 'Cuz there's no way except Cellular Data.  <comment303898> vDog asked how to have internet access without using wi-fi. Doesn't using the "WiFi Hotspot," by definition, use wi-fi? <comment303956> Cheers Hackman but I am looking for a non-wifi solution :) <comment303988> I had that problem on my iPhone 4S. I could not find a solution and could only use cellular data. So I used cellular data until I upgraded to a newer iPhone.
