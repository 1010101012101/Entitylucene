Adding Gradle to PATH <body> I am trying to add Gradle to my PATH.  I have used the command  precodeexport PATH=/myUsername/Applications/gradle-2.6/bin:$PATH /code/pre  but when I type  precodegradle /code/pre  I get an error "command not found."  So I went to look for .profile or .bash_profile, but neither file existed.  So I created .bash_profile, and added the line  precodeexport PATH=/myUsername/Applications/gradle-2.6/bin:$PATH /code/pre  This still did not work, and I have no idea what to do from here.  When I type $PATH, I see the lines added, so I have no idea why it isn't working.  Any help would be appreciated.  <answer201291> The path /myusername/Applications/gradle-2.6/bin probably doesn't exist except your personal user folder is in the root of your main volume - which would be very, very uncommon on a *nix system.    Depending on where you've installed Gradle the proper path might be:  precode/Users/myUsername/Applications/gradle-2.6/bin or /Applications/gradle-2.6/bin /code/pre  So change the export line to  precodeexport PATH=/Users/myUsername/Applications/gradle-2.6/bin:$PATH or   export PATH=/Applications/gradle-2.6/bin:$PATH /code/pre  <answer201292> Personally I'd not place it forward of the system's code$PATH/code and do it as such.  precodeexport PATH=$PATH:$HOME/Applications/gradle-2.6/bin /code/pre  If you want it first in the code$PATH/code, then use:  precode export PATH=$HOME/Applications/gradle-2.6/bin:$PATH /code/pre
