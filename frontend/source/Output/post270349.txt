System Preferences and SIP thru Scripting and Terminal <body> *Question marked as too broad, and I rambled a bit, looking to clarify  Can someone please explain to me how an admin user may be able to change System Settings on macOS Sierra when Security Integrity Protection is enabled using scripts and the terminal.  To my understanding, SIP protects many of the /System files that System Preferences accesses, and that you have to use the System Preferences app to access these settings because it is Apple approved and thus can work with SIP in /System.  I have tried using launchctl and defaults write  and have limited success with both.  It is unclear if SIP is making it so these commands no longer work (since some of the .plsit files are in /System) or if the files simply no longer exist in Sierra and it has to be done in a different way.  Sample controls I am trying to control:  precodeDisable bluetooth Disable sharing Disable iCloud Restrict NTP server /code/pre  Using the GUI is not a possible solution as we are trying to push this script to many computers.  <comment339735> Are you trying to lock down another admin account? If not why not put parental controls on it. Bear in mind any admin can undo anything you do. <comment339737> I am trying to disable bluetooth, file sharing, icloud, set security settings, etc through the terminal and through non-applescript scripts.  There is so little documentation on SIP that I cannot figure out what I can and cannot do regarding settings on the Mac using scripts.  Ideally, I can control the System Settings options and panels thru scripts and terminal <comment339738> Marked unclear (or too broad): most of the settings can't be changed by a standard user, so once configured/enabled/disabled by an admin there is no requirement to lock it/change it once more. Locking down an admin user instead of assigning standard users doesn't make much sense. SIP only locks the changing of particular files and folders. SIP doesn't prevent you to unload daemon/agents (which doesn't change the files)! <comment339739> Also: `... .../com.apple.InternetSharing.plist` neither works in Sierra nor in ElCap. The daemon simply doesn't exist. <comment339770> Which specific settings do you want to change? SIP protection works independent of access method, so even System Preferences can't change configurations/plists protected by SIP. You might get better answers if you just ask for a way to, let's say, disable iCloud (Drive, I assume) from a shell script.
