Apple Server.app not showing website <body> I have tried to host a Django WebApp (app.example.com) following this tutorial: http://jelockwood.blogspot.de/2013/06/running-django-webapps-with-os-x.html  The WebApp will be hosted next to a different website (www.example.com), which was created with the Server.app Websites GUI and was working fine until now.  I created a new website for the mentioned web app using app.example.com as the domain name. The other websites domain name is www.example.com.  After adding the website for the web app in the GUI both the web app website as well as the other website disappeared and I am now unable to create anything. Even changing the PHP and Python App setting is not possible anymore. Any advice on what went wrong here?  UPDATE: I tried creating different dummy websites and it seems the Server.app does create the corresponding files and folders in the correct directory. However, nothing is shown in the GUI and the mentioned website is not served.   <comment279982> When trying to read the site where a=re the domains defined in DNS or equivalent
