The messages app isn't on my Mac (Yosemite) <body> Recently, I've been wanting to send and receive texts on my MacBook air, just like I do on my pro, but when I spotlight 'messages,' nothing shows up except for java and json files. brbrimg src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/i9OzJ.png" alt="Searching for &#39;messages&#39; in spotlight"  br Is there any way to download the messages app off of the app store (I've looked and haven't found it. Is it called something else there?) How could I get the messages app on my computer?brThanksbr-Abr Edit: I have checked to make sure my spotlight works properly, and looked through my applications folder. It is not present.  <answer244602> Since codeMessages.app/code comes bundled with OS X, it seems that it got deleted somehow.  To get the Messages app again (or any other pre-installed OS X app that is not available on the App Store), you will have to re-install OS X. The process does not erase any data.  Alternatively, if you know someone who has the same OS X, you could copy codeMessages.app/code from their machine and paste it in your Applications folder.  <comment301440> Have you verified that `Messages.app` is completely not present in your `/Applications` folder? If it is there, then your problem is only with your Spotlight index. <comment301441> Yes, I have @NetherLinks <comment301442> I'll edit my post
