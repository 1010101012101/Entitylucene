Xcode Beta "Verifying Xcode.app" <body> I just installed Xcode beta, and when trying to open it, it stays on "Verifying Xcode.app" and does not proceed. Why is that? I have the latest OS X mavericks.   <answer177239> Open terminal and run below commands  precodecd /Applications xattr -d com.apple.quarantine Xcode.app /code/pre  This will bypass Gatekeeper in OS X and launch Xcode quickly.  <comment175234> You may try to get rid of extended attributes with: `xattr -cr /path/to/Xcode.app` <comment311023> This doesn't work for me as I don't have Xcode.app to begin with. I get: xattr: No such file: Xcode.app
