How to open .dmg file or install XCode on Windows? <body> I am mostly windows developer and had to step into iDevelopmentWorld.br Went to apple to get XCode, downloaded it, however file extension is code.dmg/code. Windows does not recognize it as executable and throws following dialog.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kaQ0Y.png" alt="enter image description here"   I am guessing that etherbr 1. I need some additional software to open it (like mounting an image).br orbr 2. code.dmg/code is not for windows but iOS and I am out of luck.  <answer189824> I figured that it's archive and extracted it with 7zip. However couldn't find any executables inside. My guess is I need to run code3.hfs/code but it's different question.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/VNXyY.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer189826> You can strongnot/strong install XCode on any version of Windows, it only runs on OS X.  <answer189840> https://blog.udemy.com/xcode-on-windows/  Check out that website, you can simulate Mac OS X on windows and therefore run Xcode  <comment225230> Xcode runs under OS X, buy a Mac. <comment225233> _.dmg_ files are an Apple Disk Image file and typically not needed to be accessed under Windows however [HFSExplorer](http://www.catacombae.org/hfsexplorer/) and [DMGExtractor](http://www.catacombae.org/dmgextractor/) can be helpful under Windows if needed. <comment225236> Not entirely true there's an option of installing Virtual OS X on Windows and go from there. http://lifehacker.com/5938332/how-to-run-mac-os-x-on-any-windows-pc-using-virtualbox <comment225237> Correct, I wouldn't call it running on Windows though in that case :-) <comment225239> @Matas Vaitkevicius, Installing OS X in a VM under Windows is not allow by its SLA and no company that produces a Type 2 Hypervisor officially supports installing OS X in a VM under anything other then OS X! <comment225243> Hacker News has a reasonable discussion about [using Xcode in a virtual environment](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9644773). Those who have tried, suggest buying a Mac. <comment225257> The [SLA](https://www.apple.com/legal/sla/) for OS X **does not allow** for it to be virtualized on non-Apple hardware!
