Automator workflow fails, doesn't find command cliclick <body> My question is similar to one asked here, but no answer given there helps in my case.  I'm seeking to use in Automator a shell script that can automate mouse clicks (the script is here).  In iTerm, I simply run the following:  precodecliclick w:500 c:843,509 w:500 c:1120,558 /code/pre  But from what I gather from reading around for a couple of hours, Automator doesn't know how to find the environment variable for that script.  In my .bash_profile file, it is set as:  precodeexport PATH="$HOME/.local/bin/cliclick/":$PATH /code/pre  I'm struggling to find the correct way to call this script into action in Automator. I've tried a number of variations on the following, in my "Run Shell Script" element in my Automator workflow:  precodeexport PATH="$HOME/.local/bin/cliclick/":$PATH cliclick w:500 c:843,509 w:500 c:1120,558 /code/pre  Everything I've tried ends in the error, "zsh:2:command not found:cliclick"  I've tried, without success:  precodePATH=/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin /code/pre  this:  precodeexport PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH /code/pre  this:  precodesource ~/.bash_profile /code/pre  and this:  precodeif [ -x /usr/libexec/path_helper ]; then eval `/usr/libexec/path_helper -s` fi if  [ -f "$HOME"/.profile ]; then source "$HOME"/.profile elif [ -f "$HOME"/.bash_profile ]; then source "$HOME"/.bash_profile elif [ -f "$HOME"/.bashrc ]; then source "$HOME"/.bashrc fi /code/pre  Can someone see where I'm going wrong? I'm very much a beginner, so please don't assume much knowledge on my part.  hr  POSTSCRIPT: I guess I'm in a bit of a mess here, as I just discovered that the command  precodecliclick w:500 c:843,509 w:500 c:1120,558 /code/pre  fails if I run it through Terminal (bash), though it works if I run it through iTerm (zsh). I don't know why, as it can only work in iTerm via the declaration in .bash_profile, which I thought should also make it work in Terminal.  On the other hand, in my Automator workflow, I do have /bin/zsh selected in "Run Shell Script", so I still face the issue of the command working in iTerm (where cliclick is being made available via .bash_profile), but not in Automator.  <comment279059> On my main problem, some users on the #zsh IRC channel helped me arrive to a solution. The correct path I needed to introduce the command is 'export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"'
