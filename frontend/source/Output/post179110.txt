iPhone 5 my iMessage doesn't work <body> I do not have a SIM card in my phone. Before my iMessage used to work even without a SIM card. But now it doesn't, why?  <answer179133> If you have reinstalled the operating system of Apple just decides to make another change I have not quite figured out yet, I often find myself needing to go in and reenable the iMessage and FaceTime feature. It is fairly straight forward  Go to SettingsMessages and turn off iMessage. Then go to FaceTime and turn off FaceTime. Restart your device. Turn iMessage and FaceTime back on.  <answer179136> Ensure you are "starting new conversations from" and "receive messages using" your email address and not a phone number. This is done in the messages settings panel in the settings app.   <comment212266> did you change the WiFi ?
