How can I hide my texts when my screen is locked? <body> I had that option before and the recent update messed all my settings up:( now I can't hide my texts. I don't want people at work seeing my texts. I have my phone locked but everyone still can read them. I also don't have the option hide preview which was there before!   <answer51065> In iOS 5, go to Settings  Notifications  Messages. Turn off 'View in Lock Screen'. It makes it so that iMessage/text message notifications don't show up on the lock screen.  <comment232918> I believe it actually says "Show Preview". So it should be Settings  Notification Center  Messages  Uncheck Show Preview
