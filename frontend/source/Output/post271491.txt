Is there way to show disk i/o read/writes per process in real time? <body> I am struggling to find out what process is eating away my Mac performance, and disk i/o is the culprit. Activity Monitor frequently shows megabytes of read/write, but unfortunately, it does not show the per process value (only total written by given process, which is useless).   Is there a way to find out?   iotop does not seem to work, because I am on Sierra, and SIP is enabled.  Thank You, Zsolt  <answer271529> iStat Menus  shows, among many many other things, disk activity by process. It is not free, but you can do a 14 day trial.   <comment341304> Wasn't this free at some point?
