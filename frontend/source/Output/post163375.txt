Script Editor crashing when running Applescript <body> I need to extract the phone number of all the contacts in a particular group and for that I am using the following code -  precodeon run {input, parameters}       tell application "Contacts"         set thePeople to every person         repeat with i from 1 to number of items in thePeople             set this_person to item i of thePeople             set inGroup to name of group of this_person             if inGroup is "Technology" then                 set x to properties of phones of this_person             end if         end repeat     end tell end run /code/pre  But whenever I run the code, the script editor crashes and asks me to reopen it even though I have only one contact in that group. What's happening here?  <answer163380> Try:  precodetell application "Contacts"     set inGroup to first group whose name = "Technology"     set phoneProps to properties of phones of inGroup's people end tell /code/pre  <comment191251> did you test it with 'try' just to see if the behaviour is different? <comment191255> Can you elaborate? I am new to AppleScript. +Tetsujin <comment191256> you can isolate any part of an applescript so it attempts & doesn't error if it fails. Similar syntax to an if/end if, starts 'try' ends with 'end try'. Anything in between won't halt on error. May not work, but might allow you to hone down the problem section <comment191276> How do I retrieve only the phone number as an output instead of the label, class etc. <comment191291> set phoneProps to value of phones of inGroup's people <comment191292> is the result a string? @aday <comment191294> No, a list of lists. <comment191296> The element inside the lists? What type? <comment191297> The value itself is a string
