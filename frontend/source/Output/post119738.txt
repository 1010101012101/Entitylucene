How to sync 30 days of mail in the mail app? <body> I find managing multiple browser windows on OSX a real pain with no solution, so I decided to get rid of some tabs.   I loaded up gmail into the OSX Mail client, but it wants to sync my entire account. Is it possible to sync only new stuff? Basically I want it to only sync the last 30 days and not everything...  It's trying to sync about 6gb worth of mail...  <answer119740> You can't do this in the OS X Mail client. Mail.app will download all your emails available on the server.  The workaround is to make the change emon the server/em. You mention that you have Gmail, therefore you can go to Gmail's IMAP settings and restrict the amount of emails available (for example, the most recent 1000).  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YJFlh.png" width="500" title="Folder Size Limits"  Also, you can exclude labels from being visible to IMAP, therefore Mail won't download the contents.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vWVVY.png" width="120"  <comment194917> This won't affect what's stored in Gmail, only what's visible to Apple Mail, right? <comment194918> @Szabolcs True; you make the change in Gmail settings but it only affects IMAP clients like Mail.app. <comment227935> Now this is a good tip!
