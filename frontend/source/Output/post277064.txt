Disable macOS banner notifications for Time Machine <body> I am trying to find out how (I'm assuming in terminal) to disable the macOS notification that slide out on either Failed backups or "time machine hasn't backed up in x days" without turning off Time Machine altogether. I manage about 10 machines remotely for an office, and have found a third-party application, "tmnotifier" that will remotely monitor and alert me when Time Machine backups have failed".  This is mostly due to the NetGear NAS that all the macs back up to. They seem to be inconsistent in their success/fail ratio, and I would rather not end-users see "failed" notifications once every couple of weeks.  That way, I can check in to see what's going on without distracting users from their work day.
