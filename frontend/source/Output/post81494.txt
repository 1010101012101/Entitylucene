Non-recursive spotlight search? <body> When using the Spotlight search at the top right of a finder window, I often want the search to be non-recursive, i.e. only look at files in that specific directory, not any directories within it. Is this possible?  <answer81606> As far as I know, unfortunately it's not possible to do this.  Strangely, I also set the 'Document Container' criteria within Spotlight and it wouldn't show any results at all.  This is extremely poor behaviour, I agree. You can give Apple feedback on OS X (from which you can post feedback on Spotlight) here.  <answer81623> The command-line interface to Spotlight, mdfind, has no such capability.  (There is an code-onlyin/code flag but empirically it's recursive.)  Since it's extremely unlikely that the Finder would have more capability than the command-line interface, I think it's safe to say that this is not possible.  Sorry.  That does sound like it would be a very useful feature.  <answer106020> Not a solution for using the graphical interface, but i've started using the following in terminal to get the desired effect:  codemdfind FOO | grep $PWD | grep -v ^$PWD/.*/.*$/code  <answer248623> You can always just move the folders, perform a search, then move them back.  The other answers are probably better and easier to use then this method, however.
