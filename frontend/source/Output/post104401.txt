Can iOS' builtin dictionary be accessed/browsed as an independent app? <body> If you select some text in whatever application, there's a "define" option that will open a builtin dictionary screen:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4FFYa.png" alt="Dictionary Screenshot"  Can this dictionary be accessed/browsed? As in, an actual application?  iOS 6.0  <answer122027> There used to be a nice little app (that luckily I still have) that did exactly that: let you search for definitions directly. It was called Dictionary+, Apple removed it reportedly for violating the codeUIReferenceLibraryViewController/code terms of use)  There's a replacement open source app that you can build, sign and install it manually, I haven't tried it, though: https://github.com/josh-/DictionaryPlusPlus  <comment123032> Somebody could make a jailbreak app for it for sure, and as I'm not sure how it's implemented, somebody might be able to make a normal app that does it (albeit, it wouldn't get accepted into the App Store). <comment142366> While this link may answer the question, it is better to include the essential parts of the answer here and provide the link for reference.  Link-only answers can become invalid if the linked page changes. <comment142421> I added a few notes, but really OP was asking for an app and I linked to that app. The link **is** the essential part of the answer.
