How do I set my Logitech harmony remote to control my Apple TV? <body> I know I can teach the Apple TV to "learn" a 3rd party remote, but thats not what I'm looking for.      I want to add the Apple TV as a device, and I know it's possible, but I don't know where to find the right device in the harmony menus.   I know it's possible, as i know others who have done it in the past, but am no longer in touch with them.    Anyone know how to do it?  <answer68302> I believe the correct setting is found in the following location  precodeComputer-&gt; Media Center PC -&gt; Apple -&gt; Apple TV /code/pre  <answer270865> Type in the model number as well example: Apple/TV3  <comment349908> This worked for me!
