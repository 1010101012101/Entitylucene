Mac Won't Remember Hostname in Terminal After Reboot, gives 'unknown...' <body> I'm trying to set my hostname for my mac.  Currently it's codeunknown002374e31ebd/code.  I've tried setting it with  precodesudo hostname -s Steve-Mac /code/pre  Which will work for all future terminal sessions.  However, if I restart, it goes back to codeunknown/code  How can I get it to keep this setting?  <answer90281> Setting the hostname via the Terminal is not permanent.  From the hostname manpage:     DESCRIPTIONbr   The hostname utility prints the name of the current host. The super-user can set the hostname by supplying an argument. To keep the hostname between reboots, run `scutil --set HostName name-of-host'.   Alternatively, set the hostname in your System Preferences, under the Sharing section.  <answer90285> Fastest way is to setup it in System Preferences - Sharing (unlock screen by clicking padlock on bottom) and then change name and Apply.  <comment105972> Additionally, `-s` does not stand for "set". Also from the manpage: `-s    Trim off any domain information from the printed name.` <comment137114> in my version of scutil, `-s` doesn't stand for anything, I get the following error when I try to run `scutil -s HostName Foobar`: `scutil: invalid option -- s` <comment137311> I was talking about `hostname -s` not meaning what OP thought it meant. Indeed, `scutil` doesn't have a `-s` option.
