Possible to use cellular while Airplay mirroring video apps with Apple TV? <body> I'm wondering if it is possible to have an iPad on cellular and an Apple TV, and to use Airplay mirroring to have the screen of the iPad show up on the TV.   I do have a router I could use for it, but it will not have internet access. I would want the iPad to use the cellular connection to get all data, then have the audio and video from the iPad come out of the TV. I know this portion is possible using a static IP setting for Wi-Fi if I have a router as it says at:  Can I use 4G LTE (Cellular Data) and Airplay using Wifi w/ No Internet connection at the same time?  However, in that same exchange, it says YouTube/Netflix would not work. Is this the case or is there a work around at all? Having the Apple TV use a hotspot or another connection isn't really an option. Could anyone point me in the right direction?
