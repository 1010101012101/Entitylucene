Can I disable all the specific service in macOS's Safari? <body> I want to disable all the specific service disabled in China (e.g. embedded Google Map, embedded tweets in Twitter) because it make a load of a page insuffarbly slower, even though these embedded service are not essential to use the main functionality in the page.  For example, suppose that you want to calculate the distance between two airports and access to such a page in China. Now you get the noticeably slow response. Inspecting it from Developer Console, I found that it was Google Maps that made it so slow.  So can I disable these service in my entire browser, not on a specific page?
