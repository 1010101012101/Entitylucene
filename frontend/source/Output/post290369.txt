Setting the default startup disk from Windows without Bootcamp <body> With the Bootcamp tools/drivers installed in Windows, you have the ability to set the startup disk from the Bootcamp app in your systray. If you don't have Bootcamp drivers installed though, is it possible to change the default boot disk via another approach?  I have an unflashed PC graphics card in my Mac Pro, so holding Option to get the boot manager on startup is also not an option, because you can't see the boot screen on power on.   Switching when booted in MacOS is easy via the Startup Disk in the System Prefs, but how can you switch back to MacOS from Windows without Bootcamp utils?  This is on a 2008 Mac Pro, dual 2.8 Xeons.  <comment366552> Not sure it's possible - one reason to hang onto your old graphics card... have you tried installing the BC drivers separately? https://support.apple.com/HT204923 <comment366595> I've left the original card in just so I can swap over the monitor to get to the boot screen if needed. I've tried down loading the BC camp drivers using the "Download the latest Windows support software" option in Bootcamp to a flash drive, but when I try to install then in Windows 10, the error is "This version of Bootcamp is not intended for this computer model" error (I think that's the one, I'd have to try it again to be sure) <comment366612> Ah, an 08 - no, Win10 isn't supported, so no drivers exist, unfortunately. I've never personally tried Win10 on an 08, I have 08 & 2010 here, with Win7 on BC. For Win10 I use Parallels instead. A long shot, make a Win7 BC on a spare drive & see if you can force it that way. <comment366676> Oh well. The plus is that Windows 10 installed from DVD fine and runs great, and I (apart from the Startup Disk selection) I don't seem to be missing drivers for anything (Ethernet, mouse, keyboard all work fine)
