Smart Mailbox and Any Recipient rule not working <body> I've had a few smart mailboxes in Apple Mail which have worked fine so far, but I've noticed some odd behaviour lately (which may or may not have been there before).  Mailbox rules:  ul liDate received - is today/li liAccount - [my work mail account]/li liAny recipient - contains [my work e-mail address]/li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/i9pGT.png" alt="Mailbox definition"  The idea is to have a smart mailbox which shows all emails I received today (sent to me, not a mailing list of which I'm part of). The account is an Exchange mailbox.  This works without fault as long as I am the emsingle/em recipient. As soon as the mail in question is addressed to multiple people (all in codeTo/code), Apple Mail decides that it doesn't meet the mailbox criteria. I can't figure out why it decides to leave those messages out. Is there something I can check or can I define the criteria in a different way so it would work?  FYI: OS X Yosemite version 10.10.5 on a MacBook Pro (15", mid 2012).  <comment242124> Just a guess... any different with recipient **is** rather than contains? <comment242292> @Tetsujin Same results actually. <comment242293> ah, ok - was just an outside chance <comment244627> I can reproduce this problem on my system. Unfortunately, I can't find a workaround. <comment304242> I just realized that this is still an issue with Mail.app 9.3 on OS X 10.11.5 El Capitan. Since I wasn't able to find a workaround either, I decided to file a radar on https://bugreport.apple.com (issue #27437956).
