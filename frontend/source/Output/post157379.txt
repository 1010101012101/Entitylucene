Can't start xcode - stuck on installing state <body> I was tring to upgrade xcode because it didn't let me upload to apps to itune.  now it's stuck in installing state (few hours) and doesn't start:  precodeXcode is being updated  Xcode can not be opened while it is being updated. /code/pre  what do to?  <answer157437> codesudo rm -rf /Applications/Xcode.app/code should wipe it out, then you can re-install from the App Store. But do make sure it's not actually updating first. It's a multi-gigabyte download so can take a while (yes, even hours, depending on your internet speed.) Opening Launchpad will show a progress bar if it's in the middle of doing something.  <answer157458> There is a small progress bar under Lanchpad (in the lower icon bar).  wait for it to end.  <answer157465> In launch pad hold the Xcode icon until the X appears and click the X to delete Xcode then go back go back to the app store and get a fresh copy.  <answer209491> I had a similar problem but posting here in case someone found this link through Google like I did.  Xcode was not installing because I was not logged in to my account (it was a new computer).  If you need to uninstall a previous version though, you can run this in the terminal  precodesudo rm -rf /Applications/Xcode.app /code/pre  and then close out the App store, open it back up, log in, then try again, you can then see the progress under the launchpad icon.   <answer215876> Sometimes, a simple restart can solve this.  <answer225649> Download a fresh copy from Apple's download page  <answer237107> Everything is much more simple... open AppStore and click on the "Store" in the top-left menu and choose the following option - "Check for Unfinished Downloads...". Enter your Apple ID and password and you everything will be up and running.  The reason is that XCode does require additional confirmation before download.  Hope that helps.  <comment185088> Can you delete it and reinstall? <comment237764> I couldn't believe how long it took (and was "stuck" at the end for 60% of it) but waiting it out was all it took (wait time: 2.5 hours on 2013 MacBook Air) <comment252702> This will not even begin to load for me on this new computer I was given. <comment260458> How can it possibly take so long. I guess VS also takes a long time, but it is more like an hour vs 2.5 hrs. <comment303307> This would be better as a comment
