Emailing pics from icloud photostream <body> I'm afraid I'm not very wised up technically.  I have taken pics on my ipad.  They have synced to my pc, in the icloud photostream, where I can view them.  I want to attach some of them to an email, using my normal email service.  Can I do that?  <answer139688> You can view them in iPhoto  !   In the left column there should be an item "Photostream" if you synced your account with the iCloud account.    <comment164660> Did you install the iCloud stuff on your PC? You will be able to open Photostream as a folder.
