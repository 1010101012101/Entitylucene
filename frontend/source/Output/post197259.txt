iCloud delete and remove device and photos <body> Inexplicably I wasn't able to enter my 4 digit password on my iPhone anymore. I tried so many times that my iPhone was deactivated.br I powered off my iPhone and restarted it, but no chance.br Afterwards I asked to delete my iPhone from iCloud.com, but first I requested to erase the phone.br What happens to my iPhone if I've erase my iPhone via iCloud ("Find my Phone") and afterwards I also delete my iPhone from my iCloud account?. Does the request to delete my iPhone still apply?  <answer197274> Yes, the iPhone will still be erased - when you start your iPhone you'll be asked to set it up again as a new one.
