How can I install and run R on an iPad? <body> I teach a class that uses R as part of the lab and one of my students uses an iPad for her primary computer.  Is there anyway to install R on an iPad?  I found some old blog posts that say it isn't possible but I have not been able to find any information less than about 5 years old.  <answer224401> It's actually pretty simple, in that, if it is not in the app store it can't be installed, unless you want to go the jailbreak route because you found an "R" app for jailbroken IOS devices.  <answer224445> Let her try this site: TutorialsPoint, where she can use R or R-Studio.  Also, this RollApp may be the answer.  <answer224447> If you have an internet connection, one thing you could do is use the website DataJoy (from the makers of ShareLaTeX), which is basically an online (collaborative) editor for both Python and R. However, DataJay is not free. There is a 7-day free trial, but it normally costs $20 per month (at the time of writing). That being said, it is possible to get a half-price academic discount so that it would only be $10 per month.  <answer280928> There is an app called Analyser by You Hui Yan available on the App Store ($14.95) which includes a R interpreter as well as a Python interpreter. The codeinstall.packages()/code is disabled (per Apple's requirements), but a fairly broad number of libraries are included. The last update was in 2017, so it is still active.  <answer283572> Also you can download an ios app from the appstore to connect via ssh to another machine in your network with R already installed  <answer285154> I setup Rstudio on Win10 with Amazon's workspaces. The cost is reasonable at 7.95/mo and 22 cents/hr of use for the basic tier. There is an Amazon Workspaces iOS app that actually seems to be usable.  I am not that interested in programming on my iPad. I am more interested in running programs and seeing the output. This definitely is feasible with Amazon Workspaces. But programming might actually be feasible. YMMV.  <comment272367> Worth additionally pointing out that ShareLaTeX alone has support for the LaTeX `knitr` package, so if she's already on ShareLaTeX there's no need to create an additional account... Although as I recall the way `knitr` decides to place generated plot images is kinda screwy (not that hard to figure out, but it is a bit annoying). <comment272374> @ParthianShot As far as I'm aware, it's not possible to use a ShareLaTeX account with DataJoy. So you would need to create an additional account. <comment272493> Well, what I'm saying is that ShareLaTeX alone has support for a LaTeX package that runs R code and saves the output. The package is called `knitr`. <comment273318> @ParthianShot Ah, I see. I misunderstood. That's a good point. Thanks! `:)` <comment353586> Scroll through the description. The author talks about the python engine before the r engine. Can't use install.packages but you can use source() and iTunes file sharing as well as read.table() with url's <comment371282> @user3674944 is correct, you can't use install.packages(). That is an Apple-imposed limitation. However  you can use iTunes File Sharing, iMazing, and iFunBox to add files into the Documents directory and any sub-directories you happen to create. Also library() works just fine as do functions like readRDS() and lazyLoad().  Apple's restrictions (see 2.5.2 in the guidelines) prohibit the addition of compiled code. There is no restriction on, say, serialized database (*.rdx) files.    The recent update has added many common packages, including the tidyverse.
