Where to find ARM GCC compiler in XCODE5? <body> I am trying to run kivy on Mac and it relies on my Xcode arm gcc compiler.  I already tryied to answer this question in a stackoverflow question but here I we again...   Where to find the strongarm apple llvm gcc/strong compiler in the new XCode 5?   <answer102867> Apple stopped shipping gcc with Xcode.  The clang compiler presents itself as gcc (technically I believe it's an llvm front end that respects many gcc flags) when you install Xcode from the Mac App Store:  precodeMac:~ me$ xcrun --find gcc /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/usr/bin/gcc Mac:~ me$ `xcrun --find gcc` --version Configured with: --prefix=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/usr --with-gxx-include-dir=/usr/include/c++/4.2.1 Apple LLVM version 5.0 (clang-500.2.76) (based on LLVM 3.3svn) Target: x86_64-apple-darwin12.5.0 Thread model: posix /code/pre  If you need a different compiler, you'll likely need to download it elsewhere or build it from source.  <comment121131> But does it compile for ARM platform or only for x86_64? <comment121135> As far as this site goes - that's the compiler with Xcode and we don't get into code level details. Also, kivy should ship with everything you need - http://kivy.org/docs/installation/installation-macosx.html <comment121136> In case my pointing out the gcc that ships with Xcode isn't what you seek, what is it that you are really trying to do? <comment121138> The thing is: XCode 4.x used to come with the LLVM GCC compiler. BUT Xcode5 does not contain it, according to the [Apple website](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/DeveloperTools/Conceptual/WhatsNewXcode/Articles/xcode_5_0.html). So how to install or point to a gcc compiler (in my case, one that compiles for ARM platform)?? I alrady added this issue to the [kivy ios github page](https://github.com/kivy/kivy-ios/issues/62)
