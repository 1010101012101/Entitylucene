Syncing iPhone to a new PC under a different iTunes account <body> I want to start using a different PC to sync my iPhone, this is so that I can retire my iPod (Nano 2nd gen) &amp; transfer all my music to my iPhone:  I have 2 email addresses and AppleIDs: "Work" (me@company.com) &amp; "Home" (me@gmail.com).  My company iPhone (7 Plus):br App purchases made using "Home" AppleID.br iCloud backups made using "Home" AppleID (from Settings page).br iTunes and App Stores using "Home" AppleID (from Settings page).br When backing up to the PC, iTunes shows my account as "Work" (the account I originally used to set up my 3GS).  My PC at home (used with iPad and iPod):br AppleID of "Home" used for everything.  I already make music purchases on my iPhone (under "Home" account), then they're downloaded and transferred to my iPod when I sync it.  Can I start using my home PC to sync and backup my iPhone, are there any pitfalls etc.., such as:br Will non-iTunes music transfer to my iPhone (CD-ripped)?
