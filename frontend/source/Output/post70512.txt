How to use fn-key (function keys) with an external keyboard that has no fn-key? <body> I am using Lion on a late 2009 13 inch MacBook, with external monitor and an external Apple Keyboard with numeric keypad - German (MB110D/B) while keeping the MacBook lid closed.  Some of the applications I run use the F-keys. This works fine for kbdF5/kbd and kbdF6/kbd but the other key are used for things like muting and so on.  There is an option in the preferences to use the kbdfn/kbd-key in combination with the F-key. Unfortunately the keyboard I am using has no kbdfn/kbd-key. Any ideas?  <comment81870> The question has already been answered before: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/24758/how-do-i-map-a-key-on-the-a1048-109-key-keyboard-to-provide-an-fn-button
