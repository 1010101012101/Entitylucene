Transfer SSD from MBP 2009 to MBP 2012 <body> I'm upgrading from a MBP 2009 to MBP 2012. I installed a SSD drive on the 2009 unit. A few days ago, I got the black screen of death due to the logic board failing. I back up every 30 days using Time Machine, but was on day 27 or so, which means I need to capture many work days of files; etc.   How do I swap out the 750GB HDD in the 2012 for the SDD in my 2009 with my 2009 not booting up?  Thanks, Scott  <answer198858> There's a great website for repair guides called: iFixit
