Force Chrome to use OS X notifications? <body> I'd like to find a way to use OS X native notifications instead of the Chrome notifications.  I have read something about using a Growl extension and then redirect Growl to OS X Notifications Center using Hiss app, but I never used Growl and for what I've read seems like it was used only on old versions of OS X.  Is there any way?  <answer228165> The short answer to this is strongemNo/em/strong  In order for Chrome to send an alert to OS X's notification center, an API call must be initiated - from the browser to OS X.  Technically, an add-on could be developed that would address this, however, Google seems to have left open the idea that they would be bring this feature to fruition.  Chrome's notification center is the latest casualty in the war against browser bloat  Unfortunately, this is just something we are going to have to wait for.  <answer231922> You can now go to chrome://flags and enable "Enable native notifications. Mac", and it works as it should.  <answer246072> Yes you can with this experimental feature. Open codechrome://flags/#enable-native-notifications/code to enable the feature, then restart Chrome.  <answer280616> I'm adding an answer here because now Chrome on macOS uses by default the native notifications system. You don't have to perform any specific action anymore.  <comment283298> Consider adding some details to this post to make it more helpful. <comment283311> sound similar to http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/178218/is-there-a-way-to-send-google-notifications-to-the-mac-os-x-notification-center <comment303350> Yes it wasn't available at the time of this question was posted.
