Applescript (PDF to iTunes): How to extract and/or write metadata with special characters? Help please :-) <body> strongINTRODUCTION/strong  Hello there,  Like always, I want to put in front that I'm not a script expert. I'm not even a basic coder. I just try to learn, little by little about coding when I have these challenges. Please be through enough for a Dummy!  strongPRECEDENT/strong  I need to transfer the metadata information of the author of a PDF book to the Author tag in my iTunes library.  (Yes! I got rid of iBooks and got back Books in iTunes)  Recently here in this site, with the help of one of the members I got a script problem solved. Or sort of.  strongTHE PROBLEM/strong  I say sort of, because even when the script will do the task flawlessly if no special character is in the name, the script has a huge limitation: It won't read, write or both, text containing special characters.  strongEXAMPLE:/strong  Mercé Lamás del Jagüey Nuñez   embecomes in iTunes/em  Merce\U0301 Lama\U0301s del Jagu\U0308ey Nun\U0303ez-  I appreciate your help to find a solution. I need to automate this task to properly curate the +4000 PDF books in my iTunes library.  Thank you!  strongSCRIPT IN DEVELOPMENT/strong  precodetell application "iTunes"  set sel to the selection  if sel is {} then display dialog "Please select something" buttons {"Cancel"}  repeat with i from 1 to count of sel      set the_track to item i of sel      set the_posix_path to POSIX path of (location of the_track as alias)      set authorfield to paragraph 2 of (do shell script "mdls -name kMDItemAuthors " &amp; quoted form of the_posix_path &amp; "|  awk -F\\\" '{print $2'}")      set artist of the_track to (authorfield &amp; "-") as string end repeat   end tell /code/pre  strongGRAPHIC/strong  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9qxUV.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer181554> You can use perl to convert escaped unicode character from ASCII text :  precodetell application "iTunes"     set sel to the selection     if sel is {} then display dialog "Please select something" buttons {"Cancel"}     set tc to count sel     repeat with i from 1 to tc         tell (get item i of sel)             set loc to location             set authorfield to my getAuthors(loc)             if authorfield is not "" then set artist to authorfield &amp; "-"         end tell     end repeat end tell  on getAuthors(f)     do shell script "mdls -name kMDItemAuthors  " &amp; (quoted form of POSIX path of f) &amp; " | /usr/bin/perl -ne 'if (m/^ /) {s/^ +[\"]?|\"$//g;s/\\\\u([[:xdigit:]]{1,4})/chr(eval(\"0x$1\"))/egi;print}' " end getAuthors /code/pre  Or python :  precodedo shell script "export PYTHONIOENCODING=UTF-8; /usr/bin/python -c 'import sys; print (sys.argv[1].replace(\"\\U\",\"\\u\").decode(\"unicode-escape\"))' \"$(mdls -name kMDItemAuthors  " &amp; (quoted form of POSIX path of f) &amp; " |  sed -nE 's/\"$//;s/^ +[\"]?//p')\"" /code/pre  <answer181611> At the end of your script, replace "as string" with "as Unicode string". And try. If this does not solve your problem, try with "as Unicode text".  <comment215991> Ah, the beauty of an AppleScript perverted by these barbaric Unix commands! I hope there is another solution. <comment216041> "as Unicode string" formula not even pass the compiler attempt: "Expected class name but found identifier."---the "as Unicode text" passes compilation but gives the same bad result: "Merce\U0301 Lama\U0301s del Jagu\U0308ey Nun\U0303ez-" <comment216042> Purist or not that solution works like a charm in both alternatives! <comment216043> @jackjr300: Wow! Thank you so much pal! Both, mdls and python flavors work perfectly! I really appreciate! You made my day. I can process my +4000 pdf books in iTunes library flawlessly and in almost no time. Thank you so much! <comment250431> @Jostma - What "both alternatives"? <comment250432> @Jostma - So reading and writing work but incorrectly? In your question, you say that reading and writing do not work. I don't understand.
