Unable to do a partial screen recording on OSX with quicktime <body> I am using multi-screen: I am using the primary screen of my MBP plus two external monitors via displayport  When I start the screen recording, it is the message I see on my screen  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Kp9BS.png" alt="enter image description here"  I go on to select an area for recording  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/UZzU9.png" alt="enter image description here"  It is where I get stuck: there is simply no way I can start the recording after the selection. I clicked, tried to access the Quicktime app, tried some key combination. But nothing will get the recording to start.  How can I start a the screen recording for part of the screen?  <answer183339> You can record a selected area of your screen as follows:  ul liOpen the codeQuicktime Player/code app/li liChoose codeFile/code - codeNew Screen Recording/code or kbdCtrl/kbdkbdCommand/kbdkbdN/kbd/li liNow select the area you want to record/li liPress the button in the middle of you selected area that states: codeStart recording/code/li liTo stop, there will be a squared stop button that appears in the menu bar/li /ul  emAs your screenshot is missing this button, you might want te restart codeQuicktime Player/code or reboot your machine./em  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mbvdQ.png" alt="Start Screen Recording"  <answer183340> As soon as you drag the square, a button should appear in the centre of that area.br Click to Start.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2C0Fs.png" alt="enter image description here"  To Stop, there will be a button that appears in the menu bar  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/I0LZ0.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer272747> I had this same problem, it was caused by trying to drag the quicktime window between spaces. Instead, it needs to be re-assigned via the dock icon (Right Click - Options - Assign to This Desktop).  <comment218511> And you just beat me to it. :) <comment218512> :-) almost a photo-finish <comment243321> I'm having this problem too. The "Start Recording" button just does not show up. I'm also using multiple monitors. It seems that this problem is related to multiple monitors.
