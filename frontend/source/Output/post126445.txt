help removing installmac malware <body> In a moment of stupidity I installed a program on my OS X 10.8.5 that was suppose to turn my Iphone into a remote for my powerbook.  I was gifted with this hijacker app SearchInstallmac  I've read a lot about it, removed all the files I can find. The list of files I have deleted are found here:  https://discussions.apple.com/thread/5091234?start=30&amp;tstart=0  and  here  http://www.thesafemac.com/arg-genieo/  My Chrome Browser is still trying to re-direct to the malware site.  I have cookies blocked and so it can't redirect but I'd love to remove it completely.   I'm I missing something or a file that still needs to be deleted?  Do I need to reinstall Chrome?   <answer126446> I would head straight to sophos where they provide free virus and malware scanning software as well as removal tools.  ul lihttp://www.sophos.com/en-us/products/free-tools/sophos-antivirus-for-mac-home-edition.aspx/li /ul  Their product is quite well vetted and used by enterprise and many organizational IT departments. Worst case, you could reboot your Mac into recovery mode and install a fresh OS onto a USB drive and then install the cleaning software there, but from what you've listed a decent tool might clean things up with little muss or fuss.  <comment148174> (+1) for the muss or fuss <comment148351> Thanks so much for your suggestion. The antivirus software my IT department has running on my system didn't catch this nasty bug, but Sophos did.
