When I try to move the folder, the copying process begins <body> Why, when I move (using mouse) one folder into another, instead of moving, copying process starts? How to fix it?  OS X El Capitanbr Folders are located on an external drive, GUID partition scheme, connected via USB.  <answer229118> Hold the kbd Cmd âŒ˜ /kbd key as you drag.br This will reverse the default behaviour of 'move to same drive, copy to another'  <comment279433> Thank you very much, it helped! Why this problem occurs when I move some folders, and does not happen with others? Is it possible to somehow set up this default behaviour  for all of them? <comment279434> It should only try to copy if you are moving data between partitions. If it is to the same partition it will move. There is no way I know of to change that behaviour [which is a very sensible default] <comment279437> I see ... it's strange, because these folders are located on the same drive, they may still be in different partitions? <comment279440> possibly - you'd have to look at the partition map in Disk Utility to know for certain <comment279443> Ok , thank you!
