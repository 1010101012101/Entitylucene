Extracting the created/expiration dates from signing certs in the keychain <body> I'm trying to automate the process of creating provisioning profiles, but we want to verify that the certificates in the Dev Portal also exist on the machine.  Given the info we receive from the Dev Portal, it looks like the created/expiration dates might be the best comparison.  However, I've looked through the codesecurity/code command line tool's documentation (https://developer.apple.com/legacy/library/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/security.1.html) and can't seem to find a way to extract the dates.  The best I can do is dump all certificates matching a name, via codesecurity find-certificate -a -c "name of the cert"/code. I'm unsure how to extract further info.
