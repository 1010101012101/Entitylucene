How to force purging of cached files, to keep from running out of application memory? <body> After reading a couple helpful threads on this forum, I was able to figure out why my Mac started being non-responsive despite having 32GB of RAM, and almost nothing open.  Despite using only 4GB-ish of RAM for applications, my Mac had almost 28GB of cached files.  Since the system stops being responsive once it hits that point, I decided to take this PrintScreen a bit before I run out.  How do I clear the cached files from RAM, to make sure I don't run out of memory when I'm using practically nothing?  p.s., I have more than 1TB of available HDD space-- so it's not failing to store swap files.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/iPGCW.png" alt="enter image description here" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/XLRdd.png" alt="Memory usage"  <comment366958> What is your computerâ€™s uptime? It might be time for a restart to discard or save those files... <comment367029> Uptime was about 4 days.  How do I find out what "those files" are, and how can I discard or save them?
