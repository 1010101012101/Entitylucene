Cannot reclaim partition as free space <body> I'm trying to reclaim some free space for my main SSD but I'm having problem, the disk utility won't let me expand.  Btw I checked for core storage and it said there wasn't any. I can't use TimeMachine it seems to invalidate loads of licences on many of my programs which is a huge hassle.  Here's a screenshot of my problem, what do i do?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2Vddj.png" alt="Partition Image"  <comment226802> Could you edit the post to show `sudo gpt show disk0` and `diskutil list disk0`? The graphical tool doesn't allow diagnosis of the issue, only confirmation that you have one.
