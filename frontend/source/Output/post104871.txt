Prevent mounting of a specific volume when connecting an external drive <body> I've got an external drive with 3 volumes on it. All of them are mounted upon connecting the external drive to my Mac.  I want one of these 3 volumes to not be mounted when I connect it. Is that somehow possible?  <comment123385> It is a duplicate.
