Xcode wants to access DeviceManager in your keychain and tells me to add Spotify to Accessibility <body> Every now and again (when I plug my iPhone into my Mac with Xcode open), I get the following dialog:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6rjTd.jpg" width="439"  The only problem is when I click 'Allow' or 'Allways allow', it pops up with this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GykBp.jpg" width="450"  Should I trust this? Why does Spotify needto be in accsessability when Xcode needs to accsess 'com.apple.dt.XcodeDeviceMonitor' in my keychain? What should I do about it?  <comment338904> To take a screenshot of a window, after ⇧⌘4, press space, then click on a window (or ⌥-click to screenshot without shadow). <comment338929> @grgarside I didnt think that worked with popup alerts.
