Mac Air won't login into admin account after 'Restore MacOS' and takes me to 'Other' account login page <body> I couldn't access my admin account on Mac, so I pressed cmd + R to use Disk Utility. However, when I selected the internal hard drives-my Mac hard drive, I couldn't see an option to Repair the disc. So, I chose Restore MacOS option. Now, the login page comes and after I enter the password, the boot gets stuck at the end and suddenly shifts to an account named 'Other' and asks for Name and Password. I don't have 'Guest' or 'Other' account set up. Please tell me any way I can override this and get in my account. Thank you!
