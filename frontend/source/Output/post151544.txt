Can't open files after changing username <body> I use OS X Mavericks 10.9.4.  I changed my username and this may have caused that I am not able to open any files. I still can see my PDFs and photos in Preview! I get this:     File XYZ couldn’t be opened because you don’t have permission to view it.   I have tried to run Repair Permissions in Disk Utility but that didn't help. I tried manually codechmod/code files but didn't have a permission to do that.  The strangest thing is that I can see my photos in Preview but when I open them I get the error.  The files are not locked. The folder is not locked too and in permissions tab I can see my username "Lukas (Me)" as "Read Write" access.  <answer151548> Make sure that all the permissions are correct on your home folder.br You can use the ACL tool on the Recovery HD to do this:  ol liBoot into the Recovery HD using ⌘R./li liRun coderesetpassword/code in Terminal (available from Utilities → Terminal)./li liSelect your account from the drop-down list./li liClick the Reset button for strongReset Home Directory Permissions and ACLs/strong./li /ol  <answer151553> I have launched Disk Utility once restarted my computer and then did codeRepair permissions/code and it worked.
