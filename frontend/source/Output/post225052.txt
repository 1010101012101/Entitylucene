Is there an option to inspect live variable data like in Visual studio? <body> When I set break points in Visual Studio, I can inspect variables to see what they are set too: int's, string's, array's, etc..  Is there an option similar in XCode to help with debugging?  <answer225054> Yes - open Xcode's help and search for strongDebugging with Xcode/strong - there are links to WWDC videos, and ample documentation to get you going.
