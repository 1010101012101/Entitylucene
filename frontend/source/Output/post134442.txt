How do I move an app? <body> I have several apps on my iPod touch (5th generation) that I would like to move from their current place on screen to a different place on screen. Is there any way to do this? If so, how?  <answer134443> Put your finger on the app and hold there. The app will start wobbling and have a cross in a circle at the top left.   Then drag it to where you want. If you hit the cross it will delete the app.
