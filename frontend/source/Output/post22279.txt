iPhone data connection types <body> Just curious — could anyone explain the exact meaning of all the connection type symbols in iPhone?  Let's see, strongwifi/strong and strong3G/strong, the fastest connection types, are quite clear, but how about the others: strongE/strong is probably for EDGE (aka EGPRS), but what does the circle (strongO/strong) mean? (2G something? GPRS? Or is the latter a higher-level concept in mobile data transfer?) EDGE is presumably the better of these two? (In practice I haven't noticed great difference as both are much slower than 3G.)   Finally, how do UMTS or W-CDMA fit in this picture? And if EDGE is a 3G technology too (as stated in Wikipedia), what kind of 3G technology exactly does iPhone's "3G" refer to?  (Also, please correct me if there are more than the four types I could remember.)  <answer22281> On GSM (All but Verizon/Sprint):  ul li4G = LTE (or HSPA+ on AT&amp;T)/li li3G = UTMS/HSDPA/li liE = EDGE  /li lio = GPRS/li /ul  On CDMA (Verizon or Sprint in the USA):  ul li4G = LTE/li li3G = EV-DO/li liE = no equivalent - not possible  /li lio = 1xRTT/li /ul  <answer22282> The circle is GPRS, and UMTS or W-CDMA are technologies that make up 3G. Edge is not a 3G connection, it is a 2G connection.  <answer22283> From Apple's online iPhone How To: Status icons  <comment24658> Thanks for the authoritative reference! (To me it seems to be page *14* in the PDF.) Meaning of GPRS still isn't perfectly clear as Wikipedia says it's available in 2G *and* 3G systems http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Packet_Radio_Service — but I guess I'd need a degree in mobile telecommunication technology anyway to fully understand this multitude of standards. :-) <comment24659> @Jonik - The Status Icons reference I looked at was on page 21. To be honest that was all I was looking for :) <comment24660> I'm not totally sure what the phone is doing exactly when using GPRS, but I can tell you from experience that the circle means the phone has a data connection, but it's too slow to be worth using. :) <comment24661> @Diago http://www.kuvaboksi.fi/mediaobjects/orig/pub/2009/08/19/8143010478554031196orig.png Oh well, maybe your link mystically takes me to a different PDF :) <comment24662> @Jonik. It is actually possible. However there could be two signal charts in the manual, or we could just be using different page sizes. I do know Apple does do country redirection thought. <comment24663> This is a good answer to the main question, so I'm accepting it for now. If someone provided a more complete answer, addressing all of the questions and doubts I had, that'd be appreciated though... :) <comment24664> Hmm - but Wikipedia says: "EDGE is considered a 3G radio technology and is part of ITU's 3G definition." http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enhanced_Data_Rates_for_GSM_Evolution <comment24665> Sorry my bad. <comment24666> It may be in the ITU 3G definitions, but that Wikipedia entry reads like propaganda. EDGE is typically referred to as "2.5G" (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2.5G for another perspective) by everyone else and does not require the UMTS technology to work. <comment24667> I didn't migrate at first because the question was old and wasn't sure that it was still relevant, as there could still be a newer version of this question already on Apple.SE.  Migrated anyhow. Cheers! :) <comment71241> I updated the answer to include Sprint and 4G. If I'm wrong I hope somebody'll pop along and fix it!
