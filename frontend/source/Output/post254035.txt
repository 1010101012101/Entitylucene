Health app updates slowly un iOS 10? <body> I do a lot of walking, and since upgrading my iPhone 5S to iOS 10, I've noticed that the Health app seems to be delayed, or provides odd data. For instance, on one walk it said I made 7000 steps and covered 0.09 km. I had actually covered about 6 km. Last night I walked 7 km and when I looked at Health near the end it said I had made ~1800 steps for 1 km.  Everything seems to be fine when I look the next day, but this is still annoying.  Is anyone else seeing this?  <comment316241> Have you tried force restarting your iPhone after upgrading it (hold power +Touch ID button until the Apple logo appears)?
