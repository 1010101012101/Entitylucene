How to get iMessages to sync across an iPhone, iPad and Mac automatically? <body> One of the new features of Mountain Lion is the fact that one can sync iMessages across iOS and OSX devices.  I would really like to have a thread that I start on my iPhone automatically sync to my Mac and iPad so I can reply easily from either device. I do understand that SMS text messages will not sync, and only iMessages.   This question applies to iOS 6 and Mountain Lion devices as I am running an iPhone 4S and 3rd Gen iPad with iOS 6 and a Macbook Pro with Mountain Lion (OSX 10.8).  How can I enable this feature so that my iMessages stay in sync across all my devices?  <answer77158> iOS 6 combines your phone number with your Apple ID email address, which makes it possible for others to iMessage your phone number and have those Messages sync across your devices. Whereas, previously, with iOS 5, one had to use Apple ID email addresses only in order for it to sync across devices.  First, you need to make sure all your devices are on the same Apple ID.  strongOn each iOS device (iPhone, iPod Touch, iPad, iPad Mini):/strong  ol liOpen Settings.app/li liGo to "Messages" and make sure iMessage is strongOn/strong. /li liIf iMessage is on, "Send &amp; Receive" will appear below it. Tap on it./li liMake note of the Apple ID at the top of the page./li liSelect your phone number and email address(es) that you want to sync to that device./li /ol  strongOn each Mountain Lion Mac:/strong  ol liOpen Messages/li liClick Messages - Preferences/li liClick the "Accounts" tab in the top./li liSelect your iMessage/Apple ID account, and make sure "Enable this account" is checked./li liSelect your phone number and any email address(es) that you would like synced./li /ol  The most important part is that everything is consistent across all the devices.   Note that only new iMessages will sync - history will not.  If you are still having trouble getting new iMessages to sync across the devices try:  ol liDisabling then re-enabling iMessage on each device that isn't being synced to./li liDelete all your previous conversations: Some people have reported that they had to delete all of their conversations before things would sync up./li liMake sure you have your phone number added to your Apple ID account online./li /ol  <answer280239> I am on iOS 10.3.1 and macOS Sierra 10.12.3. I need to setup Messages in macOS using https://support.apple.com/kb/HT202549. In iPhone, the settings that allowed me to sync is in Settings  Messages  Send &amp; Receive. I have to login my Apple ID here.  <comment121417> this is just way to complicated for a simple task like thisâ€¦ Are less steps possible for setting up new devices? <comment121476> Yep, it's actually all very easy and simple. The answer above is comprehensive, therefore it *looks* harder/longer. Just sign into your Apple ID on your iOS/OSX device and make sure iMessage is on. The rest just happens. <comment331010> Except when it doesn't. <comment354761> thanks great answer! is it possible to sync history too? <comment357911> I was replacing an old phone with a new one. iMessage didn't work until I disabled and then reenabled "iMessage" switch in Settings  Messages - for some reason, this forced it to reconnect to the mac. <comment371820> And, FYI, history will sync in iOS 11/macOS High Sierra, IIRC.
