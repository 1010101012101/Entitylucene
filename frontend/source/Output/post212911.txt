Yosemite 10.10.5 - Accounts not visible in mail app <body> I am on Mac OSX emYosemite 10.10.5/em and using Mail emVersion 8.2 (2104)/em. This morning I opened the mail app and for some strange reason all of my accounts are not listed over there anymore.   The mail app shows codeNo mailbox selected. Choose a mail account to add/code  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/82hOz.png" alt="enter image description here"  If I go to codeSystem Preferences/Internet Accounts/code the accounts are visible there:   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nR8tt.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  strongThis is what I tried to do in order to fix:/strong   ul liClose mail app and remove an account /li liReboot the system /li liAdded the account back/li /ul  I also deleted from code~/Library/Mail/V2/MailData//code the files that start with codeEnvelope index*/code  ul liRemoved/Re-added icloud account for my mac/li /ul  But none of the above worked.  hr/ Additionally if I add an email account that I never used before on my machine the mail.app crashes.   emWhy is this happening (is it because of an update)? How can I get this fixed?/em   <answer213074> After chatting with apple support - apparently there was a problem with the strongmail.app/strong under my main user account.   emTo find out what the problem was I went through this steps:/em   ul liRemoved/Re-added iCloud account/li liRemoved one of my other accounts from  codePreferences/Internet Accounts/code and re-added it in mail.app/li liCopied the contents of code~/Library/Mail/V2/code in another location on my HD (Rebooted afterwards)/li liChecked if the problem was also happening when the account was logged in codeSAFE BOOT/code/li /ul  And after all of the above I still couldn't get it fixed.   So I created a new test account on my machine and checked if the mailboxes were synchronising within the mail.app under the new account. And soon enough I found that everything was working properly therefore, something was wrong with my primary account.   strongSolutions I had:/strong   ul liCreate a new account and migrate everything from the old to the new but except the mail preferences /li liUpdate to El Capitan (Which it wasn't the most optimum choice because it was going to mess up with my Apache configurations) - emSolution I eventually followed/em/li /ul
