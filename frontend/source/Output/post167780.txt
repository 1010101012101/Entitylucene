AppleScript from Terminal unrar command <body> I would like to know if it's possible to make an AppleScript of the following terminal command(s).  precodecd unrar e -r -o- *.rar &amp;&amp; find ./ -name “*.r*” -delete /code/pre  Also, I would like to know if it's possible to tweak the codeunrar e -r -o- *.rar/code command.  Following situation:  pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"codeMain_folder\SubfolderA Main_folder\SubfolderB Main_folder\SubfolderC /code/pre  When I login in to Terminal and use the command codeunrar e -r -o- *.rar/code, everything from the subfolders will be extracted to the Main_folder.  Is there a command that will extract the code*.rar/code in the same subfolder as where they are stored?  For now I have…  precodeon run {input, parameters}   tell application "Terminal"     activate     do script with command "cd /Volumes/******_storage/******* &amp;&amp; unrar e -r -o- *.rar &amp;&amp; find ./ -name “*.r*” -delete"   end tell /code/pre  This works fine except that subfolders are still extracted in code/********/code instead of their own folder and that my files aren't deleted.  <answer167813> In the help text of the utility is says...  precodeUNRAR 5.10 beta 4 freeware      Copyright (c) 1993-2014 Alexander Roshal  Usage:     unrar &lt;command&gt; -&lt;switch 1&gt; -&lt;switch N&gt; &lt;archive&gt; &lt;files...&gt;                &lt;@listfiles...&gt; &lt;path_to_extract&gt; /code/pre  so you can include the codepath_to_extract/code at the end of the command and once inside a loop it's easy. Like this...  precodecd &lt;path&gt; for f in `find . -name "*.r*"`; do unrar e -o- $f `dirname $f` &amp;&amp; rm $f; done /code/pre  HTH  <comment196733> Curly quote marks don't work in bash, and replacing them with standard quote marks breaks the AppleScript as the quote marks are mismatched.
