Can two Macs be kept in sync using a single external hard drive? <body> I regularly commute by bicycle from home to work and find the weight of a MacBook Pro a little excessive. My thought is to have identical MacBooks at the office and home and only carry a hard disk on the bike.   So how would it be easiest to ensure that the two laptops are totally synchronised? Would Time Machine do the job or would it be time consuming and cumbersome? Or is there a better way of doing this avoiding cloud-based or network-based sync solutions.   The only connection between the two MacBooks will be through a portable hard drive.  <answer123614> To keep all settings and files of two Mac's in sync through an off-line method you could place your Home folder on an external HDD. There are plenty of tutorials on-line on how to do this, I will use this one to explain the process.   I assume you have a user account codeAllan/code on the current MacBook Pro (codeMBP-1/code) which you would like to share with the new laptop (codeMBP-2/code) through an external HDD named codeExtDisk/code. Keep in mind that you should substitute the actual hard disk and user account names.  ol liFirst create a back-up of the user account in case something goes wrong. Time Machine is an option for that, but you can also clone the drive with for example Carbon Copy Cloner./li liCreate a new administrator account on each MacBook Pro. This is for the case that you lose the external HDD for some reason or just don't have it with you. This way you'll still have an account from which you can use the laptop./li liMigrate the codeAllan/code user account from codeMBP-1/code to the new codeMBP-2/code. Here's an Apple Knowledge Base article on how to do that./li liOn codeMBP-1/code login to the newly created admin account. Copy the codeAllan/code home folder of codeMBP-1/code to codeExtDisk/code. You can do this by using the following Terminal command (the Terminal application is found in Applications - Utilities - Terminal.app):br codesudo ditto -v /Users/Allan/ /Volumes/ExtDisk/Users/Allan/codebr This command will ask your admin account password to get permission to copy all your files to the external disk codeExtDisk/code./li liWhen you're done copying, open codeExtDisk/code in the Finder and check if the user folder is there and has (roughly) the same size as the codeAllan/code user folder on codeMBP-1/code./li liGo to codeSystem Preferences -&gt; Users &amp; Groups/code. Right click on the codeAllan/code account and click codeAdvanced Options.../code./li liThe codeHome directory/code line says now code/Users/Allan/code. Click codeChoose.../code and navigate to the home folder on codeExtDisk/code./li liConnect the external HDD to codeMBP-2/code and repeat steps 6 and 7 on codeMBP-2/code./li liDo the following on each Mac with the external HDD connected: login on the codeAllan/code account and check if everything went right. To verify that it actually uses the home folder on the external HDD, select a file on the Desktop, hit kbdcmd/kbd+kbdI/kbd to show the Get Info window and check if the codeWhere/code field says code/Volumes/ExtDisk/Users/Allan/Desktop/code./li liIf all went well you can delete the code/Users/Allan/code folder on the internal hard drives of codeMBP-1/code and codeMBP-2/code./li liNow you can use the setup as follows:  ul liplugin the external HDD and turn on the laptop/li lilogin on the codeAllan/code account at home/li lishutdown the laptop at home  (maybe a logout is sufficient)./li lidisconnect the external HDD. Go to work./li liplugin the external HDD in at work and turn on the laptop./li liuse the codeAllan/code account at work./li /ul/li /ol  Pro-tip: as you will be carrying around your HDD with you the chance that the drive has an unpleasant physical encounter is somewhat higher. Make sure to have a daily backup running, either at home or at work, or if you really want to be sure at both places.  Disclaimer: I have not carried out this process myself. I don't accept any responsibility in the case you lose files.  <comment144243> How many files we talking about? What kind of capacity? Want to sync OS and user files as well? <comment144248> I don't think Time Machine is going to help you, it's more geared towards backup and recovery. Maybe placing your home drive on the external HDD is an option? In that way all your files, preferences and applications will be on one hard disk. [Here's an article](http://www.macworld.com/article/1164891/keeping_mac_os_and_data_on_separate_drives.html) on this process. Feel free to ask specific questions about this process here if something doesn't work. <comment144383> You can boot from a USB hard drive. Use an SSD and it will be fast enough for daily use.
