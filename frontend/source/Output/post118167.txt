How do I quickly find large files and folders on my mac? <body> I need to free up space on my Mac and know there are a ton of hidden files that are eating up space (Logic for example downloads a lot of instruments... somewhere).  Is there any way I can create an interactive (or non interactive) tree map of my hard drive?  Here is an example of a tree map http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treemap  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jTqtj.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer118168> GrandPerspective can create a Treemap:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/39zxj.png" alt="GrandPerspective screenshot"  <answer227920> You can use spotlight as well:  precodemdfind 'kMDItemFSSize &gt; 2000000000' /code/pre  Add or remove zeroes to get more or less hits as you are searching.  <answer278805> try   codedu -sh *  | grep -E "\dG"/code  to get all files and folders of size 1G and above. (Output will only show once codedu/code is done)  <answer278809> strongClean Up Old and Large Files with CleanMyMac 3/strong     The Large &amp; Old Files module in CleanMyMac 3 makes finding space-hoggers on your Mac simple.

Everyone has (at one   time or another) thrown files into random folders. It’s easy for these   files to take up gigabytes of space without even realizing it!   CleanMyMac 3’s Large &amp; Old Files scans your entire Mac and brings all   these files to the surface. Plus, it lets you see what’s what, based   on a file’s size, date last opened, and type.   <comment137889> possible duplicate of [How can I figure out what's slowly eating my HD space?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/5353/how-can-i-figure-out-whats-slowly-eating-my-hd-space), [What is consuming HDD space on my MacBook Pro?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/56562/what-is-consuming-hdd-space-on-my-macbook-pro) <comment137891> @l'L'l Not quite a duplicate — most of those solutions included the accepted answer don't produce Treemaps. <comment137892> ^ see the second link. <comment137908> However, the answers to both questions contain all the recent tree map type utilities that are in common use. What about your situation makes you think "tons of hidden files" are in play? Finder will show you folder sizes quite easily and you can navigate to locate things without needing any extra software.
