OS X tool to convert MPEG-TS into MPEG-PS <body> I have a cable tv settop box capable of recording the MPEG-TS bit stream on to a USB-drive similar to what I can do with EyeTV on my Mac.  Unfortunately I have found that XBMC and VLC are the only OS X tools which can cope with these files, and I would like to have something simple which can convert this into a normal MPEG-PS file compatible with QuickTime for further processing.   I am well versed in Terminal.app, and can compile from source.  What should I use for this?   <answer50794> You can probably compile your own ffmpeg then use:  precodeffmpeg -i input.ts -vcodec copy -acodec copy output.mpg /code/pre  http://jungels.net/articles/ffmpeg-howto.html  <comment58201> Use [Homebrew](https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew) to make installation even easier.
