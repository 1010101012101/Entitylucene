How to recover lost partition after diskutil erasevolume noformat <body> I previously had 2 partitions on my 1TB hard drive... - Partition 1 (disk0s4): Macintosh HD (which had OS-X and all my data) - Partition 2 (disk0s2): Apple HD (which was a back-up partition)  I erased partition 2 and tried merging it with partition 1, but Disk Utility didn't allow it (the "-" button was inactive). I then used the command codediskutil eraseVolume free %noformat% disk0s2/code, but now I've completely lost the space of partition 2.br When I type codediskutil list/code, the following appears:  precode   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *1.0 TB     disk0    1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1    2:                  Apple_HFS Macintosh HD            499.0 GB   disk0s4    3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s7 /code/pre  I've tried resizing disk0s4 with the command codediskutil resize volume disk0s4 R/code, but I get the following:   precodeResizing to full size (fit to fill) Started partitioning on disk0s4 Macintosh HD Verifying the disk Verifying file system Using live mode Performing live verification Checking Journaled HFS Plus volume Checking extents overflow file Checking catalog file Checking multi-linked files Checking catalog hierarchy Checking extended attributes file Checking volume bitmap Checking volume information The volume Macintosh HD appears to be OK File system check exit code is 0 Resizing Error: -69742: The requested size change for the target disk or a related disk is too small; please try a different disk or partition, or make a larger change /code/pre  Also, if I type codediskutil cs list/code, I get:br codeNo CoreStorage logical volume groups found/code  Is there a way to restore disk0s2? I'm afraid that if I reboot without recovering this partition, I might lose everything... Ideally, I'd prefer to recover the missing space from disk0s2 and merge it into disk0s4.  <answer251005> The problem has finally been resolved... I went into Internet Recovery (but normal Recovery will do as well) and "reactive" the partition with Disk Utility. The old version of Disk Utility that is used when in Recovery mode allows to do this whereas the new version in System Preferences has pretty limited functions.  Basically, the partition had just disappeared before... When using the command sudo gpt -r show /dev/disk0 I had 4 partitions, but one without any identifier. As a result, I was unable to either mount or restore this lost partition with diskutil, as there was nothing to identify it. Sorry for not being any clearer, but since I restored everything, I don't have the output to demonstrate it anymore.  I still thank you for answering back!  <comment311621> You question explains ***what*** partitions you currently have, The problem is you have not explained ***where*** the partitions are. This information is needed before a answer can be given. So, post the output from the commands `sudo gpt -r show /dev/disk0` and `sudo fdisk /dev/disk0`. These commands will not change your computer.
