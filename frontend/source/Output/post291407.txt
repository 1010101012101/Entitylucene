Error activating Messages on multi-user Mac <body> I have strong3 users/strong including me on my Mid 2012 MacBook Pro 13" macOS Sierra with strongour own iCloud accounts/strong signed in.br My user account is strongAdmin/strong, it works perfectly with the Messages and FaceTime apps.  However, the other two users are facing problems when logging into Messages and FaceTime:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kDe1F.png" alt="This is error"  I went through this Apple discussion, but had no luck in solving the issue.  Any idea why I am having this issue? What can be done to solve it?  <comment367952> What exactly have you tried? Have you, as proposed on the linked Discussions thread, contacted Apple Support? What did they tell you to do? <comment367966> I tried resetting NVRAM. I haven't contacted Apple support as I thought this is related to multi-user accounts. <comment368042> NVRAM is becoming the new voodoo [shake the chicken bones whilst facing East at sunset on any Tuesday with an R in the month]... it really is very rare resetting it will fix much at all; certainly nothing as high as OS-level.
