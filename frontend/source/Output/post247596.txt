OSX version 10.9.5 <body> I have been opeing a facebook account for my company but nmow find I also have a personal facebook page - NOT WANTED - how do I get rid of the personal; one but retain the company one?  <answer247597> You cannot create a Page without having a personal account, believe me I tried for ages. Just create a new account with a different email address, and leave the person profile as is, empty..  <comment305544> Many Thanks - good advice
