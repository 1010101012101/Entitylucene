Keyboard Layout suddenly grayed out/disabled <body> I have been using a keyboard layout codeusd2.keylayout/code for 4 months on this laptop. After rebooting this last time (after many many other reboots..) it is grayed out.  Why might this be?  I am on el capitan  precode[![enter image description here][1]][1]      $ll ~/Library/Keyboard\ Layouts/     total 80     -rwxrwxrwx@  1 boescst  USWIN\Domain Users  37414 Nov 15  2015 usd2.keylayout     drwx------+  3 boescst  USWIN\Domain Users    102 Nov 29 15:53 .     drwx------@ 58 boescst  USWIN\Domain Users   1972 Mar 21 20:40 .. /code/pre  <answer277690> OK here's a hack that has worked: I simply emre-added/em the emsame/em keyboard layout. It now shows up twice .. but at least one of them is emenabled/em.  I will go and delete the other (corrupted??) one now..  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lKLzb.png" alt="enter image description here"  And deleting the previous (same file) one did clean it up.  That was .. emweird/em ..  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jRAyi.png" alt="enter image description here"
