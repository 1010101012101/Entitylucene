1 and 2 keys to change tabs in Safari (like in Opera) <body> In Opera browser 1 and 2 keys can be used to change between tabs. Is it possible to set up this shortcut in Safari? I tried adding a "Show Previous Tab" shortcut in keyboard preferences but is does not allow me to set a shortcut without a modifier key (ctrl/alt/cmd).   <answer129975> You wouldn't make the shortcut from keyboard preferences. I believe that you would add this shortcut from Automator however I am not on my computer right now so I think that will work but I haven't tested this specific shortcut. If that dosent work then there is always the option of "⌘+`/⌘+Shift+' " to go to the next or previous tab. Hope this helps!  <answer132988> Not quite what you're asking, but I found SafariTabSwitching extension recently and am very happy with it https://github.com/rs/SafariTabSwitching  It let's you switch tabs using Cmd-(tab number) like all other browsers.
