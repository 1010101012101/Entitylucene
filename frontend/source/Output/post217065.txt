Your first 5GB is free.  The iPhone itself has a strongfixed/strong hardware strongmemory/strong, or space, which can only be chosen when you buy it, in 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, or 256 GB configurations.br The total you see in Settings  General  Storage will never be quite this figure, as some of that is needed for the formatting of the memory &amp; the data structure itself.br This memory is where it stores all apps, music, documents etc that your phone can use.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/y1iDX.png" alt="enter image description here"
