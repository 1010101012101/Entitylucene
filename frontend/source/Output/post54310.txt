Can I get album art for songs only on my iPod? <body> I have an iPod Classic (the 160 gig one) that I use, and I want to have album art for all of the songs.  Problem is, I cannot just use the "Get Album Art" option on iTunes, because that will only find art for songs currently on that particular computer, and I have many songs on my iPod that are not on my computer.  Short of manually adding the art to every album (like I have been doing), is there a way I can get iTunes (or any other program) to go through my iPod and find the appropriate album art for the songs there?  <answer54311> There is no way for iTunes to know what is on your iPod if you manage it manually. So the answer is NO.  I assume you are aware that you risk losing all your iPod-only tracks in case your iPods breaks down, gets damaged or stolen. So it may be a good idea to get all tracks into iTunes (and your computer) anyway.
