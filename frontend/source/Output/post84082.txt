Problem updating homebrew <body> Trying to update homebrew, I get this:  precode$ brew update  error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by merge:     .gitignore     Library/Contributions/brew_bash_completion.sh     Library/Contributions/brew_fish_completion.fish     Library/Contributions/brew_zsh_completion.zsh     Library/Contributions/manpages/brew.1.md     Library/ENV/4.3/cc     Library/ENV/4.3/make     Library/ENV/4.3/xcrun     Library/ENV/libsuperenv.rb Please, commit your changes or stash them before you can merge. error: The following untracked working tree files would be overwritten by merge:     CONTRIBUTING.md     Library/Aliases/ag     Library/Aliases/heroku /code/pre  ... etc...  Any way to just clean that up? Looks like it's using git under the hood?  <answer84144> That would depend on whether you care about local changes to those files. Did you change them yourself, or did you run a program that changed them, or something else?  If you didn't mean to change them at all, codecd /usr/local/code and run codegit reset --hard HEAD/code; this will reset them all to their original state. Then try updating Homebrew.  <comment96952> I didn't change them intentionally. I have no idea what any of those files are even for! I'm wondering if they could have been changed by a previous aborted homebrew operation - does that sound plausible? <comment96968> I definitely think that's plausible, but I think you should maybe raise this issue on the Homebrew GitHub page and see if they have a clear picture of what's going on here.
