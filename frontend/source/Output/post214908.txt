Problem sharing via email in Photos app on Mac <body> As of yesterday, I can't send a photo from Photos app on my Mac via email (through the 'share' feature). I've been sharing this way all week and now, nothing. No message, it just doesn't do anything. Help?  <comment259545> In System Preferences  Extensions  Share Menu, is Mail enabled? <comment259781> mgiordi, the box for Mail is checked but is greyed out. What's weird is that I've been sharing this way all week until a couple of days ago.
