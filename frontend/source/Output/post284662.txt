How to create editable Custom HTML Email Signature Templates in macOS Mail? <body> I want to create an html template for an email, but i want that the client can only modify the text of the email.  <comment358951> Mac Mail doesn't use HTML natively. You'd need to mail from Safari, just 'bouncing it through' Mail. Creating the HTML itself is, however, off-topic for Ask Different. <comment358953> hmm... my bad, signatures can be hacked into Mail, just not fully editable 'bodies' http://matt.coneybeare.me/how-to-make-an-html-signature-in-apple-mail-for-sierra-os-x-10-dot-12/ Far too much to pr√©cis in here.
