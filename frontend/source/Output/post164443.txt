Does OS X Yosemite support spotlight on network drives? <body> I know in the past OS X did not support indexing network drives.   Has this changed?   Do more recent versions of OS X such as Yosemite support spotlight on network drives?  I am thinking of investing in a NAS storage device such as Synology and spotlight support is a requirement.  Since I have lots of data on my external drives right now.  <answer164451> Indexing of an AFP-network drive isn't a problem:  To enable spotlight indexing on a network drive open codeTerminal.app/code and enter:  precode mdutil /Volumes/name -i on /code/pre  To disable the indexing of a connected network drive:  precode mdutil /Volumes/name -i off /code/pre  To check the status of indexing on a connected network drive:  precode mdutil /Volumes/name -s /code/pre  Source  In the comments there, a Synology NAS has been mentioned explicitly:     MacHouis â€¢ a year agobr   Thanks a lot, it works very fine :):):). I had to mount the volume (a Synology Ethernet server) in afp to start the Spotlight Indexing... thanks thanks thanks...   This also works for older Mac OS Xs (in the example below it's Lion). Make sure that you've switched to 'Shared' in the search window:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nc3ZJ.png" alt="search"  <comment192798> If I unmount a network volume and mount again does OS X start the index all over again or is it smart enough to only do an incremental scan? <comment192799> @ScottWalter I think it's smart enough to just perform an incremental scan. I just tested it with a Mac Server share (Mavericks) and since the (shared) drive already has been indexed by the Server itself nothing happened at all after entering 'mdutil /Volumes/ShareName -i on' on the client side (Lion)... <comment254457> Trying to index my filetransporter, which is a FUSE mount.  No joy so far:  "Error: invalid operation.         Error: unknown indexing state" <comment294326> @AndrewWolfe I also get that for NFS mounts <comment294327> @Michael Indexing only works with AFP and SMB shares <comment332171> Permissions issues might prevent indiexing as mentioned in thie answer: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/129993/how-to-make-spotlight-index-files-shared-over-afp
