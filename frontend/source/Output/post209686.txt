Preview refuses to open pdf file, incorrectly claiming a permission issue <body> I had to force quite Preview (it became unresponsive after trying to open a 200Mb animated gif), but after re-starting it some files there were open before no longer open. Instead an error box pops up saying that      The file “file.pdf” couldn’t be opened because you don’t have   permission to view it.   and      To view or change permissions, select the item in the Finder and   choose File  Get Info.   (how can I generate an image of that error box?).  However, the file permissions are okay, finder generated the usual preview, and acroread can open the file. I suspect that preview has generated some lock for this file somewhere, but I'm not sure where and how. OSX 10.9.5. (copying the file in a terminal to another one and trying to open that didn't help, as did changing permissions to read-write for everyone).  <answer209695> After searching on the net I found a solution, following mainly this suggestion, though only deleting a small sub-directory:  ol liI removed the sub-directory code~/Library/Containers/com.apple.Preview/Data/Library/Saved Application State/com.apple.Preview.savedState/code/li liI quit Preview and re-started it./li /ol  <answer223165> quitting preview was enough to fix it for me.  <comment301649> Worked for me... strange bug <comment310483> Just opening preview and quitting didn't work for me. But opening and then force quitting seemed to work for some reason. <comment327825> I think preview just locks the resources and does not release it.. This solution is good :)
