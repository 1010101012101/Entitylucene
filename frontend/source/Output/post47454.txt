Smart Cover and Sim-tray <body> I would like to know weather the smart cover on a 3G iPad covers the sim-tray completely partially or not at all. A photo would also be really helpful  <answer47458> I'll have to update my answer. As you can see, the magnets are emjust/em above the sim-tray.br So, no, the smart cover won't cover the sim-tray.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LONYA.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer47506> Only a small portion of the sim tray is really emcovered/em by the smart cover.  Or, in other words, the smart cover attachment does not hide the sim tray.  However, the sim tray pops out straight, parallel to the display, so you cannot remove the sim without detaching the smart cover:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YwsRj.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MmH4v.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zcpGK.jpg" alt="enter image description here"
