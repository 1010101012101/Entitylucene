Put Backup on Old iPhone <body> Is it possible, using iTunes, to put a backup of a currently active iPhone onto an older iPhone that has no service?  Basically I want to keep all the text conversations on a separate older device.  It's a backup of an iPhone 6 and I want that backup placed on an iPhone 4S.  Thanks!  <answer195276> Alternatively there are apps that let you download texts off, such as PhoneView by ecamm but I heard they stopped working in one of the most recent updates, so I would check the demo first.  <answer195320> Yes, it is possible.   The iPhone 4s can support the same versions of iOS as the iPhone 6 (see supported devices and Apple's iOS 8 information - see screenshot below from here) and both will run the forthcoming iOS 9, so it shouldn't be a problem restoring a backup from the latter onto the former.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hmKTi.png" alt="IOS 8 supported devices"  I've done something similar, restoring an iOS 8.x iPhone 6 Plus backup onto an iPhone 5 and had no problems.  <comment233032> I'm not aware if any way to backup an iOS 8 device and restore it to an iPhone 4S that can only run iOS 7. <comment233142> I think most of those apps stopped working after they uprated the sandboxing in iOS 8.3 I think you need to jailbreak to do any of that stuff now. <comment233156> An iPhone 4s can run iOS 8, which is the latest iOS version. Therefore, it would be possible to put an iPhone 6 backup on the older phone.
