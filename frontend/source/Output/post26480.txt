Where can I find my crash logs? <body> I would like to ask you, where could I find my crash logs?  <answer26482> Open the Console from the Application-Utilities, you will see the log files.  <answer26483> Console app has them neatly arranged depending on if a system level process has crashed or a user level process...  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1JbvX.png" alt="enter image description here"  From there you can see if it's in ~/Library/Logs or /Library/Logs - you will get crashes and panics and hangs in separate files. Don't forget to look in /private/var/log as well.  <answer26492> ~/Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports/ (where ~ refers to your Home directory).  ~/Library/Logs/CrashReporter/MobileDevice are the crashlogs for your iOS devices (if any).  ~/Library/Logs/CrashReporter also has links to items in ~/Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports/   <comment359986> In Console, you will see directories that @TJ Luoma mentions too, but it may not list all the files in the UI. I'd recommend using Reveal in Finder right-click option once you locate the right folder from the console.
