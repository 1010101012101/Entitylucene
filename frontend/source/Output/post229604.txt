What is installer.failurerequests in the root directory? <body> I just noticed a file called codeinstaller.failurerequests/code in my root directory:  precodecd / ls Applications/              User Information@          cores/                     installer.failurerequests  sbin/ Library/                   Users/                     dev/                       net/                       tmp@ Network/                   Volumes/                   etc@                       opt/                       usr/ System/                    bin/                       home/                      private/                   var@ /code/pre  It's a plist of some sort and its contents read as:  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt; &lt;!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"&gt; &lt;plist version="1.0"&gt; &lt;array&gt;     &lt;dict&gt;         &lt;key&gt;Operation&lt;/key&gt;         &lt;string&gt;fsck target&lt;/string&gt;         &lt;key&gt;CrashAtProgress&lt;/key&gt;         &lt;integer&gt;0&lt;/integer&gt;     &lt;/dict&gt; &lt;/array&gt; &lt;/plist&gt; /code/pre  What is that file and what it is doing in code//code?  I am on OS 10.11.3  <answer240045> It is a file left behind by the OS X installer in later versions. It seems to always be there after installation, so its existence does not indicate a failure in it self.  What the installer actually uses the file for is not known to me. It might be used if the installer fails/crashes, to indicate what the installer was doing at the time of the crash - but this is guesswork.  <comment292332> Same here, but donâ€™t where it came from either.
