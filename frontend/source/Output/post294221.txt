Save the order or a column <body> I have some words in column B. They are sorted by a personal criterion, nothing that Apple Numbers can consider:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zgA1V.png" alt="enter image description here"  At a certain point, I want to organize the information by another criterion. For instance, to make it simple, sort ascending:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dQ4cr.png" alt="enter image description here"  Is there a way I can go back to the first picture?  (Here I simplify the case. Of course, I could cmd z, but that is not the point. I am looking for an easy way to save a specific order even after I close the file o even days later)  What I have tried:  This is a simplified case. In real live I have several files with thousands of rows in each file. I cannot create a column and give them a number of reference manually. I tried to create a column and generate the order this way:  1- I put 1 in A1br 2- Put A1+1 in A2br 3- Copy paste the formula in the other columns. Or drag the yellow point, it's the samebr 4- Create another column and "paste results" (When I sort by the B column the formula column will change. That's why I need that extra step and create a column with only numbers)  This works, but it seems complicated and I need to do it many times. Is there any other way to strongsave the order/strong that is easier, simpler?  <answer294240> Simply create an Index column.  1, 2, 3 etc. (As pjctec mentions in comments.). Without some ordered list or index, there is no way for Numbers to know how to use a custom sort.  There is no need to use a formula to create the list of numbers.  ol liIn codeA1/code enter code1/code/li liIn codeA2/code enter code2/code/li liIn codeA3/code enter code3/code/li liSelect cells codeA1 to A3/code/li liDrag the yellow dot down./li /ol  Sorting will not change the numbers as they are static.  No need to use a formula.  Then you can always sort the index column later.  If needed, the column can be hidden or shown when needed.  Apple supplies a good resource for Numbers basics on their Website. Numbers Help. Recommended for new users and anyone who wants to get the most out of using Numbers.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Xom79.gif" alt="Sort and re-sort"  <comment371442> That is the solution that I already explained. The question is that I cannot manually write the index column. There are thousands of references. Please read where I explain "What I have tried" <comment371444> I have many references. I need a better way to create that id <comment371473> See my edit.  No need for a formula such as `A1 + 1` to create the list.  But it is recommended to learn what you can about how spreadsheets applications such and Numbers or Excel use formulas, do sorting etc.  Cheers.
