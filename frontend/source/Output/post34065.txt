NAS recommendation <body> I'm wondering if anyone can recommend a 4-bay NAS with AFP/TimeMachine support and the ability for me to install codes3cmd/code (a utility for simple S3 syncing).   The reason I ask is simple: just having a back up at home isn't good enough. I've used Dropbox for a while now but since we've got a number of machines my ultimate aim is to back them up to a NAS and for that NAS to sync with S3 a few times a day so we'd have a remote version.  <answer34067> Synology has a few solutions. Their products are reliable and affordable.  There are multiple applications you can install in a few clicks but for S3 backups you will have to go the manual way.   <comment38875> I second this advice. I have one (single bay) and I'm very happy with it. I also backup offsite on S3 but manually. <comment104858> Hardware shopping questions are off topic. If you wanted to edit this to be about how to evaluate any NAS for compatibility with `s3cmd` at might be fine to reopen.
