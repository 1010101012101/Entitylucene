Fastest Way to Image Multiple Macs of the same model with the same apps, system and settings? <body> I've got several Macs of the same model and I'd like to deploy a default image of the latest OS with a handful of applications installed. I've made the custom image by setting up a machine to the way I want them all to be and then turned that into a disk image.   I've got a bootable system on an SSD with a copy of the disk image. I then intend to connect this SSD to each of the target machines and use SuperDuper to image the disk image to the internal drive.   Any suggestions on how I could deploy the settings to all the machines faster than what I've stated above.  Just to clarify this is a once off imaging, they won't need to be restored to defaults everyday or anything, it's just to set them up all the same and spend the least amount of time doing it  <comment369975> Is that a one-time experience? Then I would do as planed. If you expand this procedure to more macs, I would recommend a deployment suite like JAMF Suite or munki..
