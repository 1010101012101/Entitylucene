How do I revert the sudo less /private/etc/cups/printers.conf command? <body> I have used the above command to try and find my printer's address using the web.  Now I would like to revert this setting using terminal.  Can anyone help me with this?  <answer227922> Less isn't modifying anything in your printer settings, it's just displaying the contents of the file. For example:  precodeless test.txt  /code/pre  will show the contents of the test text file. If you exit using codeq/code, and you reopen the Terminal window, you will no longer see the IP address of the printer without using the   precodeless /code/pre  command again.  <comment277778> `less` is not changing anything. You exit `less` command with `q`.
