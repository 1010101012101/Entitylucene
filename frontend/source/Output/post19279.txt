Special keyboard keys <body> I have this applet made in java, which relies on the users keycode input. The case is that I have to press "Insert" for a function, which doesn't exist on the keyboard. Another function requires the "Page Up", which is also missing from my keyboard.  I have the BT Keyboard (no numpad).  I did not make the applet and there are no options to change the keyboard-controls.  How can I send these 'keys' to the Java applet?  <answer19280> The page up Key is mapped to kbdfn/kbd + kbdArrow UP/kbd.   Other key combinations with fn and the arrow keys are:  ul likbdArrow down/kbd  page down/li likbdArrow left/kbd  beginning of line or begin of page depending on situation/li likbdArrow right/kbd  end of line or bottom of page depending on situation/li /ul  For the Insert Key there's no correspondant key on a Mac keyboard, but you could try using the kbdfn/kbd + kbdEnter/kbd which I found here. I can't confirm this though as I absolutely have no idea where I could test this out.   <answer19281> On that keyboard, the Page-Up key code can be sent by pressing: kbdfn/kbd+kbdâ†‘/kbd  This can be found by turning on the Keyboard Viewer in System Preferences - Language and Text - Input Sources.  <comment21153> fn + Enter didn't work, but fn + Up did. <comment131393> fn+Enter is a Windows key combination for Insert, if you've installed it on your Mac (like with BootCamp).
