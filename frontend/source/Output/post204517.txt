Where does this strange output in Terminal come from? <body> Everytime I open my terminal I get a little notification error:  precodedeclare -x Apple_PubSub_Socket_Render="/tmp/launch-jsWpOJ/Render"   declare -x DISPLAY="/tmp/launch-yARwMh/org.macosforge.xquartz:0"   declare -x HOME="/Users/Austin"   declare -x LANG="en_US.UTF-8"   declare -x LOGNAME="Austin"   declare -x OLDPWD   declare -x   PATH="/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/opt/X11/bin:/usr/local/git/bin:/usr/local/MacGPG2/bin"   declare -x PWD="/"   declare -x SHELL="/bin/bash"   declare -x SHLVL="1"   declare -x SSH_AUTH_SOCK="/tmp/launch-PWYfTW/Listeners"   declare -x TERM="xterm-256color"   declare -x TERM_PROGRAM="Apple_Terminal"   declare -x TERM_PROGRAM_VERSION="326"   declare -x TERM_SESSION_ID="EA9B2123-82A5-470E-8F9D-328367CEE7BD"   declare -x TMPDIR="/var/folders/hb/ss6hsppn5497rzzmnx81hh8r0000gn/T/"   declare -x USER="Austin"   declare -x __CF_USER_TEXT_ENCODING="0x1F5:0:0"   declare -x __CHECKFIX1436934="1"   /code/pre  I don't really know how to get rid of this, I think it might have something to do with XQuartz or X11. Can anyone point me in the right direction to fix this?  <answer210010> The reason I was getting the output in my shell for every environment I created was because my ".bash_profile" had a some statements that didn't evaluate to true. The shell was looking for a path that didn't exist anymore, so I had to update the current path so the bash didn't generate an error.   Thanks everyone!  <comment246537> Why do you think it has something to do with X11? Are the lines displayed inside your Terminal window, your xterm window or in a separate popup? Is there anything in your `.profile` or `.bashrc` which could trigger this? <comment246569> The following command might help you identify which config file may be causing the problem. `grep -lE 'declare|env' $HOME/.* 2/dev/null` <comment246707> This occurs every time I open my Terminal shell. As for the bash command, @fd0, nothing echoed after the search. <comment246820> @SomeGuy -Rename (mv) any of the following files that exits in the root of your home folder: .bash_profile, .bash_login, .bashrc, .profile then drag the com.apple.Terminal.plist in your Preference folder to your Desktop. Logout then log back in. The output that you are seeing looks similar to the command `printenv`. <comment248398> @fd0, It appears .bash_profile is in my /Users folder, and I did a search on my computer for the other ones and I came up empty handed. I also moved my terminal preferences away from my Library (to my desktop) which didn't help with the error either. In fact something weird happened, after I restarted my laptop it didn't request a password (like it's supposed to). <comment252550> I found why I was getting the output in my terminal every time I opened a new shell. It was my ".bash_profile", the path that is supposed to be linking up to Python 3.4 was set to a pwd that doesn't exist. <comment253062> @SomeGuy You can answer your own questions. May as well make the last comment the answer.
