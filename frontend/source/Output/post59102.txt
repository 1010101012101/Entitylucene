Safari 6 keeps suddenly crashing on Lion <body> I upgraded Safari to version 6 on OS X Lion 10.7.4br The browser is really fast but with one problem, it keeps suddenly crashing and closing.  Relaunching it wont prompt with the usual suspects: em"Ignore"/em and em"Report to Apple"/em.  <answer59122> h1Disappearance of Safari without a crash/h1  The browser may disappear without crashing.   First, for the time of the disappearance, seek a matching code.crash/code file for codeSafari…/code or codeWebProcess…/code at the following path:   code~/Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports/code  If no code.crash/code file around the time of the disappearance, then use Console to see whether the following line was logged a second or two before the disappearance:   precodeReceived an invalid message from the web process with message ID 323002f /code/pre  <answer59125> If you're using a proxy: this might be related to proxy settings in combination with WebSockets, as also noticed on Meta Stack Overflow. Though there it was reported for Mountain Lion, and it emdid/em show the option to send a crash report, and hence find some more details. Still then, maybe the symptoms are the same?  The blog post Networking Crashes In Mountain Lion and its comments blame crashes that refer to "CoreSchedulingSet::copyWithUpdatesReleaseSelf" to either the "Auto Proxy Discovery" and "Automatic Proxy Configuration" settings, or a VPN connection.  Some more investigation on 10.8, with only "Auto Proxy Discovery" enabled, without restarting Safari:  ul liSafari 6 often crashes for Stack Overflow, but only when logged in. Super User crashes much less often, but also shows the issue. When not logged in, all is fine./li liGoing to websocketstest.com often (but not always) crashes Safari right away./li liGoing to the Echo Test on websocket.org seems less troublesome. Repeatedly connecting and disconnecting might not cause trouble, but it too will crash at some point./li /ul  <answer89403> A common reason for an application crash is a corrupt preference file. The first thing you'll want to try is backing up and deleting your preference file for Safari.  Close Safari, and then you can find the preference file by going to code~/Library/Preferences/code and looking for the file called codecom.apple.Safari.plist/code. Once you've found the file, back it up by adding a tilde to the front of the file name so it becomes code~com.apple.Safari.plist/code. Once you restart Safari, it will generate a new .plist file.  If that doesn't work, the next step would be to do a permissions repair using Disk Utility, which you can find in code/Applications/Utilities/code.  <comment104927> Which Safari 6.?.?
