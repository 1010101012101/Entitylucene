List of all packages installed using Homebrew <body> Is it possible to and how do I get a list of all the packages installed on my Mac using codeHomebrew/code?  I am not interested in packages installed outside of Homebrew.  <answer101092> h1codebrew list/code and codebrew cask list/code/h1  Running codebrew list/code will show a list of all your installed Homebrew packages.  In addition, codebrew cask list/code will provide the items installed using the Caskroom.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DUqIh.png" alt="brew list"  <answer144649> You may use codebrew list | grep 'package-name'/code or  if are looking for specific package. br codebrew list 'package-name'/code also works and provides additional information.  <answer154750> codebrew leaves/code shows you all top-level packages. That is packages that are not dependencies. This should be the most interesting if you are using the list to re-install packages.   <answer256269> codebrew bundle/code may also be interesting if you are asking because you want to manage your brew installation. This includes casks, which codebrew list/code does not. It is aimed at having reproducible Homebrew setups.  precode# creates Brewfile in the current directory from currently-installed packages brew bundle dump # edit Brewfile # install everything from the Brewfile brew bundle /code/pre  You can use the code--global/code flag to operate on your code~/Brewfile/code and code-f/code to force overwriting of your existing file (for installation, this will force uninstallation of not-listed packages).  <comment181947> If you had this list in a txt file. How would you go about installing all of them? `brew install  list.txt` doesn't seem to work. <comment182004> @Jonathan `cat list.txt | xargs brew install` Feel free to ask a separate question for more details or clarification. <comment188198> @grgarside - love ur terminal prompt. would you be willing to share your config files for getting my prompt to look like that? <comment189038> @Kaushik I've finally written a blog post about [my terminal/shell setup](http://georgegarside.com/blog/my-os-x-terminal-shell-setup-2014/)—feel free to ask any questions there. <comment230875> Nice answer. Do you know how to get a list of the packages that were installed by the user? This can be different to `leaves`. <comment259560> @grgarside `404`: did your post move? <comment259565> @msanford Yep, I updated it for 2015, forgot about this link — thanks, I've 301'd it to the right place. <comment259797> @grgarside Great, thank you! <comment267563> @grgarside what's your iTerm/Terminal theme? <comment269224> @deadlock looks like [TomorrowNight](https://github.com/chriskempson/tomorrow-theme) <comment269237> @deadlock Yes, it's customised slightly, check the link to the blog post. <comment269314> @grgarside :thumbsup: <comment282558> Also, to list casks installed, use `brew cask list`. <comment308029> @Jonathan `brew install $( list.txt )` <comment310489> Great. I did not know about this command. Thanks. <comment311676> and for apps installed with cask: `brew cask list` <comment329681> This is excellent! I had no idea this existed. Thank you. I only wish it was like `brew leaves` and omitted the packages you didn't install directly, but only got as dependencies. In the future a package may change dependencies, but you will install it anyway and not need it. <comment329702> Yes. It seems like every package manager goes through this phase of not differentiating the two. <comment357793> A recent dump of mine suggests that `bundle` now excludes dependencies. There are some other changes like quote style and ordering that are making it harder to understand the diff, but overall it looks like at least some libraries are missing from `Brewfile` but installed.
