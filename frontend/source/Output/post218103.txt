Can I assign my named faces in **Photos** to contacts? <body> I want use faces which determined in Photos app and I named them. Specially I have contacts with the same names. I want link these and prefer do it automatically. Is there any way do this? strongEDIT :/strong I saw links which @Tetsujin introduce me. But I can't solve my problem. In addition I use Persian names which can made differences.  <comment263662> see http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/215674/contact-picture-not-connect-with-faces-on-photo/215694#215694 & also http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/182615/why-is-there-a-doubled-name-in-the-photos-app-when-i-search-to-name-faces/182616#182616 which was kind of halfway through figuring it all out <comment263680> @Tetsujin I just have Photos app. I don't have iPhoto. Doesn't it make any changes in my position. <comment263681> No difference in that respect, in fact my first link was done on Photos in El Capitan, the 2nd, older link on iPhoto in Yosemite.
