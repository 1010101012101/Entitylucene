How to download a game twice with an apple ID? <body> Could you pls inform me How I could download a game twice with my apple ID on my Iphone, since I deleted it by mistake and now I can not download it.  <answer124873> Anything you buy on the App Store is able to be downloaded again as many times as you like, it's not like it used to be on iTunes where you downloaded it once, and then couldn't do it again if you lost the file.  To do this, just go back to the app store, and search for the app in question.  Instead of listing a price, or saying codeFREE/code etc, you should have a little icon showing a cloud and an arrow which you can tap to redownload.  Note, you can only download the latest version of the App, so it it has been updated since you last used it, then you cannot go back to an older version (unless you have a local backup of the file on your iTunes machine).  Also, you must be logged into the store using the same Apple ID that was used to make the original purchase.  The only way I know of that you cannot use this method, is if the app is no longer available on the App Store, in which case you can still get it, but you need to go through your empurchase history/em to get to the download link instead of getting it from searching the store.  <answer124880> Instead of searching for the app, you could open the strongPurchased list/strong and download it from there.  <answer124911> You can reinstall purchased apps (and free apps just the same) using the strongApp Store/strong app.  ul liOn your device, navigate to the strongApp Store/strong Select the right-most tab, strongUpdates/strong /li liAt the top of this view is an area labeled strongPurchases/strong. Tap on it /li liThis shows anything you have purchased on the Apple ID you are logged into (more on how to change that in a second) /li liYou can strongSearch.../strong for your app, or if you can't recall the name, tap strongNot on this iPhone/strong to look for apps that you own, but are not installed on your device. /li liOnce you've found it, there should be a strongCloud icon with a Down Arrow/strong.

If not, please add a screenshot or describe the problem you are running into in more detail. <comment146141> What exact words are shown next to the app in the App Store? What led you to conclude "I can not download it"? <comment146188> Damn the autocorrect.
