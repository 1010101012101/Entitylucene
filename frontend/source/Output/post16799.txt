How to make iPhone camera silent? <body> On my iPhone, the camera shutter sound follows the ring/silent switch. However, I'd like the camera to be strongalways/strong silent, regardless of whether incoming calls &amp; messages make a sound. Is there any way to configure it that way?  (Non-jailbroken iPhone 4 with latest iOS.)  <answer16806> A simple solution is to use the mute switch on the side of the phone.  The camera shutter sound is controlled by the ringer volume, since the mute switch mutes the ringer the shutter sound is also mute.  However, you are asking an optional permanent solution.  So far there is none.  The application doesn't have any additional options within the app or within System Preferences.  Digging into the app store there is a simple camera application called emSecret Camera - Taking Photo Secretly/em for $1.99. Apple Store Link It looks like it functions like the normal Camera application, but reading its description it doesn't explicitly mention a shutter mute option.  I assume this is an implied feature due to the app's name.  <answer48713> It may not be the best solution, but I use an old headphone jack.  Essentially, I cut the end of the cord up to the point where the jack is.  I use the jack as a "sound" blocker.  Does wonders if you don't mind a little jack sticking out at the bottom lol  <answer48725> Don't think there's an option to disable the camera shutter sound, but here is a guide on how to disable the sound.  <answer146079> just flip the the phone's ring/silent switch to silent.  <comment18365> Secret Camera - wow :P I think I'm not that keen on the silentness and will stick to the default Camera app for now. Thanks anyways. <comment18387> No problem.  Don't forget to mark this question as answered. :) <comment46933> Unfortunately, this (first part of your answer) is not a valid answer for iPhones originating in Korea or Japan. The mute button does not mute the camera shutter sound. More answers would be appreciated. <comment55804> Problem with that guide is, the MobileFinder app is (no longer?) available in the App Store. (Given Apple's restrictive policies, I'd actually be surprised if a such file manager apps were available.) <comment55805> (On jailbroken iPhones renaming the photoShutter.caf file would probably be a piece of cake, but personally I'd rather not jailbreak.) <comment55899> I'm not sure about MobileFiner, but there are other apps, like iExplorer (http://www.macroplant.com/iexplorer/), that can be used on iPhones that aren't jailbroken (I used it once to upload a Japanese dictionary into the Kindle app for iPhone and it worked perfectly). <comment55906> Hmm, [iExplorer](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/iexplorer/id307733225?mt=8) indeed is on App Store. (Though the reviews don't paint too good a picture of it.) If you have the app, you could try if it's possible to rename files under `System/Library/Audio/UISounds` with it... (Somehow I still doubt that.) <comment55908> This was done a few months ago on my girlfriend Mac so I don't have it installed myself, but the app is 100% free and downloadable via the website I posted in my previous comment :) <comment172484> Please read the question before answering: "the camera shutter sound follows the ring/silent switch. However, I'd like the camera to be **always** silent" <comment279630> Here's another guide with more detail: http://osxdaily.com/2013/03/25/turn-off-iphone-camera-sound/
