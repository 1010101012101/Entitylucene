How do I view PDF attachments to my Google Calendar event synched with my iPhone? <body> I synched my Google Calendar with the iOS Calendar app by adding my Google account. I can see the attachments and file size in the event, but when I click on it to view the PDF file, it brings up a gray screen. Multiple attachments to multiple events do not work. I can share or click Done. The attachments work in the desktop web site.  I can see the attachments in the Calendar event on my phone, but when I click on them, it only brings up a blank page without any content. The file size shows in the list of attachments too.  iOS 10.3.2 img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/daeai.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vKgDk.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment362583> If possible, could you please add a screenshot of the blank/gray screen you get? <comment362734> Interesting. I just tried this on my phone and it just said there was an error opening the attachment. I'd file this as a bug. <comment363071> what is the original source app of the .PDF files ? Try with one that was created by Adobe. <comment363654> I don't know. Downloaded from a web site. They work in Safari if I view them from the Google Calendar desktop web site.
