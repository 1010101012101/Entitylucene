Mail.app El Capitan no longer supports non-icloud email 'from' addresses? <body> In prior versions of Mail.app, one could add a comma-separated list of email addresses to the iCloud account configuration, which would enable the user to select a particular "from" address when composing an email.  Is this impossible now, via any means, in El Capitan? It seems we cannot amend the automatic configuration of the iCloud account configuration in Mail.app. Furthermore, adding a custom IMAP account with iCloud configuration details fails to authenticate. Some notes:  ul liThis question is not about adding @icloud aliases./li liThis question is not about using another third-party service (e.g. gmail) to obtain the ability to use different "from" addresses./li /ul  I just want to use the single iCloud account and have multiple "from" addresses that are not of the @icloud.com domain, like we've always been able to do prior to El Capitan.  <comment269152> I'm somewhat confused as to your previous working method. Mail accounts behave just the same in El Cap as before, except that the setup is now duplicated into System Prefs, though doesn't have to be managed from there, it can still be done in Mail, as before. I have a dozen email accounts, only 2 of which are iCloud/me.com, the rest are all kinds, from gmail to exchange. <comment269383> See the first sentence of my question. One can no longer add a comma-separated list of non-icloud email addresses to the iCloud account configuration. <comment269441> Yeah, that's the bit I didn't understand...
