macOS Sierra: ulimit maxproc only 2500? <body> macOS Sierra introduced us to the ulimit-Justin-Bieber-restriction. Thanks, Apple!  According to this tutorial you can set ulimit max manually by creating two files. In the tutorial max. processes is at 2048.  Did this. Problem is: my max. processes per user is 2500. Found out via try &amp; error. Great stuff!  Why? Why can't I go over this number? Tried 2600, after reboot codeuname -a/code shows 1064. What is this number, why exactly 1064? Why am I limited in user processes anyway? The default number was 709...  P.S.: for those who wonder why I need such a "high" number: it's because of JMeter and the thread handling there. If I don't manually edit the maxproc, JMeter just won't run properly. Or not at all.  <comment373997> IIRC the hard limit is 2500 for every 8 GB of installed RAM (e.g. 32 GB  10,000 maxproc) <comment374038> OK, but due to the fact that my machine offers 16GB the maximum should be 5000...
