Mac OS: Disable the eject button/option, disable option to unmount drive from Finder <body> I have external drive which is always connected to my Mac. I want to disable the option to umnount/eject this certain drive in Finder. Is there any option to do such thing? I'd like to disable the button &amp; the ability to drag'n'drop the drive to the Trash.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/daiR9.png" alt=""  <comment302468> Also, see http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/157589/remove-eject-button-from-finder?rq=1 <comment302471> @patrix I need to disable unmounting just for certain single drive. <comment302472> The answers to the question linked to at the top of your question work for one or several drives and prevent accidental ejects.
