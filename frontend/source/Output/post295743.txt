iOS Home app notification sound <body> Is there a way to change the sounds for notifications from a HomeKit device? I have a flood device and want to make sure I don't overlook a notice.  <answer295922> No, you cannot change the notification sound unless the app supports it (or it is one of the notification types listed under Settings  Sounds &amp; Haptics), which Home does not (and it is not).
