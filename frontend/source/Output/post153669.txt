How to send and archive emails from iPhone or iPad? <body> In gmail, I have a button that both sends and archives a message at once. When I send emails from my iPad or iPhone, the messages stay in the inbox. Is there a setting I can use to make the mobile functionality the same as the computer?   <comment180913> are you using the gmail application on ios or the native mail application?
