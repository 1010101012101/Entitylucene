How do I change $PATH and set it to the default directory? <body> For some reason when I run codeecho $PATH/codeI get the following directory: code/Users/&lt;home&gt;/Library/Applications//code.  How do I set it back to its default location so that I don't have to run this command, codeexport PATH=/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin/code each time I want to run commands in Terminal?   Thanks for the consideration  <answer119201> First, check the contents of your code~/.profile/code and code~/.bash_profile/code for any lines involving writing paths to $PATH.  If this doesn't help, check the contents of code/etc/paths/code and code/etc/paths.d//code for any path that you don't want to be included in your $PATH.  Furthermore, you can show what code is being run by bash by adding the following to the top of code/etc/profile/code:  precodeset -x /code/pre  Save the file, then open a new Terminal window. This should show when and how the $PATH variable is being overwritten.  <answer119203> Check to see if you have this file: code~/.MacOSX/environment.plist/code That file can be used to set environment variables for OS X applications, not just shell commands. If the codePATH/code variable is being set in that file you will get all kinds of wonky behavior. This Apple Technical Q&amp;A document leads me to believe the environment.plist file has been deprecated. In nearly every case you do not want this file anyways so if you have consider deleting it.  <comment139030> What is in your ~/.profile or ~/.bash_profile
