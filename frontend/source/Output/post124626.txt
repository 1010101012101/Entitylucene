Google Quick Scroll extension for Safari <body> There is a great Chrome extension Google Quick Scroll that scrolls to funded text on a page after googling it. I want it for Safari but cannot find any alternatives or so. Is there?  <answer124648> Not quite the Google Quick Scroll but it works as well.  The kbdcmd/kbd + kbdF/kbd will open the search window, type or copy the text in it.  <comment145810> That's actually exactly what the plugin does as far I can see, nice catch. <comment146372> I'm doing it every time already. I just bored and want to automate my work.
