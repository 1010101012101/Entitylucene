"Use F1, F2 as standard function keys" no longer there: how can I control my volume through keyboard? <body> Apparently this option is now gone in the keyboard settings on OSX Lion, or maybe it does not appear because I am using a Dell keyboard  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fcf1Y.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Now, I am not particularly concerned about it. If I press kbdF12/kbd, I get the dashboard. The problem is that I have no keys to set the volume anymore. How can I set the volume, considering I can't create a keyboard shortcut (there's no menu name to bind) ?  <answer51017> This seems to be the only answer (other than buy a mac keyboard): https://superuser.com/questions/61001/how-do-i-press-the-fn-key-using-a-pc-keyboard-on-a-mac
