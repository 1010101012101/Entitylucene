OSX asking for my password <body> OSX asks for my user password pretty often -- seemingly whenever it needs to use Keychain.  How do I make it stop asking me?  <answer38741> As you phrased this, it generally occurs because the login password was reset at some point, and now the "login" keychain is protected with a different password than the account as a whole. The other possibility is that the keychain is set to lock automatically. Both issues can be addressed using strongKeychain Access/strong, which lives in your strongUtilities/strong folder.  h2If you do not know the password:/h2  ol liChoose emPreferences/em from the emKeychain Access/em menu.br img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qVQ6z.png" alt="Choose Preferences from the Keychain  menu"  /li liClick emReset My Default Keychain/embr img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/BTgjh.png" alt="Keychain Preferences window"  /li /ol  h2If you do know the password, but Keychain is auto-locked/h2  ol liHighlight the "login" keychain on the left of the main window.br img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Wk6bO.png" alt="login keychain in source list"  /li liChoose emChange Setting for keychain "login"â€¦/em from the emEdit/em menubr img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5uvf1.png" alt="edit menu image"  /li liAdjust settings as desired.

In general, the password prompts are a security feature.  I'm not sure if there's a way to disable them globally, but if there is, it's probably not a wise thing to do anyway. <comment43815> Check the relevant keychains in *Keychain Access*. `login` does not lock automatically by default. If you changed this setting, you'll need to enter the password whenever you need to access something in it outside the unlock grace period.
