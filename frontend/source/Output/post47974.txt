How to figure out iOS device battery health? <body> I'm looking for ways, similar to coconutBattery for OS X to figure out current health of battery for iOS devices.  <answer49126> Found an easier way. Jailbreak your phone and install codeBatteryInfo Lite/code. It's a free, ad-sponsored application. Tested on iPhone 3gs, iPhone 4 and iPad and it works. BatteryInfo Lite provides the following useful information:  ul liTemperature/li liCapacity (current, design, maximum)/li liCharge Level/li liCycle count/li liVoltage/li liBootVoltage/li liBattery Serial number/li liModel number/li /ul  Here is a screenshot of the application running on my iPhone 4.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dWR4g.png" alt="BatteryInfo Lite screenshot"  EDIT: Great news! The latest (3.2) version of coconutBattery supports iOS battery health information. Just download it and connect your iPhone.  <answer94650> I dont't want jailbreak, after search by Google finally I found iBackupBot 4.0 works for me (from http://www.icopybot.com/blog/check-ipad-iphone-battery-charge-cycle-count-without-jailbreaking.htm):     ol   liConnect your iPad, iPhone or iPod Touch to computer, then launch iBackupBot./li   liSelect your iPad, iPhone or iPod Touch in Devices window, then click More Informations in right side window/li   liiBackupBot will pop up a window to show many informations about your iPad, iPhone or iPod Touch, include the battery charge cycle   count, battery campacity and more/li   /ol   <answer101311> There are apps that you can use to assess battery health, but I recommend a Mac/PC app called iBackupBot. Tether your device to your computer, navigate to the lower left window pane, select the device, and click the link for codeMore Informations/code. The top portion of the resulting window will look something like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uR3Co.png" alt="enter image description here"  EDIT: The best iOS app I have used to provide this info is BatteryLogger Plus. However, it requires a jailbreak. Non-JB apps seem to provide optimal operating information, but not cycle count information. This may be a function of App Store limitations, which is why BatteryLogger Plus is a Cydia store app instead.  <answer192977> If you have a Mac, try coconutBattery. Very simple to use! ;) img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hvBIb.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer193012> Yes, many apps can check the battery status, I use Battery Doctor.  <answer205499> I upvoted mspasov's answers (Battery Info Lite, and coconutBattery 3.2). The app of choice seems to change from time to time. As of iOS 8.4 it is  http://batterylife.rbtdigital.com  I'm posting this more as a reminder to myself because if a Jailbreak for iOS 9 comes out, I'll probably wipe my phone and... forget what the battery app is called.   Cheers!   Colin  <answer215320> I've found a regular App Store app (doesn't require jailbreak) that does all of this: Battery Health.   It's not free, but for what it's worth...  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/JPLlL.png" alt="screenshot#1" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hYAnk.png" alt="screenshot#2"  strongUpdate:/strong This app has been removed by Apple.   <answer243363> This app does not require a jailbreak: batterylifeapp.com  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/cVAmf.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment56974> works like a charm ! <comment110948> Answers on Ask Different need to be more than just a link. It's okay to include a link, but please summarize or excerpt it in the answer. The idea is to make the answer stand alone. <comment141262> Thanks Dave. And iBackupBot doesn't require a "jailbroken" device. <comment190783> Doesn't seem to work on iOS 8.1.1 - does anyone have an alternative? <comment206844> @Colin try coconutBattery 3.2 - works like a charm. <comment229841> Hi ZÃ© M., welcome to Ask Different. Please add a link to the app you suggest on your response and if you are in any way related to it, disclose it. Thanks! <comment229883> Welcome to Ask Different!

Thanks! <comment260059> In my humble opinion Battery Doctor does absolutely nothing. Tells me nothing I didn't already know, shows no meaningful information. Just a bunch of pretty graphics and animations. I don't get how they get 5,000 5 star reviews... <comment262399> So far the simplest way to get battery information from your iPhone. <comment272579> Hmm, how did they manage to get it past App Store reviews.. <comment272612> This is awesome - somehow my new 6s plus battery capacity took a huge hit after a snowboarding trip - it appears to have permanently reduced the battery capacity (any idea on how to fix that?) thx. <comment332046> Not available in Dutch Store.
