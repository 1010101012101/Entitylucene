How can I import a .terminal file using the command line? <body> I'm writing a (Bash) script to automate setting up my Mac environment and would like to do this, except using the command line only. I'd also like to make that theme the default.  I have a .terminal file exported and all ready to go, I just can't figure out how to do this programmatically. Is there a documentation for this somewhere that I'm missing?  ... or would these be easier using AppleScript? Never done that before though.  <answer99036> Use the "open" command:  precodeopen ~/MyTerminalSettings.terminal /code/pre  <answer99039> This isn't an answer but the basic bricks you will have to use to write your shell script.  ol liCheck that codeTerminal/code isn't running to avoid corrupting its plist:  pre if ps ax | grep '[/]Terminal' /dev/null 2&1 ; then     echo Terminal running! &2 && exit 2 fi # go ahead /pre  beware to the code[/]/code which is here to avoid to codegrep/code your codegrep/code command which will be always successfull./li liConvert your codeTerminal/code plist to a text file with:  pre     plutil -convert xml1 ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.Terminal.plist /pre/li liStrip your code.terminal/code file from its header, let's says its name is codeimported.terminal/code  precodesed -n '/&lt;dict&gt;/,/&lt;\/dict&gt;/p' imported.terminal &gt;tmp.terminal /code/pre/li liInsert this codetmp.terminal/code plist within the code~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.Terminal.plist/code  inside the right dictionary.  This will need some context analysis to do it right. I'd chose codeperl/code if I had to do it, but codeawk/code, codeex/code, or codesed/code might be easier with a few lines and testing./li /ol  <comment116391> Might be kind of tricky to not have Terminal running while you have a script running in Terminal :-) <comment116393> I thought Matt wanted to do this from a shell and not directly from a Terminal because he is not doing this from a Terminal (for example through a `ssh`). But this should be clarified. <comment116396> Why do you want to make this setting from a shell and not directly from within `Terminal`? <comment116404> That opens a terminal window which might get in the way (though, perhaps that can be stifled) -- and it does seem to import the theme... but how would I set it as the default theme? <comment116409> @danielAzuelos So I can automate the process. <comment116422> How do you intend to run this shell script? From a `Terminal`? <comment116444> Well, from a shell at least. If I had to do it from a Terminal, hopefully this automation script is the only one I'd have to run in the default Terminal settings. <comment116445> Either way. Whichever is easier. <comment116457> â†’ Matt: do you have to do this configuration more than once (i.e. on more than one account or on more than one computer)? <comment116458> As Patrix noted it, one path will be hard. One can't easily modify `Terminal` plist if the shell doing the task is forked from this same `Terminal` program. When `Terminal` will terminate, it will overwrite all the modification done thus far. This was the reason for my suggested step 1. <comment116494> @danielAzuelos Hopefully not -- my idea is to be able to re-configure my own workstation whenever I re-install the OS or something. For years I was using Windows and I hated having to reconfigure everything manually, and with Mac being a Unix system it's nice that I can more easily script things. <comment116495> True, okay, understood. <comment125073> I think you should be able to perform step 4 without scripting it yourself. See http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/57960/how-can-i-export-text-substitutions-from-lion-for-import-into-mountain-lion <comment233459> @Matt - did you ever manage to do this? I'm also looking for a way to import as default, for the same reason :) <comment233529> No, but I'll be pursuing this again later this year, probably the apple script or automator route.
