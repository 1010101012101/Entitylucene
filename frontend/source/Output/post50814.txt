Automator action to adjust volume on audio files <body> I am looking for an Automator action (or an app with Automator support) that can adjust the volume on audio files (something like set to 150% of input file volume), preferably free.  <answer50817> How about something like SoX (free/donationware). It's features page lists wide variety of volume/level effects, including:     ul   liVolume/level effects   ul   li.../li   li.../li   livol: Adjust audio volume/li   /ul/li   /ul   According to the SoX documentation, the following should double the volume of codeinput.wav/code and write it to codeoutput.wav/code (the value after the -v flag is a multiplier)  codesox -v 2.0 input.wav output.wav/code  You should be able to use this in an Automator workflow using the "Run Shell Script" action.
