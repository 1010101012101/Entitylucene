How to open numbers spreadsheet in 2 separate windows <body> I often find it useful to have two tabs of one spreadsheet open in separate windows. In Excel this is easy (Windows/New Window).  Is there any way to achieve this in Numbers (as of Version 3.5)?  For the record, I've tried searching for an answer to this, but needless to say, searches including "Numbers" and "Windows" doesn't lead to anything useful.  <answer163217> This is currently not possible. You can provide feedback to Apple here:  ul lihttps://www.apple.com/feedback/numbers.html/li /ul  <answer163223> As a workaround - you can open a spreadsheet, then press kbdCmd/kbd+kbdN/kbd, choose the first template, and open the spreadsheet from that new window.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3RUDt.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer163244> Thinking about this some more, I have figured out a workaround. Though it's not altogether satisfactory, it could be useful in some cases. The workaround is iCloud.  Save the Numbers spreadsheet to iCloud drive, and then open it from a web browser. Open a new browser window and again open the spreadsheet from iCloud drive and you now have the spreadsheet open in 2 windows.  You could also have a local copy open in Numbers, with additional windows provided by iCloud browser windows, though there would be some lag between local changes appearing in iCloud and visa versa.  <answer210208> There is a (clumsy) workaround. From the File menu select Duplicate and a new window will open with a copy of the spreadsheet. Just be care to use it only to read and make updates to the original spreadsheet. When you are done, you can close and choose delete on the copy.  <comment191075> Sorry, but that makes no sense to me... if I do cmd-N and choose the first template, I just get a new, blank spreadsheet. You're screenshot looks like an older version of Numbers - maybe what you suggest no longer works in the current version? <comment191077> Thanks for the definitive answer - I've sent the feedback to Apple too. <comment191078> That's a very clever workaround! <comment191085> @rowatt possibly! Sorry I didn't pay attention to the version. Basically what I did to achieve the above was: 1. Open a spreadsheet 2. Press Cmd+N 3. Create new spreadsheet by clicking the template 4. 2 windows are now open. It may be that this doesn't work in the latest version - but your workaround is very clever - +1! <comment191257> I can open 2 windows in Numbers, but not two windows from the same document. Is your method allowing 2 windows for one document in the older version? <comment191259> @rowatt yes - older version, sorry about that! <comment349299> Clumsy or not it works!  Thanks for the tip.
