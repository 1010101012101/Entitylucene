Can I exclude itunes from the Software Update feature in system preference? <body> I've reverted from 11 back to 10.7 three times by now because I keep forgetting to uncheck iTunes whenever it prompts me to install patches. I'd like to be able to tell the updater to skip over iTunes automatically.  <answer85824> In the Software Update app, select the update and select codeIgnore Update.../code from the codeUpdate/code menu.  If you ever want to bring it back, select codeReset Ignored Updates/code from the codeSoftware Update/code menu.
