Noticebly larger amount of free space reported compared to the graph in Storage view <body> My MacBook Pro is of 256 GB. Although I haven't used much of it's space, I'm kind of facing an issue. When I click the Apple menu on top left corner and go to codeAbout This Mac &gt; Storage/code, it mentions 213 GB free of 256 GB but slightly below there is a bar, which is about half filled (approximately 160 GB acquired).  The most amazing part is 160 GB is being acquired by applications, and I haven't downloaded application more than 6 or 7.  Can anyone tell me why the bar is filled but still it showing I'm left behind with 213 GB? I really appreciate if someone help me out with this.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FStKr.png" alt="Screenshot of the Storage view"  <answer209584> Sometimes spotlight can mess up that graph.  I would open Finder and use the preferences to change the setting on calculate all folder sizes or use a tool like Daisy Disk to double check the sizes.  If you have that much space used but things are mis-classified, you can reset spotlight and leave the machine running for a few hours as it re-reads the storage contents.  If you don't have that much space used, boot to Recovery HD and run Disk Utility to repair the volume and drive.  <comment252818> Actually my mac OS is Yosemite if i upgrade it to El Captain, wouldn't this issue will be solved automatically? <comment252825> El Capitan will run the disk check for you. It's more risky since you might have apps or extensions that aren't ready for El Cap, but if you have a backup, why not jump. I love El Capitan changes and feel it's a great OS. I did have a backup in case things didn't work, though.
