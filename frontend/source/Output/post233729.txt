Specfic epubs downloaded outside the iBooks store not syncing on a particular mac <body> I have a handful of epubs I downloaded outside of the iBooks Store and read them across two different macs and an iPhone.   For reasons I cannot explain some books’ data  (highlights, notes, place in book) will sync across the devices while others do not.  The following options are turned on in my iPhone settings:  ul liSync Bookmarks and Notes/li liSync Collections/li /ul  On both macs I have the following turned on:  ul liSync bookmarks, highlights, collections across devices/li /ul  I have not used syncing via iTunes. So some books sync via iCloud while others do not.  Despite syncing turned on, I cannot get a Macbook Pro to sync with the highlights on the iPhone for certain book. I drag the epub into iBooks on the Macbook and it thinks its a “new” book. FWIW, I have a Mac Mini that seems to sync fine.  How can I correct this?  strongHardware:/strong  Macbook Pro  Intel Core i7 3.1 Ghz  OS X 10.11.4  Mac Mini 2.3 GHz quad-core Intel Core i7 OS X 10.11.4  iPhone SE 64GB iOS 9.3.1  Thanks in advance.  <answer258467> Go to system preferences- icloud - icloud drive options...  Then look for ibook entry, check it. Done  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/063Rs.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment286012> Good news is that you aren't alone. I spent 2 hours with a Senior Applecare Adviser about this exact issue. It's also obnoxiously inconsistent. I've seen data go up from one unit but not to anything else. iOS devices and OS X devices seem totally separated. There's currently a ticket in for Apple Engineering for the situation. If I learn more, I'll make sure to post it here. <comment317812> I also have this very same problem. <comment355557> I have tried the various recommendations like activating / deactivating iBooks iCloud syncing as well as 'Sync bookmarks, highlights, collections across devices', restarting devices, but syncing highlights & collections never works reliably across Mac, iPad and iPhone. iOS version 10.2 & Mac OS Sierra 10.12.4. Has anyone gotten this to work?
