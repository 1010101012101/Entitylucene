El Capitan - Weather search in Spotlight not working <body> I've just upgraded my Mac to OS X El Capitan and typed:  codeweather in Sao Paulo, BR/code  I got nothing.   I'm actually in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Any ideas?  <answer219450> From testing on my Mac, I can confirm that codeweather in Sao Paulo, BR/code doesn't actually show the weather, whereas codeweather in Sao Paulo/code, or codeweather in Sao Paulo, Brazil/code does. Whether or not the code√£/code is used doesn't affect the result:   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WuA3x.png" alt="natural language testing"  If these inputs don't return the natural language search results, then check on the OS X Feature Availability page. You may need to strongreconfigure your Language &amp; Region settings in System Preferences/strong in order to use the feature, until it's supported for your current Language and Region settings.  If neither of these methods provide solutions, you may want to try strongdisabling and reenabling Spotlight Suggestions/strong.  ol liOpen System Preferences &amp; navigate to codeSpotlight/code/li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3LuWI.png" alt="enter image description here"  ol start="2" liEnsure that codeSpotlight Suggestions/code is checked; if it's already checked, uncheck spotlight suggestions, then recheck it. Now, try bringing up Spotlight and you should be able to get the weather from typing codeweather in sao paulo/code/li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/sLotx.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment289546> Perfect !
