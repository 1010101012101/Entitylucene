How do I fix the SSL warning I get when visiting github.com? <body> I see the following warning when visiting http://www.github.com/ after July 26, 2014. I get this warning in both Chrome and Safari on my OS X Mavericks-equipped iMac.  Should I worry about this? How do I fix it?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/iIlVu.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer140807>    Should I worry about this?   You should always distrust SSL connections that are using expired certificates. This could indicate a simple oversight on the part of the website operator emor/em it could indicate a malicious attempt to intercept encrypted communications between the website and your browser. Heed your browser's warnings and don't load the page when these warnings occur.     How do I fix it?   OS X users can delete the expired certification from their keychains. This certificate was issued by DigiCert and they have a blog post that details what happened and how to fix it. Paraphrased from the post:  ol liStart the codeKeychain Access/code application (you may be asked for your password when you do this)/li liIn Keychain Access go to codeView -&gt; Show Expired Certs/code and search for codeDigiCert High/code to find the codeDigiCert High Assurance EV Root CA/code that expired on strongJuly 26, 2014/strong. emIt's important you only delete the expired certificate here./em/li liDelete this certificate and close Keychain Access./li /ol  You may also need to restart Chrome and Safari for the warning to disappear. Also, make sure you check all Keychains and verify your Category filters - certificates or All Items should be selected.
