Yosemite imessage not in sync with iPhone 6 <body> I have latest software on both Macbook and iphone 6 plus.  My imessage thread on Macbook is not in sync with the message thread on my iphone for a given phone #.  For example, on a given day and recipient/phone # I can see a whole bunch of message exhange on Macbook iMessage. Those same messages do not appear on iPhone messages for that same recipient and day.  Bottom line all message threads on iPhone are not in sync with iMessage.  Does anyone know how to fix this?  <comment186670> What do you mean by not in sync ?? As in not showing the same new iMessages/SMS's, or do you mean that if you delete a message on one device, then it is not removed on the other devices - or what do you mean ?? <comment186671> Are the missing messages shown in blue or green in the iPhone? <comment186674> Hi Patrick, all imessage sent are blue, received are gray. Same respective colors on iPhone. <comment186675> Rene, I mean some messages that show in Imessage do not show on iPhone. PS: imessage sent are blue, received are gray. <comment186676> You have set iMessage up so you can be reached with the same phone number and email addresses ?? <comment186677> Rene, yes I did. <comment186682> The messages you don't get on you iPhone - how are they sent - to your phone number or your email adr. ?? and you are sure that you have the same checkboxes checked where you can be reached ?? <comment186688> I am not sure if messages sent to me were done using my phone # or email address. Is there a way to know which one was used by the message sender ?  In my iMessage preferences under "You can be reached for messages at:", both my iPhone phone # and email address are checked. <comment186694> You should be able to see it in the details on each message - it should show the phone number or email adr. in a blue text/link. <comment186728> hmm I have never seen either an email or phone # text/link in a blue bubble iphone message or imessage. Do you have a snapshot of what that looks like ?
