Photos on Mac OS X - avoid importing photos that were previously imported and subsequently deleted <body> I want to avoid importing photos that were previously imported and subsequently deleted from my Photos library.  My workflow:  ol liImport e.g. 10 photos from my camera into Photos in Mac OS X via the memory card reader/li liEject and remove the memory card/li liDelete e.g. 5 unwanted photos from Photos after the import is completed/li liRe-insert the memory card to perform another import - the originally imported, but subsequently deleted, photos are again shown for re-import. This makes it very hard not to re-import previous photos and have to delete them all over again./li /ol  Using Photos 1.0.1 on Yosemite 10.10.5.  In previous version of iPhoto, there used to be a checkbox something like "hire already imported photos" - and this worked such that it hid photos even if they were deleted from the library after import.  Is there a way to do this in Photos?
