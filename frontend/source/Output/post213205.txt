Use the backup to get your own content (photos, messages, etc), and ignore the apps. Download them fresh from the app store.   <answer250706> This has been a pain since the move to iOS 9.    There is not ultimate fix for this, but these are things I've found that helped in various combinations and order. I will update this answer with additional workarounds whenever I come across them.    ul liSometimes its stuck at this place:br iTunes 10.5 and IOS 5 sync hang at "Waiting for items to copy", possible fix  /li liAt other times, this has helped:br http://www.seriouslytrivial.com/2015/09/26/iphone-5-to-iphone-6s-upgrade-nightmare/ http://www.seriouslytrivial.com/2015/09/30/fixing-iphone-apps-stuck-on-waiting//li liAt times, while I was still connected to iTunes I'd go to AppStore and download the "Waiting" App from there, and other times that would not work. /li liCertain times, the number of Waiting Apps/ Warnings would just slowly decrease each time I make iTunes sync with the phone.    ul liA recent example was from 200  193  175 and so on.. /li /ul/li /ul  There are some grave issues with Apple's iTunes Sync with iPhones and made even more grave with recent App Slicing and iCloud integration, we'll have to reply on Trial and Error some of the above on this.     And for a 64GB iPhone, given that neither the USB 2 speed connection or the WiFi speeds are good enough or fast enough to Backup and Restore the data (It took my iPhone 64 GB 12+ Hours to do a Restore from Backup and was still faulty), so when iPhone's can sync at USB 3 SuperSpeeds, we might have a better experience.   <comment257429> Are you saying not to "restore from backup"? Or only those specific apps after the Restore?   What if I have crucial data in some of those apps? <comment261561> Restore from backup to get your unique content back onto the phone. Get as far as you can, I'm going to assume at least some of the apps will install correctly. If the crucial data is stored in iCloud, grabbing a new copy of the app from the app store should not affect it.
