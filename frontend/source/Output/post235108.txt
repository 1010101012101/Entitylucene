Blocking applications from terminal? <body> I want to disable Safari because I end up using it to waste time on sites like youtube. I use Stayfocud and Leechblock on chrome and firefox, but there isn't anything good for Safari (WasteNoTime is too easy to disable). So initially I wanted to delete Safari, but I'm a little hesitant, because I don't want to hurt the OS in any way. So I wanted to know if there was a way to disable or "block" Safari using terminal. I realize that there are apps like Focus which can do this, but they are paid. Thank you for your help.   <comment287552> This question may already container your answer: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/182275/disable-safari-in-os-x <comment287557> @nelson2tm I have seen that question. Unfortunately the method outlined in the answer is not working for me. It says that I do not have the "necessary permission". <comment287886> If you're on El Capitan, there's new security which is probably why you got the error about permission.
