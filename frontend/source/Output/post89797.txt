Encrypted/Journaled Seagate won't accept Password <body> I have a 2011 MacBook Pro Intel running Mountain Lion. I have a 2tb Seagate External Drive with 3 partitions: all three were set up the same way with different passwords as a person who used to live here was burning DVD's from my digital backups I felt the need to do so. I was having no issues with this for the first six months I had the drive set up like this but about two months ago this changed. I can no longer mount one of the partitions. It will not accept the password I KNOW goes to it. All I can figure is that, some how, the system encryption key must have been damaged. The only other pieces of Info I can give you is this. First, I didn't use firevault for this but Disk Utl. Second, at times, I can mount one of the other drives and even though I get the "shaking window" as though I typed in the wrong pw it still mounts the drive. Odd.  <answer101803> Same problem here. Read and on and I'll tell you what I did to solve this problem:  I do Time Machine to an encrypted external Hard Disk. I stored the password to the disk in the default Keychain, and the system mounted the disk automatically after plugging it in. But suddenly, last morning, after I plugged in the disk, it prompted me for a password (it never did, since it was set to remember the password). In that dialogue, type a wrong password and the dialog does the wrong-password, shake animation, and it prompts for a password again; strongbut type the correct password and the dialog freezes, like this: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kKC5J.png" alt="stops responding"/strong  The solution I have found to work is as follows:  ol liLaunch Disk Utility and Select the Drive that won't unlock./li liClick on Verify Disk (after it finished it told me the disk needed repair), and after it finishes with the verification, click Repair Disk./li liI let the computer do it's job, and after a while (about 30 min), it told me the disk couldn't be repaired, strongbut the disk was now mounted, and working normally/strong. Like shown in the following screenshot:/li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1hwOR.png" alt=""  And now, my Time Machine drive works normally again: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/E8nTI.png" alt="Time Machine icon indicating a backup is in progress"  So, launch Disk Utility, then Verify and Repair your faulty disk as needed. This worked in my case.  <answer142846> Andres's answer is good (Thank you!), and if the first attempt to repair doesn't work, you might have to run it a few times:  ul liverify/li lirepair/li liverify/li lirepair/li /ul  and yes then it did reappear from 'greyed' to 'colour' disk on the side panel.  For me to see it mounted, I had to unmount it, pull the USB out and replug it back in.
