Migration assistant runs forever <body> Using Migration assistant over wifi, both source and target machines spin wheels and don't find each other. Both machines have firewall off and set to IVP6 automatic. Target is Yosemite and source is 10.6.8 Any ideas  <comment191871> "don't find each other" means that you haven't even be able to initiate a data migration yet, correct? Did you try to restart  both computers already? Do you have a way to connect them via LAN instead of WiFi?
