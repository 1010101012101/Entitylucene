How can I know which formula create this file <body> precode$ brew link binutils  Linking /usr/local/Cellar/binutils/2.24... Warning: Could not link binutils. Unlinking...  Error: Could not symlink file: /usr/local/Cellar/binutils/2.24/share/info/configure.info Target /usr/local/share/info/configure.info already exists. You may need to delete it. To force the link and overwrite all other conflicting files, do:   brew link --overwrite formula_name /code/pre  As I see I can not link binutils because there is configure.info file in my filesystem.  I am just wondering if there is any way to know which of installed home-brew formulas had installed this file ?  <answer125258> If the file was installed by Homebrew, it is a symlink to a file in code/usr/local/Cellar//code:  precode$ ls -l /usr/local/share/info/bash.info lrwxr-xr-x  1 admin  wheel  45 Mar 15 15:25 /usr/local/share/info/bash.info -&gt; ../../Cellar/bash/4.2.45/share/info/bash.info /code/pre  It's also possible that the file was not installed by Homebrew. code/usr/local//code is often the default installation target in makefiles, and it is also used by installers and by other package managers like codepip/code.  <comment146401> Could you provide us the content of `configure.info` file ? <comment146406> I know that it is a gdb's file (configure.info - ../../Cellar/gdb/7.7/share/info/configure.info).  But I am searching general way of solving this problems.
