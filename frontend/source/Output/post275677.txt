MacBook Pro 2nd HDD not detected anymore <body> there are a lot of potential problems here, so I really appreciate someone taking the time to read through this. Here goes:  At the beginning of the year I replaced the original HDD with an SSD and the DVD-drive with an additional HDD. Since about late January, the computer has episodically crashed on waking from sleep and required a force restart; sometimes I was able to wake and even login but then a freeze/crash would occur seconds later. This issue abated for a while, but returned at the beginning of the month again on a consistent basis - i.e. every time the computer is woken from sleep.  Two days ago the HDD (replacement of the DVD-drive) was suddenly no longer detected by the Mac OS X during regular usage - neither in Finder or with Terminal commands or Disk Utility. I re-inserted the ‘original HDD’ in place of the current one, and this emwas/em recognised. However, the current HDD is recognised without issue when connected via USB/SATA cable. When the original DVD-drive is re-inserted, this is not recognised by the OS X either; again, no issues when connected by USB/SATA cable. When using the ‘original HDD’ as an external USB startup disk, both the HDD and SSD were briefly recognised, but after a minute the HDD disappeared from the Finder menu (not found by Terminal either).  strongTL;DR/strong  Current status: SSD startup disk, HDD in DVD-drive slot (not detected). Both drives checked for integrity with Disk Utility - both appear OK.  VRAM and SMC have been reset multiple times - to little effect.  Logic board has been replaced twice by Apple - March 2014 and July 2014.   Frequently requires several attempts to boot - boot much slower in past week than previously experience with SSD.  Any help would be appreciated,  em-/em S  <comment346823> It sounds like you've attempted to repair and verify both drives from disk utility?  You may need to look into replacing the optical drive cable.
