Change keywords meanings of the terminal <body> I am running Maxima from the terminal, and there are some things that annoy me a little bit. For example, if I want to move left or right, instead of doing that, the terminal prints some weird combination of letters, for example code^[[C/code (when I press arrow right), code^[[D/code (left), code^[[A/code (up) and code^[[B/code (down).  Is there a way that arrows work as expected? Is it possible to make the terminal seem more like an editor, like codeTextWrangler/code?  <answer188136> If you are running the default terminal program that shipped with your Mac then the arrow keys should move you left and right on a line or (for the up and down keys) back and forth in the shell history.  When you first launch the shell and before you run your program does UP and DOWN scroll through history? If you type anything on the command line (and without pressing ENTER) does LEFT move you back over what you typed?  It may be that (whatever "Maxima" is) your program has different input methods and changes that of the default Mac O/S X shell.  <comment222582> Yes, normally it does up and down and left and right correctly, but with maxima it doesn't...do you know how to change the input methods? <comment222587> Then it is likely that Maxima is the culprit and you might need to take that up on a board that specifically supports that application.
