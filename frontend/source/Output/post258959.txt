Outlook 15.27 Ctrl-A and Ctrl-E shortcuts no longer working <body> I emoften/em have to use the kbdCtrl/kbd kbdA/kbd and kbdCtrl/kbd kbdE/kbd shortcuts to get to the start and end of lines in Outlook, and it looks like in the latest version (15.27), these no longer work.  Instead kbdCtrl/kbd kbdA/kbd behaves like Windows and selects everything, and kbdCtrl/kbd kbdE/kbd doesn't seem to do anything.    I can't figure out anything in settings or another way to override this behavior - has anyone encountered this or figured out a workaround?  <answer258971> I tested this out and can confirm that this did stop working.  However, there is a quick and easy fix: you can set your keyboard command in strongemCustomize Keyboard/em/strong directly in Word.  Under the strongTools/strong Menu in Word, select strongCustomize Keyboard/strong (it's at the very bottom)  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7H0qq.png" alt="enter image description here"  Next, in the strongemCategories/em/strong tab, select "All Commands."  Then in the strongemCommands/em/strong search for "endofline".  You can then assign kbdCtrl/kbd kbdA/kbd  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/UH1ah.png" alt="enter image description here"  Make sure you are saving to emNormal.dot/em (the default template) and select "OK."  You should have your keyboard shortcut restored.  <comment324082> Thank you so much - this is incredibly helpful.
