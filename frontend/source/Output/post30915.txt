iPhone Visual VoiceMail in Israel <body> I brought my unlocked iPhone 4S to Israel and got a local SIM card. The voicemail button is calling the voicemail instead of showing me the visual voicemail.  I asked my provider about it (Cellcom) and they had no idea what I was talking about. They didn't even know Visual Voicemail existed.  Is there a way to enable it?  <answer30917> Nope.  Visual Voicemail needs to be activated by the service provider as it uses their services. It requires some work on their side, so I would imagine they need a big group of people wanting it.  Out of interest, this Wikipedia article briefly covers the topic. There is no open standard for this feature, so it hasn't been deployed on a lot of networks due to the service provider having to provide the required interfaces.  <answer31846> Hi if you go to this page on the Apple website you will find a list of carriers that support Visual Voicemail.   Not all carriers have Visual Voicemail. Although it is shown as a main feature of iPhone  <comment36646> As far as i know, Israeli providers such as Cellcom does not support Visual Voicemail.
