Change Notification Style from Banner to Alert via AppleScript <body> does anybody know an easy way to make an apple script that changes the notification style for a specific app from "banners" to "alerts"? I've been trying for hours but I'm finding it hard to use the right combination of "tab group 1"/"scroll area 1"/"window 1" an so on... There is a script out there that seems to solve the problem but it doesn't seem to work for el capitan - maybe there is an easy fix?  Link to script  I'd like to have a possibility to make this change on several computers.  Thx in advance!  Daniel
