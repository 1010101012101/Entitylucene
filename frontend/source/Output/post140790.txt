Mac internal trackpad and keyboard not working on Yosemite <body> I have found some threads describing this problem on Google, but none of them provided an (working) answer.  I have stronginstalled beta of Yosemite/strong on my MBA (2013). I made no back-ups, but it's my secondary computer and I have no important data here. The problem is: internal trackpad and keyboard stopped working suddenly - during internet browsing on Safari. What's more, mac was running pretty slow during the first hours after the problem occured. Then, this issue fixed itself.  When I connect mouse and keyboard via USB - it' all OK. What I already did:  -PRAM Reset  -SMC Reset  -checked all what I could in system settings UI  -Reinstalling OS X   -Hard reset (erased disc) to factory settings with Maverics OS.   However, it should not be a hardware problem - I can enter recovery mode ( Cmd + R ) with my internal keyboard.  Does someone has any more suggestions ?
