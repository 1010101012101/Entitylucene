Setting Up Raid iMac <body> I have one lacie 2big thunderbolt 4th unit setup as raid 1. I want to add a lacie 2big thunderbolt 4th unit. How do I get it set up so the entire unit 1 is mirrored onto unit 2(Raid1)?  <answer116362> Easy, the Disk Utility program on OS X allows creation of software RAID.  ul liOpen Disk Utility from spotlight or /Applications/Utilities/li liType "Create RAID" into the help menu search term/li liGo to the article and follow the steps for strongCreate a mirrored RAID set/strong/li /ul  This does involve erasing all drives, so you'll want to be sure everything is backed up elsewhere before starting. On 10.11 El Capitan, this feature in the Disk Utility graphical tool was removed, so you would need to call the underlying codediskutil/code command that still has the RAID commands.  <answer219010> As of El Capitan, the Disk Utility application no longer provides RAID functionality, but it remains in the codediskutil/code command-line program. For brief instructions, type codediskutil appleRAID/code or codediskutil appleRAID create/code in the terminal. For more detailed information, type codeman diskutil/code.

It provides information     about, and allows the administration of, the partitioning schemes, layouts, and     formats of disks. This includes hard disks, solid state disks, optical discs,     CoreStorage volumes, and AppleRAID sets.  It generally manipulates whole vol-     umes instead of individual files and directories. /code/pre  On RAID:  precodeappleRAID | ar raidVerb [...]     AppleRAID verbs can be used to create, manipulate and destroy     AppleRAID volumes (Software RAID).  AppleRAID supports three basic     types of RAID sets:            o   "stripe" - Striped Volume (RAID 0)           o   "mirror" - Mirrored Volume (RAID 1)           o   "concat" - Concatenated Volume (Spanning)      Of these three basic types, only the "mirror" type increases fault-     tolerance.  Mirrors may have more than two disks to further increase     their fault-tolerance.  Striped and concatentated volumes are, in     fact, more vulnerable to faults than single disk volumes.      AppleRAID is not a replacement for backing up your data.  Backups     should be always be performed on a regular basis and before modify-     ing any RAID set using these commands. /code/pre  On creating a new RAID:  precode    create mirror | stripe | concat setName format devices ...                Create a new RAID set consisting of multiple disks and/or                RAID sets.  setName is used for both the name of the cre-                ated RAID volume and the RAID set itself (as displayed in                list). e.g. 'diskutil createRAID stripe MyArray JHFS+                disk1 disk2 disk3 disk4'.  Ownership of the affected                disks is required.  diskutil createRAID is a deprecated                synonym for diskutil appleRAID create. /code/pre  <comment136126> Is the only way to erase everything??? I don't just have a free 2tb lying around... <comment136153> You'll want to have a 2tb lying around to back things up that will be stored on the RAID unless you can afford to lose everything on the RAID. I haven't used an alternate raid software in years, but [SoftRAID](http://softraid.com/news.html) might give you better features and was recently updated for Mavericks. <comment264915> This was removed in El Capitan. Instead type `diskutil appleRAID` for help.
