Dell U2711 Flat Panel Monitor <body> I have a Dell U2711 Flat Panel Monitor, which I have been using with my Mac, preIntel and Intel. Suddenly I cannot acces to any control, instead a padlock appears on my screen. Any help?  <answer147395> Press and hold the two bottom buttons (4+5) for 15 seconds. The lock symbol will "unlock" after 15 seconds and you should be able to use the OSD menu again.  <comment173752> This is a display issue <comment173798> it worked. life is a lot easier thanks to people like you. <comment173832> Thanks, @FranciscoBatallerAlvarez.
