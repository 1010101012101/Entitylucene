Given its IP, how can I find out the name of a Windows PC on my network? <body> I'd like to find out the computer name of a Windows PC (like the name shown in the 'Shares' section of the Finder, e.g. bill-pc) given only its IP address. codenslookup/code doesn't do the trick.  I'm also interested in the reverse lookup: given its Windows name, how can I find out its IP address? codeping bill-pc/code or codeping bill-pc.local/code seems not to work in some cases.  <answer42212> If you're using Lion, you can use codesmbutil/code:  precodeusage: smbutil [-hv] subcommand [args] where subcommands are:  help       display help on specified subcommand  lookup     resolve NetBIOS name to IP address  status     resolve IP address or DNS name to NetBIOS names  view       list resources on specified host  dfs        list DFS referrals  identity   identity of the user as known by the specified host /code/pre  For example (assuming 192.168.1.9 is a valid IP on your network):  precodesmbutil lookup 192.168.1.9 smbutil status bill-pc /code/pre  If you're using Snow Leopard, you should be able to use codenmblookup/code:  precodenmblookup -A 192.168.1.9 nmblookup bill-pc /code/pre  <comment48026> Thanks! That's exactly what I wanted!
