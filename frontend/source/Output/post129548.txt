Will I lose all the old Time Machine backup files?  <answer129552> All the files currently located within the partition 'Time Machine' will be located in the partition 'Time Machine 1'. The partition 'Time Machine 2' will be empty and no files will be deleted.  Disk Utility should prompt you if the contents of Time Machine doesn't fit in Time Machine 1, but to be safe, check first.
