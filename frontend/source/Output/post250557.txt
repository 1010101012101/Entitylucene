Recover deleted files from Filevault 2 <body> On one partition of an external drive encrypted with Filevault 2, I have accidentally deleted a folder and files. Does decryption also decrypt the deleted files?  <answer250559> No - encryption/decryption is a completely separate process that will not affect what the OS sees as data (files/folders) versus available space.  You will need to run a file recovery program, such as DiskDrill or Data Rescue; the chance of success at retrieving your files will vary.  Finally, you should seriously consider a proper backup solution, anything from Apple's built-in Time Machine to 3rd party solutions like CrashPlan or BackBlaze.  <comment311215> Ok - Any pointers on a technical article that describes how Filevault 2 handles deletions of files? I've looked around extensively and come up short. <comment311300> FileVault 2 doesn't have anything to do with deletions - that's handled by the OS instead.  FileVault encrypts the drive, waits for a successful challenge at boot to unlock that drive, then the OS runs as normal.  You should be focused on the specific version of OS X you're using and the format of the drive (likely jHFS+).
