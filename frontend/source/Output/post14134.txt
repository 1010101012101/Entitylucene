Bluetooth mouse that doesn't require a USB dongle <body> Since my Macbook only has two USB ports, I'd like to get myself a mouse that can pair with the Mac's built-in bluetooth. The obvious choice is the Apple Magic Mouse, but at $70 it's pretty much overkill. I don't need the touch functionality, since the Mac's trackpad already does a great job with that.   I'm mostly looking for something that allows me accurate control, isn't too large (so I can toss it in my backpack), and isn't too expensive. And looks nice next to the Aluminum Macbook, or course. :)  <answer14136> The Logitech V470 Cordless Laser Mouse for BluetoothÂ® may suit your needs.  BTW: I've used Logitech mice for a long time now and can say that they're built very well. They're a pleasure to use. The MX1000 is the greatest mouse ever built in my opinion. I've yet to use a Bluetooth mouse though.  <answer14156> I've used the RadTech BT500 for some time and love it.  It's small, rechargeable, works well, and silver in color, to look good next to aluminum Macs.  <answer180838> Read about the Mad Catz R.A.T M. It is a mobile Gaming Mouse which doesen't require a dongle.  <comment15240> I've used a Logitech BT travel mouse for years now. Built well, compact size, good battery life. I don't think you could go wrong with the V470 recommended above. <comment15246> I can't speak for the OP or for pricing in his area, but here in Canada, a V470 costs only $10 less than a Magic Mouse. <comment17021> Hey @Neil, how did you go on your mouse hunt? <comment26168> Honestly, I've ended up swapping my Logitech mouse between my netbook and my Mac, also have gotten more comfortable with the trackpad. The Kensington I used to use is better than anything else I can find, but it's too pricey to replace just now. A better mouse trumps having that extra USB port, I think. <comment198244> Why do you say you want a USB mouse to use it via Bluetooth? <comment198245> Usually, we choose either a USB mouse or a Bluetooth mouse. <comment198257> @NicolasBarbulesco - That was a typo; I wanted to avoid tying up a USB port. Typo fixed.
