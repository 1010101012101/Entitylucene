How to change shape defaults in keynote? <body> I'm using Keynote 6.2. Is there a way to change the default properties of shape objects? Specifically, I'd like to get rid of the drop shadow and the advanced color fill. It's a pain to have to change it manually every time I create a new shape.  I figured out that I can create a shape, change the style and go to codeFormat | Advanced | Create shape style/code, then I can delete all the default styles by right clicking, so only my styles show. The problem is that when I create a new presentation, my custom styles disappear and the defaults come back. Is there any way to make them permanent?  Also, can I change the default text size and font?  <answer154538> Yes that is possible - you need to exchange the template file within Keynote.  First, save the presentation you want to use as a the new template with a code.kth/code extension. Keynote will not directly let you do that, so you need to rename the file in Finder.  Within the codeKeynote.app/code package, find the folder codeContents / Shared Support / Templates/code. To change the defaults of the "White" Theme in standard format, replace codeStandard.kth/code in the codeWhite/code folder.  I have also made a step by step guide with screenshots for the method.  <comment182029> Thanks!
