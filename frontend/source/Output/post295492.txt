Kali Linux dual boot on MacBook Air - WiFi not working <body> I installed Kali Linux on a partition on my MacBook Air 13-inch Early 2015 model, but unfortunately something went wrong and I corrupted my hard disk. But that's a separate story.   Fortunately now that I am back with the help of a backup I created, I think I'm brave enough to try the installation once again, but before that, I'm having a terrible issue with the WiFi. When I installed Kali Linux earlier, and even now when I boot it directly from the USB Drive I have, WiFi won't work. Even during the installation it was unable to detect my Network Interface card.   I can't connect to the internet so I don't think I can download any drivers through Linux. Please help me out here!   Specifications:  Wifi Card Type: AirPort Extreme  (0x14E4, 0x117)  Firmware Version:   Broadcom BCM43xx 1.0 (7.21.171.130.1a1)  <comment373121> If you search kali here - the drivers seem to be what hang everyone up once they have kali booting. https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/217075/kali-linux-dual-boot-wifi-not-working
