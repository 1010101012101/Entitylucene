some file system operations very slow, ssd <body> (macbook air 2012, noticed before I upgraded to mavericks)  on my SSD, newly downloaded files or newly created folders take a very long time to be moved, viewed, or examined. I have 1/5th of the free space available.  I also notice this after I extract an archive file, and try to look at its new folder, it takes upwards of 5 minutes before the file listing will return, in finder.  this concerns me as I have an incomplete backup, what is going on and how can I improve it?  <comment154585> Have you examined Activity Monitor.app to see if there is anything using a lot of RAM or CPU? How frequently to you shut your system down and is everything on your computer up-to-date? <comment154591> @AndrewU. nothing is using an abnormal amount of RAM or CPU, yet, an I/O operation would have nothing to do with that. I shut my system down maybe a few times a year, mainly system updates, but I haven't updated to 10.9.2, also not a solution unless it contains a fix specific for this issue which we have yet to identify <comment154610> I suggest to sign in with Guest Account and try to replicate the problem. It’ll help you to decide if it’s the OS level problem, or caused by third party apps. <comment154680> Well how about you test a restart and see if it helps...
