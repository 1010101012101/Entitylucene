Can I disable the MS Word import warning in Pages? <body> Every time I open a MS Word file in Pages, I get the little warning window that says the fonts aren't going to be perfect or whatever.  OK, Pages!  I get it.  You might not be perfect.  Is there any way to just get rid of this warning forever?  It's pretty annoying.  <comment231937> Save as a .pages? Change the font? <comment231955> It's easier to close the warning than to change the font and re-save a file. <comment231977> Yes but you would have to do this only once per file. Or maybe you only take a look at these files? <comment231994> I only have to close the warning once per file.  I want to disable the warning application-wide.
