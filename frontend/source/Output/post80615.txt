How can I find my Apple ID on my iPad? <body> My mum can't find her apple ID on her iPad. I'm not with her at the moment and do not have an iPad so I don't know where to look.  She already has an Apple ID set up on this iPad, so I don't want to set up another one.  <answer80616> The first option should be the most reliable:  ol liOpen Settings.app, scroll down and tap on "iTunes &amp; App Stores". The Apple ID that the device is currently signed into will be at the top of the screen next to "Apple ID"./li /ol  Alternate methods (only on iOS 5 or newer):  ol liSettings.app  iCloud (under "Account")/li liSettings.app  Messages  Send &amp; Receive At (under "Apple ID")/li liSettings.app  Facetime (under "Apple ID")/li /ol  <comment93012> Thanks, couldn't figure out over the phone
