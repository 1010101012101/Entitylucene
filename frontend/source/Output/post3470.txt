Trigger an Automator action with a sound <body> Is there any way to trigger an Automator action with a sound? I'd like to be able to record a sound and trigger an action every time my computer's microphone receives the sound.  <answer3483> Mac OS X comes with speech recognition (check System Preferences  Speech panel) but it can't easily recognize a generic sound, only built-in commands.  Now, it is possible to make an automator action or script that is triggered by an arbitrary phrase. However, if by "sound" you mean a beep, blip, crash or other sound that can't be  recognized as a string of phonemes (ie. speech in english or possibly another language) then we're into serious Objective C programming territory here.  <comment3161> Do you mean that Automator recognizes a sound that is coming from a microphone? <comment3163> @Martín I think he means when mac heard a sound run some automator script. <comment3175> @Am1rr yes but… from what I understand he wants it to be a “specific” sound recorded by him, which would be very difficult on its own. <comment3183> Not even Objective C, that will require a very decent knowledge of C and low level sound analysis algorithms. My head hurts and I only imagined it.
