I messed up my /.bash_profile and Bash will not recognize most commands <body> I was trying to add paths to my code~/.bash_profile/code and accidentally screwed up the final one right when I closed it. Now, I cannot use a majority of the basic shell commands, like codels/code, codetouch/code, etc. I can still use codeecho/code and codecd/code. When I codeecho/code my path, I get: codeâ€œ/Users/Forthman/Desktop/paml/bin:??/code. If I try other commands, I get: code-bash: touch: command not found/code.  My code~/.bash_profile/code is invisible, and so I cannot directly open it in TextWrangler or TextEdit. How can I fix this?   <answer251151> Open TextWrangler. Press the command key and o key. A dialog box will open. Press the shift key, the command key and the period key and your dot files will be visible in the dialog box.
