How to disable accidental trackpad input in Yosemite? <body> The solution to this problem in previous versions of OS X was a checkbox in the trackpad preferences that said "ignore accidental trackpad input." That option is no longer there in Yosemite.  Is it still possible to enable it, and if so how?  <answer233248> If you have a multi-touch trackpad Mac, the option no longer appears in System Preferences because it as enabled automatically. See https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201822.  strongUpdate 2016-04-03-1007/strongbr You may want to give BetterTouchTool a try. It enables fine grained control of trackpad behavior. Three items that may interest you in particular:  ol liDisable trackpad gestures after hitting a keyboard key to prevent accidental gestures while typing/li liThumb recognition (filters out thumb and palm . . .)/li liReenable gestures only after touching the center area of the trackpad/li /ol  <answer262149> I was having similar issues after purchasing a new MBP. What seemed to fix it for me was to go into codeSystem Peferences &gt; Trackpad &gt; Point &amp; Click/code and disable the following items:  precodeLook up &amp; Data (Tap with three fingers) Force Click and haptic feedback /code/pre  Since I don't need any of those features I just disabled all of them.  I code and don't use a lot of fancy trackpad features.  Try playing around with those options to see what works best for you.  If you need those options some of the time, you could probably make a script to quickly toggle them on and off.  UPDATE: Non-technical HACK:  While some of these tricks seemed to have helped, I found a very easy way to eliminate accidental thumb clicks while typing.  Place a 1/2 inch width strip of electrical tape across the top of the trackpad.  It may not look pretty but it gets the job done with no further hacks required!  img src="https://i.imgur.com/oPRgrKA.jpg" alt="Easy Electrical Tape Hack"  UPDATE: Pro tip: To insure the area of electrical tape is not trackable, use 2 layers of tape with a thin strip of aluminum foil between the layers. You probably could use clear or scotch tape for the top layer for a thinner profile. Just be careful the foil doesn't make direct contact with the trackpad itself.  <answer263212> I changed "Click" to "Firm" in the menu.   System Peferences  Trackpad  Point &amp; Click  It seems to have helped.   <comment285077> Interesting...I guess the problem is it thinks my input is not accidental then. Maybe it's the new hardware because my hands haven't changed and I did not have this problem after enabling that option on previous macbooks. Thanks for the answer regardless. <comment285136> @tubes I am having the same issue, I am typing then my palm taps the trackpad, the new trackpad with force touch, and then I am typing on a different line.  I was really hoping to fix it <comment285551> I updated my answer to provide an alternative solution. <comment352627> @tubes Does this command work for you? `defaults write -g com.apple.trackpad.setWantsRestingTouches -bool TRUE` <comment354628> I had that setting but still it sometimes jumped on me.  Electrical tape method works like a charm! :) <comment364319> Definitley helps a bit versus the default setup.  I still have issues sometimes, but it does seem to reduce the frequency of the issue.
