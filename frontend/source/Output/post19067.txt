Rename iOS device without needing to restore <body> I have just restored my iPad but for some reason (most likely because I pressed space bar on that text field but do you not remember) my newly restored iPad is called "iPad" rather than "my name's iPad". Is there a way to rename your iPad without having to go though the restore process again?   Note: Jailbreaking is not of the question.  Thanks  <answer19068> ol liConnect your device and open iTunes./li liIn the source list (the left-hand column of iTunes), double-click on the name of the device./li liType the new name for your device and press Return on the keyboard./li liSync the device (press Sync in the bottom right corner of the screen)./li /ol  <comment20872> Oh right. I right click'd to see if that option was there but I didn't think of the obvious thing, thanks though.
