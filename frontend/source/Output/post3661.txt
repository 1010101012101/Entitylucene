Switching between windows with cmd-tab <body>    strongPossible Duplicate:/strongbr   Best app to switch between all open windows (Witch alternatives)       In Microsoft Windows kbdAlt/kbd+kbdTab/kbd combination switches between all windows from all applications. In Mac, kbdCmd/kbd+kbdTab/kbd only switches between applications, and when you want to switch between windows in single application, you have to use kbdCmd/kbd+kbd`/kbd. I'm used to Windows behavior and I like it more. Is it possible to configure kbdCmd/kbd+kbdTab/kbd to switch between all windows from all applications?  <answer3662> There is no built-in way to do it, but Expos√© (Wikipedia link) is pretty good.  Alternatively there are some third-party apps which are might help.  <comment3395> It is partial duplicate, but if there is any way to achieve this in plain Mac OS, I would be 100% happy :)
