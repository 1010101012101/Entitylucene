iOS simulator for El Capitan <body> I am a web developer and I often need to do testing on emcodei/code/em devices. I have a macbook around and I don't know what is the best way to test my web applications on iOS devices. I don't have any physical iPhones or iPads (emyet/em).  Is there any simple &amp; good iOS simulator? I'm interested to debug the JavaScript in Safari, in developer tools.  Is it possible to install the simulator without installing XCode?  How to do that?  <answer237797> Without Xcode, there's not really any way to get an iOS simulator that I know of. Alternatively, you could download Xcode and just pull the iOS simulator out of it from the path codeXcode.app/Contents/Developer/Applications/Simulator.app/code.  emedit: to run Safari in Debug mode on your virtual iPhone, there are a set of instructions on tutsplus. In essence:/em  ul liemopen iOS Simulator/em/li liemfrom the menubar, `Develop  iPhone Simulator  (website name)/em/li liemthis should open a side window with Safari Developer Tools/em/li /ul  <comment291444> Where is the `Xcode.app` directory located? <comment291447> Usually in `/Applications`. You'll have to download the application first to extract the Simulator app. <comment291448> That's correct. The full path is `/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Applications/Simulator.app/Contents/MacOS/Simulator`. But how can I open the developer tools in Safari from iPhone? <comment291453> I believe I have misunderstood that you were looking for an iOS simulator that runs Safari. I would think you are looking for Safari's developer tools on an iPhone simulator on a Mac? <comment291455> First thing is to get the simulator working (I did that by installing XCode and running the `Simulator` executable in the terminal), but I'd like to debug Safari in the iPhone simulator, without having a physical device. Is it even possible? <comment291461> It seems to be. I'd advise taking a look at [this article on tutsplus](http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/articles/quick-tip-using-web-inspector-to-debug-mobile-safari--webdesign-8787). I'll add this to my answer when I get back.
