iCloud not syncing with iCal or Address Book after iOS 10 update <body> I know this is a stretch. iCal and Address Book on my old iMac with old OS 10.6 (Snow Leopard) were syncing with iCloud fine with a little complicated setting I learned on the web (something to do with CalDav server setting in preference). I am not sure when it quit, but it seems after iOS update to 10.3.2, they quit syncing.   Before iOS update and when syncing server address: pXX-caldav.icloud.com (XX to be unique 2 digit numerals)  server path: /123123123/principal (123123123 to be unique 9 digit numerals) port: 430  I sense the server address and path (and its port) for iCloud are different now. By clicking few things, I think server address is something like:  pXX-calendars.icloud.com  (XX to be unique 2 digit numerals)   But I don't know how to get path or port. Or this may not work at all? I suspect the latter a bit more strongly when I see 2 sets of server addresses in my iCal depending on a particular calendar.  Is there anybody who can enlighten me by saying other than I need a new OS or new computer?  Thank you in advance!
