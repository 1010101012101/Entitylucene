I want to be able to copy/paste a list and then drag to reorder - is this possible on an iPhone/iPad <body> I regularly get sent a plaintext list to my iPad - I'd like to be able to order this list using an interface like the one in Reminders:   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FvFHG.png" width="320"  (I do not need to get the text back out - just see them in the reordered view)   The only apps I've found that can take copy/paste will, at best, sort alphabetically. Is there any functionality in iOS devices to achieve this? Even with an odd workaround?  Would even take a webapp....
