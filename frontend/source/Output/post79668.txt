New harddrive on a macbook pro 13 inch, dvd drive doesn't work, what do? <body> What I don't have:  ul liAn USB dvd drive/li /ul  What I have:  ul liAnother working, up to date, Macbook (with snow leopard)./li lipurchased Mountain Lion on the app store/li liA desktop PC/li liA 4GB usb stick./li liA USB harddrive I'd like not to wipe out entirely./li /ul  My macbook pro's dvd drive seems busted, I spray some dry air inside and tried to 90 degrees trick, did not work.  Doesn't apple provide some way to make a bootable usb thing ?  <answer79669> There is a few way you can do this from the working MacBook. The first is to follow the tutorial here which will take you through the process of making a bootable USB disk for Mountain Lion.  The steps involve  ul liReformat the USB stick to HFS+/li liExtract the install image from the downloaded installer/li liWrite the image to the USB using Disk Utility/li /ul  Alternatively just download the Lion DiskMaker software which will do all the work for you.  The only problem I can forsee is that you need an 8GB USB stick for this to work since the OSX installation is bigger then 4GB.  <comment91951> Have you tried cleaning the dvd drive with one of [these] lens cleaners CD's? They only cost a few dollar and it worked for me when I my superdrive didn't read any discs anymore. <comment91958> I wonder if I can resize my usb hdd partition, to not lose what's on it... ? <comment91964> @jokoon Both method require the Drive to be reformatted a raw write to be done using `dd`. There is a very good change you will lose data. <comment117124> Does your DVD drive have ANY working function? (for example, upon boot, the mechanism can be heard as it attempts to pull in any possibly available disk) <comment117455> it does a sound when I turn the macbook on
