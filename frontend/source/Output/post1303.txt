How do I handle HDR photos in Aperture 3? <body> What strongplugin/strong do you guys use to handle HDR photos in Aperture 3 ?  <answer1315> Photomatix seems to be the most well-regarded.  <answer1317> There are two choices available right now:    ul liPhotomatix  /li liHydra/li /ul  You should try both and see which matches your “taste” better :)  <comment1100> had no points to create tags... thanks for that <comment1104> This may fare better on the photos site.    Not suggesting it's off-topic here, but I'd guess that the percent of photo enthusiasts using Aperture is way higher than the percent of mac users who do. <comment1115> Jaydles... if you use Aperture, then you're a Mac User as Aperture only runs on mac :)
