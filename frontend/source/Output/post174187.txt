Position of Percentage Symbol on Keynote Charts <body> I am trying to change percentage symbol on charts in Apple Keynote. Keynote automatically put % symbol before numbers. Is there any way to change/set it as after number? Thank you!  <answer236134> You should change the regional settings of your Mac to US. There was an option "US (Computer)". I chose that and it worked.  <comment225864> I am not able to replicate the behavior that you describe.  I am getting rendering like: "100%" in my charts.  Keynote 6.5.3 <comment227554> Do you have a screenshot? <comment288909> Welcome to Ask Different!   Your answer looks "good" but it should be expanded somewhat.
