Winclone restore to 150GB partition, Windows shows only 128GB <body> I attempted to install Linux on a spare partition on my MBPr, which, of course, made both Windows and OSX unbootable.  So, I flattened the drive and reinstalled OSX. Then, using a familiar procedure, I repartitioned the drive as follows:  precodeBootcamp       - 150GB Data partition - 350GB OSX            - 150GB Linux          - 92GB Linux Swap     - 8GB /code/pre  I then used WinClone to restore an image that I created a few months ago, when my Bootcamp partition was only 128GB.   Now, I can boot both Win7 and OSX. But, OSX reports the Bootcamp partition as 150GB (as expected), while Win7 reports it as 128GB (the size of the partition that was used to create the Winclone image).  How to have OSX and Win7 agree on partition size?  <comment122716> Well what is your actual question? You've stated what's happened but not what your goals are. <comment122735> @Mort to have OSX and Win7 agree on partition size. <comment122903> What does the command `df` says ? <comment123983> Thanks to everyone; I got it working. I'm not really sure *how*, though.
