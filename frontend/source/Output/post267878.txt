How do updates of re-"purchased" apps of an Apple ID that had the country changed behaves? <body> After more than 3 years leaving abroad, I‘ve finally decided that I need to change my Apple ID‘s country so I don‘t have to keep a credit card in my home country.  I did an extensive research and found that it would be fine to do it with just a few drawbacks, like manually re-downloading apps and no apps on the purchased apps list. (This and this comments say so).  But one thing that I couldn‘t find is how these re-downloaded/re-"purchased" apps will behave regarding updates. This comments here mention this, but it‘s not clear.  So Id‘d like to know if anyone had already changed country, re-downloaded previously (before changing the Apple ID country) purchased apps and can share the experience regarding these apps updates. Does it works normally with auto-update on macOS and iOS or is there any caveats?  strongBonus questions:/strong  ol liDo the re-downloaded apps appear again in the purchased apps list after re-"purchasing" them?/li liCan the other things you bought (music, movies, books etc) also be re-"purchased" for free?/li /ol  <comment336192> Where are you thinking you'll change country? My understanding is that it's not possible. I'm curious what you've found that indicates otherwise.  You don't have to keep a credit card in your home country. You can keep the account and use gift cards. My underage son has his own Apple ID with no credit card associated with it. <comment336199> @Zonker.in.Geneva I don‘t want to keep buying gift cards and having to have a second account to download apps that I need in my current country but are not available in my home country. Also, it is easier to deal with taxes this way.  Regarding the possibility of changing country, the 3 links I‘ve added in my question confirm that, but you can check this apple support link to confirm: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201389
