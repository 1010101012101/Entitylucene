How do I install OS X Yosemite on an unsupported MacBook? <body> I have downloaded and made a bootable USB of Yosemite but once I boot holding the option key and attempt to install I get an error stating that Yosemite is already installed on my computer. I'm running Snow Leopard and I made my bootable USB using Diskmaker X.   <answer153784> You should use following to make a bootable Yosemite USB.  precodesudo /Applications/Install\ OS\ X\ Yosemite.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/Untitled --applicationpath /Applications/Install\ OS\ X\ Yosemite.app â€”nointeraction /code/pre  Just replace the Untitled with name of the USB drive  <comment180989> diskmaker is not the way to do it <comment181006> Describe "unsupported MacBook". What MacBook model are you trying to install Yosemite on that would make it unsupported? Understand well that anything with a 32-bit EFI is simply not going to happen, period.
