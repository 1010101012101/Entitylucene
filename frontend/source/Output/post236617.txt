What file system should I choose when formatting a flash drive? <body> I need to write a few large files (larger than 4 GB) on a flash drive, but I can't do it, because the file system of the flash drive is MS-DOS (FAT32).   How should I format the flash drive, so I can write down large files into it, and then open it on a PC on windows and download these files? What file system should I choose when formatting the flash drive?  <answer236619> exFAT is the only format which will work for you as it will allow files greater than 4GB and work on Windows. Disk Utility can format using exFAT.  <answer236620> What is the capacity of your flash drive ?  More than 8GB ? If yes then NTFS will do.  If you want to use your flash drive on Windows, only FAT32 or NTFS will be nice.  If you haven't download yet, there is a lot of software that allow OS X to write into NTFS partitions. Like TUXERA NTFS or Paragon NTFS.  <comment289604> Why not just use exFAT? <comment289639> NTFS will **not** do as it is  not writable without 3rd party software. FAT32 also has limitations. IconDaemon is correct exFAT is the way to go <comment289640> Thank you for help! What is the difference between NTFS and exFAT (what limitations there are in the case of each of these file systems?) <comment289642> If this is the answer you were looking for, then mark it as the solution! <comment289751> Done! Thank you. <comment289752> I'll keep in mind that NTFS is also an option, thank you!
