Windows 10 1511 won't hibernate on MacBook anymore <body> I have a MacBook of the latest generation and installed Windows 10 on a second partition. I mainly use Windows 10 on it. Hibernation didn't work during the first days (sometimes it worked, sometimes not), but started to work very soon. Then, with installing the 1511 update the hibernation support was suddenly gone. This is very annoying as I do not want to use sleep mode most of the time.   What happens: when I choose hibernate the screen gets almost immediately black and after a few seconds there's a tiny sound that it shut down. I actually don't remember how this step worked when it was still working as I had it configured to hibernate when closing the lid. And that was what I always did. The hibernation file gets created, but when the Mac starts up it boots like normal instead of resuming.  I suspect that the system would need an updated driver, but I haven't seen any new drivers being delivered in the Apple Software Update tool since 1511 went live.  I've searched around, but couldn't find any solution, nor was this problem specifically mentioned for 1511. I remember that when I first researched then problem when hibernate didn't want to work after the initial installation of Windows 10 I found a few references that hibernate with a MacBook works flaky on Windows 10 (or 7 or so?). So, I wasn't too surprised that it didn't work reliably first. I was quite surprised that from a few days later on it started working totally reliably.  Now, it's gone again, and now completely. Is there anything I can do? I tried already the following solutions: reset NVRAM, set hibernate on/off in Windows. Thanks!
