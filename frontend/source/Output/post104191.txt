Can you mirror an iPad screen while playing a video? <body> I have a Digital AV Adapter hooked up to an iPad (mini running iOS 7.0.2) and I'm trying to mirror movie playback such that the video shows on both the iPad screen and the HDMI-connected display.  Apple's info page seems to imply that mirroring is supported, but that some applications only support video out. The built-in video player and VLC send the video over the adapter and only show controls on the iPad screen.  Are there any apps that support actual mirroring? Or some other trick to getting this to work?
