HFP CLI notification is not sent <body> I have an iPhone 5 connected to a pc via bluetooth using the HFP profile. The USB dongle asks for CLI notification issuing the command codeAT+CLIP=1/code and the phone answers codeOK/code, as expected.  The problem is when the phone rings for an incoming call, the +CLIP message is not sent. I know I can retrieve this information from ANCS but I would like to use the HFP profile right now.  With the same configuration other phones (not iOS) work fine, sending the +CLIP messages as requested.  I'm afraid there is something different from the standard to enable this features on iPhone.  Any ideas?
