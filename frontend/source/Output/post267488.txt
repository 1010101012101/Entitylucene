Wine won't open any programs <body> Running macOS Sierra(Version 10.12.2 16C67).  I installed Wine version codewine-1.8.6/code (through a .pkg file). I opened up a game and it worked fine.  The next day when I downloaded Origin installer, it wouldn't open. When I double clicked on it, the Wine icon showed up in the dock and said it was open, but no windows showed up. When I clicked on another program(or on the desktop), Wine closed. Now when I try to start that same game I opened when I first installed Wine, the same thing happens that happened when I started Origin installer.  When I go to the terminal and type codewine {path of .exe}/code I got this: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FADwx.png" alt="enter image description here"  I installed wine tricks using codebrew install winetricks/code and it installed fine, yet it didn't change my situation.  codewinecfg/code works properly, and so does codesh winetricks/code.  <answer267739> I finally got it fixed. I just deleted the code.wine/code folder, and ran winecfg again, and everything started working.
