How to record a specific area of the screen with QuickTime Player <body> I've tried to record a specific part of the screen with QuickTime Player. But again nothing works as expected with the Mac, but I have to work with.  My result is always a black video with the selected size.  What I've done so far:  ul liOpen: QuickTime Player/li liChoose: File  New Recording Screen/li liPress: Red Button/li liMark an area on the screen for which I want to record./li liClick: Start Recording/li /ul  On the screen recording I press stop and I get back to the player. When I play the recorded movie, I only get a blank screen. I see from the consumed time, that it was recorded and also a save would be not empty.  What is the trick to getting something useful with this Apple Product?  <comment292462> What are you trying to record? Is it some kind of movie (It might restrict the ability to record it from QuickTime)? Please try to record for example TextEdit app. <comment292464> I record my own app and I don't think that quicktime technically can indicate if I am recording a movie or a simple gui. Also recording a very small part of the GUI is not possible. I know for recording an app I could record directly from the device, but then quicktime crashes after some seconds. Very disappointing the MAC in general. <comment292541> FYI Quicktime will not record a DVD on screen, nor DRM protected web content
