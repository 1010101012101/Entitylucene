How do I get AppleScript to open another script file <body> So I'm working on a script and I want one of the buttons to open another script file. I have:  precode    tell application "AppleScript Editor" to open "Fallen_Order_Intro.sctp" /code/pre  When I do this, it says that it can't open "Fallen_Order_Intro.sctp" because it is a text document, (which it isn't).  Am I going about it the wrong way? Is there a different way I should be trying to open a script file? Thank you  <answer239891> You're close.  Get the path to your file by making a one-line script:  precodeset the_file to choose file /code/pre  Copy the result of that. Then, in the script that will open the "Fallen_Order_Intro" script, tell the Finder to do the opening for you, pasting in your second script's path, obtained using the "choose file" script. Here's how it would look if your "Fallen_Order_Intro" script is on your desktop (and if your user name is sdavis).  precodetell application "Finder"     open alias "Macintosh HD:Users:sdavis:Desktop:Fallen_Order_Intro.scpt" end tell /code/pre  That's all there is to it. The file will open in Script Editor because the Finder knows it's a Script Editor document.  <comment294825> That opens the folder that contains the file, but it wont open the file itself <comment294855> @S. Davis, If it doesn't open the file them why did you mark the answer as  accepted?
