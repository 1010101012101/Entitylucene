Photos taking too much space on MacBook Air <body> I was clearing up my Mac to download the latest Os X, but when I saw the "Photos" in "About this Mac" are taking 9 GB space! Any idea where I can find all these photos?   <answer231781> The strongPhotos.app/strong imported images/movies are stored in the strongPhotos Library/strong in the strongPictures/strong folder, along with other individual pictures, within your strongHome/strong folder.  You can access the strongPictures/strong folder in strongFinder/strong.  <answer231803> Photo application keeps all the pictures inside is library: strongPhotos Library/strong.  The location of the library is the following: code~/Users/&lt;user_name_here&gt;/Pictures/code.  Anyway, you can open the application Photos and choose one by one if keep or not any photo.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5OSNw.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment283076> Try opening the Photos app. <comment283094> You’re probably looking for the “optimize Mac storage” option in Photos.app’s iCloud preferences. Maybe you even want to deactivate the iCloud photo library (or stream or both) on your MBA altogether.
