Is there a hotkey to Search Wikipedia for "x"? <body> This is a question about keyboard shortcuts. I think it's quite cool that you can put a word into the spotlight and one of the options is to search Wikipedia for it, but to get that functionality takes a lot of typing or mouse movement. Is there a fast way to do it?  Example: codeCMD-Space/code opens the spotlight, I type codetidal basin/code. About 30 files, most irrelevant appear, and at the bottom is the wikipedia search. I can use the mouse to click on it, or I can hit codectrl-n/code many times to get there and then codereturn/code. Is there a faster way to do this?  <answer135554> In the default setup for Spotlight, Search Wikipedia is the second to last option, Spotlight Preferences being the last option. You could invoke Spotlight, press kbdFn/kbd + kbd-/kbd (or End if you have a full size keyboard with that key) then up and Enter.  Very little hand pivoting is necessary to accomplish this.  <comment160666> It's not bad, but I'm trying to avoid leaving home row at all. One idea that should work, but doesn't, is to hit `ctrl-p` twice to loop back to the bottom of the menu, but they seem to have disabled this. <comment160785> Other options: Always use a browser. If you use Chrome, you can set up a custom search engine for Wikipedia, type `wp`, hit tab, type in the name of the article, enter. Alfred has a quickly selectable `search wikipedia for 'x'` option, as do many other Spotlight replacements.
