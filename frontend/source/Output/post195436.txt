Applescript - Get information from terminal command <body> I'm creating a little script to allow quick changes to the network settings of my Mac. I have got it all working, but I wanted to be able to see what the settings are before I change them in the first dialog pop up.  The command that gets this information is "networksetup -getinfo emdevice/em"  The result is like this:  precodeManual Configuration --This may also say DHCP Configuration-- IP address: 192.168.0.100 Subnet mask: 255.255.255.0 Router: 192.168.0.1 IPv6: Automatic IPv6 IP address: none IPv6 Router: none Ethernet Address: (null) /code/pre  How can I get the IP address, Subnet mask and Router as 3 variables in my script so I can output them to the user over the following prompts?  <answer195440> I've whipped up this nice code snippet, try it out, it should work well for your specific application.  precodeset device to "Ethernet"  set getInfo to paragraphs of (do shell script "networksetup -getinfo " &amp; device) set ipAddress to ((item 2 of getInfo) as string) set subnetMask to ((item 3 of getInfo) as string) set router to ((item 4 of getInfo) as string) -- You could use the output here, and remove the rest of the script, or continue to remove the excess wordage.  set ipAddress to ((characters 13 through -1 of ipAddress) as string) set subnetMask to ((characters 14 through -1 of subnetMask) as string) set router to ((characters 9 through -1 of router) as string) /code/pre  <comment233296> This is exactly what I needed. Works great. Thanks heaps! <comment233297> You're welcome.
