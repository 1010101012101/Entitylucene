Process assistantd keep writing login keychain <body> This is a Sierra box, the system memory was suddenly out of usage. I have checked the system to find out that the keychain process was busy and used nearly all the memory.br I had to reboot the system, then i opened keychain to see the login items list is flashing, one unknown item in login keychain was keeping being deleted and inserted. br Want to know why, I opened activity monitor, then got to know strongassistantd/strong was busy doing that. I killed the process, the keychain came to be in peace.br I think the process is used by Siri, as strongassistantd/strong process came out again after I clicked the siri icon. br  Even I do not use siri, I want to know why this could happen, and what is the real solution.  <answer260904> The problem is solved. I have searched in strong~/Library/strong for all the directories and files within  has strongsiri or assistant/strong in their names, and removed them all.br Then reboot, all are fine then!  <comment326558> Are the processes you killed running as your log in user or as root / another system users? If user process, consider making a new user and letting the assistants to complete all the way and remeasure. <comment326563> The process was running as login user. I have created another user, the keychain is fine with siri.  But then login back, the problem remains the same. I had to disable siri.
