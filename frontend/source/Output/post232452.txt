How to skip iOS 9.3 update? <body> Is there a way to skip this (or any future) updates?  I'm using an iPhone 5s.  <answer232457> strongOption 1: Delete the update from your iOS device./strong  ul liGo to Settings from your Home screen/li liSelect Storage and iCloud Usage/li liGo to "Manage Storage"/li liFind the iOS update that is bothering you and select it/li liTap on "Delete Update" and confirm/li /ul  However, you'll have to stay off of Wi-fi, otherwise it'll re-download.  strongOption 2: Block Software Update domains on your router / gateway/strong  You'll have to figure this one out on your own, since all routers are different, but the domains you'll want to block are:  ul licodeappldnld.apple.com/code/li licodemesu.apple.com/code/li /ul  strongOption 3: Just update/strong  You can also give in and submit to the installation. This will bring you up to the latest, most reliable and up-to-date version of iOS, but if you don't want to, that's definitely fine.  <comment284045> Yes, just do not update the software, when you will eventually asked to :) <comment284046> yeah but everyday it asks me to do it and the only choices are install now or remind me later.  I'd like to not be bothered by this everyday <comment284061> Given recent events we've all read about in the news, this seems like an amazingly bad idea. <comment284083> @MichaelHampton, perhaps you could provide a link for those who lack the context that seems so obvious to you? <comment284085> @Wildcard To begin with, [the obvious](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/03/apple-fight-about-all-us). Then the [less obvious](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2016/03/imessage_encryp.html), and finally the [totally non-obvious but still critically important](http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2016/03/acedeceiver-first-ios-trojan-exploiting-apple-drm-design-flaws-to-infect-any-ios-device/). Not installing security updates is asking for trouble.
