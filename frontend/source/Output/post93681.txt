Also it could be a more narrow issue, with the software not storing the electronic agreement properly or your account is in a state of transition or error. You may need someone on the inside to either correct the records or point you to what (and when) you can resolve this yourself.  In this case, it's an account management issue so log in with your developer ID and either fill in the form or call the numbers listed for your account.  ul lihttps://developer.apple.com/contact/submit.php/li /ul  <answer108288> You need to check your Contracts, Tax, and Banking information.

To transfer an app, make sure that:  precodeThe **transferor and the recipient have active developer accounts** and accepted the most current version of all master agreements that are currently in effect The app has at least one approved version The app is in the Ready for Sale, Invalid Binary, Rejected, Developer Rejected, or Developer Removed from Sale state Any associated In-App Purchases are in the Ready to Submit, Ready for Sale, Rejected, Developer Removed from Sale, or Approved state You know the Apple ID of the recipientâ€™s Team Agent and their Team ID /code/pre  If the app uses iAd, the transferor and the recipient must have accepted the most current version of all iAd contracts.   Pulled info from Apples FAQ in developer center. https://itunesconnect.apple.com/WebObjects/iTunesConnect.woa/wo/146.0.0.13.7.2.7.9.3.1.2.3.3.1.1.3.2.1.3.0.1.0.9.0.1.1.1  <answer177409> I had the same problem,  The IOS developer licence had recently been updated and I had to agree to it again, then this "Master Agreement" field was green and I could transfer the app.  I would recommend jumping into your Developer member center, and you can agree to the licence.  https://developer.apple.com/membercenter/index.action#updateAgreement  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/izExC.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment109889> At the moment I get the same too. I expect Apple will fix this over the next few days. <comment110019> I know we normally close developer questions and send them to stack overflow, but we're working on getting iTunes connect questions a place to come and live, so that means some developer looking questions might arrive. Let's talk on [meta] if anyone has serious heartburn about this change. <comment118188> The Master Agreement is now check marked. I guess Apple fixed this for my account on June 12. <comment118190> Well, the same thing happened when Apple last updated the developer portal: It took them a few days to fix up the ability to edit provisioning profiles and some other things. <comment139080> +1 This is the best answer of the group. I was able to solve the problem posted by the original question without contacting Apple support. Thanks to both @Sanghoon and @grgarside! <comment248901> This worked for me as well. Make sure you wait for your contracts to finish processing though. AKA there shouldn't be any contracts in the "Contracts In Process" section. Same goes for the recipient of the transfer.
