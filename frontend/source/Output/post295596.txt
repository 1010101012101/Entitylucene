So I'm looking way to clone old iPad.  <answer295597> You could use iTunes to take a backup of original iPad and restore it on the other iPad.  Note: There's no version of the iPad without WiFi.  <answer295599> The easiest way to do this is to iTunes on your Mac or PC.  Broadley speaking, the steps would be:  ol liLaunch iTunes on your Mac or PC/li liConnect the first iPad to your computer/li liiTunes should recognise that your iPad is connected and will display an iPad icon/li liClick on the iPad icon and view the Summary screen/li liYou'll see a strongBackups/strong section. Click on the kbdBackup now/kbd button to make a full backup of the iPad to your computer. This may take some time./li liOnce completed, connect the other iPad to your computer/li liRepeat Steps 3 &amp; 4 above/li liIn the same strongBackups/strong section, click on the kbdRestore Backup.../kbd button/li liYou'll now have the option to restore from the backup you just made to your other iPad. This also may take some time./li /ol  Further reading:  ul liHow to back up your iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch/li liRestore your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch from a backup/li /ul  <comment373283> i'm sorry i mistaken, first iPad don't have cellular capabilities, edited original post <comment373284> will backup/restore thing work for slightly different ipads (with and without cellular)?  will iTunes handle two ipads with the same name? will sync work correctly? <comment373285> Yes, it should all work fine. The only time you may have a problem is if the first iPad has a version of iOS installed that's different to the second iPad. In that case you'll get an error saying that you can't restore the backup to that iPad, or a message saying the second iPad has to be updated first. This all depends on your personal circumstances - but there's no risk because you're creating a backup of the first iPad (which remains intact) and your second iPad will either be restored from the backup or it won't (in which case it just remains as is).
