OS X 10.10 Yosemite -DisableSleepProxyClient <body> I have a Mac Pro from 2009. Its in my bedroom. Prior to 10.10 I was able to disable periodic wake (when emWake on Lan/em is enabled) with adding code-DisableSleepProxyClient/code to codecom.apple.mDNSResponder/code. I was able to wake my Mac with a magic packet (WOL). In 10.10 this was changed to codediscoverydp/code and now I am wondering if it is still possible to disable this.  console log entry if it matters  precode19.10.14 07:38:51.000 kernel[0]: Wake reason: RTC (Alarm) /code/pre
