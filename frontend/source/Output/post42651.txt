How to make the "shake" commands easier? <body> When I want to undo some typing on Notes or Pages, I have to shake my ipod-touch like a crazy (and afraid that it may throw from my hand).  Isn't there a way to configure the "shake sensitivity", or change this command for, say, a button?  <answer42666> As of iOS 5, there is no way in stock iOS to adjust the shake gesture sensitivity.   <answer42711> In settings use accessibility to turn on assistive touch. That gives you a virtual home button which includes many things including shake. Touch the virtual home button, touch device.  One of the options under device is shake.  <answer104787> You can use this option while u r typing text in message or in notes or in any application.  <comment48491> I can't think of an answer to this question more useful than "No", unfortunately. Unless there's something available via jailbreaking... <comment48498> Try pivoting/tilting along the home-/power-button axis while shaking the whole device up and down - i.e. rotating your hand while moving it up/down. This may help to trigger the "shake" command. <comment48707> That's an alternative, but much more complicated. <comment48708> Ok, the @iolsmit commend also helped me. <comment123285> Which option are you referring to?
