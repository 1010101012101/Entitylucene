How to add paragraph symbol <body> I send a friend w/o a Mac some paragraphs &amp; they disappear in the sending, so I'd like to include the paragraph symbol at the start of each paragraph so she can see where they go. How do I do that in Pages 5.2.2 on a Mac?  <answer234773> You can enable "Show Invisibles" from codeView &gt; Show Invisibles/code or kbd⌘ Command/kbd+kbd⇧ Shift/kbd+kbdI/kbd to see these "invisible" characters in Pages. These are eminvisibles/em that appear when the selection highlight goes over their area, and disappear when unhighlighted. For identification purposes they're usually colored blue.  To add a emnon-invisible/em paragraph symbol (or any other delimiter of your choice), kbd⌃ Control/kbd+kbd⌘ Command/kbd+kbdSpace/kbd should bring up a "Characters" window, from which you can double-click on any character to add it to the current text field.  The characters under this window follow their Unicode specification, so some names might seem a little emweird/em (e.g. "Place of Interest Sign" for "⌘").  The name for the Paragraph symbol is "Pilcrow".  <answer234783> With the US keyboard layout, you can make the ¶ sign with the key combination kbdOption/Alt/kbd+kbd7/kbd.
