Modifying bootcamp (link include) - Error when writing Iso on USB stick <body> Thank you for your tutorial for modifying bootcamp for Early 2008 MacBook Pro... Bootcamp - No ISO Option  On my side, modifying Bootcamp to add the new option have worked perfectly, but i always got an error when Bootcamp write the Iso to USB... I tried with 2 different USB sticks... If someone have an idea, that would be great...  strongEdit:/strong   So I tried the VirtualBox method, but I have a problem when I arrive to: step 12:  When I enter in terminal: codesudo  fdisk  -e  $DISK0  &lt;&lt;&lt;"$INPUT"/code I get: Error the resource is busy...  May be it is because at step 7, I am not sure of the correct syntax : they ask to modify codePARTID="$DISK0"s"$PARTITION"/code  I entered: codePARTID="$disk0s4"s"$PARTITION"/code  Is it correct? Any ideas please?   strongEdit 2/strong  With El Capitan, I have been able to write an iso on my 320 Go USB HDD (without power cable) or an 8 Go Sony USB stick.br But the problem is when Boot Camp Assistant restarts to install Windows, the "WININSTALL" disk is not discovered and I get a black screen with "insert an Windows disk and press any key".      I don't understand why at reboots my Windows installation disk/stick is not used by Boot Camp.    I can try with a Firewire HDD to see if it work better, but if I can use the USB I would prefer it. The only FW HDD I have is my backup HDD.  <answer221012> I will forward you to this answer. To install Windows you will have to first install a free copy of VirtualBox. This software takes very little drive space and is required to boot from the Windows iso file. If you have any questions let me know.  <comment267469> What is the model/year of your Mac? Not all Macs can install Windows using a USB stick. <comment267484> It is an macbook pro mid 2010 (sorry i made an error when i was writing my question)... Model : MacBookPro6,2 Bootrom : MBP61.0057.B11 <comment267539> You can not use a flash drive to install Windows on your model Mac. Is there a reason you did not use your optical drive? <comment267571> Yes, since an Apple Update or OSX release, (i don't remember which one) i cannot burn DVD DL... it always give me an error. And any iso or .dmg cannot be burned on DVD DL... <comment267574> What version of Windows are you trying to install? What version of OS X are you currently running? It is possible to install Windows without the use of a DVD or USB stick. <comment267578> I am running OSX 10.10.5 (14F1509), and i am trying to install Windows 7/8 PRO... <comment267593> OK thankyou, in fact i understand what you mean, i tried with Wine and Bottlewine, but i blocked at the "accessing the USB" problem... With Wine and Winebottler i haven't succeffully allowed it to use the USB Stick, or DVD (i didn't tried DVD)... ISO2USB cannot reach USB stickj, Rufus is the same... In fact i can select an ISO but cannot select an destination Disk, the menu is blank... May be with VirtualBox it would be better... Thankyou :) <comment269717> @Cedric `PARTID="$disk0s4"s"$PARTITION"`is wrong, the resulting PARTID=s$PARTITION = probably "s4" (because $disk0s4=NULL)
