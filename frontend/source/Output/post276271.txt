after waking from sleep native screen in clamshell mode wakes up and takes dock <body> I work on external screen mostly and have MacBook in clamshell mode. External screen is set as main screen with dock attached to it.  When I wake MacBook up from sleep, sometimes screen in clamshell mode wakes up and overtakes my dock. Screen itself is turned off, but soft thinks its on.  To fix this I've to open MacBook lid and close it again. This brings dock to my external screen.  Atm I've set external monitor to mirror MacBook screen avoiding this issue altogether. But surely its annoying. Seems like a bug as I didn't notice this in OS X.  I noticed this issue on macOS sierra. I've a MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Mid 2014), 2.6/8/256   <answer276421> The first things I'd try are to reset both the NVRAM and SMC in that order. Before following the steps below, ensure you have no external hardware connected (so, unplug your external display) and make sure you use the strongbuilt-in keyboard/strong.  strongReset the NVRAM/strong  Older Macs had what's called Parameter RAM (PRAM), newer Macs use Non-Volatile Random-Access Memory (NVRAM).

Or is it that you're running macOS Sierra and didn't notice this with earlier versions of the OS? <comment347745> @Monomeeth yes I updated OP <comment347747> @Monomeeth OSX was renamed to macOS in version Sierra. That's what I meant. So before Sierra didn't have this. <comment347748> All good - that's what I _thought_ but didn't want to be presumptuous. Can I ask that you also edit your question to include the exact model of MacBook you're using? <comment347758> @Monomeeth added that in too <comment348050> Did as you've advised. Didn't encounter issue so far. <comment348152> Unfortunately issue is back. this did not help. I think its OS bug. <comment348155> If everything was working previously and you are using the same external display and cables, then you should [submit a bug](http://www.apple.com/feedback/macos.html) to Apple.
