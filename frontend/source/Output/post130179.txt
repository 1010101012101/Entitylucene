33% + 33% + 34% is not the same width as 100% in safari <body> I'm running into a situation where 3 divs with widths of 33%, 34%, and 33% do not add up to the same number of pixels as one div with 100% width. Consider the following complete html snippet:  precode&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; &lt;html lang="en" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"&gt; &lt;head&gt;     &lt;meta charset="utf-8" /&gt;     &lt;title&gt;ios math test&lt;/title&gt; &lt;/head&gt; &lt;body&gt;     &lt;div style="width:100%; height:3em; background-color: green;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;     &lt;div style="width:33%; height:3em; float:left; background-color: red;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;     &lt;div style="width:34%; height:3em; float:left; background-color: red;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;     &lt;div style="width:33%; height:3em; float:left; background-color: red;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt; /code/pre  You'll notice that safari on iphones, ipads, and even desktop instances of iOS will show the div that has 100% as being longer than the sum of the widths of the divs below it. This seems strange.  All apple devices that I've tested exhibit this behavior(safari on a macbook, safari on an ipad, safari on an iphone, chrome on an ipad, chrome on an iphone, etc...). It does not exhibit this behavior when using chrome on a windows box, or safari on a windows box, or android.  Here's a jsfiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/zd6wx/  What's the correct way to represent this on an iOS device (safari, chrome, etc...) that also works on other devices (eg android)? I don't want to use tables, and I only want to use javascript as an option of last resort.  Thanks  <answer130181> You have experienced such results because of rounding of numerics.  While you drag vertical separator you able to rich up to 100% (but usually less) This is more correct version: jsfiddle edit  So the more accurate way to get this I thought to put 3 second line divs into one parent (same colored) and align it inside.  precode&lt;div style="width:100%;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div style="width:100%;"&gt;&lt;div 1 /&gt;&lt;div 2 /&gt;&lt;div 3 /&gt;&lt;/div&gt; /code/pre  <answer130182> I just tried your script with minor change  precode&lt;body&gt;     &lt;div class="greenbox" style="width:100%;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;     &lt;div class="redbox" style="width:33.333%;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;     &lt;div class="redbox" style="width:33.333%;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;     &lt;div class="redbox" style="width:33.333%;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/body&gt; /code/pre  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/IREjg.png" alt="match" results in perfect mach. Reason is obvious!  If you round up to 33.34% it looks like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ns4fE.png" alt="round up"  <comment152462> Flagged this question for SO <comment152471> The jsfiddle that you supplied displays correctly on iOS devices, but line breaks on android/windows devices. <comment152472> Are you using iOS, Buscar?   I plug that into a jsfiddle and it pops out edges that aren't consistent:  http://jsfiddle.net/zd6wx/6/ <comment152474> Well, every browser divides percents as it can. I also don't recommend to solve such problems via javascript. <comment152475> I agree...  but that relegates me to either using fixed widths, or using tables:  both seems inconsistent with responsive design. <comment152478> @Rob Why did you flag this? <comment152479> You should post this at StackOverflow. <comment152481> I assumed that since AskDifferent has css, html, and safari tags, that it was fair game here.   Here's the corresponding [StackOverflow question] (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23545153/33-33-34-is-not-the-same-width-as-100-on-ios) <comment152484> Jason - Thanks for the post and welcome. In general, we ask people to not cross post, but the same core question can be asked on several sites. I'll put this on hold here temporarily to see if you want to edit it to focus on end user actions to control this. If you just want to know about programming css/html - you can leave it closed and the SO question stand for a place to answer that specific question. <comment152500> Actually the on-hold-reason is invalid, as html is no programming language, thus this is neither programming nor software development question. Get a better reason or fix the definition of off-topic. <comment152510> I tried it with FF on 10.9.2 on MBA :)
