How to view certificate info without installing <body> I have a certificate and/or private key file (pfx) on my OS X desktop.  I'd like to look at its information (CN, SAN, OU, thumbprint, etc) but when I double click on it, it attempts to install into my Keychain.  Once its in there, I can see the info and then delete it.  I would like to know if there is a way to "open" a certificate for viewing without having to install it into your Keychain.  Similar to how you can click on the padlock in Safari and see the cert info.  I'd prefer something native to OS X but maybe there are tools out there too?  <answer165219> via Terminal.app and type something like:  precodeopenssl x509 -noout -text -in ~/Desktop/yourcertificate.crt   /code/pre  Where last parameter is a path your certificate file(you can drag and drop that if you like)  gives us:   precodeCertificate:     Data:         Version: 3 (0x2)         Serial Number: 27 (0x1b)         Signature Algorithm: sha1WithRSAEncryption         Issuer: C=US, O=Apple Inc., OU=Apple Certification Authority, CN=Apple Root CA         Validity             Not Before: May 26 19:16:09 2010 GMT             Not After : Jul 26 19:16:09 2017 GMT         Subject: C=US, O=Apple Inc., OU=Apple Certification Authority, CN=Apple Application Integration Certification Authority         Subject Public Key Info:             Public Key Algorithm: rsaEncryption             RSA Public Key: (2048 bit) ...... /code/pre  <answer268300> I'm not sure if this was available in the OS you had at the time you wrote your question, but at least with OS X 10.11.6, if you select the .crt file in the Finder and press the spacebar, a Quick Look window will open and you can see all of that info in a nice display.  Works for .pfx files too.  <comment195216> Yea, I thought about openssl... I was hoping to have it be more gui based.  Probably could write an Automator script to be able drag/drop the cert into a folder and it would pop open a terminal and run the openssl command you suggested.  thanks. <comment344093> This is actually a very useful method! I like it more than the command line version!  Thanks!
