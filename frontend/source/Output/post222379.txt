How do you fix missing partition on OS X El Cap? <body> After trying to install Windows 10 via Boot Camp, my Mac automatically rebooted (supposedly to the newly created Windows partition). However, it just booted back my OS X 10.11.2.  When I went to Boot Camp Assistant, it's as if the installation never happened. The partition was taken, but OS X can't read the missing partition: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kcyZL.png" alt="Disk Utility not seeing the partition"  Here's the output of sudo gpt -r show /dev/disk0:  precode      start       size  index  contents           0          1         PMBR           1          1         Pri GPT header           2         32         Pri GPT table          34          6                   40     409600      1  GPT part - C12A7328-F81F-11D2-BA4B-00A0C93EC93B      409640  488555536      2  GPT part - 53746F72-6167-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC   488965176    1269536      3  GPT part - 426F6F74-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC   490234712          7            490234719         32         Sec GPT table   490234751          1         Sec GPT header /code/pre  How do I recover this missing partition/disk space?  <answer222520> The GUID partition table looks good. Nothing is really missing. The partition with the index number 2 is a CoreStorage Logical Volume Group. The partition with the index number 3 is your Recovery HD. The Boot Camp Assistant probably failed to resize the LVG (~ 250 GB) but succeeded resizing the Logical Volume (emMacintosh HD/em ~ 192 GB). As a result about 58 GB in the CoreStorage LVG are not allocated to Logical Volumes.  To expand emMacintosh HD/em boot to your Recovery HD (hold kbdcmd/kbdkbdR/kbd while booting). Open emDisk Utility/em and verify the integrity of the superior CoreStorage LVG and the inferior LV (Macintosh HD). Then open Terminal in the menubar Utilities - Terminal  ul liEnter codediskutil cs list/code./li liEnter codediskutil cs resizeVolume lvUUID size/code. emlvUUID/em is the UUID of the Logical Volume; usually it's the last listed in the output of codediskutil cs list/code. Use 250g as size. If you get an error (not enough space...) use a slightly smaller size like 249500m./li liEnter codeexit/code, quit Terminal and reboot to your main volume./li /ul  <comment269447> Please add the output of `sudo gpt -r show /dev/disk0` entered in Terminal to your question. Did you try to revert to the previous state with Boot Camp Assistant ("...remove Windows...")? <comment269624> @klanomath When I opened Boot Camp Assistant to try to revert, it's acting as if there's nothing to revert <comment270117> When I ran [code]diskutil resizeStack lvUUID size[/code], I got the error:  "diskutil did not recognize verb resizeStack"  Perhaps, another command? <comment270138> seems to be the right command. But I got this new error message:  "Error: -69674: The provided Core Storage logical volume has an incorrect size; you should run whole-disk repair"  Full screenshot here: https://goo.gl/photos/mnPtVy7NAAeyMvXm7 <comment270142> @AllanCaeg Do you have a Time Machine backup? <comment270166> making one. Do you recommend simply wiping then recovering via Time Machine? <comment270168> @AllanCaeg I recommend backing up the entire volume, then detach the backup drive. Now you can try to revert the CoreStorage LVG to a normal partition. If successful expand the classical (non-FileVault) volume and re-encrypt it later. If not successful restore the backup.
