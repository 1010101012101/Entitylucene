What causes Firefox to not show me a new tab? Can this be fixed? <body> I am using Firefox 7.0.1 on Mac OS X 10.6 and 10.7. Often times when I make a new window, the tab bar contains only a single "+" tab, even after I got to a URL:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NRrrY.png" alt="Firefox Screencapture"  If I make new tabs, then I cannot get back to the first tab I created. This is extremely annoying. Is there a fix for this?  <comment30725> Did you try to disable all plugins? <comment30726> @patrix: good suggestion. I have FireBug installed, maybe that's what's causing it.
