If the Apple logo was placed such that it   was right side up when the lid was opened then it ended up being   upside down when the lid was closed, from the point of view of the   user."/em   So when closed, it appeared right-side up from the point of view of the user. But when opened, it appeared upside down from the perspective of on-lookers. Joe Moreno states that em"Opening a laptop from the wrong end is a self-correcting problem that only lasts for a few seconds. However, viewing the upside logo is a problem that lasts indefinitely."/em  All of these decisions of course went through Steve Jobs. With the release of the current Macbook product lines, Jobs reversed his decision and had the logo appear right-side up from on-looker's perspective.
