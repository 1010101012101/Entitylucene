Clear out Chrome history from command line? <body> Is it possible to clear out Chrome's history from the command line? I know that this history is also cached online, ideally it would be good to do this from the command line as well.  <answer61134> The Google Chrome history files live in code~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Default/code. If you really, really want to delete browsing history from the command line (why?), I think removing the history files in this directory with a command line command/script would be the only way to go like this guy is doing. , as Google Chrome does not provide any ready-made commands or command switches for deleting history according to this list.  However, please consider this excerpt from the README-file:      Google Chrome settings and storage represent user-selected   preferences and information and MUST not be extracted, overwritten or   modified except through Google Chrome defined APIs.   So, do it at your own risk. I would experiment with deleting the history files of a test installation of Google Chrome and see what happens.  <answer201725> just press command and Q at the same time it works every time bro ;) good luck  <answer201761> To delete the files containing the all-time history (past 10 weeks) and the current (logged) history, do:     cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/Google/Chrome/Default   then     rm History History-journal   <comment232032> I too need this, as often i have to clear chrome history to load latest code while doing web-development. <comment243209> how does this solve the problem described in the question?
