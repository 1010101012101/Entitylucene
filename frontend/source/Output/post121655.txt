Encrypted external drive usually prompts for password, despite being in keychain <body> I have an external encrypted drive, and almost every time I plug it in, it'll ask me for the password, even though it's already in my keychain. If I type the password in, it'll mount as expected. strongOddly, if I hit cancel, it still mounts anyway/strong, presumably because the password is in the keychain.  The problem is that it prompts for a password each time, even though it clearly doesn't need it because the password is in the keychain.

What I've noticed since then is that it's much more likely to mount cleanly (without the redundant password prompt) if the computer is unlocked, whereas if it's asleep or locked (i.e. password required after screensaver activates) then they won't mount cleanly.  Haven't really tested this thoroughly, but am wondering if it's actually something completely different, like the locked/unlocked state of my account (and perhaps therefore my keychain?), that causes the prompts to appear and the disk to fail auto-mounting.  h3Update 2:/h3  Just plugged it in, everything mounted cleanly/without prompt before I'd logged in. So it's not the keychain being locked while the computer is locked.  <answer126925> Two things you can try are key chain first aid and keychain reset, altough these strongin-house/strong solutions hardly ever fixed anyhting for me. This is based on the fact that when some apps keep asking for passwords stored in the keychain, it's sometimes related to a corrupt keychain DB (Address Book's empty DB comes already corrupt on every new Mac - emsarcasm/em).  <answer132130> To me Key Chain First Aid did not identify any problems, but removing the corresponding entries from the keychain and entering them again next time I plugged in the external drive solved the problem (for the last two starts ;)  <comment141840> Is there anything in the console of interest <comment144039> I get "failed to unwrap the vek, status = e00002bc" messages on 10.9.2 even when a FileVault 2 drive mounts successfully, so you can rule that out as a sure-fire cause of the issue. I'm not sure what exactly that message signifies. <comment149052> Keychain first aid says there's no problems... <comment149144> What about removing the password from Keychain's list and adding it again when prompted? Also try to double click on the password entry and change some of the [Access Control](http://i.stack.imgur.com/z1dDd.png) options. <comment149243> Tried just removing it and re-adding it originally (to no avail). Have reset my keychain but will need to test that next week... <comment149645> So something along the way seems to have made the problem intermittent (or I'm only now noticing it's intermittentness), but it's definitely still there (say half the time), even after a full keychain reset. <comment155298> Do you unplug the external drive without Ejecting it first? <comment155299> It does not identifies your HD correctly, check in the About this Mac to see if it does.
