Does Mountain Lion remove headers in /usr/include? <body> Is it just me or common to everybody that all the header files that was in the /usr/include is no longer there?  Which is causing boost bootstrap to fail with this error:  precode### Using 'darwin' toolset. ### rm -rf bootstrap mkdir bootstrap cc -o bootstrap/jam0 command.c compile.c constants.c debug.c function.c glob.c hash.c  hdrmacro.c headers.c jam.c jambase.c jamgram.c lists.c make.c make1.c object.c option.c output.c parse.c pathunix.c regexp.c rules.c scan.c search.c subst.c timestamp.c variable.c modules.c strings.c filesys.c builtins.c pwd.c class.c native.c md5.c w32_getreg.c modules/set.c modules/path.c modules/regex.c modules/property-set.c modules/sequence.c modules/order.c execunix.c fileunix.c In file included from command.c:17: ./jam.h:317:10: fatal error: 'sys/types.h' file not found #include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;      ^ 1 error generated.[/code] /code/pre  <answer58411> I still have stuff in there on my Mountain Lion install (upgraded from Lion, however)  precodeMacbook Pro:~&gt; find /usr/include/ | wc -l     2820 Macbook Pro:~&gt; ls -l /usr/include/sys/types.h  -r--r--r--  1 root  wheel  10133 28 Jul 04:14 /usr/include/sys/types.h /code/pre  <answer58782> This also happened to me, upgrading to Mountain Lion removed commandline tools. I just needed to go to Xcode and install again. Solved.  <comment67161> hmm... probably just me then. thanks <comment67165> hmm... that's really weird. 3 of my computer installed with Mountain Lion doesn't have headers in the /usr/include <comment67167> I also have XCode + commandline tools, perhaps that put them there? <comment67179> hmm... That's weird. I got Xcode Commandline as well. oh well, looks like it's just me. I'll figured it out. Thanks <comment67706> do you have header files in /usr/include/ before installing the commandline tools? <comment67736> @NegativeZero No, it was empty or there wasn't one, I'm not sure whether I've mkdir an empty one to try to remediate and later noticed that I just needed to install the commandline tools. <comment67741> arh, it looks like someone had the similar issue with me then.
