Does anyone use Xcode Playgrounds on a Macbook 2015? <body> I'm interested in the MacBook 2015 form factor and wondered if anyone uses Xcode Playgrounds on one and how it handles it in terms of responsiveness, battery drain and screen size. I realise that 1400x900 scaled resolution isn't prefect for full on development with story boards extra, but feel I could be productive whilst out and about on Playgrounds as I've found myself fiddling a lot with prototype code in that environment rather than messing up my main code base. I guess a MacBook Pro 13" might be a safer option but used to use a MacBook Air 2011 for Ruby on Rails development (i.e. very text based development environment) and really appreciated the lightness of the device. To be honest I'd probably wait until Macbook 2016 (if there is one) because of Skylake but would love to know if anyone has tried this on the current machine.  <answer223032> XCode playgrounds are quite slow currently and sometimes they get blocked for no apparent reason (the processing spinner spins indefinitely).  This is true for me on a 2015 Macbook Pro and a 2009 Macbook Pro. I think there is quite a chance that it will be no better on a Macbook. I think, however, that this is largely a software problem and it will take more than more raw power thrown on it to solve it.  <comment270321> Yep, I've experienced this too on a MacBook Pro 2013; hopefully Apple will improve in future releases, I still find them useful though. How was performance on the 2009 machine other than that? What chip/ram does that one have? <comment270324> I have a mid2009 mbp with a core2duo processor (I think the 2.66Ghz one)  and 4 gigs of ram. It is not fast and XCode regularly stops to think about something (I code in Swift) although it has been getting better. I use it for side projects and fun, I would definitely not recommend it as a workhorse for serious job unless really necessary. Apps in simulator run smoothly and compilation is reasonably fast. <comment270334> Impressive that it works at all really; that'll be non-SSD (unless modified?), very low ram by today's standards and the multicore geekbench well below 3000 - wow!
