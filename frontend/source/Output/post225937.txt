How to restore OS X on MacBook Air after installing Windows 8? <body> After installing Windows 8 MacBook Air is not booting. I want to revert back to  OS X. I need help on how to do that.  <answer225941> press the Option key + R select the disk that installed Mac OSx. maybe you're starting with Windows.  Now if you want to a new installation, you will need access to another Mac, to mount the flash drive installation. follow these steps: http://osxdaily.com/2015/09/30/create-os-x-el-capitan-boot-install-drive/  <comment274285> Please improve your answer: boot to Recovery Mode/Internet Recovery Mode - Disk Utility - Check / Erase Volume/Disk - Restore OS X <comment274319> Because improving my answer? I told him does not work? it can not mount a USB stick installation on another computer and reinstall the system? <comment274322> Because your answer is incomplete and frowsy. The first half of the first sentence is the right direction. In case the OP has no second mac/no thumb drive there is still a solution like indicated in my comment. <comment274325> at the moment it does not have a connection to the internet your solution does not work well.
