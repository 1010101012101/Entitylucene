Sharing folders between 2 users <body> I just downloaded a virtual box VM which I will be sharing with my wife. Both my wife and I have accounts on our mac.  I copied the downloaded VM into /Users/Shared/MyNewVM  Then I went into System Preferences - Sharing and I added /Users/Shared/MyNewVM   and gave "everyone" the "read/write" permissions.  Now, when I go to Finder and go into /Users/Shared/MyNewVM/VM.vbox and double click it, it gives me the following error:     You do not have permissions to open document "VM.vbox". Contact your   computer and network administrator for assistance.   But I gave the permissions ... didn't I?  <answer200742> ol liSelect the folder in Finder and open Get Info (⌘I)./li liClick the padlock in the bottom-right corner of the Get Info window and authenticate./li liSet up the permissions, then click the gear and select Apply to enclosed items…./li /ol
