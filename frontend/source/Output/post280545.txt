How do I upgrade my openssl? A symlink isn't working for /usr/local/bin/OpenSSL <body> I'm having trouble updating my version of openssl so I can get Fastlane working.   Can anyone explain where OpenSSL should be, and how different environments hook into it?   precodeMACOS:~ lamont$ openssl version OpenSSL 0.9.8zh 14 Jan 2016 MACOS:~ lamont$ ruby -ropenssl -e 'puts OpenSSL::OPENSSL_VERSION' OpenSSL 1.0.2k  26 Jan 2017 MACOS:~ lamont$ rm /usr/local/bin/openssl rm: /usr/local/bin/openssl: No such file or directory MACOS:~ lamont$ cd /usr/local/Cellar/openssl MACOS:openssl lamont$ ls 1.0.2k MACOS:openssl lamont$ sudo ln -s /usr/local/Cellar/openssl/1.0.2k/bin/openssl /usr/local/bin/openssl Password: MACOS:openssl lamont$ which openssl /usr/local/bin/openssl MACOS:openssl lamont$ openssl version OpenSSL 0.9.8zh 14 Jan 2016 MACOS:openssl lamont$  /code/pre  <answer284946> If you run  precodebrew info openssl /code/pre  you will have the answer :     This formula is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /usr/local,   because Apple has deprecated use of OpenSSL in favor of its own TLS and crypto libraries.      If you need to have this software first in your PATH run:     echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/openssl/bin:$PATH"'  ~/.bash_profile
