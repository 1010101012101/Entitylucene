Disk Storage - Deleting Applications <body> I found on here that deleting an Application (in order to free up disk space) is as easy as moving an application to the trash and then emptying the trash.  I tried deleting XCode. It was 12GB in size. So I deleted it and saw my Apps disk usage decrease by 12GB but saw my Other increase by 6GB. Did it just move half of the supporting files to Other? And if so, why weren't all 12GB of (related) files not deleted?  <comment323851> Though not familiar with Xcode I think what is likely is that there are a lot of Xcode-related files in ~/Library/Application Support and/or /Library/Application Support. And since Xcode is now gone macOS no longer knows what kind of files they are and thus classifies them as "other." *Extrapolating/guessing* here but I think it is likely. <comment323963> Yeah that makes sense but nothing under that directory seems obvious to me that it would have been related to Xcode.
