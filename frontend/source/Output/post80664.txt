iOS purchase verification <body> I've been trying to find an answer to this but having difficulty. What I want to know is if there is a transactionReceipt included in an app when it is originally purchase from the App Store. I know that it is included with in app purchases.  I need to verify apps talking to my web service as being purchased but cannot find a way. I am not worried about trying to secure against jail breaking with this question.  Thanks guys
