Tracking down the source of a flash and shutter sound effect that occurred during a video recording on an iPhone 4S <body> I need to find out whether this is possible on an iPhone 4S: while recording a video, is there anything the user can do (either accidentally or deliberately) to trigger the camera flash and the shutter sound effect, as if taking a photo?  In the video I am considering, filmed by a stock (i.e. not jailbroken) iPhone 4S, a flash is seen partway through, and the shutter sound effect is heard. It is quite important that I be able to tell whether there is any way this could have been triggered by the phone recording the video, or whether (as I believe) there must have been another camera or phone at the scene, out of the video frame but betrayed by the flash and shutter effect.  There was no photo corresponding to the moment the flash went off to be found on the phone, either before or after the stored video (and the file numbers were sequential with no interruption). As far as I've been able to figure out, the iPhone 4S emcannot/em take a photo while recording a video. This makes it hard to see how the flash and shutter effect could be triggered, but I would really love to be able to rule it out absolutely. Could anyone confirm that it is impossible to trigger the flash and shutter sound effect while recording a video?
