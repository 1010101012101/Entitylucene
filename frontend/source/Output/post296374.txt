Why is iMessage not synched across 3 devices? <body> I use iMessage on my Mac, my iPad, and my iPhone.  On all three I am logged in to the same Apple ID.  I would expect to see the same (recent) conversations on all 3 devices, but I don't, and I'm completely baffled why not.  I've gone through settings and can't see anything that would seem to be preventing these from being in synch.  I know this is a pretty broad question, but... any suggestions for getting these in synch?
