bluray burn folder takes up much more space than original folder <body> I occasionally burn files to bluray disk using an external bluray drive. There tend to be lots of small files within a folder structure (there can be many files and folders).  When I do this, I often find that the disk cannot be burnt because the file size is over the disk capacity. But the original folder I'm trying to burn is well under. For example, an 11GB folder makes a burn folder of 33GB.   If I compress the original folder with zip then there is hardly any increase in disk space in the burn folder. I have a hunch that the extra space has something to do with the fact that there are lots of small files and folders. But why does this increase the file size quite so much? And are there any other solutions than zipping the folder?
