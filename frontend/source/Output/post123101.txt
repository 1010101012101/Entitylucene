Notification Center iOS7 bug? <body> Before submitting to Apple I'd like to know if anyone else has this problem on an iOS7 device  The images is in Dutch, but the visual should be clear.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mv0lY.jpg" width="320"  <answer123103> Yes, I am able to reproduce this bug in all of the UITableViews with reordering. Whilst I'm not convinced it's a bug, it is indeed reproducible in all views I've encountered.  <comment143725> I'm not quite sure what the bug is being shown… Are you currently pressing the screen for that row to remain in that place or has it 'stuck' there? <comment143726> Holding it and dragging it around on that page. <comment143727> Indeed, I am able to reproduce this, but I'm wondering if this is even a bug — it's dragging to where you've placed your finger: what did you expect it to do? <comment143728> Not go above "Inclusief" as that's the top of the 'table' if I can name it that way. Why would you drag it outside an area to place it nowhere? ;p <comment143729> Hmm, I suppose… <comment143731> Alright, I just rolled my eyes when finding out somehow. Silly stuff..
