After Mountain Lion reinstall, iPhoto and other apps won't work <body> I had to reinstall Mountain Lion from the disk utility because my macbook pro would not boot. After the reinstall, iPhoto and several of my apps will not start. What can I do?  <answer92949> Have you logged into Software Update or the Mac App Store, using your Apple ID and password? Have you gone to System Preferences: Internet &amp; Wireless: iCloud, and logged into iCloud with your Apple ID and password?  Try these things and then see if you can launch those apps.  <answer92952> ...in addition to Wheat's suggestions, make sure you are running the must current builds of Mac OS and iApps (via Software Update).  <comment109032> Define `will not start` <comment109038> Everything shows to be up to date. <comment109039> I can log into iCloud, and the App Store says there are no updates available. I have a Time Machine, and I went into it and found the last backup of one of my apps (Photoshop Elements) that would not open, and chose to restore it, and it went through the steps and "Restored" it, but it still won't open. It just bounces up and down in the task bar and finally gives an error, saying, "Could not open the application, a report will be sent to Apple." This is what it does with iPhoto and all my other apps too. Since I could not restore it from the Time Machine, could my OS X have gotten corrupted? <comment109040> Will not open. Gives an error, saying that it could not open the app. <comment109041> It was successfully restored from the Time Machine, but still will not open. Could I have gotten a corrupt install, as the laptop is really slow now and wonky. <comment109042> Did you perform a clean install/restore or an update install? <comment109045> I don't know what you mean. I installed it from Disk Utility, when the computer would not boot. <comment109063> Have you repaired permissions using Disk Utility? <comment109064> Is your Mac under warranty, or under AppleCare coverage, and can you take it to an Apple Store or other authorized Apple repair facility and ask them to look at it? <comment109098> Does this mean, you formatted your drive and made a clean install, or did you just install OS X over your broken System? In the last case, your might have carried over your problem to the new installation. A solution would be to try a [clean install](http://macs.about.com/od/MountainLion/ss/How-To-Perform-A-Clean-Install-Of-Os-X-Mountain-Lion-On-A-Startup-Drive.htm). But make sure to have a current backup (Time Machine), before you start. <comment109198> I did not format the hard drive, so I didn't do a clean install. I went back and reinstalled mountain lion from the app store, and then all my apps were working, but then I started getting the spinning beach ball everytime I tried to do anything, so I guess I still have my problem. A virus scan showed that I have a trojan, but it hung up before I could get rid of it. Now, it shows nothing... I guess i still have the original problem. :-( <comment109199> The clean install is not something I think I can do. <comment109635> In this case you should first make sure that the trojan is gone. Try a full scan with [avast scanner](http://www.avast.com/free-antivirus-mac), it seems to be very good. The trojan might be a Windows trojan - not affecting your Mac. But you should make sure your OS is clean. After a successful virus removal, boot into Recovery HD, reinstall your OS again. A good set of preparation instructions is [here](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/3531813). Removing all user prefs also can help. Let me know, if you need help doing this. <comment130088> Apple's Genius Bar will diagnose, and often fix, software issues at no charge regardless of warranty status.  A lot Apple Authorized Service Providers will do the same to a lesser extent.  Reason behind this is AppleCare doesn't apply to software, only to hardware failures.  The only tie to software that AppleCare has is the ability to receive phone support concerning software issue. <comment146552> were you running osx Mountain Lion before the reinstall?
