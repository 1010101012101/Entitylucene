How to Mimic Location of Slave VPN for Primary VPN? <body> I would like to mimic the location of my primary VPN by the second VPN ("slave").  My mobile internet and data comes from Finland because it is cheap. I need to connect to my school's VPN server in Sweden. My school allows only connections to their server from Sweden with password+username (no certificates).  They have a firewall which blocks connections coming from outside of Sweden.   ol liInternet is gained with a mobile-connection of Telia-Sonera of Finland./li liFirst VPN connection allows access to institutional materials ... but it requires local IP is in Sweden. I give them my username+password but they have extra security with local IP./li liSecond VPN ("Slave") is required to change local IP from Finland to Sweden, but current VPN providers give only codeppp0/code, no dynamic IP and no split tunnelling.  ul li(2-3) multiples because there are multiple institutions/li /ul/li /ol  I connect to NordVPN Swedish VPN server.  However, connecting now to the school VPN server is unsuccessful, and the connection is rejected.  NordVPN's answers about having multiple VPN connections at the same time, which I do not believe because I think they are talking about their NordVPN application and because their technical proficiency of the customer service has been low     Unfortunately, it is not possible to have multiple VPN connections   active on same computer at the same time.   - -    No, you can not change the subnet details assigned for you.   - -    NordVPN routes your entire internet traffic through VPN, thus the only option for two VPN connections is to set up one VPN connection on a virtual machine.    - -    No we do not support split tunneling.    but I am ready to change my VPN provider if it is needed for the task. I am not sure if you can make split tunnelling yourself.  Based on the thread FAQ on OpenVPN, it is possible to have multiple VPN connections active at the same time     Make sure each TUN/TAP adapter has a unique, non-overlapping subnet   using server, server-bridge, or ifconfig.

Often VPN-providers use a NAT firewall - which means you are first connected to an internal network. You can get the network with codeifconfig/code. In your above example that's a 10.0.0.0/8 network (10.250.250.88 -- 10.250.250.1 netmask 0xff000000). Check that all network traffic is sent to the VPN provider./li liDownload and install a type-2 hypervisor like VirtualBox or Parallels Desktop/li liSet up the NAT network of the hypervisor with different network settings than the internal network of the VPN provider, your own network and your school's network.  Examples:  Parallels:   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/sE56W.png" alt="Parallels Shared newtwork"  VirtualBox:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YyCQR.png" alt="VirtualBox Shared newtwork"  Possible networks may be private networks in 172.16.0.0/12 (e.g. 172.18.8.0/24)/li liCreate a new VM hull and attach it to this NAT network./li liInstall a familiar OS (e.g OS X 10.9-10.11) in this VM/li liSet up a VPN connection in the VM to your school's VPN server in Sweden in the VPN in System Preferences - Network, shut down the VM and quit the hypervisor./li liConnect to NordVPN in the non-virtualized OS/li liStart the VM/li liConnect to the school's VPN server in the virtualized OS/li /ol  tested with a Parallels VM (OS X 10.11) and a private VPN server (Cisco IPSec) and an iMac (OS X 10.9) and VyprVPN (OpenVPN)  <comment293815> Is there any possibility to do this with server client/OS without the GUI. VB/Paralle's GUI slows down the system a lot. <comment293816> @Masi I don't understand your question. **server client/OS ?** <comment293817> VB for instance has heavy GUI frontend (visual environment). I would like to have the solution without extra burden of power consumption. <comment293819> @Masi Usually the memory/CPU footprint of the hypervisor itself is very low compared to the VM (e.g. 1:10 (RAM) and respectively 1:100 (CPU)). Since the VM - as the final work environment - has to have a window you can't start it headless. <comment293820> Do you understand why VM is the only solution here? It would be great to understand this better and be 100% sure that it is the only solution.
