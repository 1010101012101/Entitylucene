Blocking- IPHONE 5- Can they see texts I sent if I blocked THEIR number <body> I had accidentally blocked a number from my phone and had texted them..If I'm the one who blocked them... did they receive the texts I sent when I had their number blocked?   <comment161007> you blocked them from reaching you, not you from reaching them.
