How to type pipe with the ABNT2 layout? <body> I'm used to the ABNT2 brazilian portuguese layout, which is very nice for both programming and typing with accents, but my apple keyboard lacks keys that are standard for such layout, like one on the left of Z and a fourth on the right of M. As a result, slashes and question mark need extra work to type, namely pressing alt-q, alt-shift-q and alt-w. But nothing for pipe.  So I wondered how I could type a pipe without messing with ukelele as suggested here?  <answer259605> You could set up a shortcut for it in system prefs/keyboard/text/replace with  Minimum 2 characters I think.
