How do I reinstall header files from Homebrew? <body> I was doing some terminal-fu really quickly and ended up removing some header files in my Homebrew include directory by mistake. So far my solution has been to reinstall a package when I use or upgrade something that notices it's missing. However, I'd like to know if there is there any way I can reinstall just the header files. I know I could reinstall all packages, but that just seems much more burdensome.
