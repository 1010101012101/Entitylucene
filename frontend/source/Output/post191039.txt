Why are family organizer and family member photo the same in iOS8 Family Sharing? <body> I'm the organizer and added my daughter as member. I added her directly by entering her Apple ID and password. First her picture showed up with my ID, after I manually changed my picture for my ID, it now shows for her ID as well. Any idea how to change her picture back to her own?  <answer191551> Having the same problem. We also added the child's user id &amp; password.  How can we fix it, so that each Family Member keeps their own individual photo?  <comment226900> "I added her directly by entering her Apple ID and password" something is wrong right there, because when you add a family member to a family you do not need the family members password.
