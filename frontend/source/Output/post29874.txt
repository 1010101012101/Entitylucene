How can I list all user accounts in the terminal? <body> How can I list all local user accounts (whether logged in or NOT so 'users' or 'who' is no good) in the terminal on a mac? OS X version is 10.6.8.  I have seen this suggested - dscacheutil -q group  But it lists domain user groups and non-local accounts.  <answer29877> How about  precodedscacheutil -q user | grep -A 3 -B 2 -e uid:\ 5'[0-9][0-9]' /code/pre  <answer29878> If no user home directories were moved then codels /users/code will do. Except it will also list directories like 'Shared'.  <answer81577> Try this one. I used it to find lost hidden account.  precodedscl . list /Users | grep -v '^_' /code/pre  <answer94358> codedscacheutil/code returns more than just local users, for example any users I've queried Directory Services for also show.  I have found this more useful:  precodedscl . list /Users | grep -v "^_" /code/pre  Although it also returns the likes of codedaemon/code, codenobody/code and coderoot/code.  <answer169054> User accounts since 10.6 are being managed by OpenDirectory. The backend files related to users for OpenDirectory are here:  precode/var/db/dslocal/nodes/Default/users /code/pre  Executing codels */code in this directory will enumerate all local users registered on the system. Executing codeplutil -p &lt;file&gt;.plist/code will allow you to read some properties for specified user account (i.e. current home directory path).  This is rather undocumented so I accept downvotes. However, this method can be used to inspect a system which is not running, and for which the user has only an offline disk image.  <answer250374> You can also type:  codewho/code which tells you who's logged on, and where they're coming from. Useful if you're looking for someone who's actually physically in the same building as you, or in some other particular location.  codew/code which tells you who's logged in, and what they're doing. Especially useful: the 'idle' part. This allows you to see whether they're actually sitting there typing away at their keyboards right at the moment.  <answer271776> JMTCW to recreate a command line friendly code/etc/passwd/code equivalent (though not quite in the same order):  precodedscacheutil -q user |     paste -d " "  - - - - - - - - |     sed 's/^name: //;s/ [^[:space:]]*: /:/g' /code/pre  Or if you prefer a space separated output (but parsing GECOS field will be a little more complicated:  precodedscacheutil -q user |     cut -d: -f2 |\     paste -d " "  - - - - - - - - /code/pre  <comment34301> I like this option. It returns a bunch of accounts beginning with an underscore, though. Any way to filter this out? e.g. _softwareupdate, _mysql <comment34302> Pipe the result through grep `dscl . list /Users | grep -v ^_.*` <comment34305> As a long time AIX user, I sure miss the system management commands they baked into their unix. [lsuser](http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/sonasic/sonas1ic/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.sonas.doc%2Fmanpages%2Flsuser.html) would be nice to have for this purpose. <comment35337> Very cool! I'll have to remember this one. <comment94047> That's precisely what @Mark said [here](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/29874/how-can-i-list-all-user-accounts-in-the-terminal/81577#comment34302_29877). <comment114143> This is such an easy one to commit to memory, too. <comment179974> Never do this. There are much more than just `Shared` that can be there. <comment304030> what is the point of hidden accounts? <comment357380> I like it, but it required sudo/root to work, std admin user got a permission error.  `dscl` works for std admin.
