why use yosemite bootable usb installer when you can use recovery HD for clean install? <body> i just re-installed Yosemite from Recovery HD. Performed a clean install as i erased my HD from Recovery HD before installing the software.  Yosemite is being downloaded since a few hours but it would be the same with the USB Installer as Recovery HD is an Installer too.  So in both cases you need internet. Am i right or wrong?  <answer193344> A bootable drive saves the entire OS X installer locally. If your current reinstall were happening from a bootable drive, the "downloading Yosemite" step would be nonexistent because everything's already there.  As in, you're wrong. The specific benefit of a bootable drive is the ability to reinstall OS X without needing to download it on the spot. (Of course, first you needed to have downloaded the OS X installer and run through the bootable drive-making procedure at some point beforehand, but the point is that once you've done that one download, you've got it for whenever you need it.)  <comment230385> Yup - I keep one ready on a USB key for that 'just in case' moment. <comment230387> Well - both need internet, but one needs it right this minute or you're stuck, the other is at your leisure.
