How can I do a fresh install of OSX Mountain Lion onto my SSD for my Macbook? <body> My macbook is sluggish and has so much stuff that I don't use anymore and just want to start over from scratch basically. I did a time machine backup just in case something goes wrong.  ul liNew blank SSD /li liMacBook Pro (early 2011)/li libacked up everything that I wanted to keep on an external HDD so that I can put it back on the SSD once OSX is installed again./li /ul  I can't directly clone everything to the SSD since my HDD has over 300GB used and my SSD is only 120GB.  Is it possible/how can I get OSX installed on my SSD without a HDD Caddy.  There is no install disc since my Macbook came with the OS preinstalled on my HDD?  <answer100000> h2Internet Recovery/h2  If you installed the Internet Recovery firmware update, hold kbd⌘ cmd/kbd + kbd⌥ alt/kbd + kbdR/kbd on boot to begin.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/B1FLV.jpg" alt="Internet Recovery Progress"  An image of OS X will be downloaded from the internet, and can be installed on the internal SSD normally. Once this is complete, you can restore your data from your external drive.  <comment117668> Ok thanks, Do I download that onto my HDD or SSD? <comment117669> @Justin The OS X image: SSD. (The firmware update needs to be installed with a drive that has OS X on it already - your HDD.) <comment117670> Ok so download that, discharge static, remove hdd, insert SSD, boot with that key combo? <comment117671> And that link says "sorry this download is unavailable." Would updating via the appstore include the Internet recovery firmware update? <comment117674> @Justin Theoretically yes - Since the firmware update was released on the Mac App Store, updating via the MAS should include that update.
