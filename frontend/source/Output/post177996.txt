Can I get rid of these timestamps in terminal? <body> I'm getting Javascript output in my terminal and it currently looks like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zC05N.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Is there a way to get rid of the timestamps at the beginning of each line? I'm not sure if this is something I somehow added at some point or if it's the default behaviour (or perhaps coming from the Javascript?).  Either way it's annoying because it takes up space and makes copy pasting the output a pain.  <comment210748> What are you running which generates this output in the first place? <comment210754> Perhaps something to do with [this](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber/wiki/Running-Features) or maybe  [this](https://drawception.com/pub/panels/2015/1-29/nfSe5pXxGW-8.png)? I'm gonna have nightmares about running cucumbers tonight.
