How to stop programs stealing focus when initializing a build in XCode? <body> I'm currently using XCode in conjunction with Unity. When I initiate a build in Unity, it automatically runs XCode. XCode will then steal focus from whatever app I happen to be in. Is there a way of disabling apps stealing focus in OSX?  <answer77084> You can add this to the Info.plist of Xcode to make it launch in the background:  precode&lt;key&gt;LSBackgroundOnly&lt;/key&gt; &lt;string&gt;True&lt;/string&gt; /code/pre  (You might need to get write privileges on the Info.plist if you downloaded Xcode from the Mac App Store)  Source and details about what it can break: http://reviews.cnet.com/8301-13727_7-20085680-263/keep-applications-from-stealing-focus-when-opening-in-os-x/  <comment87570> When you initiate a build in Unity, does a window or tab also automatically open in Xcode, or is it silent (just the app activates or becomes the focused app)?
