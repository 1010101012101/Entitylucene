Mac Pro 3,1 No Longer Appears in List of Shared Devices <body> I have an early-2008 Mac Pro (3,1) that I use for nothing but serving iTunes content via Home Sharing. I keep the MP in a spare bedroom and rarely interact with it directly. My usual workflow is to add content to the iTunes Library from my Macbook Pro via Screen Sharing (drag from MBP desktop to MP desktop, then add to iTunes Library), or to open the MP via Finder and drag-and-drop media files from MBP to MP desktop, then add to iTunes Library via Screen Sharing.  Until recently, this has all worked more or less without a hitch. However, in the last few weeks, the MP has stopped showing up in the MBP's Finder Sidebar. I can see the MBP from the MP Sidebar, but not visa-versa. Have tried deleting com.apple.sidebarlist.plist file, but no change. Cannot navigate directly to MP via Finder's Go  Connect to Server item. Network analyzer tool shows MP is connected to network and ping-able.  Someone please tell me what the heck is going on here.  <comment341561> Have you rebooted/restarted all devices involved, including routers/wifi transceivers, etc? If so, please edit question. <comment341801> Located the problem in the Sharing control panel. All of my sharing options had been reset to off/unshared. No idea how that happened, as I'm the only one who accesses that computer, and I certainly didn't do it. Maybe a recent software update?
