TextEdit - quickly switch between colors <body> I am using TextEdit, and I am frequently switching between red, blue and black for the text colour. Right now I have to move my mouse to the colour picker in the toolbar and select the desired colour.  Is there a way for me to press a key combination to switch between them instead?  <answer105120> There are two ways that I can think of:  One involves running an apple script and mapping keys, which is difficult depending on your skill level, it is described in this post:  http://macscripter.net/viewtopic.php?id=19711  The script requires that you have support for assistive services enabled, which I had to do.  This can be found at: /Applications/System Preferences/Accessibility/ img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/c3hNZ.png" alt="enter image description here"  I've extracted the script here.  precodeAll you need to do is save the three files changing one line: activate application "TextEdit" tell application "System Events" to tell text area 1 of scroll area 1 of window 1 of process "TextEdit" to if exists then     set {x, y} to value of attribute "AXSelectedTextRange"     if x â‰¤ y then tell application "TextEdit" to set color of document 1's characters x thru y to {0, 0, 0} end if /code/pre  All you need to do is copy the above text and then save it as a file called "black (or whatever you want).scpt" For changes to Blue you need to change the second to last line to:  precode{0, 0, 65535} /code/pre  For Red; and  precode{65535, 0, 0} /code/pre  For Black just use the one I posted above.  Then you will need to assign the AppleScript files to a keyboard shortcut via Automator, although there are third party tools that make this easy.  The other uses the shortcut: Command + shift + T and having the three colours already defined in the boxes below. I assume you are already doing this? And it does not really qualify as keyboard shortcuts.  <comment123608> I found the answer with a google search with the following terms: textedit change text colour keyboard shortcuts
