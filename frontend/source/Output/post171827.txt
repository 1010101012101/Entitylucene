Mac App Store Download Failure - Clear Cache? <body> I bought a program on the Mac App Store (Desk) on one of my computers.  I am running Yosemite on a different computer and I tried to install the program from the Mac App Store - while I was on a public WiFi connection that blocks the Mac App Store. The download failed - but any attempt since then on that computer fails to download that one app.  Whenever I attempt to "Install" the program in the Mac App Store it eventually times out and I receive the following error:  "We could not complete your purchase. The request timed out." I can download and install other apps just fine.  When I attempt to download I see the following in the console:  precode2/13/15 9:53:20.491 AM storeaccountd[351]: ADI: {     "Cache-Control" = "max-age=604800";     Connection = "keep-alive";     "Content-Length" = 0;     Date = "Wed, 28 Jan 2015 15:26:24 GMT";     Location = "http://10.66.66.66/denied.html";     Server = "squid/2.6.STABLE21";     Via = "1.1 8802 (squid/3.3.5)";     "X-Cache" = "MISS from 8802"; } /code/pre  I believe what has happened is that the App Store Web View has cached the redirect to the "denied" page from the public WiFi, but I don't know how to fix this.  ol liI have rebooted/li liI have restarted App Store/li liI have Cleared Cache in Safari/li liI tried delete this files: ul li/private/var/folders/tv/mw9ndb1s7qn76_xtbg8zy3v80000gp/C/com.apple.WebKit.WebContent+com.apple.appstore/li li/private/var/folders/tv/mw9ndb1s7qn76_xtbg8zy3v80001z2/C/com.apple.appstore/li li/private/var/folders/tv/mw9ndb1s7qn76_xtbg8zy3v80001z2/C/com.apple.appstore/com.apple.appstore/li li/private/var/folders/tv/mw9ndb1s7qn76_xtbg8zy3v80001z2/C/com.apple.WebKit.WebContent+com.apple.appstore/li li/private/var/folders/tv/mw9ndb1s7qn76_xtbg8zy3v80001z2/T/com.apple.appstore/li li/private/var/folders/tv/mw9ndb1s7qn76_xtbg8zy3v80001z2/T/com.apple.appstore.PluginXPCService/li li/private/var/folders/tv/mw9ndb1s7qn76_xtbg8zy3v80001z2/T/com.apple.WebKit.WebContent+com.apple.appstore/li /ul/li /ol  <answer171832> Got this sorted out.  ol liQuit App Store./li liUse strongTerminal/strong to quit the following processes and to delete the following folders:  precodekillall storeaccountd killall storeassetd killall storedownloadd killall storeinappd rm -rf ~/Library/Caches/storeaccountd rm -rf ~/Library/Caches/storeassetd rm -rf ~/Library/Caches/storedownloadd rm -rf ~/Library/Caches/storeinappd /code/pre/li liRestart App Store and download!/li /ol  <comment202235> and the root cause was ?? <comment202374> Root cause - open wifi blocked the AppStore and the AppStore cached the denied redirect.
