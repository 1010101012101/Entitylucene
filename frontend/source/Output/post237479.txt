How to Change USB Thumb icon using Terminal or Bash/other scripting language <body> I'm looking for a method to change USB or External Drive Icon using bash or any other command line method. I know how to manually chnage them like this  I am using El Capitan  <answer237531> You need to copy the code.icns/code file to the root folder of the volume. The new file needs to be named code.VolumeIcon.icns/code. For example, if you are using a Bash shell, have the file codevol_external.icns/code and destination code/Volumes/MyStick/code, then below would be the command.  precodecp  vol_external.icns  /Volumes/MyStick/.VolumeIcon.icns /code/pre     strongA word of warning: Once you assign an icon to a volume,  changing this icon is very difficult. I feel there must be a bug somewhere in OS X. However, deleting the icon does seem to work./strong   To get a directory listing for this copied file, you may need to include the code-a/code option in the codels/code command line. For example, the command  precodels  /Volumes/MyStick /code/pre  will not display the file code.VolumeIcon.icns/code, but the command  precodels  -a  /Volumes/MyStick /code/pre  will show the file.     Note: Normally, files starting with a code./code do not appear in the Finder application.   <answer237657> In my case, simply copying was insufficient. I used the SetFile attribute as shown in the below code:  precodecp vol_external.icns /Volumes/MyStick/.VolumeIcon.icns sudo SetFile -a C /Volumes/MyStick/ /code/pre  <comment291387> I as far as I can tell, SetFile is a deprecated command.
