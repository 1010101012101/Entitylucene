Is there no way to dismiss a timer/alarm with the earpod controls on iPhone that does not result in resuming playback? <body> I have an iPhone 5 with iOS 6. This is what happens:  ol liAudio playing in the background OR paused audio playback/li liTimer goes off with alarm sound/li liDismiss alarm with Earpods center button/li liPlayback resumes/li /ol  I would have thought that after dismissing an alarm sound the phone would go back to whatever state it was in before the alarm, but that doesn't happen in the case of paused playback. This behavior is confusing and seems inconsistent.  Is there a way to turn of the Timer alarm using just Earpods, and without having music playback start?
