Hiding emacs backup files in Finder <body> I would like to find a way to hide all the *~ files in Finder, which are used as backup files by Emacs. Is there a general approach to make Finder hide all the files with their names matching certain patterns? Thanks.  <answer53674> If you don't like all the code#*#/code and code*~/code files floating around in your working directory, put the following elisp code in your code.emacs/code file.  precode;; Put autosave files (ie #foo#) and backup files (ie foo~) in ~/.emacs-backups/. (custom-set-variables   '(auto-save-file-name-transforms '((".*" "~/.emacs-backups/autosaves/\\1" t)))   '(backup-directory-alist '((".*" . "~/.emacs-backups/backups/"))))  ;; create the autosave dir if necessary, since emacs won't. (make-directory "~/.emacs-backups/autosaves/" t) /code/pre  Reference: http://snarfed.org/gnu_emacs_backup_files  <answer74295> If you want to hide a file from GUI you can use codechflags/code utility, e.g.  precodechflags hidden *~ /code/pre  As a permanent solution you can install a codelaunchd/code agent with command    precodefind $HOME -type f -name '*~' -exec chflags hidden '{}' ';' /code/pre  I used Lingon for that.  <comment61316> If you are only concerned about Emacs backup files, would storing them all in a single folder (e.g. `~/.emacs-backups/`) be an option as well? <comment61328> @patrix Thank you, I did so. Sometimes, it's easier to customize the Emacs OS than Mac OS:) <comment61330> That's truly true. Please post the specific settings for `backup-directory-alist` etc. as the answer so others can benefit from it in the future.
