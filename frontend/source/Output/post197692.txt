Can someone identify this broken MacBook Pro part? <body> I recently removed the battery from my Mid 2010 MacBook Pro 15 inch model and I noticed that this piece was broken. It appears to be a plastic black bridge close to where the battery is normally stored. It is sitting next to a metallic looking bridge piece that is connected by two screws. This black piece is much smaller though. What does this do and is it important?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Tonxw.jpg" alt=""  <comment236386> It would probably be much more helpful if you'd provide a picture of everything you described. <comment236388> File was too large for SE <comment236394> Sorry, not an answer but you might find a way to identify it on the take apart instructions on iFixit.com. <comment236457> It seems to have something to do with the trackpad ribbon, but it appears to be some kind of guide or connector, not sure if "essential" - look here: https://d3nevzfk7ii3be.cloudfront.net/igi/TTD4Myj2tc6ARsc1 and this guide in general: https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/MacBook+Pro+15-Inch+Unibody+Mid+2010+Logic+Board+Replacement/3097
