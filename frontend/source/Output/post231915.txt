Removing XCode while keeping the command line tools (on El Capitan) <body> As by subject.  There are a number of links, such as this that deal with the issue but are not El Capitan specific and/or are just not that on the subject or are not up to date.    Is it possible to Uninstall XCode 7 while keeping the Command Line Tools (and still being able to get the CLT upgrades)? Should I just uninstall everything and reinstall just the CLT (how?)?  Any other way?  <answer243506> Personally, I think that instead of trying to "bodge" a method of uninstalling XCode while leaving CLT intact is too cumbersome.  My suggestion is to:  ol liUninstall XCode Completely/li liInstall XCode CLT/li /ol  Doing this should take you less than 5 minutes total and is quite simple.  hr  h2Uninstall XCode/h2  There are a number of different ways to uninstall XCode.  An excellent tutorial can be found at OSXDaily.  However, the most reliable way I have found to uninstall software is with the emfree/em App reccomended by Macworld.com called AppCleaner.  You can "drag and drop" or "Search" for your Apps that you want to remove and it will find all related files/directories for you - even the ones that get installed as launch daemons.    emDisclaimer:  I am strongnot/strong affiliated with the App or the developers of the App in any way./em   h2Install XCode CLT (Yosemite through Sierra)/h2  Installing XCode CLT is actaully quite simple.  In terminal execute the following command:  precodexcode-select --install /code/pre  You will get a dialog box that will prompt you to "Get XCode," "Cancel," or "Install."  Select "Install" to install the CLT emonly/em.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0N9fL.jpg" alt="xcode-select install dialog"  The installer will do it's thing and will notify you once it's complete.  Once finished you will have access to tools such as codegit/code and codesvn/code.  You can execute those commands by testing them out in Terminal.  CLT will be installed to code/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools//code  That's it!  XCode CLT are installed and ready for use.  <comment299886> I did exactly how you suggested. Xcode is removed while `brew doctor` for example gives me `Error: Failure while executing: /usr/bin/otool -L /usr/bin/install_name_tool`and `xcode-select --install` returns `xcode-select: error: command line tools are already installed, use "Software Update" to install updates` <comment299889> Did you delete the `/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/`? <comment299890> No, as not indicated in your procedure. Going to. <comment299893> Sometimes with AppCleaner, you have to select the folders - it's not perfect, but it's really good. <comment299896> Yes, it's a good app and I was already using it. I deleted the CLT folder and reinstalled but the problem with brew remains (brew is the only reason I need CLT, I do not use Xcode anymore and it occupies ~9GB) <comment299897> So you installed CLT - does that work?  Now brew (I don't use brew) is throwing an error? <comment299902> Yes, before removing Xcode, brew was working fine <comment299903> You may need to reinstall brew **or** create symlinks from the commands to `/usr/bin/` <comment299906> Also svn was not working. To fix I had to run `sudo xcode-select --switch /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/` <comment300520> I think you should update your answer. <comment330442> I tried this method on Sierra, actually AppCleaner won't delete the command line tool folder, and you don't need to. Just delete all files found by AppCleaner, then do `sudo xcode-select --switch /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/`. Run `brew doctor` to make sure everything is OK.
