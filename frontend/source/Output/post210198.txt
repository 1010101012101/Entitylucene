Mount Ext4 on El Capitan <body> I recently installed OS X 10.11 on my Mac.  I tried to read a SD card with an Ext4 partition which wasn't even shown in codeDisk Utility/code, although codediskutil/code did show it as a Linux partition.  I can't seem to mount the partition (the codemount/code command seems to have changed, but I haven't explored this fully).  I had codeFUSE for OS X/code installed and updated to 2.8.1. I also had codefuse-ext2/code, but even though this was shown in Preferences, it shows "Not Installed". I tried to re-install from the sourceforge site, but got the following error:-  precodeThis package is incompatible with this version of OS X and may fail to install. /code/pre  Has anyone any solution to allow Ext4 partitions to be mounted.  <answer210207> As discussed in fuse-ext2 / OSX 10.11 "El Capitan" make fails, installation of codefuse-ext2/code fails on OS X 10.11, El Capitan, due to System Integrity Protection (SIP).  The recommended solution right now is to disable SIP.  <answer224477> strongWarning: Having experienced some of the same issues described in Schnorch's answer, I can no longer recommend this program!/strong Original answer left below for posterity...  A commercial ($20) option is Paragon ExtFS for OS X, which supports read/write mounting of ext2/3/4. I'm using it now in El Capitan.  It has a few annoyances, such as seemingly not paying attention to mount options specified in fstab... But generally seems to do the job fine.  <answer225330> Don't use Paragon ExtFS for OSX with El Capitan.The port is very experimental despite the fact that Paragon claims support for El Capitan.  I've damaged two times a 1.5TB ext4 filesystem beyond irreparable limits, using two independent installations of EL Capitan (10.11.3) on a MacBook Pro and MacBook Air. codefsck -y /dev/sda(x)/code on an linux box after file transfer completed is claiming hundreds of thousands multiply-claimed blocks with several files and directories - filesytem gone!  ExtFs is also not implemented in DiskUtilty in Ela Capitan so you can't check the integrity of your filesystem nor format in ext2/3/4...  Paragon Guys please fix your software urgently! Your claim supporting El Capitan is very much misleading!  In Summary dump Paragon ExtFS with OSX 10.11.x and not waste your $20 or wind back to Yosemite or earlier OSX's. Alternatively put a Linux Box on your GB network and copy through SMB. It's safer....  <answer236886> I have made a fork of fuse-ext2 which installs everything in /Library and /usr/local, so that you don't have to disable SIP in Mac OS X El Capitan. Glad if you try it ;-).  <answer251611>   Try using codeext4fuse/code.     ext4fuse This is a read-only implementation of ext4 for FUSE. The main reason this exists is to be able to read linux partitions from OSX. However, it should work on top of any FUSE implementation.   Basic usage, where codeN/code and codeM/code in code/dev/diskNsM/code are the disk and partition numbers (such as code7/code and code1/code) of your Ext4 ("Linux") data. You can find these appropriate numbers for your machine in OS X' Disk Utility.  pre class="lang-bsh prettyprint-override"codemkdir -p "$HOME/tmp/my-linux-mount" ext4fuse "/dev/diskNsM" "$HOME/tmp/my-linux-mount" /code/pre  hr  Install using Homebrew.  pre class="lang-bsh prettyprint-override"codebrew cask install osxfuse brew install ext4fuse /code/pre  According to the docs, you might also have to add code&lt;your user&gt;/code to the codeoperator/code group. Here using codewhoami/code to find your current username.  pre class="lang-bsh prettyprint-override"codesudo dscl . append /Groups/operator GroupMembership `whoami` /code/pre  <comment254263> Hey, just wondering if you've found a solution to this problem ? <comment254270> @dastaan I worked around my original task by mounting on a Linix machine. I have also installed a Linix OS (Ubuntu MATE) in a virtual machine and can mount Ext4 using a USB card reader (the internal reader can't seem to be accessed). Neither of these is entirely satisfactory; I am undecided whether to disable SIP. I don't see why Apple wants to stop me using my machine, or why it obstinately refuses to build in Ext4 support (as it did to NTFS for years) - at least this is open source. I still hope someone will build Ext4 support which works with SIP. <comment254275> Thanks for the quick response. Lemme do it by your method, at least for now. Btw I tried disabling SIP mode to see if it works. But couldn't get it working. <comment290000> Looked interesting until I got to the Homebrew step. Is it possible for someone to make an installable package? <comment290011> Homebrew is needed only for e2fsprogs package (commands to make a new ext filesystem, do the check of an ext filesystem, etc). fuse-ext2 uses only the command e2label from efsprogs, to get the label of an ext volume. I think this is necessary for automatic mount at devices insertion (USB memory sticks, external hard drives, SD cards). If you are okay with manual mount, and don't need to make new ext filesystems or to check existing filesystems, you can leave out Homebrew and e2fsprogs installation. <comment290015> And, if you already have an installation of e2fsprogs in your system (from MacPorts, from Fink or compiled from sources) you can edit the file `/Library/Filesystems/fuse-ext2.fs/fuse-ext2.util` in order to use your e2fsprogs installation. <comment344697> Thanks for this answer! Very useful.  I had to use `sudo ext4fuse /dev/diskNsM ~tmp/my-linux-mount -o allow_other` to mount it before I was able to open it with my user... Wasn't able to open the disk without `sudo` on my system <comment346848> This reads like a horror story! Have you had any subsequent dealings with Paragon's ExtFS since that would update this experience, or have you avoided using it since? I was considering it as an option, but this gives me legitimate concerns to read more before doing so. <comment348497> Quick note here, :"quoting" `~/` in a command using `zsh` will actually create `\~` folder instead of using home directory. Consider removing quotes or use `$HOME` instead. I confirm this works flawlessly on MacOS Sierra 10.12.3 :) <comment348530> @GabLeRoux: quite right! Knowing how much copypasta happens on superuser, I kept the quotes but changed to `$HOME`. Thanks! <comment349907> I had a similar horror recently, but, fortunately, i was able to recover my files (only using windows tools). <comment349910> Where's fstab on OSX? I am using OSX 10.12. i can only access ext4 in read-only mode now. I recently lost my ext4 partitions but i'm still fighting with Paragon.. <comment349911> at some point, while checkin my didsks, i was asked to install a newer version of e2fsck so i guess even those with older installations of e2fsprogs are advised to upgrade.
