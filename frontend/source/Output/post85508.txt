How do you set the selection in iTunes in an AppleScript <body> I'm writing a script in iTunes, part of which changes the selected playlist. When I'm all done, I want to restore the playlist and the selected tracks. I was able to do the first, but haven't found a way to do the last (and I'd really rather not use UI scripting and keyboard automation to achieve it). Here's what I've got that's working:  precodetell application "iTunes"     -- Save the original playlist and selection     set originalPlaylist to view of front window     set originalSelection to selection      -- go on and select some other playlist     delay 5      set view of front window to originalPlaylist     -- something like this, which doesn't work:     -- set selection to originalSelection end tell /code/pre  <answer85515> Try:  precodetell application "iTunes"     set originalSelection to first item of selection     delay 5     reveal originalSelection end tell /code/pre  <comment98680> Thanks, I had only tried `reveal` on the entire selection, which throws an error. It's not as good as selecting the entire range, but it's a start.
