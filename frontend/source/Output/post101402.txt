Specify AppleScript bundle icon <body> I'm trying to assign an icon to my AppleScript bundle, but without success.  Steps:  ul liAdded the icon (applet.icns) to the bundle's code/Contents/Resources/code directory/li liModified the bundle's  code/Contents/Info.plist/code:  precode&lt;key&gt;CFBundleIconFile&lt;/key&gt; &lt;string&gt;applet.icns&lt;/string&gt; /code/pre/li /ul  ** edit **  I ran the 'Set Bundle Icon File' script in the Applet Bundle Tools.  It did not change the situation.  What am I missing?  <answer101455> Disclaimer: This may not work for an AppleScript bundle.  First I open the icon in preview.app.  I select the full picture and type Command-C  The way I typically change icons for files is that I select the file and type Command-I  In the info window that opens, I then select the current icon in the upper left.  Type Command-V and the icon (theoretically) will change to the picture in the clipboard  <comment119617> Wow, that work!  Thanks so much.  Question, where does it store that icon?  If I distribute the bundle, will the icon be lost? <comment119736> I have tried sharing it before, but I don't know where the icon is stored (sorrry), but I have had about 50/50 success rate with it being shared and keeping the icon.  You will have to try it yourself, and see if it works.  Just try copying it with a flash-drive to another computer and see if it keeps the icon.
