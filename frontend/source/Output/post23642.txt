What is the best widget for song lyrics? <body> I'm looking for a widget that can  ul liShow the lyrics of the current playing song/li liGet the lyrics online if there is none on the music, and save it/li liNice designed/li /ul  I used to use the Harmonic widget, but it seems it was abandoned  <answer23662> h1SaveThoseLyrics (Freeware)br //h1  It looks like it does the same thing as Harmonic.  h1LyricSearch (Free)/h1  Allows you to search for lyrics by song. (Don't think this is what you are looking for)  h1Canto Pod (Free)/h1  Allows you to search for a song, then add it to your iTunes library. (Don't think you are looking for this either)  LyricSearch and Canto Pod were lyrics widgets that I found. As I already said, I don't think that's what you are looking for, but I put them there in case you did want to search by song, rather than the current iTunes song. I hope this helps you out.
