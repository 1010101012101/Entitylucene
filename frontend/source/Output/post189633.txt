OSX Yosemite DNS cache Issues <body> I'm having a really frustrating DNS cache issue on my Macbook running Yosemite.  I'm a web developer so i'm always working with new sites and setting up new servers / domains etc.. so every now and then I will try to load a domain that hasn't propagated yet and I will get the standard "ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED" error.  I will then confirm the domain has propagated and try clearing my DNS cache using every single option I've found online:  ul lisudo killall -INFO mDNSResponder/li lisudo discoveryutil udnsflushcaches/li lisudo discoveryutil mdnsflushcache;sudo discoveryutil udnsflushcaches;say flushed/li /ul  And NONE of them work! I simply can NEVER access that domain until I restart my Mac or wait 24 hours or something stupid!  I can access the domain FINE on my phone via both WIFI (same network) AND 3G / Mobile... so the issue is 100% with my Macbook and Yosemite!  It's so frustrating!!!!  Does anyone know a fix for this?   <answer189634> Yosemite doesn't use mDNSResponder, it uses discoveryd - which has caused so many people so many issues that Apple have done an about face &amp; are re-introducing mDNSResponder in Yosemite 10.10.4  You can sign up for the Appleseed Beta if you really want it early.  <comment224941> So there is no way to manually go in and delete a single url from being cached?? This is a huge bug! Is restarting really the only fix? <comment224942> there's a useful answer here, but it does seem to have been causing issues for a lot of people - http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/158166/85275
