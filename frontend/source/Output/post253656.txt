How do I find the full model number of a USB Flash Drive <body> I very much love the Sandisk extreme USB flash drive's so every time I break one or it stops working I kept buying new ones as chucked these in a drawer.  Well, I finally have sometime on my hand and found out they have lifetime warranty. But I have a couple receipts and have no idea how to match them to the receipt. There is a model number on the back of it but not the full number.  Ex. One of them has Model #: SDCZ80-032G But the orders have additional letters/numbers, for example: SDCZ80-032G-G46 SDCZ80-032G-AFFP etc.  Is there a way on OS X to retrieve additional info about the flash drives inserted?
