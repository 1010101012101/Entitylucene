Split audio and video into two separate files <body> Is there a way (I'm thinking using QuickTime perhaps) of taking a video+audio file and splitting it into two separate files, one of just the video, and one of just the audio? I know that in Finder, there's a context menu item "Encode Selected Video Files" which lets you encode it as audio-only, but not as video-only.  Thanks!  <answer95437> I would recommend the VLC player, my favorite, it will play anything and do anything.  Here is how the splinting could work.  Here is where you can download the VLC.  <answer95439> QuickTime 7 Pro is the tool I have used for this splitting of tracks. Once you have registered the software, there is a nice tool that shows all tracks and you can delete them, move them, edit them separately.  <answer95495> ffmpeg supports demuxing without re-encoding:  precodeffmpeg -i input.mkv # show stream numbers and formats ffmpeg -i input.mkv -c copy audio.m4a # AAC ffmpeg -i input.mkv -c copy audio.mp3 # MP3 ffmpeg -i input.mkv -c copy audio.ac3 # AC3 ffmpeg -i input.mkv -an -c copy video.mkv ffmpeg -i input.mkv -map 0:1 -c copy audio.m4a # stream 1 /code/pre  code-c copy/code is like code-vcodec copy -acodec copy/code. code-map 0:1/code means file 0, stream 1. code-an/code means audio none.  <comment111941> The first link is for splitting a file into smaller segments e.g. saving a 5-minute segment from a 1-hour video, and not for separating the video and audio streams. I'll look around VLC and see if I can find something, though. <comment111942> Thanks, I might buy that if I can't figure out something in VLC. <comment111947> It was just an example, maybe you want to read this one! http://www.ehow.com/how_8690780_split-videos-vlc.html <comment112083> I easily used http://ffmpegmac.net/ to do this, and it was very fast and easy. +1 for no re-encoding. <comment343798> Used this technique to extract one specific video stream from a multi-angle Xvid file for upload. +1
