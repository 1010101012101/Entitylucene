Two Macs, one Apple ID, separating information <body> We just purchased a Mac for an assistant and it currently uses my Apple ID.  I keep seeing my files on that computer.  Is the only way to keep my information private to use a separate Apple ID for the new computer?  <comment355947> Yes. Or sign out the other machine entirely, though you'll have issues going forwards, as everything on it belongs to your ID & they won't be able to update anything. One user, one ID is the paradigm.
