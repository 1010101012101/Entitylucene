Sierra - How do I disable automatic workspace switching when focusing an application? <body> On an older version of Mac, I was able to achieve this by unchecking the "emWhen switching to an application, switch to a Space with open windows for the application/em" setting in Mission Control. I recently upgraded to Sierra, and unchecking that box has not given me the same effect. I have a full screen application running on two monitors and my third monitor is reserved for everything else. If I click on my application that spans 2 monitors, the 3rd one switches to it too. I do not want my workspaces to switch automatically for me at all. What do I need to do to achieve this?
