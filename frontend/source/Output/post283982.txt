Variable Length 'Wipe' Transition in Motion 5 <body> I am trying to create a motion project that will take two clips, and wipe from the right, to the center of the first clip, revealing the second behind. Afterwards, it would continue the wipe to the left. This will also have an angled rectangle over the reveal line, for aesthetic purposes. I have tried using a transition, but this does not allow for build ins and build outs. This is important as I would like to use it in multiple cases, for different lengths, but retain the wipe section timing. I have also tried using a generator, with drop zones, but this does not work with audio. How would I work around this issue of not being able to use build in/out markers in transitions, especially in this case?  <comment364770> Give me a reference what it looks like and can help you.
