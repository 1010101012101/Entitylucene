Apple dictation missing commands in web browser <body> I am dealing with physical problems from the keyboard/mouse, so discovering Apple dictation has been amazing. However, I work a lot in Google Docs and Gmail... and Google Chrome (or any web browser) does not let me use all of the commands that Apple's dictation provides. It's missing essential selection, navigation and editing commands that are available when using an Apple app like TextEdit. Those commands are essential for moving the cursor around and making fixes without the keyboard. The only solution that's been working for me has been to type in TextEdit, and then to copy and paste into the browser. But this is not a real solution. brbr It would be nice to stick with the native (and free) Apple dictation software on the mac, so does anyone have an idea to get these dictation commands to work in a web browser for use with gmail and google docs?   Edit: I found that Safari lets you use Apple's dictation with gmail, but still not with Google Docs.  <answer225464> Google docs uses a custom javascript application that disables the services component of the Mac (that lets the built in Mac voice dictation work.). If you want to use voice dictation in Google Docs, you have to use there build in functionally, and strongyou MUST use Google Chrome/strong.  From Google:     emFor an easy way to put words on a page, you can type with your voice in a document. At the moment, this feature is only available in Chrome   browsers./em   Here's how to activate the type with your voice function for Google Docs.  ol liIn a Chrome browser, open a Google Docs document./li liClick the codeTools menu -&gt; Voice typing.../codebr img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gL8Wj.png" alt="Go to Tools menu, then click Voice typing."/li liA pop-up microphone box will appear.

For example, here is a command for moving the cursor to the end of the line in Gmail.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/iVryu.png" alt="enter image description here"  You can find this menu under AccessibilityDictationDictation commands+  So, so long as you have key bindings for the stuff that you want, you will be able to manually create voice commands. There are lots of key bindings for Gmail, and I believe with some investigation you could find Chrome add-ons for navigating links within pages.  <comment273534> Chrome doesn't follow the Mac toolbox structure like Safari or TextEdit does. I've not tested, but that may be your solution. <comment273790> That's nice, but google's voice typing also lacks selection, navigation and editing commands. And it leaves you stuck inside Google docs without being able to use Apple dictation for other things, like controlling applications on the mac <comment273799> @JonathanCakes unfortunately that's the best solution I've been able to come up with when working with Google Docs. It's all on Google and the way they developed Google Docs. People blame Apple for not letting it work, but everything I can find points to Google not letting it work in the underlying code. Just try doing a standard Right Mouse Click in Google Docs. You can't because they've disabled that as well. It's one of the main reason why I do all my "typing" outside of Google Docs, and copy and past it in. If I compute up with an alternative solution I'll post it put here. <comment273921> I appreciate that very much. You inspired me to try again with other browsers and I found that using Safari, Apple's dictation works fine in Gmail. But sadly, not Google Docs like you said.
