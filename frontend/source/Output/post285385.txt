Cannot delete my iCloud <body> So, i forgot my password and lost my recovery key for my old apple id. I got a new one recently but i can only use the new one for my itunes and appstore. I cannot signout my old id for my iCloud since the Find My Iphone setting is turned on and it needs my password to be turned off. (I know, i'm such a dummy) Anyways, how am i supposed to replace my old id with my new id on my icloud?   *honestly, i know my case is hopeless. But i am still hoping that apple would do something about it. Thanks
