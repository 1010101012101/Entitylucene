What's your strategy for archiving emails in Mail.app? Do you archive your Sent & Trashed emails too? <body> I'm using Mail.app + IMAP email accounts for my email. I want to be able to archive all my email and make them searchable.   Currently I copy the previous month's email from my IMAP folders to local folders called 2010, 2011, etc. However I don't copy my Sent email, so I'm wondering what's the best way to archive them as well. Any suggestions? Please share!  I'd like a method that doesn't involve Gmail if possible, as I'm not a big fan of the company and the service.  <answer21708> Basically, I always BCC to myself, so never archive the Sent folder.  <answer24996> I use Mail app's "smart mailboxes" instead of copying and moving the actual messages in Mail.  For example, to archive July 2011:  ol licreate a new smart mailbox, /li liname it "Mail Archive July 2011" or whatever, /li liset the find criteria to "Date Received is in the date range 1 Jul 2011 to 31 Jul 2011",/li liyou will probably want to check the "Include messages from Sent"/li liHit okay and in a moment you have a folder contain all of July's email/li liRight-click the smart mailbox and choose the "Archive" option and save./li /ol  After this you have the option of keeping the smart folder or deleting it. Spotlight (in OS 10.6.8) searches the .mbox archives Mail produces, so your archive remains searchable.   <answer25150> Since you're in OS X Lion, the best way to "Archive" a message is perhaps using the integrated (new) way to Archive: kbdâŒ˜/kbdkbdY/kbd   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/eM4Hk.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer39722> I've recommended MailSteward to several clients. It maintains a separate SQLite (or MySQL in the "pro" version) database of archived messages. It handles de-duping too. Messages are searchable, attachments are stored and you can reply to archived messages. (Reply will open in Mail.)  <answer120556> There are many options, but I recommend the module archiving emails OpenKM. Because allows us to use the repository as a document management system to store messages massively. The mail file is an automated process for the preservation and protection of all emails.  <comment24009> When you BCC yourself, doesn't that clutter up your inbox? Do you have some rules to help manage it? <comment28241> Are you talking about what version of OS X? <comment28256> I'm on 10.7 Lion <comment28257> That's awesome, thanks! <comment44933> A further question to this if I may. Is mail.app's archive independent to the IMAP email account? In that if all emails were archived and the IMAP account removed from mail.app, the archived emails would still be available. <comment73032> And what does it do in practice ? .. Where are stored archived messages? How can they searched and restored?  Thanks <comment73121> @AlberT they go to the "Archive" folder. I'm sure that restoring is only a matter of moving them back to where you want them. Yes you can search, the archive is a folder. It just moves the messages out of the way. <comment91172> This doesn't really work with Exchange accounts -- the Archive folder is created on the remote server, negating any space-saving. <comment91173> For the record, the Archive folder is remote if you're using an Exchange server. I understand the behaviour is different for different account types -- a regular POP account will have a local Archive, for example.
