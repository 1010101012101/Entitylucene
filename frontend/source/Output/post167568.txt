How to run OS X on ext4? <body> I'd like to install OS X on an ext4 filesystem, not hfs. How can this be done? I've looked at the Apple site, but, of course, it won't say anything about that.  <comment196463> @Buscar웃 Because they don't care about it. Doesn't necessarily mean it can't be done. <comment196478> possible duplicate of [How can I mount an ext4 file system on OS X?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/29842/how-can-i-mount-an-ext4-file-system-on-os-x) <comment196507> @Buscar웃 Installing on/booting from ext4 is quite different from just mounting. <comment196514> @patrix I think that is what the op actually wants, since os it self does not work on ext4 format <comment196515> @Buscar웃 The question talks about "install OS X *on* ext4", let's stick to that for now (at least until the OP changes the wording) <comment196518> Why are you wanting to do this and what benefits over HFS+ do you expect to find? <comment196608> The wording is correct. Install OS X *on* ext 4. <comment196609> @ScunnerDarkly Just curious. I don't specifically know the advantages/disadvantages.
