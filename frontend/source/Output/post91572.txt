In applescript how do i get two different things to repeat at the same time <body> I am trying to get two different actions to repeat at different intervals but right now only the first action will repeat.   precoderepeat         keystroke "i"         delay 44     end repeat     repeat         keystroke "o"         delay 5.5     end repeat /code/pre  thank you!  <answer91577> You could take advantage of the fact that 44 is evenly divisible by 5.5 and use an inner and outer loop:  precoderepeat     keystroke "i"     repeat 8 times         keystroke "o"         delay 5.5     end repeat end repeat /code/pre  Note that for the codekeystroke/code command to work, you need to be in a codetell/code block for the codeSystem Events/code application.  <comment107542> haha i love that the numbers just happened to work out so evenly! a perfect solution. And yea I have it in a tell, just didn't paste the entire code block. Thanks again.
