Send text messages to iphone by email <body> I'm looking for a cheap hack to text myself alerts whenever my server is down. (I know there's services like Nagios etc, I don't want to get into that.) I'm already sending out emails, so I'm looking for a quick way to add my phone as another recipient to the list of emails.   I know individual carriers have different ways of doing this, but I'm looking for something apple-specific since all of the members on my team have iPhones but with different carriers.  <answer138530> Try strongIFTTT/strong. This lets you set up recipes that can do things, such as send an SMS when an email is received. The contents of the SMS can be customised based on the contents of the email, such as including the subject and/or body of the email in the SMS.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bpquo.png" width="821"  supThe tag is customisable and optional./sup
