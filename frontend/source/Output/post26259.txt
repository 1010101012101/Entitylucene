Lost password on Mac OS Extended (Journaled, Encrypted) Drive. Want to reformat it <body> I am using a Seagate Free Agent Desk external drive as my Time Machine on a modern iMac running Lion. I made the mistake of encrypting the drive, and I do not remember the password. I dont mind losing the data on the disk, and I just want to reformat it if possible in order to use it as a non encrypted drive. Any ideas on how to do this?  <answer26261> You should be able to reformat this external drive with Disk Utility without any problems.  <answer26286> Lion's Disk Utility should be able to do this. My encrypted FreeAgent is at home.  Have you tried both erasing/reformatting the volume, and repartitioning the disk itself? Repartitioning should work.  <answer26304> The encrypted volume's password is not required for erasing the disk, only to mount the encrypted volume on the disk. It's unclear whether you're being asked for the password only when connecting the disk, or when you attempt to erase it.  In Lion, you can use Disk Utility to erase an encrypted volume, but not in Mountain Lion. However, you can erase the encrypted volume with the codediskutil cs delete/code command (see Terminal section below) in both versions.  hr  h2Disk Utility (Lion only)/h2  The following steps should work in Lion:  ol liConnect the disk to your Mac. /li liWhen prompted to "Enter the password for the disk 'your disk'," emclick "Cancel"/em. You don't need to mount the encrypted volume to erase the disk. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/UqiWA.png" alt="enter image description here"/li liOpen Disk Utility and locate your external disk on the left side. Its name will likely start with its capacity and include "Seagate" or "Free Agent" in the name. You should see your encrypted volume directly under the disk. The emvolume/em will be indented and grayed out. br /img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/OzAts.png" alt="Disk Utility: List of disks and volumes"/li liSelect the emdisk/em on the left side, not the volume. br /img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/CNy7O.png" alt="enter image description here"/li liClick the "Erase" tab, found between the "First Aid" and "Partition" tabs. If you don't see the "Partition" tab, and all the buttons under the "Erase" tab are grayed out, double-check that you've selected the emdisk/em on the left side, and not the disk's emvolume/em./li liChoose a format and enter a name, then click "Erase"./li /ol  If this doesn't work, let us know which step is not working and how.  hr  h2Terminal (Lion &amp; Mountain Lion)/h2  ol liWith the encrypted disk connected, launch Terminal and enter the following command     diskutil cs list   You should see output describing the encrypted disk, starting with info about the Logical Volume Group:  precodeCoreStorage logical volume groups (1 found) | +-- Logical Volume Group 109FC023-5F18-438A-AF3D-14FF60334A0C     =========================================================     Name:         Le Disque     Size:         68375502848 B (68.4 GB)     Free Space:   0 B (0 B)     | â€¦ /code/pre  If you have more than one encrypted disk, locate the Logical Volume Group with the name of the disk you want to erase./li liCopy the UUID which follows the words "Logical Volume Group".

Make sure you've copied the correct Logical Volume Group UUID for the disk you want to erase, especially if you have more than one encrypted disk connected./em  Enter the following command to erase the encrypted disk, replacing codecopiedUUID/code with the UUID you copied:  precodediskutil cs delete copiedUUID /code/pre/li liWhen complete, the disk will be partitioned with one volume mounted, called "Untitled". You can then start using it or repartition or encrypt it in Disk Utility as needed./li /ol  <answer59704> I encountered the same issue. My best option would be to use another formatting utility from another operating system.  Starting the format from Windows wont care that mac has encryption on it.  After the partition is destroyed mac should be able to format it again.  Alternatively some Systems have disk utilities in the Bios. And you can use the manufacturers Low Level format utilities to erase the drive back to 0's. But Other than that. I think apple limits the format of encrypted mac drives. Likely to protect you from removing something that someone else encrypted. "Perhaps there is a Special key you have to hold to enable the format" If not, Perhaps there should be.  <answer74134> As joelseph said in his answer, you should be able to erase an encrypted volume in Disk Utility even without entering the password. However, I do not have a 10.8 system to test this with, and Ian C. said that 10.8 changed this.  If Disk Utility emdoes/em prevent joelseph's answer from working, strongwiping out the partition table using the terminal/strong is a viable workaround:  ol liLocate the drive in Disk Utility and click the strongInfo/strong button/li liFind the strongDisk Identifier/strong line and note what it says. It will say codedisk#/code where code#/code is a number./li liOpen the Terminal (in the Utilities folder) and enter the command:  precodesudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/disk# bs=1024k count=1 /code/pre  Where code#/code is the disk number from step #2. strongDouble check this command!/strong Then, strongtriple check the command/strong. Make sure the code/dev/disk#/code matches the codedisk#/code from step #2.  h1This command will overwrite the first megabyte of the disk with zeros, permanently destroying any information on the diks. Be sure you want to continue/h1/li liPress kbdreturn/kbd and you will be prompted for your user password. Enter the password to begin erasing the partition table./li liAfter the process finishes (you will see a message code1+0 records in 1+0 records out 1048576 bytes transferred.../code) return to Disk Utility. You should now be able to format the drive./li /ol  This was confirmed to work in chat. Again, strongbe very careful with the command/strong. If you use the wrong disk you may erase valuble data.  hr  You should never run terminal commands without understanding what they do. Here is a detailed explanation:  codedd/code stands for Data Duplicate. It is a standard system command. See the Wikipedia Article and Manual page  codeif=/code specifies the eminput file/em to duplicate from. code/dev/zero/code is a special file (actually, a emcharacter device/em) which produces nothing but zeros (NULL characters)  codeof=/code specifies the emoutput file/em to duplicate to. code/dev/disk2/code or whatever is the external hard disk to overwrite.  codebs=1024k/code specifies the emblock size/em, meaning write blocks of 1,024 kilobytes (1 megabyte). Writing blocks of 1 MB is simply faster than smaller blocks, that's why I close this size.  codecount=1/code specifies emhow many blocks/em to write. 1 block of 1 megabyte is sufficient to overwrite the partition table, meaning Disk Utility will no longer know this is a password protected disk and will allow you to format it.  <comment29994> I can't. It asks for the password, and I can't remember it. <comment30057> THANK YOU VERY MUCH!!! Choosing the disk and not the volume made it fly. Thank you for the detailed information! <comment86084> Does not work. There is not even the erase tab! But luckily I still know the password. Then I can select the *volume* not the *disk* - you'll see the erase tab then, and it's not greyed out. However, this is not the answer which this question requires. <comment86092> @gentmatt confirmed. My encrypted TM drive cannot be erased or re-partitioned via Disk Utility if I skip entering the password for the drive. I suspect this is a loophole Apple closed in the newer FileVault that shipped with 10.8.x. <comment86143> @getnmatt Your volume is listed as a Logical Volume Group, which indicates you're using Mountain Lion. Apparently the Disk Utility instructions only work in Lion, not Mountain Lion. I've update my answer with instructions for the `diskutil` command that works in both versions. <comment86180> I wish I could give you another +1 for the `diskutil` command. That's a much cleaner solution than my `dd` hack :-) <comment114725> IMHO: Encrypting your data is NEVER a mistake! <comment120252> This was extremely helpful; thank you so much. <comment266924> What is a mistake is to forget to manage passwords. <comment300315> Beware that a GPT disk and many LVM's store the metadata in multiple places, often both at the beginning and the end, and in some cases in multiple periodic places (aka EXT fs's superblocks).
