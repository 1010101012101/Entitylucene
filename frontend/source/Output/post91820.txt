disable iMessage on one or more devices but not all <body> I have an iMac, iPad, a MacBook Air, and an iPhone.br I want iMessages to work only on the iPhone.  How can that be accomplished?  <answer91871> On the Macs, in Messages.app, go to the menu Messages  Preferences, select the Accounts tab, select your Apple ID in the column on the left (if it is there) and press the '-' button to remove it.  On the iPad, go to Settings, Messages, and turn off the iMessage switch there.
