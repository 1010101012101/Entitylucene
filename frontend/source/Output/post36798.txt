MacBook Air can't connect to cafe wireless, but iPhone can <body> My MacBook Air stopped being able to connect to the wireless network at a coffee shop I frequent.  It's an open network, but requires a clickthrough on a gateway page to complete the connection to the internet.  My iPhone accesses the click through page fine and connects to the network, but my Air cannot load the page, the autoconnect pop-up will load forever, and I get a timeout when going through the browser.  Is it possible there are some stored settings for this network that I need to clear before trying to connect again?  I've tried removing the network from my list of preferred networks, looking for any entries in my keychain, and accessing the network through my guest account.  Any suggestions are appreciated!

I've tried clean copies of chrome and safari.
