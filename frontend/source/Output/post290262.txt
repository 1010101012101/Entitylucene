iPhone Podcast App refuses to download specific podcast (but iTunes on Win7 has no such problem) <body> iPhone SE 64GB (49GB free) with iOS 10.3.2  When I tell the Podcast app to download an episode it goes through the motions, displaying the progress indicator. When the download is complete the "cloud" icon does not go away, and the podcast cannot be played except when connected to WiFi.  The problem seems to affect only episodes of that one podcast.  HOWEVER, the podcast episode downloads just fine on iTunes on my (Windows) PC, and even after syncing the phone from iTunes, it STILL shows up with the cloud icon (and cannot be played unless on WiFi).  Any idea what's going on, or why I cannot download the podcast?
