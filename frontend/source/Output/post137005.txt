Random characters/number being added after file extension? <body> Does anyone know about, or come across, OSX adding random characters to filenames? It happens every now and again and I have no idea why?  It started after we had a new Windows server installed at work, and I noticed when saving to the server this would happen, but occasionally they would right themselves automatically. I assume it was a glitch or bug between OSX and Windows. It stopped for a while, but happening again today, this time to files on the Mac â€“ however these were images FROM the server which I was re-saving with a droplet in Photoshop then batch renaming. So now unsure where the issue lies.  Trying to repeat the problem this morning: Image FROM server  Ps Droplet save to Mac  Better Rename batch  move to server = Weird file name once moved. Then, selecting that copied file back on the Mac, that suddenly changes too. (Second image shows this action)  I'm on 10.9.3 on a 3.2ghz i3 iMac. Server is Windows 2013 emI think/em (Sure we upgraded from 2003).  Here are some screen shots and console shots in case it helps?!:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2gkJe.png" alt="enter image description here" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bBpGN.png" alt="enter image description here"  Occasionally also get the issue when saving to server of not having permission to save/overwrite a file - and if happening when overwriting, the file I'm updating disappears from server without warning!  If anyone has any ideas/suggestions that would be great!!  Thank you!  Ben
