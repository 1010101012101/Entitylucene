How do install OS X El Capitan onto a VM <body> I am spinning up a VM to do some ruby development. At this point I am trying to install OS X 10.11 to it. I have looked into several ways, but they are not working because I have a bad network connection. How is this done?  Here is one link that I looked at: OS X on OS X  <answer220717> Preface:  This how-to targets VirtualBox because the OP uses it. I strongly recommend to purchase Parallels Desktop or VMware Fusion though. A lot of features like drag-and-drop, strikechange the monitor resolution/strike etc. don't work properly in VirtualBox (or I don't get it to work).  hr  The installation of El Capitan is a dual-stage process. You first have to create a Yosemite VM and then update to El Capitan.  emThe script below apparently doesn't work with El Capitan. A "bootable" El Capitan iso boots to an EFI command line only. The intermediate step of creating a Yosemite.iso seems to be inevitable./em  ul liDownload the latest VirtualBox installer, the latest Yosemite installer and the latest El Capitan installer./li liInstall VirtualBox/li liUse the following shell script to create a bootable Yosemite.iso. The script assumes that emInstall OS X Yosemite.app/em was downloaded to the folder /Applications.  precode #!/bin/bash     # Create bootable Yosemite ISO   # Mount the installer image    hdiutil attach /Applications/Install\ OS\ X\ Yosemite.app/Contents/SharedSupport/InstallESD.dmg -noverify -nobrowse -mountpoint /Volumes/install_app   # Convert the boot image to a sparse bundle    hdiutil convert /Volumes/install_app/BaseSystem.dmg -format UDSP -o /tmp/Yosemite   # Increase the sparse bundle capacity to accommodate the packages    hdiutil resize -size 8g /tmp/Yosemite.sparseimage   # Mount the sparse bundle for package addition    hdiutil attach /tmp/Yosemite.sparseimage -noverify -nobrowse -mountpoint /Volumes/install_build   # Remove Package link and replace with actual files    rm /Volumes/install_build/System/Installation/Packages  cp -rp /Volumes/install_app/Packages /Volumes/install_build/System/Installation/   # Copy Base System    cp -rp /Volumes/install_app/BaseSystem.dmg /Volumes/install_build/  cp -rp /Volumes/install_app/BaseSystem.chunklist /Volumes/install_build/   # Unmount the installer image    hdiutil detach /Volumes/install_app   # Unmount the sparse bundle    hdiutil detach /Volumes/install_build   # Resize the partition in the sparse bundle to remove any free space    hdiutil resize -size `hdiutil resize -limits /tmp/Yosemite.sparseimage | tail -n 1 | awk '{ print $1 }'`b /tmp/Yosemite.sparseimage   # Convert the sparse bundle to ISO/CD master    hdiutil convert /tmp/Yosemite.sparseimage -format UDTO -o /tmp/Yosemite   # Remove the sparse bundle    rm /tmp/Yosemite.sparseimage   # Rename the ISO and move it to the desktop    mv /tmp/Yosemite.cdr ~/Desktop/Yosemite.iso /code/pre  Copy the above lines, paste it into a new document emprepare_yosemite_iso.sh/em on your desktop with a decent editor (below I use emnano/em) and make it executable.

Due to lengthy tutorial, I suggest you to read the complete article from here. Feel free to ask me any question if you face problem during installation.  <comment267029> @user3439894, I jus re-wrote my question. <comment267035> After reading the link you included, [OS X on OS X](https://ntk.me/2012/09/07/os-x-on-os-x/), I wouldn't waste one minute trying to use VirtualBox to install OS X El Capitan.  I'd use [VMware Fusion](https://www.vmware.com/products/fusion) instead.  It's not free, but you get what you pay for. <comment267040> Mmm I think that you can't install a legal OS X on a VM. Is why you have the hackintosh. <comment267059> @MrMojoRisin, The Client version of (Mac) OS X has been legally virtualizable since 10.7 and prior to that the Server version since 10.5.    From the current [OS X SLA](http://images.apple.com/legal/sla/docs/OSX1011.pdf). "_(iii) to install, use and run up to two (2) additional copies or instances of the Apple Software within virtual operating system environments on each Mac Computer you own or control that is already running the Apple Software, for purposes of: (a) software development; (b) testing during software development; (c) using OS X Server; or (d) personal, non- commercial use._" <comment267087> @user3439894 ohhh Thanks for your comment :) I'll go to bed a wiser man tonight <comment267124> I decided to use Linux because I was having to many issues with OS X. It's working. <comment267176> FWIW, my reason for switching from VirtualBox to VMware Fusion was strictly due to performance.  VirtualBox is well-supported and seems to work very well, but it's much slower than Fusion in my experience. <comment267182> @EmmEff Hmm El C. boots in 28 seconds to the desktop using VBox. In Parallels 10.9 needs 39s, 10.8 41s etc and 10.10 is even slower. But I'm restricted to 1024x768  in VBox and a lot of features I'm used to aren't available. <comment267236> The question - though not very obvious - targets VirtualBox. We all know that installing newer OS Xs in Parallels or VMware is more convenient than in VirtualBox. <comment267454> Boot time is an irrelevant measure of system performance and I was speaking of VMware Fusion, not Parallels.  If you're happy with VirtualBox, then use it.  I was simply commenting that VirtualBox is not the fastest solution. <comment267458> @EmmEff I'm using Parallels/VMware. But the OP needed a solution for VirtualBox. In my answer I recommended Parallels or VMware.
