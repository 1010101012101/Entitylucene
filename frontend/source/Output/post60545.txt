Keyboard Shortcut for Notification Center not working <body> The keyboard shortcut "Show Notification Center" you can set under emSystem Preferences - Keyboard - Mission Control/em stopped working for me after a restart.   I tried resetting to defaults, changing the short cut and finally exiting all running apps and processes - nothing seems to bring back the short cut.  Does anybody know how to debug this or a plist where I can manually edit this?  <answer60899> Resetting PRAM worked: https://discussions.apple.com/message/19284693?ac_cid=ms123456#19284693  <answer97188> Resetting PRAM does not solve the issue for everyone (including another poster in the above thread, and myself).  I worked around it locally by using the MacOS Automator to create a new Workflow. The workflow had a single "Run Applescript" action in it where the applescript is as follows:  precodeon run {input, parameters}     tell application "System Events"         tell process "Notification Center"             click menu bar item 1 of menu bar 1         end tell     end tell     end run /code/pre  Then I saved the workflow and used BetterTouchTool (http://www.boastr.de/) to bind a "Start Automator Workflow" trigger to a a keyboard shortcut.   <answer153073> Resetting PRAM didn't work for me either. Chris Kline's solution is great, but I don't think the AppleScript is compatible with Mavericks or Yosemite.  This AppleScript works in Yosemite:  precodetell application "System Events"     click menu bar item 1 of menu bar 2 of application process "SystemUIServer" end tell /code/pre  BetterTouchTool, as Chris mentioned, or Alfred (http://www.alfredapp.com/) can be used to assign a hotkey to the script.
