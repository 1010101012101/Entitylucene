Not able to login to google using Internet account Mac OS Sierra <body> I have been trying to configure postfix server using gmail outbound relay for last two days and have been tweaking a few files and few gmail settings. It was fine until now, when I stopped receiving mails on the mail application for the gmail account. I then removed the account and tried adding again. I haven't been able to get past when I enter the credentials and I see a spinning wheel, which disappears in a couple of seconds and it gets stuck. Nothing happens.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Xv2oF.png" alt="enter image description here"
