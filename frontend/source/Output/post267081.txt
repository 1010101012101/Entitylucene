New Apple TV screensavers not downloading <body> I've read about and seen other people have new cities appear in the Aerial Apple TV screensaver. My Apple TV, and with the latest software, doesn't seem to ever show these. Has anyone else had this? I've also experienced a black screen when the screeensaver is meant to otherwise appear.   <answer267733> It sounds like you need to change how often Apple TV downloads new vidoes from Never to Daily, Weekly, or Monthly. Open settings  general  screensaver  download new videos  <comment336010> Thanks, but I've actually always had that setting set to Daily.
