Is it possible to view files stored in iCloud Backup? <body> I have a backup for my iPhone 5s from January. Is there any way I can download them onto my computer ?   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/XIeVv.png" alt="enter image description here"  Is there any way I can look into the files that were backed up onto iCloud?  <answer133145> No and no, I'm afraid,  You could restore the iCloud backup to the device, then back it up to the computer and use a 3rd party tool to dig into that backup file, but you won't be able to get at the iCloud backup contents directly.  <comment236951> I've found a third party solution for now.
