What's the terminal command to see how network shares are connected? <body> I would like to see how certain volume shares are connected to my Mac. I'm on a Windows network and need to know if shares are connected over smb2 or cifs or afp protocol... etc... Do I need to restart my Mac each time to get an accurate reading? (cache)  <answer154041> You could use the mount command from terminal:  precodemount /code/pre  This will give a print out of everything mounted on the system and details about what protocol was used and by who.  Here's in example output:  precode/dev/disk0s2 on / (hfs, local, journaled) devfs on /dev (devfs, local, nobrowse) map -hosts on /net (autofs, nosuid, automounted, nobrowse) map auto_home on /home (autofs, automounted, nobrowse) map -fstab on /Network/Servers (autofs, automounted, nobrowse) /dev/disk1s2 on /Volumes/TM Backup (hfs, local, nodev, nosuid, journaled) //user@theShare:548/Share on /Volumes/Share (afpfs, nodev, nosuid, mounted by user) /code/pre  <answer284080> For a more detailed listing of samba connections including the protocol in use, try:  precodesmbutil statshares -a /code/pre  <comment181319> Simple. Thank you. Would this differentiate from CIFS vs SMB? Or is it all the same to the Mac? <comment181320> CIFS stands for Common Internet File System.  It is the standard file sharing in Windows.  Mac accesses it using the Samba protocol(SMB). <comment181322> Excellent. Thanks!
