MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Early 2015) Dual External Monitor Performance <body> According to the MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Early 2015) Technical Specifications, the Graphics and Video Support for the 2015 Retina MBP 13-inch is:     ul   liIntel Iris Graphics 6100  /li   liDual display and video mirroring: Simultaneously supports full native resolution on the built-in display and up to 3840 by 2160 pixels on up to two external displays, both at millions of colors./li   /ul   There exist answered questions here on the Apple Stack Exchange about emwhat's possible/em in terms of dual external monitors for this MBP. I understand that, as shown by the above quoted text, it is possible to run two 4K monitors with the MBP.  My question is concerned with the actual emperformance/em of using two full 2160p/4K external monitors with (at least) a Mini DisplayPort connection - has anyone had any problems (flickering, or really anything negative) with this setup? Similar to  this question, but for the 2015 MBP.  I guess the performance may vary with the brand of monitor, but I'm just looking for a general idea of how well it does. I'm interested in knowing about how it would function before I make the costly investment.  I know the Intel Iris Graphics 6100 are integrated and use up to 1.5GB RAM of the MBP, but I don't know if that will mean a stable, reliable experience with two 4K monitors. I also know the Retina 15-inch 2015 MacBook Pro uses a discrete graphics card, which may be more suitable, but I'm not interested in the 15-inch screen.  <answer213541> I had this exact same question, and found the answer on Apple's discussion forums:     A final update - I got my hands on two Dell P2715Q's which support 3840x2160@60Hz over SST. I'm happy to report the new 13" RMBP happily drives both displays at their native resolutions with 60Hz refresh in single stream mode (the default).   https://discussions.apple.com/thread/6868583
