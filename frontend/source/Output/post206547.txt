I didn't need to restart my machine.  <comment248966> Did you restart both the computer and the phone already? <comment248967> I did everything. I restarted my laptop and still it did not worked. I am not using phone to test my app right now. I am using simulator. <comment248970> OK, i restarted my machine again and it worked now :). Not sure why it was not working before. Thanks for your advice.
