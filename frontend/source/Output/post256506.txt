OSX Keychain SecretStorage <body> In my keychain I have found some suspicious activity which I am trying to understand better. There have been two application password items stored with the names 'SecretStorage' and the application 'SecretStorage'. In one case the account field is a hashed value, in the second case the account field is the text 'backend-test'.  What is creating these keychain items?  <comment320023> Apps that are very important pretty much.
