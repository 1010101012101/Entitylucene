Windows Mobile emulator for iPhone <body> Does anyone know of any emulator / VM / anything that would allow Windows Mobile 6.5 applications to be run on an iPhone or iPad?  Ideally on the iOS device itself but failing that on a hosted server with the iOS device as a dumb terminal.  <comment58629> Hey, April 1st was 7 weeks ago! There aren't any VMs available for iOS (and Apple probably would refuse them anyway). <comment58687> There aren't any VMs as of yet for iOS even if you're JailBroken.
