partition type ffffffff-ffff-ffff-ffff-ffffffffffff <body> I use a 13" MacBook Pro mid 2014 (Retina). About a year ago I installed Windows 10 via bootcamp.   Everything was OK, but some months ago I decided to install Ubuntu instead of Windows. I successfully did it, strongbut/strong I did not delete Windows partition via bootcamp assistant (did it manually). So when I booted up Windows boot screen i saw Macintosh HD in the left, and Windows in the right. (Selecting Windows actually booted Ubuntu). That was not quite a big problem, so i used it normally.   Then I decided to completely get rid of Ubuntu. So first I tried to delete the Windows partition via Bootcamp Assistant (though it was still recognized in system as Windows). But Bootcamp option to delete Windows and restore disk failed (do not actually remember the error text).   Then I tried to do it via diskutil, there I got Macintosh HD drive partitioned into 150 GB maOS part, and 100 GB Windows (Ubuntu part). I deleted Windows part, so I got just 150 GB macOS part and 100 GB of "Free space". But I couldn't change the size of mac OS part (i wanted it to take full available size (250GB)). The error was something like "CANT READ PARTITION MAP". I googled this solution (https://discussions.apple.com/thread/7268440?start=0&amp;tstart=0) where author succeed with the help of Internet Recovery.  (I actually created a new partition on this 100GB part and called it 'deleteme' to delete completelly via Internet Recovery), I used this command:  precodesudo diskutil eraseVolume JHFS+ deleteme /dev/disk0s3 /code/pre  So I entered Internet Recovery, and then saw this picture in diskutil (the 'deleteme' disk was under Macintosh HD):  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/OyFaV.jpg" alt="Picture 1 on drive"  But! The Macintosh HD (the second one) was called disk0s2 and its color was grey. When I clicked on it, all options were disabled, and the bottom part looked like this:   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jgiZY.png" alt="Picture 2 on drive"  'deleteme' was empty with black colored link. So i deleted it and had actually Macintosh HD - disk0s2. (And disk1 - 'OS X Base System' in the bottom). But i couldnt resize disk0s2 (bottom Macintosh HD on the picture). It was written that 'size of this partition couldn't be changed'. I tried to reboot and got this picture (Ubuntu wtf?):  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mQ0Op.jpg" alt="Picture 3 on drive"  The I rebooted with 'alt' key pressed and got this screen (windows here? i have completelly deleted Windows part?) and no Macintosh HD! So I actually can't boot into Mac OS!  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/x9AkL.jpg" alt="Picture 4 on drive"  Then I rebooted into Internet Recovery again and started researching, so I used following commands:    precodediskutil list /code/pre  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kFvtY.jpg" alt="Picture 5 on drive"  Apple_CoreStorage was FFFFFFFF-FFFF... (disk0s2)  precodediskutil info /dev/disk0s2 /code/pre  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Z1xqR.jpg" alt="Picture 6 on drive"  was FFFFFFFF-FFFF...  precodegpt -r show /dev/disk0 /code/pre  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Lj1Ob.jpg" alt="Picture 7 on drive"  Index 2 was FFFFFFFF-FFFF...  fdisk /dev/disk0  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/iZpAz.jpg" alt="Picture 8 on drive"  This stayed unchanged  I realised that partition of disk0s2 FFFFFFFF-FFFF-FFFF-FFFF-FFFFFFFFFFFF is not OK, so i started googling. Came up to this thread Partition type suddenly FFFFFFFF-FFFF-FFFF-FFFF-FFFFFFFFFFFF, drive unmountable  The solution was to manually set right partition to bad partitioned drive, so i wrote:  precodediskutil umountDisk /dev/disk0 gpt remove -i 2 /dev/disk0 diskutil umountDisk /dev/disk0 gpt add -b 409640 -i 2 -s 294511376 -t 53746F72-6167-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC /dev/disk0 /code/pre  After these commands disk0s2 transformed into Macintosh HD (you can see it on my pictures). But I still can't change its size (and its quite strange picture although):  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/aXLzh.jpg" alt="Picture 9 on drive"  Each time I reboot into Internet Recovery I see Macintosh HD grey link and 'not connected' text in the left bottom corner, then if i click 'open' it asks for my mac user password, and after i enter it, it becomes connected (Mount point: /Volumes/Macintosh HD)  But when I try to boot my Mac again, I still see that Ubuntu GNU screen and in boot manager there is still only Windows out there.  hr  strongLink to google drive (with the original screenshots):/strong https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B84qZPasIWxyNVJPa0pvQ1lTUE0?usp=sharing  <comment353402> Your disk0s2 is not necessarily a corestorage LVG - it can also be a normal HFS+ volume. In my answer to the linked "Partition type suddenly FFFFFFFF-..." question I **knew** that is was an LVG because the OP mentioned it. Please check my other FFFFFFFF type [answers](https://apple.stackexchange.com/search?q=user%3A93229+FFFFFFFF-FFFF-FFFF-FFFF-FFFFFFFFFFFF) how to detect the proper partition type. Did you enable FileVault?
