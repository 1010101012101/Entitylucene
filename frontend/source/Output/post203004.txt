Nice Audio Mixer/Repeater <body> I am looking for a nice volume mixer for OS-X Yosemite+ for per-application audio control, I would also like per application sound output control. I don't mind buying if it's a nice product with long term support.  <answer203009> Soundflower from Cycling74 used to be the app to do this type of task, but is unsupported &amp; no longer reliable - I eventually had to uninstall it.  It was taken over by Rogue Amoeba, who maintain the download but no longer provide updates. It has been open sourced on GitHub, but I've yet to see a stable release; kernel panics are frequent.  It seems quite possible they re-worked the technology into their main product, Audio Hijack. Although primarily marketed as an 'any app' recorder, it actually can achieve some pretty comprehensive routing; comes with a fair number of built-in audio effects &amp; can also use any AU plugin effects too.  This is a quick example, using 2 apps, EQ, volume, optional recorder &amp; a specific audio output.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vcD7J.png" alt="enter image description here"  ...and another with 3 sources to 3 outputs...  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6178w.png" alt="enter image description here"  If you need even more comprehensive routing, there's always Plogue Bidule... if you can ever figure it out ;-)  <comment244829> Can you be a bit more specific on the "nice" part? What does "nice" mean to you? <comment245010> It means functional, supported, non-glitchy <comment245011> Cool! Does audio hijack suffer from frequent instability/kernel panics as well? <comment245019> @FranciscoAguilera I use both frequently for pro audio applications and have never had an issue with either of them. Great tools. <comment245020> @Tetsujin I was going to suggest the same. Also I appreciate how you used screencap images to illustrate. +1 <comment246235> [sorry, was afk a couple of days] I've never had Audio Hijack give me any problems at all - though most of the work I do is over ASIO or Rewire, so I don't use it a great deal. Bidule I only ever tried out a demo for a few days, never really got to grips with it & didn't proceed with it, so can't really comment on that one. @tjt263 - thanks for the comments & upvote :)
