Disable background app refresh for ONLY Messages app <body> iOS 10 has made the Messages app drain my wife's iPhone 6's battery.   It uses up about 40% of her battery and most of that is background time.   How can I turn off background refresh for ONLY Messages?    (Not looking for a solution that turns off all background refreshes.)  <answer264638> It sounds like you're trying to address the symptom, rather than the problem. To be clear, Messages should not be using up that much battery power. I suggest the following:  ul liRestart your wife's iPhone by holding down the Power and Home buttons simultaneously for about 10 seconds until you see the Apple logo/li liWait for her iPhone battery stats to refresh. /li /ul  strongNOTE:/strong This may take up to a day - typically it will need to be plugged back into a charger and fully charged and then removed and used normally for a few hours up to a day before the battery stats will refresh.   Once you've done this, let us know if your wife is still having this problem.  <comment331706> As a sidenote, does anyone know if iOS 10.2 will fix this problem. <comment331708> iOS 10.2 _may_ fix this problem by virtue of the fact it will force a restart of her device (as suggested in my answer). The only changes to Messages in iOS 10.2 are: (1) A new love and celebration full screen effect in Messages, and (2) It fixes an issue that sometimes prevented the keyboard from displaying in Messages. <comment331806> We had already tried a normal reboot (hold down power). I will try with a hard reboot (hold down power and home). <comment331846> @Vaccano Sorry, that's what I meant - a hard reboot. I've amended my answer to make this clearer.
