Broke Boot Camp while trying to get a triple boot <body> I'm running Yosemite, up-to-date on a mid-2012 MacBook Pro. I removed the optical drive, moved my internal HDD to its location and placed a new SSD in the original HDD's location. This has been great for a few months now. I've had a working Boot Camp setup that also was working fantastic.  Note that I removed my optical drive. I now have an external DVD drive I've been using for this.  Here's what I did:  ol liInstalled ReFind. (Everything still OK)/li liDisabled CoreStorage. (Everything still OK)/li liResized OS X partition down by 60 gigs, to leave room for Linux. (Everything still OK)/li liBooted into live CD, and began installing Linux into that new, free space... It asked where to install the boot loader (GRUB) and I think this is where I screwed up - I let it just place it on the disk, instead of the Linux partition./li /ol  I tried the normal "Startup Repair" from the Windows 8 disk I have, which didn't help at all.  I tried everything at this location https://neosmart.net/wiki/recovering-windows-bootloader/ but it didn't help. Attempts 1 and 2 went through "OK", but didn't work. Attempt 3 actually gave errors at this line: codebcdedit.exe /import c:\boot\bcd.temp/code. Not sure why.  ReFind still works great, OS X still works great, but I can't get into Windows and Linux ... well, it's installed, but GRUB doesn't exist.  Top priority for me is fixing Windows, I can get Linux going later. Any help?  <comment206398> And my partition table looks a little nutty in Disk Utility. See here: http://imgur.com/F1Dog35 The 60gb between OS X and Windows seems to be "claimed" by OS X, and now I have two small partitions after Boot Camp. Both of those showed up as "EFI" in DISKPART, but now they just seem .. normal. And broken. <comment212369> I assume by now you have fixed this problem. If not please respond. <comment212558> @DavidAnderson I wiped everything (but Mac) and just re-installed Windows. Ended up foregoing linux entirely. So, no. <comment212575> The reason I asked is because I just installed a triple boot of OS X 10.10.2, Windows 7 and Fedora 21 Workstation Linux.  All 3 are the 64 bit versions. The machine was a 2011 iMac with a 1/2 TB harddisk. I also successfully installed rEFInd on its own partition. It appears you tried to install linux between OS X and Windows. If this is true and your Windows was using a BIOS boot, then you were doomed to failure. Anyway, what type/version of linux were you trying to install? Is windows using a BIOS boot? How to you plan to use both internal disks? I may post an answer if I think it could help.
