Is there a forward delete on the iPad? <body> Using the screen keyboard on iPad, is their a way to delete the character after the cursor?  That is, behavior like the Windows delete key?    I am aware that the convention is to use Fn+delete on Macs.  If there is no such convention on iPad, it might be nice to use shift+delete.  <answer35836> Sorry, but no.  This only works on the iPad if you are using an external Bluetooth keyboard.    <answer63871> The app Textkraft has a forward-delete key.  <comment40813> On Mac, one can also use control + D for this purpose. <comment40877> @Mahnax Ooo...very cool little shortcut! I need to remember that one! <comment40888> @daviesgeek Yeah, I actually discovered it by accident once. <comment73926> You should provide a link to the app, at least, and mention what sort of app it is.
