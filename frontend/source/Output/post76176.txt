How to set caps lock to work like shift on OSX (work only when down)? <body> How do I set Caps Lock to behave like shift, working only when down, without memory?  <answer76188> PCKeyboardHack allows changing caps lock to shift:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/OCK4U.png" alt=""  Yould could also change it to a key like F13 and then use KeyRemap4MacBook to change F13 by adding this to private.xml:  code&lt;autogen&gt;--KeyToKey-- KeyCode::F13, Option::KEYTOKEY_BEFORE_KEYDOWN, KeyCode::CAPSLOCK, Option::KEYTOKEY_AFTER_KEYUP, KeyCode::CAPSLOCK&lt;/autogen&gt;/code  There's also a setting for disabling the LED:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/b2VkH.png" alt=""  <comment88381> I don't have access to my mac right now, can you try [BetterTouchTool](http://www.boastr.de/) ? Free software that I have been using over 2 years. I can let you know when I can check it. <comment89180> @Lauri_Ranta this is great, except PCKeyboardHack is making COMMAND+SPACE not to work (it should activate QuickSilvar). Any idea why? <comment89183> Lauri this was an unexpectedly rare and good answer, too glad im asked. Thanks. edit: im having trouble in accepting it for some reason
