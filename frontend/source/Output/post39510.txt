How to group images in iWork Pages? <body> How to group multiple images in iWork Pages so I don't have to move images one by one? That can be done in Microsoft Words, but I can't find this option in iWork Pages.  <answer39514> Cmd-Click to select the images you want to group and then opt-cmd-G to group them (find the group function under the ARRANGE menu), then the images will move as one unit. To ungroup the images shift-opt-cmd-G.  <comment44674> Good first answer, and welcome, by the way :) <comment44675> wow. awesome. thanks
