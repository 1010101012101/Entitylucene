Applescript dialog loses focus when I click another window, but doesn't get focus back when I click the dialog window <body> I have a short applescript I run on a schedule to pop up a dialog and ask me to log an entry. The script then submits the data to a shell/curl script. I must note that I barely know how to use Applescript and I've cobbled this together from web searches.  The important part, that I'm having trouble with, is the behavior of the dialog.  If I submit an answer as the dialog pops up, it works fine.  However, if I switch to another window, I am simply unable to return focus to the dialog to be able to enter text.  I emcan/em however emclose/em the dialog with the "OK" or "Cancel" buttons.  Script contents  precode#!/usr/bin/osascript tell application "SystemUIServer"     activate     display dialog "What have you been working on?" default answer ""      set WhatIDid to the text returned of the result     tell me to activate     do shell script "/Users/jeff/bin/what-i-did-today-curl-submission.sh "&amp; quoted form of WhatIDid end tell /code/pre  Screenshots  ul liInitial launch of dialog/li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/TJ2Y4.png" alt="enter image description here"  ul liAfter it loses focus/li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8mdl7.png" alt="enter image description here"  Finally, I've noticed this emtype/em of behavior before, on Mac, but this is the first situation where I can reproduce it 100%. I'm not sure if this is an Applescript thing or just weirdness with Mac dialog boxes.  <comment301232> Does the workaround of... click on any app, click on the Finder, click on the script in the Dock work? I find they appear to be at the Finder-level, but somehow aren't (that's about as technical as I can get, sorry;-) BTW, are you running the script as an app? <comment301304> @Tetsujin no this doesn't work; the dialog does not appear to be associated with the Finder or with any app in the dock
