How can I encrypt my VirtualBox VM? <body> Is there a way for me to use a virtual machine (VirtualBox) on my MacBook Air with encryption protection? I want to install a VM of Ubuntu, and if my employer calls back the hardware I don't want them to be able to access what's on there…  <answer105922> Yes. You can put the VM in an encrypted sparse bundle. This way, the virtual machine can only be run if the image is mounted, and that requires a password.  ol liOpen Disk Utility (found in code/Applications/Utilities//code)./li liSelect strongFile/strong → strongNew/strong → strongDisk Image from Folder…/strong or press kbd⌘ cmd/kbd+kbd⇧ shift/kbd+kbdN/kbd./li liSelect the folder that contains your virtual machine and press strongImage/strong./li liChoose strongsparsebundle/strong as the Image Format, and choose the level of encryption you require.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9M8GK.png" width="400"/li liChoose a password to encrypt the image. Make sure to uncheck the strongRemember password in my Keychain/strong box if you believe that they could access your Keychain./li liClick OK. Disk Utility will create a sparse bundle to hold the VM.  The sparse bundle should auto-mount (and request for your password if you didn't store it in your Keychain) when you try to perform any action that would require access to your VM./li /ol  <answer150918> While grgarside's procedure is spot on, you may not see strongsparsebundle/strong as an available strongImage Format/strong, as can be seen in here...  (as i recently experienced)    img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WHEZn.png" alt="enter image description here"  In this case, it is likely that you will need to enable Disk Utility's advanced image options via the following terminal command.  precodedefaults write com.apple.DiskUtility advanced-image-options 1 /code/pre  Upon retrying grgarside's procedure, you will see more format options be made available, including the desired strongsparsebundle/strong.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/UMvNE.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer204282> VirtualBox 5 now has the ability to encrypt VMs directly, so maybe the sparsebundle approach is moot in the narrow case, but still very reasonable in the widest cases.
