My Keynote version is still 6.5.3 even though mac app store says I installed 6.6.1 <body> I have a macbook white late 2009, recently upgraded to 8 GB RAM and running on yosemite 10.10.5. I updated Keynote and Pages to the newer versions. Mac app store says I was able to update to Keynote 6.6.1 and Pages 5.6.1. I restarted my laptop after the update. However, Keynote and Pages still insist that a newer version of the app is available. In effect, the new versions were not installed , but mac app store insists that they were installed. How can I solve this? thanks   <comment262533> I can confirm this problem.
