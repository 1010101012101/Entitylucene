Which are the OS X Dashboard Widgets you can't live without? <body> I don't use widgets that much, but one particular widget makes the dashboard useful to me. That's iStat     iStat Pro is a highly configurable   widget that lets you monitor every   aspect of your Mac, including CPU,   memory, disks, network, battery,   temperatures, fans, load &amp; uptime and   processes. iStat Pro can do it all.

As a front-end web developer, it's become THE single fastest way for me to quickly populate a page with dummy text for testing layouts.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HuWZO.png" alt="Loremify!"  <answer497> I like BBC weather widget.  <answer788> h2WeekNumber/h2  The calendar widget doesn't show the current week number.

It helps me keep up with my todo list!  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/r372O.png" alt="Moo"  <answer4524> I used to use the NowPlaying widget all the time for seeing what shows were on my TiVo and downloading them to my Mac  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/w3Oyy.png" alt="screenshot"  I eventually set up a Linux virtual machine to run pytivo and Galleon, and that now automatically downloads from my TiVo for me and allows me to pull the media back if and when I want... so I don't use this widget much anymore.  <answer8462> h2Tea Timer/h2  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xw8dl.png" alt="Tea Timer widget"  It's simply a timer. Notifies with:  ul liSounds/li liSpeech/li liGrowl/li /ul  Text completely customizable (codefood/code pictured). codeready in/code can be changed to just codein/code.  <answer8463> h2iStat Nano/h2  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/tOpRt.png" alt="iStat Nano"br img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bl7cH.png" alt="iStat Nano hover"  When iStat Pro feels just a bit overkill. When hovered over, you can change to a more detailed view.  <answer8467> h2Oblique Strategies/h2  One of my favourite creativity-unleashing activities from one of my favourite artists, Brian Eno, Oblique Strategies makes a great widget. I use this all the time to kickstart the creative process. Sadly, it looks like CurvedSpace Software has folded and the original version is no longer available. You still seem to be able to get it from ZDNet and CNet though.  <answer38332> Radar in Motion  Free  Install it a few times and change map coverage to suit you. I live in Connecticut and find these two maps useful for coming weather. I've been using it for years and while its connections to weather service info sometimes drop out, it's been extremely useful for me.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/XI5pl.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer38353> Delivery Status is a must-have if you routinely track packages:  img src="https://junecloud.com/images/entries/20111113_6613.png" alt="Delivery Status widget"  I also use their iOS app and it all works spectacularly well, smart enough to change the delivery source based on what's your Clipboard.  <answer38354> I've also found myself using NetworkStat:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KF17k.jpg" alt="Screenshot"  Seems a little stale, but works well for showing your current LAN/WAN IPs.  Sure, the excellent iStat widgets can show this info, but this is a little cleaner and easier to read quickly.  <answer57614> UNIX Permissions Calculator is a dashboard widget that translates UNIX file permissions between symbolic and octal formats. I find this very useful.  <answer57616> If you like to use Stickies, you should try StickiesPlus. It allows you to create a new sticky simply by OPT+clicking the widget.  Based on the Apple widget, free of course: http://www.gatada.com/downloads/StickiesPlus.wdgt.zip  <answer116101> The MAMP Control widget comes in very handy for me to start and stop Apache and MySQL:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uJpqk.png" alt="MAMP Control Widget"  <answer117373> I love using Twidget.

Faster, easier to use, and can use the keyboard shortcuts for fast recording purposes. :) <comment650> Sadly this shortcut doesn't work in Chrome :-( <comment4277> I prefer the widget simply because it looks good and doesn't clog your screen <comment4358> Or there's always http://www.lipsum.com/ if you don't want to install a widget for this :) <comment4359> That's because it only works in Cocoa apps <comment39599> A shortcut for Dictionary is to double tap with three fingers on your trackpad, while the cursor is over a word. <comment43373> In Snow Leopard, Ctrl+Cmd+D work in Google Chrome after highlighting a word. @neoneye 's comment is over a year old so maybe they since fixed this. <comment43568> Yes. Now it works in Chrome. <comment50169> I use this all the time, on both phone and Dashboard. I love it. I'm always tracking a couple of packages, and this is one of my most used apps. <comment79643> What does this do? The name seems descriptive, but it's better to not have to follow the link. <comment113858> The link to iStat Pro page does not work anymore. The widget seems to be discontinued. <comment207817> The link is dead now :(
