Can the default contact store for Mountain Lion be iCloud? <body> I'm struggling to manage duplicate contacts and would like to entirely and permanently disable the "On My Mac" category for contacts.  I never, ever want a contact to be added to a Mac and not be stored in iCloud.  Have I missed a setup step since I'm ending up missing contacts on my iOS devices when my Mac decides to store things locally instead of globally.  <answer83476> You missed a step when setting up iCloud.  On each Mac, you can set the default account to be iCloud in the general preferences.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mfAVj.png" alt="Contacts general preferences"  Now, you'll need a short clean up to migrate all your incorrectly filed contacts.   ul liSelect Accounts and temporarily disable each iCloud / Exchange / online account./li liThen export all the "On My Mac" contacts to a vCard file and delete them em(you have a backup of your Mac and if paranoid, a full export of all contacts before you delete things, no?)/em/li liOnce things are clean, enable the default account, check that it's set like above, and drag the contacts onto the "All bike@whatever" /li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4MXx3.png" alt="enter image description here"  ul liImport all the contacts, even if there are duplicates as you can then have Contacts look for duplicates and merge / update existing contacts as needed./li liOnce you've deleted all contacts from strongOn My Mac/strong and deselected it as the default, Contacts should hide that group from view and simplify your contacts going forward./li liAt this point, optionally enable other cloud contact sources and re-verify the default account./li /ul
