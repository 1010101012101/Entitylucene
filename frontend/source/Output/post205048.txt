Apple Watch pairing prompts for old Apple ID password <body> When I paired my Apple Watch with my iPhone it asked for me to login to my Apple ID.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5S5VQl.png" alt="first Apple ID login prompt"  Later while configuring Messages on the watch it asks for my password again.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/t2kDel.png" alt="second Apple ID login prompt for old Apple ID"  However, the strongemApple ID in each is different/em/strong, none of my current or previous Apple ID passwords succeeds at this prompt, and I am forced to hit Cancel to proceed.  Several months ago I changed my Apple ID from codecory@coryklein.com/code to codecoryfklein@gmail.com/code and I assume Apple has retained the older ID somewhere in association with Messages.  Messages on my MacBook is using the correct ID.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rY9ls.png" alt="messages app configuration on computer"  My iPhone is using the correct ID as well.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mjm7wl.png" alt="apple id on iPhone"  Unfortunately, this appears to be causing the Messages app on the Watch not to sync with my phone. I can't send or receive messages on my Watch.  Has anybody else encountered this and succeeded in resolving it?  I don't have Two-Factor authentication enabled on my Apple ID, but I have started the process and am waiting the mandatory 3-day period for it to activate.  <answer205775> Login with your Apple ID at Settings  Messages  Send &amp; Receive  Apple ID
