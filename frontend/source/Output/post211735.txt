Shortcut - El Capitan Dialog Box switch between option <body> How do we switch between options in confirm dialog boxes on El Capitan. Older OSXs was switching by using spacebar. Not working anymore.   <answer211739> Go to strongSystem Preferences/strong then select strongKeyboard/strong.  In the strongShortcuts/strong tab you will find an option for "Full Keyboard Access". Set the radio button for strongAll Controls/strong.  When confronted with a dialog box with buttons, kbdTab/kbd will now work to change focus between the buttons.  This setting can be turned off by key combination of kbdâŒƒ control/kbd+kbdF7/kbd (hold down the kbdfn/kbd function key too if needed.)  hr  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1PLxe.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment255757> I must accidently closed it. Thanks.
