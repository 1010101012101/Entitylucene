Imac doesn' t recognize certain colors <body> Am seeing this on a lot of website, and even different browsers on my iMac(Mac OS X 10.6.8)  colors such as code#EEEEEE/code, and code#CCCCCC/code, are not displayed at all.  screenshot:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9x0wc.png" alt="issue"  ^ Thats how it looks on my system. Am very curious about this.  I just logged in on to my Ubuntu machine, and i now notice that the screenshot, displays the codebackground-color:#EEEEE;/code correctly?   But on my Mac machine on the screenshot and when I add the backtick on some text, the background color is still white?!   Why Does my iMac not recognize certain colors?  <comment143136> Have you tried recalibrating your display? (System Preferences - Displays) <comment143137> @Dan I don't use Imac often as it is my parents. But, i have started the recalibrating, and now its asking me to choose between `D50`, `D65`, `9300`, and my own wit center? <comment143139> It's been a while since I used it but that sounds like the colour temperature, which affects what "white" looks like. Higher temperatures are more blue, lower temperature are more yellow. You'll need to go through the whole wizard. If you don't like the results you can run it again or select the default profile to revert everything. <comment143140> @Dan, i did a bit of playing around, but no luck. Will try it latter, again. <comment143150> This is either a calibration issue, or a panel fault. Re-calibrating the screen with other colour temperatures might work, but i'd look closer at the gamma value. <comment143822> The screenshot looks fine to me, since the pixels are recorded in the file, not how it was rendered on screen. You need to take a photo to demonstrate your issue.
