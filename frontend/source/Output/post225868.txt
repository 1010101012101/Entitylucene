Apple Mail: Only TLS v1.0 supported <body> I'm on OS X 10.11.3  I can't connect to mail servers running only TLS version 1.2 or 1.1 with Apple Mail.  IMAP as well as SMTP connections are always established using TLS 1.0  Could that be correct?  If so, why doesn't Apple Mail support TLS 1.2 yet?  <comment309867> Because Apple system is outdated. Them along with Microsoft Exchange lower than 2013 don't support TLSv1.2. <comment309868> I just did a wireshark on a connection on macOS Sierra and it negotiated TLSv1.2. <comment309891> @AlanShutko that sounds promising, thanks for the information!
