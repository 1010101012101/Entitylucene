How can I make Growl Tunes start automatically? <body> How can I make GrowlTunes start automatically when either Growl or OSX does?  <answer7699> Go to Preferences - Accounts - Select your account - Select the "Login Items" button or tab (not sure what I would call it!) - Then press the + sign to add a new start up item and select GrowlTunes.  <answer7705> Another, possibly quicker way, is to drag it into your dock (if not already there), then right-click it, go to OptionsOpen at Login. Then drag it out of your dock if you don't want it to stay in your dock.  <comment8336> Drag and drop is also supported in this area if you like. Just drag from Finder into System Preference's "Login Items" once you're there. <comment8343> Clever little trick +1
