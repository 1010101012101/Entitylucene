A single shortcut that changes text color in Notes? <body> When using strongNotes/strong I often find myself changing the color of the text (usually to blue or red) as an additional way to indicate emphasis (alongside emitalics/em and strongbold/strong).    The shortcut for displaying the available colors is strongCommand-Shift-C/strong but that still requires the user to use the mouse to click on a particular color.    Does anyone know how I can add a single shortcut that will switch to a given color and then, when pressed again, switch back to black? (So it, in effect, works the same way the emitalics/em and strongbold/strong shortcuts work).  I don't need to make a shortcut for emevery/em color--one for blue would do just fine. Any ideas?  <answer128411> This isn't strongexactly/strong what you were asking for, but perhaps it is close enough.  Just below the menu place where you bring up the color picker (Format-Font-Show Colors) are two other menu items: Copy Style and Paste Style. This is what worked for me:  ol liSelect some text in your note/li liManually set the color, like you do now (via Show Colors)/li liSet the cursor anywhere inside the colored text (don't select any text, just put the cursor there)/li liChoose Format-Font-Copy Style/li liFrom now on (including across relaunches of the Notes app) you can select the text you want to color and simply use the keyboard shortcut for Paste Style!/li /ol  Hope this works well enough for you.  <answer128680> In TextEdit you can do something like:  precodetell application "System Events" to tell window 1 of process "TextEdit"     set {x, y} to value of attribute "AXSelectedTextRange" of text area 1 of scroll area 1 end tell tell application "TextEdit"     set color of characters x thru y of document 1 to {65535, 0, 0} end tell /code/pre  I couldn't figure any way to do that in Notes though.  <answer250430> You are right -- there's no shortcut (yet) to change the color in Notes (source:https://support.apple.com/en-au/HT201236).  The closest shortcut would be command + T which opens the Font window where you can change font color.
