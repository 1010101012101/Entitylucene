Motu 828 firewire with Maverick <body> I've upgraded to 10.9 and now my motu 828 firewire is not being recognized. What can I do to not loose my interface?  <comment204833> Can you add some details about the specific product and things you have tried already? According to [motu.com](http://www.motu.com/download/download_matching_downloads.html?product_id=21) there should be drivers for 10.9 (Mavericks). <comment204838> tried http://www.motu.com/download ? <comment204888> I have an 828 mk2 which worked perfectly in mavericks and now works perfectly in yosemite - as the above posters suggest, go to motu.com and download the latest drivers
