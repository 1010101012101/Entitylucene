Cannot remove DevonThink Pro from menu bar <body> I installed DEVONthink Pro, then uninstalled by removing the App from the Applications dir, but I can not get rid of the icon/menu in the menu bar.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8IzbG.png" alt="enter image description here"  I've removed every file anywhere that has the name 'devon', but the think just will not go.  <answer89158> The menu you are seeing is actually the AppleScript system menu. It gives you a handy way to launch applications when you're in an app.  To turn it off:  ol liSelect the option in the menu Open AppleScript Editor.app/li liOpen the Preferences menu/li liUnselect the Show Script Menu img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/aCyrV.png" alt="enter image description here"/li /ol  <comment104633> Oh wow you're a legend, many thanks.
