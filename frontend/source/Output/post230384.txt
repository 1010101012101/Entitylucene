Log in window (El Capitan) <body> How can I update changes to the Login window (Mac OS X 10.11.3). When I change settings in the Preferences and then restart computer, there is absolutely no difference.  Is there a XML file with these settings or cache?  <answer230406> Try running this command in /Applications/Utilities/Terminal:  precodechmod -RN ~/Library/preferences /code/pre  and then restart.  <comment281180> What do you mean by "update changes"? <comment281189> :-D well i want to see those changes (refresh the login window)... there is no progress <comment281192> What kind of changes did you apply to the login window? <comment281193> Display login window as: Name and password... for example
