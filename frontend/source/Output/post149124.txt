How to get the amount of selected files in automator <body> I created a workflow to move items from one folder to another and I want to get a notification when it's done. I could create the workflow without problems but now I would like to show the number of moved files on the notification pop-up.  How can I get the number of files?  Basically I'm copying downloaded files to a "Downloads" folder on iCloud Drive. After the files are copied, I would like to show a notification saying "{NumberOfFiles} moved successfully."  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FxB9U.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer149143> You can use the following Apple Script to set a variable (named codeitem_count/code) to the number of items returned from the previous action:  precodeon run {input, parameters}     set (value of variable "item_count" of front workflow) to (count of input)     return input end run /code/pre  The list of items is simply passed through.  You could use it like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZYr3B.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment175677> Can you add a screenshot of your workflow? <comment175699> Are you thinking of something like Apple Script (as action in Automator) that counts the files and displays the result in Notification ? <comment175714> That could be, but I don't know how to create the script. <comment175729> This nice, but missing the part how to show the result in the notification pop-up <comment175774> @Buscarì›ƒ: uhm. how do you mean? <comment176818> Thanks! I guess that I just need to add the item_count variable to the displayed text on notification pop-up and it's done. I will try and let you know. Thanks again man.
