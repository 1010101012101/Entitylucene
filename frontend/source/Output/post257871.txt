Option-Up/Down Arrow has undesired functionality in Messages OS X app <body> In every other Mac OS X application with text input (especially document editing apps like Pages), pressing the kbdOption/kbd+kbd↑/kbd or kbdOption/kbd+kbd↓/kbd keys have the effect of jumping to the beginning of the current/previous paragraph or jumping to the end of the current/next paragraph, respectively. In the Messages app for Mac OS X, however, it has the effect of filling the text input box with the last message you sent in that conversation.  Maybe this used to be a useful feature in the original iChat app back in the day when IM was popular, but I find it annoying and I can't find a way to disable it. I use the kbdOption/kbd+kbd↑/kbd shorcut all the time in every other Mac app to jump to the beginning of a paragraph and add a sentence, for example, but I can't do that in Messages. Any thoughts on how to make kbdOption/kbd+kbd↑/kbd and kbdOption/kbd+kbd↓/kbd not have this special behavior in the Messages app?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6Jnm4.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment322216> Part of it, I would imagine, is that Messages doesn't really have the concept of paragraphs. Pressing Return will send your message. (Yes, Alt-Return enters a new line, but I imagine most users don't know about that.) In that context, Command-↑ and Command-↓ effectively jump to the beginning and end of the "paragraph" since, again, for most users there will likely only be one. Even given that, I'm not entirely sure why Alt-↑ lets you scroll through your sent history.
