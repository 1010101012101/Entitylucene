Why do I see this port as a leave? How to know if I really can get rid of it? <body> Once I've installed an svn, I need it.  precode$ port echo requested ... subversion                     @1.8.1_3 /code/pre  As I understand, this port is important for subversion:  precode$ port echo depof:subversion ... curl-ca-bundle /code/pre  Then I take a look on what is important for it:  precode$ port echo depof:curl-ca-bundle   perl5 /code/pre  So as a conclusion, svn needs perl5, right?br But:  precode$ port echo leaves ... perl5                          @5.12.4_0+perl5_12 /code/pre  How is that possible? Doesn't codeleaves: installed ports that are unrequested and have no dependents./code mean I don't need perl5? So I need it for svn to work or not?  <answer106939> Perl is a build dependency for codecurl-ca-bundle/code. Build dependencies are only needed at build time and can be removed afterwards, which makes codeperl5/code a leaf in your case.  <comment122600> Probably because you're running Mac OS X 10.8 which has Perl 5 installed by default. <comment122747> Hmmm... I'm on 10.8.4 <comment122771> Type `which perl` at the command line to confirm. <comment122917> Already uninstalled all leaves. `/usr/bin/perl` <comment125486> @PaulR macports uses its own perl and not Apple's so that it know exactly which version it is using
