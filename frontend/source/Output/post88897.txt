How do you make the fn keyboard button work like a Ctrl button? <body> I'm used to having the kbdControl/kbd button at the bottom left corner of the keyboard. It's a little annoying to be pressing kbdFn/kbd + kbdTab/kbd when I wanted a kbdControl/kbd + kbdTab/kbd and the position of the kbdControl/kbd button in the new Mac keyboard layout is just very uncomfortable for any finger to reach.  Does anybody know how you can make the kbdControl/kbd and kbdFn/kbd buttons change function like how you can change the modifier keys in System Preferences?  <answer88905> you can use KeyRemap4MacBook  http://pqrs.org/macosx/keyremap4macbook/  you can find the included prepared settings list at this address:  http://pqrs.org/macosx/keyremap4macbook/list.html.en  as you can see there is the setting for kbdFn/kbd Key  <answer88933> You could also add this to private.xml:  precode&lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::FN, KeyCode::CONTROL_L&lt;/autogen&gt; &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::CONTROL_L, KeyCode::FN&lt;/autogen&gt; /code/pre  See the source for the key code values and predefined settings.  <comment104250> Thank you! Worked like a charm. And it has many other useful settings, too! <comment349934> Does anyone know why on earth has Apple decided to do this?
