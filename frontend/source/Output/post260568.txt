PowerPoint 2016 slow slide transition <body> I have a MacBook pro 13" from summer 2016, with the following specs:  - 2,7 GHz Intel i5  - 16  GB RAM  - SSD drive  The machine is nice and snappy, but when using MS PowerPoint, the transition time between slides in presentation mode is horribly slow (several seconds). The same presentation is fine in design mode, and on my Windows machines it works flawlessly. Any ideas as to what the problem might be?  I have already tried the solution suggested here (to set the transition between slides to "Cut" instead of "None"), to no avail.
