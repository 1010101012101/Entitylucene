how long time to get approve for Apple Developer Program enrollment? <body> I have registered my program with individual type from India and it's already 6 days delay but still now i haven't got any email yet. So how long it will take for the activation.      <answer120410> It usually takes 5 to 7 days for Apple Developer Program enrolment to take place. This may take longer if they have a query, but they will contact you if so.  <comment140435> Thanks grgarside for your reply so that i have to wait for minimum 7 days and then my account will be activated. <comment172053> @AnshumanPattnaik how long did it eventually take? <comment322082> What did you use for phone number? It expects a US phone number. Right? @Anshuman Pattnaik
