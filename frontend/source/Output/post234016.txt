change firefox proxy from terminal <body> How can I change proxy for Firefox from Terminal app? Not the whole computer proxy settings (the ones in Network tab), but just Firefox's.  <comment286043> Have a look at: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/843340/firefox-proxy-settings-via-command-line <comment286050> I already did. Spotlight found no prefs.js, therefore I concluded that OSX modifies some other file. <comment286052> It's in `$HOME/Library/Application Support/Firefox/Profiles/*.default/prefs.js` and if I change the proxy setting from Firefox  Preferences...  Advanced  Network  Connection  Settings..., the `prefs.js` file gets updated with the changes!  Use the command line form of Spotlight, in a Terminal use: `mdfind -name prefs.js`
