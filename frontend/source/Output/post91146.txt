Good documentation about securityd,SecurityAgent and loginwindow <body> I am looking for good documentation about securityd,SecurityAgent and loginwindow. I am particularly interested in as to how these processes work in unison during Mac OS X login and authenticate the user for both local and network login. Google search does not seem to produce good results. Any links regarding this would be most helpful.  h2Thanks in advance./h2  Ramkumar  <comment107054> Do you have access to developer.apple.com? If not, register as a OS X developer (it's free) and have a look around.
