How to remove undeletable login item <body> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lLo1W.png" alt="enter image description here"  I have a login item that I can't delete! It's a random Garageband audio file that I never put there myself. It opens in Quicktime every time I boot my Mac. Does anyone know how to get rid of it?  <answer189846> Since it is set for all users it should be in the  precode/System/Library/StartupItems /code/pre  or in the code/System/Library/LaunchDaemons/code   Correction thanks to @maximus that would be in the code/Library/LaunchAgents/code  Copy one of the above and paste it in the Finders "Go to Folder"  Alternatively hover the mouse pointer over it (while it is highlighted) and there should be a pop up with the location of that file.  <answer189853> The file code/Users/your_username/Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginitems.plist/code should contain the link to this file. Using strongGet Info/strong, check to see that your user account has Read &amp; Write Privilege.  I noticed that the minus sign used for deleting items from this list is greyed out. Can you remove other items from this list?  <comment225260> I think you mean /Library/LaunchAgents, <comment225262> Spotlighting in both those folders for "Steinway" returns no results. If I right click on the login item and choose "Show in Finder", it takes me to the file's original location in Application Support/Garageband/. <comment226885> For the future - all I needed to do was click the padlock button under the login items list, then after entering my password I could delete the login item. Doh. <comment226904> one keeps learning... hopefully :)
