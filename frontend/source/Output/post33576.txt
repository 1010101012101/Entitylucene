Dual boot Linux and Lion on FileVault 2 disk <body> I have Mac OS X Lion installed on FileVault partition. On the same disk I've installed GNU/Linux. When I boot my MacBook I can only boot Lion.  strongHow to boot Linux?/strong  In case you need here is more details about my setup.

Then choose codeMacintosh HD/code or codeWindows/code (=Linux in your case)/li /ol  <answer55152> According to a blog post, I got refit to work with my filevault 2 encrypted macbook:     ol   liDownload rEFIt ( version 0.14 at this time ) on the official rEFIt website/li   liOpen the .dmg file, but don’t run the bundled installer/li   liIn the following steps, we’re going to mount the hidden EFI partition, copy and activate rEFIt:/li   /ol   precode    $ sudo mkdir -p /efi     $ sudo mount -t msdos /dev/disk0s1 /efi     $ cp -r /Volumes/rEFIt/efi/* /efi/EFI     $ sudo bless --mount /efi --setBoot --file /efi/efi/refit/refit.efi --labelfile /efi/efi/refit/refit.vollabel /code/pre     Note that the /efi/EFI folder already contains the Apple bootloader. If I where you, I wouldn’t remove it :-p      Note that rEFIt takes 25 second to show up.   That should allow you to select your linux boot partition  <answer108208> Installing rEFInd and following the included instructions does work for me using OS X 10.8 with FileVault2 and Debian GNU/Linux using grub-efi.  In short: Use a protective MBR and install rEFInd to the efi system partition (esp) (use rEFInd's install.sh --esp). Rename the refind folder on the esp to BOOT and rename the efi file aswell to allow faster loading of rEFInd.  In Debian mount the esp, create a subdirectory debian in /efi/EFI, load the efivars kernel module and install grub-efi.  Make sure you read also the general instruction on that page regarding installation.  <comment38403> Doesn't work. Did you try it on disk with FileVault 2? <comment92216> Did you enable FileVault2 after the dual boot already worked or before? <comment92254> @gentmatt I really don't remember now. But I usually do encryption as the first thing on new laptop. Now I have retina and I was able to install Windows using Apple Bootcamp on encrypted SSD if you are asking about that. <comment92323> Same for me. Having enabled FileVault2 already, installing Windows was no problem. However, the Ubuntu 12.04 live-image was not able to install and aborted with an error. (I partitioned with Bootcamp.) Therefore an **disabled** FileVault2 and installed Ubuntu. Then I wanted to **reenable** FileVault2 again, but it failed and demanded that I reformat the whole hard drive. So, I'm going to used Ubuntu in a VM only for now. <comment92374> @gentmatt I ended with similar setup. I have only OS X installed natively and for GNU/Linux and Windows I use Parallels. (for development Vagrant) <comment129682> works on mavericks, but refind may need to be reinstalled to the esp after turning on filevault (as in my case) <comment129690> Also check: http://www.rodsbooks.com/refind/installing.html#wde
