250G Disk space has filled up, but DiskInventory only adds up to 60Gs? <body> I cannot for the life of me figure out how my SD drive is filled up because I don't have any large files, especially enough to fill 250G.  I used DiskInventoryX to do a map of my drive and got this, a massive grey box full of "other" files, but they don't add up to 250G.  I ran Avast to see if there were any obvious trojans or malware of some sort: nothing.  What else could I do to figure out where this block is going wrong?  I have another user on the system, but its very similar... Definitely not enough to fill even 30G.

Most likely it is your local TimeMachine backup data.  OS X will keep TimeMachine backups local to your system so that you can do faster restores or if your main TimeMachine system is not available.  From the Apple Menu, select System Info and then click the Storage tab.  You will see how much space "Backups" are using on your disk.  This space will be automatically cleared as you need more disk space.  It is not really considered used space from the user's perspective.  If you Get Info on your drive, the Used Space value will not include it.  For more details on this feature, see this Apple Support Document HT204015  If it isn't TM data or it is some other unnecessary cache file, and it is a file that you are sure you want to remove, right click on the grey box and select "Move to Trash".  And if you don't want local TimeMachine backups at all, open Terminal and type codesudo tmutil disable/code.  If you need to re-enable them, type codesudo tmutil enable/code  hr  strongFOLLOWUP 2016-04-19/strong:  The large grey box is "Space occupied by other files and folders" because you have the "Show Other Files" option enabled in the Preferences.  Those are system files that you don't have access to read, and/or files outside of the scanned folder. It appears you started at the top of the drive but it can't access the files/folders not owned by you (i.e. root).  You can see in the picture of the code.Spotlight-V100 folder/code it has a red hyphen icon meaning you don't have access.  Since you can't [easily] run the app as root, here is another option but it will take more work.  Open the Terminal app and type the commands codecd //code then codesudo du -hxs .[^.]* */code. This will show the size of each directory tree. For example, code  68M    .DocumentRevisions-V100   0B    .PKInstallSandboxManager 2.0G    .Spotlight-V100   0B    .Trashes   0B    .dbfseventsd   0B    .file  44M    .fseventsd   0B    .vol  21G    Applications 7.0G    Library   0B    Network 8.2G    System 292G    Users 4.0K    Volumes 2.5M    bin   0B    cores 4.5K    dev 4.0K    etc   0B    home   0B    net 5.4G    private 1.0M    sbin 4.0K    tmp 1.4G    usr 4.0K    var /code  You can then codecd/code into each large dir and list the files with codels -alh/code or repeat the codesudo/code command until you find the large files.  Do strongNOT/strong delete any files unless you know exactly what you are doing.  All of the files/folders outside of the Users folder are for the system.  If you remove the wrong one, you will have a bad week!  <comment287895> Boot up in [Safe Mode](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201262). It'll take a while to finish before the login screen. Safe Mode appears in red in the menu bar once you've logged in. Because many services are not started on a Safe Mode boot, restart after you login. In addition to other activities such as running a disk check, Safe Mode deletes many user & system cache files which may be taking up a fair amount room you cannot see on the disk in the UI. Last time I used this (today, in fact) a customer reclaimed 866MB in disk space. YMMV as to how much space you get back. <comment287952> Thanks for the comment.  It's not TM as I use Code42 for my backups, and when I go to "display files" for that big partition, its actually a bunch of smaller files that come up, none of them totaling more than 100MB in a single file.  That's my curiosity-- It's a SD disk so it shouldn't have fragmented data, so I don't know how its still showing full-- I am getting "startup disk full" which shouldn't come up either if it were TM data... Thoughts? <comment288040> Because I can't put it all in a comment, I've updated my answer with more info and a different troubleshooting method. <comment288402> Thanks! That helped quite a bit-- Found out that it was the new "DocumentRevisions" in `.DocumentRevisions-V100` that was taking up 100+ gigs... thank you!
