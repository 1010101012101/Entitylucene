Why is my iPhone 4s Videos app displaying TV show episode and series titles as "Unknown" and Season as "(null)" and how do I fix it? <body> To restate the question, why is my iPhone 4s Videos app displaying TV show episode and series titles as "Unknown" and Season as "(null)" and how do I fix it?  I have already attempted to reboot, access the files directly in PhoneView, and through iTunes. I cannot make these dead files go away and syncing doesn't help.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ktDbq.png" height="350" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/AZkDM.png" height="350"  <answer65455> Have you already tried completely turning off TV show syncing in iTunes? Also maybe give deleting all your videos from within the settings app at Genereal  Usage and here look for the Videos app.  As a last resort remains always a complete iOS Restore using iTunes or the option in the iPhones settings app under General  Reset  Reset All Settings/Erase All Content and Settings. Make sure to either have a backup in your iCloud or on your computer using iTunes.  <comment77008> Thanks, but I'm trying not to restore if I don't have to. I realize that will fix (almost) everything that can go wrong with iOS, but I was hoping for a non-nuclear solution. I don't think there is a way to turn off TV Show syncing in iTunes or to delete videos from General  Usage, as there is no Videos app listed there.
