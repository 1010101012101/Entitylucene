What is the keyboard shortcut for "Open With" in Finder? <body> How can I open a file with an application, other than the default, using a keyboard shortcut? I don’t want to change the default application for the filetype.  E.g. sometimes I want to open a .html file using an editor instead of a browser.  <answer72866> I'm afraid there's not shortcut. You can, though, create your owns.  To do so just:  ol liGo to strongSystem Preferences / Keyboard / Keyboard Shortcuts / Applications/strong./li liClick the strong+/strong button./li liChoose strongFinder/strong, from the drop-down list./li liOn the emmenu title/em field add strongthe exact name/strong of the menu bar item. It this case it should be codeOther.../code instead of codeOpen with/code./li liPick your keyboard shortcut and click strongAdd/strong./li /ol  You'll be able to test the shortcut right away. Just mind the strongOpen always with/strong option!  <answer72877> I have used FastScripts to assign a shortcut to this script. It can also be used to select the open recent menus in other applications.  precodetry     set l to {"Open With", "Open Recent", "Open Recent File", "Recent Projects", "Open Recent Set"}     tell application "System Events" to tell (process 1 where it is frontmost)         tell menu bar item 3 of menu bar 1             click             repeat with x in l                 try                     menu item x of menu 1                     click menu item x of menu 1                     exit repeat                 end try             end repeat         end tell     end tell end try /code/pre  I also used scripts like in 10.6 and earlier:  precodetry     tell application "Finder"         open (get selection) using path to application "TextMate"     end tell end try /code/pre  There is a bug that makes them unusable in 10.7 and 10.8 though. It could be avoided by focusing another application at the start, but it results in a visual glitch.  You could also use Automator services, but there is another bug where the shortcuts for services don't always work until the services menu has been shown from the menu bar.  <answer123351> Right click on the file  press h key  use arrow keys to navigate  <answer143205> The best solution for me:   ol liSelect file you want to open/li liPress kbd⇧/kbd+kbd⌘/kbd+kbd//kbd (opens up the mighty Help search)/li liThen start to type a name of app you want to open/li liUse arrow keys to select right menu item/li liPress kbdEnter/kbd/li liDone! /li /ol  For example I want to open HTML-file with Sublime Text instead of Chrome.  I navigate to this file, press shortcut, type in "su", press down-arrow and press enter!  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/VDRgj.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer159886> My favorite solution is using Better Touch Tool, a free app.  For this to work you need to have Full Keyboard Access turned on (in system preferences - keyboard preferences - shortcuts), so that ctrl-f2 will access the menu bar.  Then use BTT to configure your short-cut (I use ctrl-alt-cmd-O) to do ctrl-f2, then attach addtional actions (10 times: two right arrows, then 7 down, then one right).  When typing your shortcut you will get to the same submenu as you would get using the right mouse click and 'open with'.  Note that ctrl-f2 may not be displayed in BTT when you type it, but it does after you do 'attach additional action'.  <answer160081> As requested , here is a capture of [my blog] post for an Automator Service that works for me in Yosemite .  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/O0LJW.png" alt="enter image description here"  Code for Applescript in step strong2/strong  precodeon run {input, parameters}      tell current application to activate   end run /code/pre  Code for Applescript in step strong5/strong  precodeon run {input, parameters}     set theApp to (POSIX path of (item 1 of input))     repeat with i from 2 to number of items in input         set this_item to item i of input         tell application theApp to open this_item     end repeat     tell application theApp to activate end run /code/pre  hr  After Saving the Automator Service go to  System Prefs.  and add your shortcut to it.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/toJXD.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer288183> If you frequently open a file in a specific app (other than the default app), you can set a keyboard shortcut for doing it. This is super easy.  Let's say you want to open a file in Sublime Text whenever you press kbdcontrol/kbd+kbdS/kbd strongafter selecting the file/strong.  ol liGo to strongSystem Preferences  Keyboard  Shortcuts/strong em(tab)/em strong App Shortcuts/strong em(option in left sidebar)/em./li liCreate new shorctut by clicking/tapping on strong+/strong./li liSelect strongFinder/strong as strongApplication/strong./li liSet strongMenu Title/strong as strongSublime Text/strong./li liSet strongKeyboard Shortcut/strong as kbdcontrol/kbd+kbdS/kbd. It will be shown  as strong^S/strong. Or you can use any other shortcut which you prefer./li liClick/Tap on strongAdd/strong./li /ol  Now you can simply select the file and press kbdcontrol/kbd+kbdS/kbd to open the file in Sublime Text.  <comment84615> I dont think this works. I just tried and looks like Finder confuses Open With and `Always Open With` (10.7.5): [The keyboard shortcut pref](http://imgur.com/CoPWC) and  [the error message](http://imgur.com/Skmni) <comment84617> Also, as a side effect of adding the shortcut, the `Open With` context menu item (ctrl+click) becomes `Always Open With` whenever the keyboard shortcut is mapped: [Before](http://imgur.com/6e9ha) and [After](http://imgur.com/NJ2y8) <comment84619> The closest I get is if I know the name of the app, I press `Cmd Shift /`, then start typing the name, and use the down arrow to select `Open With  App` <comment84622> @Nivas Indeed, that's why you have to write `Other...` instead of `Open with...`. [This](http://imgur.com/hSZz2) is how it should look like. It's in Spanish, but you see my point. <comment84626> @Nivas And [here](http://imgur.com/nbBIx) the preferences panel, in case I didn't make myself clear enough. <comment84627> Ah... I did not know that. `Other...` does work. (It does amaze the programmer in me though that there is an implicit assumption that the menu items should have unique names. What if another submenu has an `Other`? But that is beyond this question...) <comment144048> This does not appear to work on OS X 10.9. Do you have any third party utilities installed that may be providing this functionality? <comment188102> This is not working on 10.10 the menu Othe… get the shortcut but does not respond <comment188132> I made an Automator service that works http://www.markosx.com/thecocoaquest/finders-open-in-other-shortcut-that-works-in-mavericks/ <comment188145> @markhunte Why don't you post it as a proper answer? <comment188167> @Thecafremo done. <comment252894> The shorter solution (FastScripts) works flawlessly in 10.11, at least for opening file in Emacs. <comment334683> Glad I followed through with this one, just had to discover some 'right'-clicking needed for your orange dotted-line instruction (at least that's how I got through it.) Thanks for posting <comment363877> There is a direct and super easy solution to this. Check my answer.Please accept it as answer if it serves your need. <comment370708> IT WORKS!! YAY!!! On macos 10.12 (sierra) at least
