Create new file from contextual menu <body> Is there a program I can download to add an option to create a new file to the contextual menu of finder? NuFile doesn't seem to work in Snow Leopard.  <answer2682> If you are happy using a toolbar button instead of the contextual menu, you can use New Text File Here from Jonas Wisser. Just drop it into Finder's toolbar.  Note: As of OS X 10.11.4 this program no longer seems to be working.  <answer2689> Path Finder also adds a contextual option for creating new files, but it's shareware.  Lots of other cool feature though.  <comment2292> you just need to add to finder or if suggest you equivalent to finder it's ok too? <comment2395> Adding to finder is preferable
