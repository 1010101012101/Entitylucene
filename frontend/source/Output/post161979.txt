Syntax for "focused searches" on Finder <body> When I trying searching for a file/folder on Finder, I get way too many results. I know that I can narrow down search results by pressing the [+], but is there a way of narrowing the search results by typing something in the finder search box?  Thanks!  <comment189263> This article should be helpful: [Advanced searches in the Finder](http://www.macworld.com/article/1132817/spotlight3.html) <comment189319> Thanks- but it doesn't tell you how to narrow down searches within the text bar. <comment189356> I use [EasyFind](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/easyfind/id411673888?mt=12) for 'difficult' searches
