"File" NOT "App"... can't be opened because it is from an unidentified developer <body> got an strongmp3/strong via email from a musician friend of mine today. when i try to open it em(in any app... itunes, quicktime, vlc, etc)/em, i get this message as if it's a new strongApplication/strong that i just downloaded from the internet.  i KNOW what to do if it's an app em(keep my system prefs security settings &amp; secondary-click on it &amp; choose open that way)/em that i trust, but i've never experienced this happening before with strong"Files"/strong that i trust.  strongis this normal &amp; safe to open as if it was an app?/strong or could something have happened to it &amp; opening could be bad? or could it have been intercepted &amp; actually be some sort of trojan or something?  <answer178984> I have two guesses:  ul liIt is an application masked as an mp3 file. Yes, you should not open it./li liMac OS X gives warnings "blabla downloaded from internet" for anything, not just apps downoaded from Internet. If you are sure the file is fine, play it back./li /ul  By the way, mp3 files must be able to play back by just quick previewing them (Space bar).  <comment212100> You can also check to see if it is an app or a true mp3 file by right-clicking on the file and then choosing "Get Info" from the context menu. Under "Name & Extension" it will show you if then extension is an .app or .mp3. <comment212559> thanks for the reply. the "Get Info" shows it as an .mp3, so i guess it's ok. <comment212561> hi. thanks for your reply! **first,** i'm confused about the warnings thing. i only ever get the warning for "apps" that i download. i've never gotten a warning for anything else (& never email attachments). my security settings are set to "Allow from MAS & Identified Developers". **second,** as i just commented above to another person, the Get Info shows it as an mp3. **third,** when i do a Quicklook on it, i just get a Quicktime icon. **lastly,** this is all just very odd :-( <comment236435> I have the same problem: downloaded some mp3 from bbc, but can't open it with VLC!
