Does my Time Machine backup disc need to be dedicated? <body> I have an external HD that's about 60% full. The remaining space is more than enough for a Time Machine backup of my hard drive. If I enable Time Machine using that disc, will it erase my existing files, or just use the free space?  <answer19127> No it will not erase your existing files. Time machine will create a folder on your external hard drive called Backups.backupdb. This will contain your time machine backups. Once your disc space is full, time machine will start erasing old backups however so it can always store your most-recent backup.  <answer19128> It will just use the free space but it won't backup the files on that disk as stated on the relevant Apple support document       Time Machine works best if you use your backup disk only for Time Machine backups. If you keep separate files on your backup disk, Time Machine won’t back up those files, and the space available for Time Machine backups will be reduced.    <answer19129> No, it does not. It creates a codeBackups.backupdb//code directory for itself and leaves your other files untouched.  However, if (on Lion) you want to emencrypt/em your backup it uses the same full-disc encryption as FileVault, and I think your other files on the disc will also be subject to that. (I haven't tried this myself.)  <answer198237> If you want an encrypted backup, Time Machine will erase the contents on the drive as part of the encryption process. (It is a full disk encryption.) In that case, yes, you'll need a dedicated blank drive.  <answer266735> If the disc was formatted for Windows/PC use, it would need to be reformatted and formatting it for Time Machine will erase all data.  "Time Machine can’t back up to an iPod, iPad, or iPhone, or a disk formatted for Windows. If you connect a disk formatted for Windows, it can be reformatted (permanently removing all data) to a Mac filesystem format and used as a backup disk."  Backup disks you can use with Time Machine  <comment350394> What if my external hard drive already has a `Backups.backupdb` folder from when I used Time Machine with another computer? Will Time Machine overwrite it? <comment350395> Apparently, Time Machine will ask you if you'd like to inherit the backups that are already on the drive.
