OS X Server VPN: cannot ping local network <body> My OS X Server located in my home network. It's using Time Capsule to connect to the Internet. I've setup VPN server there and I was able to successfully connect, but I can't reach the devices in the local network.  So, the scheme is like that  precode      Me ------ Internet -- Time Capsule -- MacMini Server 192.168.1.224                10.0.1.1       10.0.1.5                                 |                                 |                                 +--- Local Device                                       10.0.1.10 /code/pre  I setup the route (in Server.app):  precodeIP Address=10.0.1.0, subnet mask=255.255.255.0, Network Type=Private /code/pre  But when I try to ping 10.0.1.10 I'm getting "Request timeout for icmp_seq". codetraceroute/code output:  precodetraceroute 10.0.1.10 traceroute to 10.0.1.10 (10.0.1.10), 64 hops max, 52 byte packets  1  10.0.1.5 (10.0.1.5)  21.294 ms  19.850 ms  21.098 ms  2  * /code/pre  If I go to the server(10.0.1.5) through screen sharing, I'm able to ping 10.0.1.10 from there successfully.  Any suggestions what I should setup to access that local device (10.0.1.10) through VPN?  <comment143216> Looks like it's a problem on the time capsule. I changed the VPN addresses from 192.168.1.224 to 10.0.1.224 and I was able to access the local network after that. I think it's because time capsule not routing the packages from 192.168.1.224 to the local network. Any suggestions how I can configure routing on time capsule? <comment144338> 192.168.x.x is in another Network than 10.0.x.x so i could not have worked with 192.168.x.x the router inside your local network has correct just blocked all atempts from you trying to ping from 192.168.x.x to 10.0.x.x Not a PC/Nor a Network Fault/Problem just a Brain Faillure
