Can't delete empty partition <body> I've searched around on here and viewed posts such as:  ul liI deleted my Bootcamp partition but can&#39;t resize my OS X partition/li liCan&#39;t ever remove partition?/li /ul  The second one looked most promising, however the solution doesn't seem to give me the empty partition when running codediskutil cs list/code so I can't delete it this way:  precodediskutil cs list CoreStorage logical volume groups (1 found) | +-- Logical Volume Group 2BBFD1F3-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX     =========================================================     Name:         Macintosh HD     Status:       Online     Size:         447653191680 B (447.7 GB)     Free Space:   106496 B (106.5 KB)     |     +-&lt; Physical Volume F3D5C9AC-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX     |   ----------------------------------------------------     |   Index:    0     |   Disk:     disk0s2     |   Status:   Online     |   Size:     447653191680 B (447.7 GB)     |     +-&gt; Logical Volume Family FCEE4713-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX         ----------------------------------------------------------         Encryption Status:       Unlocked         Encryption Type:         AES-XTS         Conversion Status:       Complete         Conversion Direction:    -none-         Has Encrypted Extents:   Yes         Fully Secure:            Yes         Passphrase Required:     Yes         |         +-&gt; Logical Volume C6735B8F-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX             ---------------------------------------------------             Disk:                  disk1             Status:                Online             Size (Total):          447300763648 B (447.3 GB)             Conversion Progress:   -none-             Revertible:            Yes (unlock and decryption required)             LV Name:               Macintosh HD             Volume Name:           Macintosh HD             Content Hint:          Apple_HFS /code/pre  This is what Disk Utility gives me:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/umxXW.png" alt="Disk Utility"  As you can see the delete button is unavailable.  I have a Time Machine backup but that only gave me the option to restore to my 447GB disk (the drive is obviously a 500GB).  What are the recommended steps to reclaim my free space? I've tried repairing, and it found some errors in the partition table and supposedly "fixed" them. The situation came about when I created a blank partition and an error was shown. I've since then being trying to delete it with no luck.  <answer204463> Solved. I just had to boot into recovery and run  precodediskutil cs unlockVolume C6735B8F-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX diskutil cs resizeStack C6735B8F-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX 0g /code/pre  The only strange thing is that Disk Utility shows a blue and white rectangle to represent the drive (unless this is simply showing used space):  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/df6HX.png" alt="Disk Utility"  Thanks goes to this post: Resizing or expanding a CoreStorage volume
