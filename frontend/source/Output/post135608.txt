Does the Apple AppStore checksum the apps after they arrive at your phone? <body> I downloaded an app on a rather crappy internet connection, and the App ran but could not connect to the server.    After a few hours of trying and retrying the username and password we finally deleted the app and redownloaded it.  This time it worked flawlessly which leads me to believe the Apps are not checksumed when they arrive.
