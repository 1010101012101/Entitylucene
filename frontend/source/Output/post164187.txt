Creating NetRestore on 10.10.1 failing <body> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/IdQwf.png" alt="enter image description here"When trying to create a NetRestore image in SIU on 10.10.1 and trying to add custom packages the build will always fail with Error Code 2.  I noticed when you try to Customize Packages that "Essential System Software" reads as 8.03TB but the SSD inside the computer is only 256GB.   I have tried to redownload the "Install OS X Yosemite" from the Mac App Store three times and with all 3 sources the "Essential System Software" will still always read as 8.03TB.  Does anyone else experience this and know how to resolve this?  <answer164199> 'Customize Package Selection' is only valid for NetInstall images and not for NetRestore images - at least for Mavericks.    Source  Probably it's the same for Yosemite. I haven't a source for that though.  On the other hand 'NetRestore' just uses an already prepared image of a working OS X installation - so absolutely nothing to customize afterwards...  <comment192431> Thats interesting. The Enterprise support guy at Apple seems to believe this should work and submitted the issue to the engineers
