Is there a way to see the automator script in text? <body> If i create some type of workflow on Automator, can I see the script in plain text?  For example, maybe get the script and push it out through Apple Remote Desktop to a remote computer?  <answer202964> While you could look at, copy and transfer, the contents of the strongdocument.wflow/strong file found inside the strongfilename.workflow/strong bundle or strongAutomator/strong strongfilename.app/strong bundle, it's just XML, I'm not sure how much good it will do you as it will not open in the strongAutomator.app/strong.  It will open  with the strongAutomator Runner/strong however it may not run as intended, depends on what's in there.  <comment244794> Is the some reason you cannot just transfer the package created by Automator?
