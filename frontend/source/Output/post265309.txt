I want to capture screen of my iPhone (video call) <body> I want to capture screen of my iPhone (video call). When i use quicktime, i get this horrible echo, so i can't listen to the call and record it simultaneously. Is there any way to overcome this echo?  <answer290408> iOS 11 includes a built-in Screen Recording function, which also includes an option to turn the microphone on during the session, by long-pressing or hard-pressing the screen recording button.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jwGfv.png" alt="enter image description here"  You might want to try that; iOS 11 is still in beta but it's now in empublic/em beta which means you don't need to be a developer to enroll and test it.  <comment332658> May be to use headphones?
