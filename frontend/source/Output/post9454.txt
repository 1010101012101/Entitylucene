Can I transfer and view xvid (avi) videos on an iPad? <body> What type of video files can I watch on my iPad?  I usually only have code.avi/code files; is there an app that will allow me to play them?  <answer9455> Use VLC for the iPad (link is directly to the apple store for VLC)  Quicky guide through here  <answer9456> You could also try AirVideo, which will convert and stream xvid (and other formats) from a local PC.  You can connect to it via local network or remotely as well.http://www.inmethod.com/air-video/index.html  <answer9480> You can use strongOPlayer HD/strong to watch your video on your iPad. There's also a free ad-supported version available  <answer9600> I usually use Handbrake to convert everything to .mp4 or .m4v (iTunes-friendly extension) before importing it to iTunes and syncing it to an iDevice.  Just open it up and give it a source file, pick the proper preset, and press Go.  <answer9616> Another idea is converting your videos using Macroplant's Adapter. Quite simple to do.  <comment9951> VLC is no longer on the App Store <comment9952> I rephrased your question, also, if you want to ask a question about Cydia, please ask another separate question (after searching if it wasn't already asked)
