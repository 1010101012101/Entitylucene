Creating New Administrator Account <body> So I am following How can I get admin access to a Mac without knowing the current password? to create a new administrator account.  I entered the command coderm /db/.AppleSetupDone/code. and the computer prompts me with the following:  precodeoverride -w---r-- /root/wheel /var/db/.AppleSetupDone? /code/pre  (It says something like that) I type in: codeyes/code and then it says “read only file system”. After I reboot nothing happens, I don’t have to create a new account or do anything like that.  I suspect it is because the file system is “read-only”; is there any way around that?  <comment209867> You did type in the command  **mount -uw /** before you typed the **rm /db/.AppleSetupDone**, yes? <comment209869> Yes, I did type in that command <comment209871> The 'w' part of the **mount -uw** command should mount the disk read/write. Would you please edit your post to include the version of OS X on this Mac, please? <comment209877> `/var/` is only a link to `/private/var` - does the same thing happen if you try to delete `/private/var/db/.AppleSetupDone`? <comment209878> Why are you wanting to do this? Are you trying to bypass account restrictions set by an administrator, for example? There is a very simple way of doing this but the question of why you're restricted to a non-administrator account has to be asked...
