How to make Tkinter run on Sierra? <body> I can't seem to get Tkinter to work on Sierra.  I have tried various versions (Apple, Homebrew, Active) of Python 2 and 3 with various versions of tcl/tk (also Apple, Homebrew and Active) but I cannot find the right combination and/or the right way to install the bundle.  Whenever I bring up a Tkinter file dialog and select a file the Python launcher hangs.  Anyone got this to work?
