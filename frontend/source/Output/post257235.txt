macOS Sierra "System" files eating up disk space <body> macOS Sierra system is using over 200 GB of storage space on my 250 GB hard drive. I've removed Time Machine backups to no avail. How do I free up space? My current usable space being less than 50 GB is getting quite problematic.  strongEdit:/strong  The culprit has been found. Imagemagick is creating tons of temp files for some reason.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/H1kWK.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer257246> strongThe Solution/strong  I used a storage scanning application to see where all the space was going. I used emDaisyDisk/em, but Disk emInventory X/em is another option  Turns out ImageMagick image editing library was rampantly creating large files at em/private/var/tmp/em  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/b7ZKA.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment321129> Adding to the commotion; Space freed up by removing personal files quickly gets eaten up by system <comment321135> Please add what you found as an answer and then you can accept it.  This will help others who have a similar problem with this software.
