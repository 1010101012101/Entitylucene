How to tell which Alternate Mode a display is using on 2016 MacBook Pro <body> I have a 13" MacBook Pro 2016 (non-touchbar) which I've connected to a couple of HDMI displays.  I know that Macs support both HDMI and DisplayPort over USB-C Alternate Modes, and I'd like to know which.  One of my adapters (Choetech) says it uses DisplayPort 1.2 so I'd like to confirm this.  The other (Bqeel) doesn't say so I'd like to know how to find out.  I've got a couple of others that I'd like to investigate too.  I tried looking in Graphics/Displays in System Information but in both cases it says "Connection Type:  DVI or HDMI" so I'm not really any the wiser.
