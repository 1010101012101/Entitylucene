How can I adjust the apparent color temperature of my display in OS X? <body> I really like strongf.lux/strong, which is an app that automatically adjusts the display's apparent color temperature according to the time of day and location (so that the temperature is in sync with Sun).  strongHow to set the color temperature emmanually?/em/strong I.e. without f.lux?   Sometimes I'd like to have "tungsten" (2700 K) colors during the day or morning, which would require fiddling with the location coordinates in f.lux. Sadly, there's no "manual mode" that I'm aware of.  I'm looking for a OS X native / software based solution, that would allow me to set white point below 4500 °K, which is the minimum that Color Calibrator can set. Is this even possible?  <answer12720> When using the Displays section of your System Preferences, if you calibrate it, select show advanced options, one of the windows is this: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zxrx6.jpg" alt="enter image description here" which to me looks like the white points you were looking for, be sure to uncheck "Use native white point" if you want to manually edit it.  <answer12721> Open system preferences, go to the Displays panel and choose the Color tab. Press the Calibrate... button and go through the steps. If you turn on expert mode, you will choose the white point using a slider, but if you don't you will get to choose between a few standard values. You can even do this multiple times, saving with a different name each time, and switch between them through the list in the color tab.  <answer12742> Found a possible workaround for those who are interested:  h2Nocturne by Blacktree/h2  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1gWZM.png" alt="Nocturne preferences"  It has a nice amount of options and is completely manual. Downside is it doesn't set apparent color temperature emper se/em, but setting a emwhite tint/em to codeRGB(255, 197, 143)/code has approximately the same effect as setting white point to ≈ 2600 °K (see Kelvin &hArr; RGB table on planetpixelemporium).  <answer12747> A cool way is to let f.lux do the work http://stereopsis.com/flux/ It adjusts your screen colour temp. with the time of the day! Give it a try!  <answer51589> This solution requires F.lux to be installed (I assume it's at code/Applications/Flux.app/code).  Create a text file (let's call it codeflux-day-color/code) and put it in code/usr/local/bin/code (codeusr/code is under "Macintosh HD" and may be hidden).  precode#!/bin/bash  if [[ ! -z "$1" &amp;&amp; "$1" -ge 2700 &amp;&amp; "$1" -le 6500 ]]; then   defaults write org.herf.Flux dayColorTemp -int "$1"   killall Flux   open /Applications/Flux.app else   echo "provide a temperature between 2700 and 6500 (rounded to nearest 100)" fi /code/pre  In Terminal, run codechmod 755 /usr/local/bin/flux-day-color/code  Now you can run codeflux-day-color 2700/code in Terminal (or in another script) to change the day temperature. Note that the script restarts F.lux so you may see the display jump to 6500 K for a split second before applying your requested temperature.  It's also possible to schedule this to run at predefined intervals, but that's beyond the scope of this answer (and the question).  If you'd rather have a launchable app that can toggle between 2 temperatures,  Open Terminal and run these commands:  precodebash cd /Applications/ mkdir -p flux-day-toggle.app/Contents/MacOS cd flux-day-toggle.app/Contents/MacOS cat &lt;&lt;END &gt; flux-day-toggle /code/pre  Now you'll see a greater than sign. Paste this:  precode#!/bin/bash  DOMAIN=org.herf.Flux KEY_NAME=dayColorTemp  LOW=2700 HIGH=6500  cur_val=`defaults read $DOMAIN $KEY_NAME 2&gt;/dev/null` if [[ -z "$cur_val" || "$cur_val" -eq "$HIGH" ]]; then   new_val=$LOW else   new_val=$HIGH fi  defaults write $DOMAIN $KEY_NAME -int $new_val killall Flux open /Applications/Flux.app END /code/pre  Wait for the prompt to appear, meaning the file was written. Now the finishing touch:  precodechmod 755 flux-day-toggle /code/pre  Now you can launch the new app. You can customize the LOW and HIGH settings to your liking.  <comment13337> Fellow f.lux user here. Great app. Best I know w/o 3rd party software or using the monitor's buttons would be to go System Preferences  Displays  Color  Calibrate. Use "Expert Mode". However this will only let you take it down to 4500 K. Interested to find out the answer on this one. <comment13338> Great info, thanks. I hadn't had the guts to go through all the steps just for the white point. Sadly, though, the lowest kelvin is 4500-4700 (just closed the window ). Is there a way to adjust *just* the white point? (well, I could calibrate different profiles) And how to adjust it below the Calibrator's options? <comment13339> Sadly, the lowest target white's are somewhere 4500–4700 °K. Do you know how to tune it down to, say, 2700 °K? <comment13340> I found the value hardcoded in /Users/username/Library/Preferences/com.apple.ColorSyncCalibrator.plist, but editing it to a lower value had no effect. I will keep looking. <comment13341> It did have an affect when I logged in and out, I was able to black out my entire monitor, so probably relauching something will reset the value <comment13349> I think I am going to need to ask my own question, something along the lines of what actions are the sys prefs taking after loading that file to tell the mac to activate the change besides changing the file. <comment13372> I think you missed the part of his question where he said "without f.lux." <comment13373> oh sorry... I realized it when I just had posted my answer <comment58964> Maybe I don't understand the difficulty, but can't you just set F.lux's daytime slider to 2700? When you say "sometimes", do you mean algorithmically predictable times/dates? If so, then a script would solve your problem. I think it's possible to write a script to force F.lux to a certain daytime temp (or nighttime for that matter). <comment58965> Here's a bonus tip: a command-line utility to set the display brightness (ie in lieu of the F1 and F2 keys). http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20090901021817717 <comment129675> Had to check this as an accepted answer as I haven't got Nocturne to work on Mavericks. I enhanced your `flux-day-color` script a bit and [created a Gist](https://gist.github.com/koiyu/7398527) that can be used to set either/both day and night temperatures (and just using `flux-temp 3000`, i.e. without options, to change the current display temperature to whatever regardless of the time.) I also found out the minimum Flux temperature is 2300 K, at least in the current version. <comment233888> @koiyu: I used your Gist to manually alter F.lux and it has worked well, thank you. However, I now cannot alter the brightness of my screen using the keypad -- is it possible that this is related to your Gist? <comment233891> @user27182 Don't think so — at least my external Apple BT keyboard alters brightness normally even when temperature is being adjusted. All the actions the script does is (1) kill f.lux (2) set f.lux preferences (3) re-open f.lux. It's more likely to be related to f.lux or just a random operating system mishap (ie. have you tried turning it off and on again?)
