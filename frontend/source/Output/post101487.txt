My mac mini HDMI display switch off and on <body> I have a mac mini (mi-2011) connected to a screen using an HDMI cable.  I have nothing on the screen except several second from time to time.  I tried to autodetect the monitor in the system preferences without success. Do you have an idea how I could push further diagnostic?  <comment119557> Sounds like faulty hdmi cable!. does it work if you plug it in to your TV?
