Troubleshooting IKEv2 on 10.11 El Capitan <body> How do I troubleshoot IKEv2 VPN issues on El Capitan?  I've followed these instructions to create an IKEv2 VPN (and certificate) on a Ubuntu server that I want to connect to, which all seems pretty reasonable.   I'm now trying to connect to it from my Mac.  I've created an IKEv2 connection with (what I think are) the appropriate details. When I click connect, the VPN menu icon just shows the connecting lights for 2 minutes but nothing happens. There is no output (error or otherwise) in /var/log/system.log or on syslog -w. There is no error message or evidence of any sort of connection attempt on the server. If I change the server address in the VPN config to something non existent, the results are identical, so clearly it's not really doing anything useful.   How do I find out what it actually thinks it's doing though? Surely something should be getting logged somewhere. I have tried adding   precodelog debug; path logfile "/var/log/racoon.log"; /code/pre  to /etc/racoon/racoon.conf and restarting but I still get nothing.    Update - I'm now getting some error output (post reboot):  precodeOct 12 21:27:06 testing nesessionmanager[519] &lt;Notice&gt;: NESMIKEv2VPNSession[VPN (IKEv2):930E0F86-1878-42E5-9CBD-08FD10677429]: Received a start command from SystemUIServer[415] Oct 12 21:27:06 testing nesessionmanager[519] &lt;Notice&gt;: NESMIKEv2VPNSession[VPN (IKEv2):930E0F86-1878-42E5-9CBD-08FD10677429]: status changed to connecting Oct 12 21:27:06 testing nesessionmanager[519] &lt;Error&gt;: Failed to find the VPN app for plugin type com.apple.neplugin.IKEv2 ...

Perhaps it wasn't ready to ship.  https://forums.developer.apple.com/thread/18197  http://www.openradar.appspot.com/22735440  <comment262890> I am on 10.11.2 Beta (15C47a) and this still has not been fixed.
