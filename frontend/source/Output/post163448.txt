My system seems stuck on Optimize hard drive in FileVault <body> Just upgraded to Yosemite. Going through the process it asked about file vault. I said yes to encrypt it, so it started to optimize hard drive it seems to be stuck on 2 hours left....probably been 3 hours since it started. What do I do? Thank you in advance (I am new to Apple products btw.)  <answer163460> Encrypting can take hours depending on the size of the information on your disk.  Run following in terminal to see the status of encryption codediskutil cs list/code
