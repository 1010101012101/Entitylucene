Playlists deleted from iTunes after deleted on iPhone <body> I have my iPhone synced with iTunes. There were some playlists synced. I needed some free space on my iPhone once, so I deleted all playlists from my iPhone to make some space for video recording.  Then, after deleting videos, I connected my iPhone to Mac and clicked "Sync" to put all this playlists again into my iPhone.   But the sync did something ridiculous - it deleted all these playlists from iTunes!   OK - I guess somebody can tell me: "That is what sync should do by its definition". NO, for me it is totally stupid approach to syncing music. But let's not talk about that.   Could you please explain what did exactly happen and how can I restore these playlists?  <comment134185> This just happened to me, except that before my iTunes would "sync" but not copy anything, despite a ton of changes.
