Import iCal data from other mac <body> I need to consolidate two iCal installations: the data from my old laptop should be merged into my new laptop’s iCal data.  I tried exporting the old iCal data and importing it on the new laptop. Unfortunately, this would emreplace/em all my new iCal data. I don’t want this. I also don’t want to export/import separate calendars – I want to emmerge/em them (i.e. “work” with “work”, and “home” with “home”).  Is there a (hopefully painless) way of achieving this?  subsupNote to self: use cloud-based calendar in future/sup/sub  <answer39901> http://www.macworld.com/article/54668/2007/01/mergecalendars.html  This seems to be doing exactly what you ask.
