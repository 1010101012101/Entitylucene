How to install specific version of python on OS X <body> I need to install python3.4 on my OS X.  Tried to do it with codebrew install python3/code and now I have python 3.5.1. But I need py3.4.  How can I install python3.4 on my Mac?  <answer237431> I have done this sort of thing in two ways - however both do not coexist with homebrew although I suspect there should be a way similar to the macports one.  The first is using Macports as the package manager. There are separate ports for several python versions 2.x and 3.x currently 2.4, 2.5, 2.6, 2.7 and 3.1, 3.2, 3.3 3.4 and 3.5. For example to install 3.4 do codesudo port install python34/code There is also a python_select port that running it allows you to choose which version of python is run by /opt/bin/python.br Each package manager needs to run as the only package manager otherwise it will be confused with unexpected different versions of libraries and executables on its paths.  The other way is install direct from python.org This will install a python into /usr/local/bin I think this installs a python and python3 executable.  The issue with Homebrew is that it assumes that things in /usr/local are installed by it and so brew doctor will report these python.org pythons and libraries as issues and as this question shows also the frameworks in /Library will be problematic.  <answer281482> code$ brew install python3/code is equals follow  code$ brew install https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/master/Formula/python3.rb/code  So. if you wanna install specific version then, you must check before install.  ul liplease check git history of python3.rb/li lifind want version.     for example   now, homebrew supported python3's head version is 3.6.1   but I wanna 3.5.2_3. so I can install this way.   code$ brew install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/ec545d45d4512ace3570782283df4ecda6bb0044/Formula/python3.rb/code /li /ul  <comment290795> Maybe from: [https://www.python.org/ftp/python/](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/) <comment290800> Ok, thank you. Installed from python.org. :) <comment336728> It is easiy with brew http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3987683/homebrew-install-specific-version-of-formula <comment336769> @Raz that is how to install one or the other not install both and chnage between them - or else I misunderstand the answer - if it is simple please give as an answer - hopefully in a simple way <comment336950> @Mark I needed to run my project on the specific python version and google gives this answer. Since brew is mentioned in the question I would prefer to install additional python version than additional package manager. My comment was for googlers like me.
