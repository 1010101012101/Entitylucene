Download Font from Application to FontBook <body> Is it possible to download fonts from applications into FontBook? I go to the application and select "Show Contents" and find the code.otf/code font files. I then try to download the font to FontBook and get a frightening warning message.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/daUqG.png" alt="Font Warning"   <comment261603> Possible, yes. Always wise, no. <comment261736> Any insights into what could be causing these "serious problems"? <comment261742> Sorry, no - but you can usually Google for the full version of a font & get an unrestricted, licensed version quite easily
