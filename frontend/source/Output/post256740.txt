Determine Apple Mobile Device From Mail Headers <body> I have a client who is using a laptop, iPhone, and iPad to send emails. However, after checking outgoing message queues on the mail server, one of the Apple devices is using the wrong settings.  Is there a way to determine if the offending device is the iPad or iPhone from the mail headers? I've already been able to determine that it's an Apple device from the headers, just not which one.
