Disable dictionary results in Spotlight? <body> How can I remove dictionary results from Spotlight results? I've typed "chrome" into Spotlight and looked up emchrome/em in the Dictionary one too many times, and now opening Chrome takes an extra keystroke.  I've seen comments about codedefaults write com.apple.spotlight DictionaryLookupEnabled NO/code, but this doesn't seem to work with Mac OS 10.8, even after a codesudo killall -u _spotlight/code.  <answer74563> ul liOpen /Applications/Utilities/Terminal  /li liEnter codedefaults write com.apple.spotlight DictionaryLookupEnabled NO/code/li liLog out and Log back in/li /ul  Please note that on some versions of OS X, Spotlight is part of the SystemUIServer process, and therefore cannot be killed using codekillall Spotlight/code.  <answer74578> TinkerTool also allows you to change this preference via a GUI (rather than a Terminal command). It's under Applications  Spotlight:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/268Fv.png" alt=""  Note that you will have to log out and back in for the changes to take effect.  <comment86592> Just start Chrome via Spotlight a few times and it should move to the top again. <comment86605> Thanks for the clarifications in the edit comment, I've included them in the answer now to avoid further re-edits of this part.
