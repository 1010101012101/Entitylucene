Manually deleted backups on Time Capsule w/ Mavericks, but can't empty the trash - it keeps deleting then re-creating files <body> I followed the advice here on how to delete old backups on Time Capsule using Mavericks: How can I manually delete old backups to free space for Time Machine?. But when I then try to empty the trash, Finder counts up the number of files to delete, starts deleting them all, then, once it reaches zero, it starts counting the files as negative again....as if they are returning....I have tried several times. Anyone know what is happening?   <comment148645> I have seen the item count go negative to the hundreds of thousands all the time and even seen it top several tens of million and still complete. Are you interrupting the clean up process or letting the trash empty complete no matter how long it takes and how ridiculous the "remaining work" queue looks while the delete is happening?
