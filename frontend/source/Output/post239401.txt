Windows repositioned to macbook screen after sleep <body> I have a MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2015, OS X El Capitan, 10.11.5) with Intel Iris Pro 1536 MB connected to an external monitor:  Samsung SE790C:  ul liResolution: 3440 x 1440 @ 60 Hz/li liPixel Depth: 32-Bit Color (ARGB8888)/li liMirror: Off/li liOnline: Yes/li liRotation: Supported/li liConnection Type: DisplayPort/li liTelevision: Yes/li /ul  Every time my MacBook wakes up from sleep, all my windows are back to the MacBook screen. I have a similar setup at home (same MacBook but with a Dell 26' monitor) and this does strongnot/strong happen.  Anything I can do about that? If more info is needed, just let me know! Thanks in advance for any help on that!  <answer239432> I found the answer after pulling my hair for a few days...  I actually had to tick the "Displays have separate Spaces" option in System Preferences = Mission Control  Does this setting depend on the monitor that is plugged in? I would suppose the answer is yes, otherwise it would not work with my home monitor... To be tested and confirmed!
