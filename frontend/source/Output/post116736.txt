Run .command with input at runtime <body> I need to run a .command file with input at runtime, but I want to run via double click, not from terminal.  I have a file codeadbInstall.command/code file with this code  precodeadb install /Directory/$1.apk /code/pre  From terminal, I can do codeadbInstall.command fileName/code and it will properly run codeadb install /Directory/fileName.apk/code  How can I input codefileName/code whilst double clicking on adbInstall.command instead of running it from terminal?  <answer116739> Using strongAutomator.app/strong:  ol liOpen strongAutomator/strong and create a new strongWork Flow/strong/li liGo to strongActions / Library / Text/strong/li liChoose emAsk for Text/em and enable the emRequire an answer/em checkbox./li liGo to strongLibrary / Utilities/strong/li liChoose emRun Shell Script/em/li liSelect strongas arguments/strong on the empass input:/em drop down. /li liType codeadb install /Directory/$1.apk/code as the actual script./li liSave as strongApplication/strong. /li /ol  Now you'll have a clicable file which will ask for the parameter for the script.  <answer116828> You could create your .command with something such as:  precode#!/bin/bash  if [ -n "$1" ] then   thefile=$1 else     read -p 'enter filename: ' thefile fi   echo "filename is:" $thefile  adb install /Directory/$thefile.apk  echo "done." /code/pre  <comment136590> Thanks for your help. In case somebody else runs across it, I had a bash profile setup, so I also had to add `source ~/.bash_profile` to the script before the `adb` line.
