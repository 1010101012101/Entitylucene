Whats the last OS X that supported Power PC? <body> I still have an old Power PC machine and was wondering what the latest OS X build I can install on it?  <answer1310> 10.5 Leopard is the last to support PowerPC as far as I know:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_X  <answer1311>    snow leopard (OS X 10.6) is also the   first Mac OS release since the   introduction of System 7.1.2 that   does not support the PowerPC   architecture, as Apple now intends to   focus on its current line of   Intel-based products.   Thus OSX supported PowerPC upto and including version 10.5  (Leopard)  <answer126648> Snow leopard does support PowerPC applications, this function was dropped with Lion. I base this on one MacBook with Snow Leopard on it works fine with Microsoft Office X, Quake II (OS XVersion), Halo, Roxio Toast Lite 5.2.2.   However on my upgrade MacBook running Lion they are tomb stoned and when you try to run them the message you receive is PowerPcC no longer supported!  <comment1119> Thanks for the tag edit.  I did not have the mojo to add a new tag!  Darn you Dr. Evil! <comment148370> OS X running on PowerPC *hardware* and OS X supporting PowerPC applications is not the same thing.
