Gmail shortcut for open spelling corrections hides window - any way to fix? <body> The gmail shortcuts list says to "Open spelling suggestions" you press Command-M, but that minimizes the Google Chrome window for me. Any way to get a workable shortcut for this?  <answer268917> As Chrome has an actual Minimise key command, you can change it to be something different  strongBefore/strongbr img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0T2mF.png" alt="enter image description here"  System Prefs  Keyboard  Shortcuts  App Shortcutsbr Hit + then set the app to Google Chrome, menu item to Minimise &amp; the key to something you don't use anywhere else    img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fhRMh.png" alt="enter image description here"  That should free up kbd Cmd ⌘ /kbd kbd M /kbd just for Chrome, yet it will still function correctly elsewhere.  strongAfter/strong  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/h5oKa.png" alt="enter image description here"  Note it adds an kbd Opt ⌥ /kbd version for Minimise All, which tends to be a common side effect of doing this type of replacement.  <comment337752> Did you test Ctrl/M or Cmd/Shift/M [sometimes they work as alternatives] <comment337754> @Tetsujin I did test Ctrl/M before. Just tried Cmd/Shift/M and that is activating a Fantastical widget for me, with no preference to turn off. So not sure if that would otherwise do it for me in gmail. <comment337755> OK, then posting an answer... <comment337779> Thanks, that took away the minimize problem, but now Cmd-M does nothing. Unlike the gmail shortcuts page says, it doesn't bring up spelling corrections widget. <comment337781> ahhh... that might be one to ask Gmail then. Sorry, it's not something i use.
