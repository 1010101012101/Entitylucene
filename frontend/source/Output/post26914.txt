how to delete characters placed next to cursor on MacBook Pro <body> I have recently shifted from PC to Mac and from what I recall on PC keyboards, there are keys where you can delete characters placed before your cursor as well as after cursor. I don't recall what the later is called.  I can't find something equivalent for Mac to delete post cursor characters.  <answer26915> For forward delete, hold down kbdfn/kbd (the function key) and press delete.  <answer26916> Laptop keyboards and Apple Wireless Keyboards use kbdfn/kbd+kbddelete ⌫/kbd for forward delete. Keyboards with a numeric keypad have a separate kbddelete ⌦/kbd key like on other platforms.  <comment30773> Mac delete = backspace on other platforms, Mac forward delete = delete on other platforms. <comment30774> If the topic starter is trying to "delete" something after the cursor, this is the way to do it.
