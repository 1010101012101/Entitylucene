Game Center Data - Delete <body> I played a game on my old iPhone and connected Game Center to it.    I then got a new phone and played the same game (started over), but its not connected to Game Center. I am about to upgrade again and want to migrate the current game data onto Game Center and then to the new phone but am scared that when I connect game center to my current phone the old data will overwrite what I have currently been doing on the game.  I have spent a lot of money on the game and do not want to lose the current data saved on the phone.  How do I delete all data off of Game Center (I still have my old phone) and then have the new phone connect to Game Center so that I can save the data on the new phone for migration purposes?
