How to make /private/etc/hosts available on macOS Sierra? <body> After searching related questions and answers, I find my issue still unsolved: editing strong/private/etc/hosts/strong does not work on strongmacOS Sierra/strong.  What in my /private/etc/hosts is the following two rules.  precode127.0.0.1   localhost 127.0.0.1   www.yahoo.com /code/pre  These two rules cannot be applied in Safari and Chrome, even after running the command codesudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder/code. The website yahoo is not redirected to 127.0.0.1.  So what do I miss in the above operation?  And the output of codeping -c 3 www.yahoo.com/code is as following.  precodePING fd-fp3.wg1.b.yahoo.com (116.214.12.74): 56 data bytes 64 bytes from 116.214.12.74: icmp_seq=0 ttl=47 time=138.418 ms 64 bytes from 116.214.12.74: icmp_seq=1 ttl=47 time=74.284 ms 64 bytes from 116.214.12.74: icmp_seq=2 ttl=47 time=69.702 ms  --- fd-fp3.wg1.b.yahoo.com ping statistics --- 3 packets transmitted, 3 packets received, 0.0% packet loss round-trip min/avg/max/stddev = 69.702/94.135/138.418/31.369 ms /code/pre  <answer271940> If you can ping your /etc/hosts entries as root but not as regular user then try changing permissions on the hosts file to allow everyone to read. This worked for me.  precodesudo chmod a+r /etc/hosts /code/pre  <comment336573> Add `127.0.0.1 qwertyuiop` and try accessing `qwertyuiop` from the browsers and ping to determine if it's a priority/cache problem or the file is ignored completely. <comment336575> @techraf I update /private/etc/hosts according to your suggestion, but cannot visit `qwertyuiop` in browsers. The output of `ping qwertyuiop` is like this: `PING qwertyuiop.dhcp (218.205.57.154): 56 data bytes` and `Request timeout for icmp_seq 0`. It looks like that `127.0.0.1` is redirected to `218.205.57.154`. <comment336583> @waleking Please check the file /etc/hosts with `ls -la /etc/hosts`. It should show something like this: `-rw-r--r--  1 root  wheel  - 214 29 Aug 22:30 /etc/hosts` (with a different size - here 214 bytes - and date of course). If the file doesn't exist or can't be found, a suffix was added probably... <comment336594> @klanomath yes, the output shows the file `/etc/hosts` exists: `-rw-r-----  1 root  wheel  71 Jan 10 13:50 /etc/hosts`. But this file does not work. <comment344494> Yes, it works for me after I use your command and reboot my mac. Thanks so much, it puzzled me for a long time.
