Sharing my VPN connection on macOS Sierra via WiFi <body> Using MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Mid 2014) with macOS Sierra 10.12.5 (16F73), I have a VPN connection through Pulse Secure on my WiFi, and I would like to share it with my mobile device, so I got a D-Link DWA-131 Nano USB WiFi adapter, and tried to connect through the new adapter to VPN, whilst sharing the connection through AirPort WiFi using Internet Sharing.  The sharing works, internet works, but VPN is not shared, only internet connection, so I tried to share my VPN using codepfctl/code but with no luck, I've done it before through Ethernet, but I'm not able to do it through WiFi.  Here's what I do:  precode# sysctl -w net.inet.ip.forwarding=1 # sysctl -w net.inet.ip.fw.enable=1 (this generates sysctl: unknown oid 'net.inet.ip.fw.enable', no idea what is needed) # pfctl -d # pfctl -f nat-rules -e /code/pre  My codenat-rules/code file contains:  precodenat on utun1 from en0:network to any -&gt; (utun1) /code/pre  This is the only rule, it worked before when I was forwarding VPN from Ethernet to WiFi (different BSD device names of course).  Have you tried such thing before? It seems that the main problem is around creating a WiFi network without Internet Sharing, which doesn't seem to be possible   <answer286851> As a test, I'd try setting things up totally from the macOS GUI rather than using Terminal. You may already know how to do this, but broadly the steps would be:  ol liConnect your Mac to the internet via your Pulse Secure/li liSet up your VPN connection in System Preferences  Network/li liClick on the kbdAdvanced.../kbd button/li liEnsure you tick the emSend all traffic over VPN connection/em checkbox/li liClick kbdOK/kbd/li liEnsure you also tick the checkbox for emShow VPN status in menu bar/em/li liNow go to System Preferences  Sharing/li liHighlight (but do not tick) the Internet Sharing service in the lefthand pane/li liOn the righthand side, select the VPN connection you created at Step 2 from the emShare your connection from/em drop-down menu/li liNow select the Nano USB Wi-Fi port (i.e. tick the checkbox)/li liClick on the kbdWi-Fi Options.../kbd button/li liGive your new Wi-Fi network a name, password etc/li liClick kbdOK/kbd/li liNow tick the Internet Sharing service in the lefthand pane/li /ol  Now test this to confirm that whenever your Mac is connected to the VPN, it will share the connection via the Nano USB Wi-Fi. This means you should be able to connect your mobile device to the new Wi-Fi network you created at Step 12. To do this, follow the steps below.  strongUsing the VPN connection/strong  To make this work with your mobile device:  ol liOn the Mac, click on the new VPN Status icon in the menu bar/li liSelect the Connect option pertaining to the VPN connection created previously/li liOnce the connection is established, your Mac should start sharing the VPN via the Nano USB Wi-Fi/li liNow go to your mobile device and connect it to this Wi-Fi network/li /ol  <comment362085> Thanks for the well written answer, the problem is though that Pulse Secure VPN is a standalone app, I had already tried to connect to the VPN from Mac Network Preferences, I will try to find if someone in my company was able to do it that way.
