How to extend the functionality of Open and Save dialogs of OS X applications? <body> On Windows there are several third-party applications that can be used to improve the standard Open and Save dialogs.  I am looking for features like:  ul liBeing able to delete files from the these dialogs./li liBeing able to move files./li liRemember dialog size or common directories per application (not all apps are able to do things like this)./li /ul  If the solutions are commercial, please mention the price.  <answer50407> Step one - try the free trial of DefaultFolderX (30$).  Step two - buy it.  These is no step three. It's that good.   <comment57825> I was just going to post the same. It's been around for many years and never caused grief. Great piece of UI extension. <comment57826> I understand the desire to know prices, but they change so why not just link to the software. <comment57848> @bmike product feautures can also change (even more often than price) - the whole point is to give good answers, clicking links and trying each product is a time wasting. Thats's the beauti of a wiki, if it get's outdated, someone will update it. <comment68049> @bmike, does DefaultFolderX suffice all features required? <comment68110> It suffices for the three functions mentioned, but does much more than the OP has asked.
