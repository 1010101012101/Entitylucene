Itunes smart Playlist with reference to Apple Music favorites won't sync to Iphone <body> I have created a Playlist (pl1) and favorited some of the tracks in it. But because I want to filter (the heart symbol in Apple Music) strongonly the tracks which are favorited from pl1/strong I created a smart playlist with following settings:  ul licontained in strongpl1/strong emAND/em/li limarked as strongfavorite/strong/li /ul  My Problem now is that the new smart playlist won't sync over to my iPhone... pl1 and the favorites sync normally and even the favorited tracks from pl1 show up in favorites on the iPhone but as I said the smart playlist won't show up.  I tried the following:  ol liRestart the iPhone/li liRe-Enable Apple Music/li liRelogging from icloud/li liRecreating both pl1 and the smart playlist/li /ol  I also found these two questions:  ul liITunes Match: syncing smart playlists that reference other playlists/li liiTunes smart playlist not syncing to iPhone/li /ul  But the first one is about itunes match and the second one said that it worked again after some time  <answer244228> Unfortunately you are not able to sync Smart Playlists that contain a rule referencing another playlist with Apple Music tracks.  In some cases you may be able to get around this by making a normal playlist and putting Smart Playlists in that (for example my top 100 played tracks strongand/strong my Loved tracks), but as you are trying to get just the intersection that wouldn't work.  Can only suggest giving Apple feedback at:  ul lihttp://www.apple.com/feedback/itunesapp.html/li lihttp://www.apple.com/feedback/apple-music.html/li /ul
