Reinstall Numbers? <body> I got myself into a state where App Store says that I have numbers "installed" but in fact I don't have it installed. I tried the recommended option/click and shift/click over the installed button and it didn't work. Can you give me a tip?  <answer117113> Try resetting the Mac App Store.  ol liEnable the debug menu and restart the Mac App Store.  precodedefaults write com.apple.appstore ShowDebugMenu -bool true /code/pre/li liChoose the strongReset Application/strong option.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/73M8S.png" height="356" alt="App Store Debug Menu"/li /ol  <comment136895> Sounded promising... but didn't seem to help. It still says "installed". How does it decide that it's installed? Because I can't find a numbers.app file or directory...
