Creating a URL that always opens in Chrome <body> If I want to ensure a URL, if clicked, will always open in Chrome (instead of the default browser) can I do that by modifying the header?  For example, I can get URLs that always open in Evernote, they start with evernote:///   Is this possible, for example to have something like chrome:///www.url.com  <answer142836> On iOS:  precodegooglechrome://www.example.com /code/pre  <answer142844> Google has official documentation on the Chrome iOS app’s URI scheme on its developer website.  Simply replace codehttp/code with codegooglechrome/code and codehttps/code with codegooglechromes/code. This means:  ul licodehttp://www.google.com//code becomes strongcodegooglechrome://www.google.com//code/strong/li licodehttps://apple.stackexchange.com//code becomes strongcodegooglechromes://apple.stackexchange.com//code/strong/li /ul  Previously, it supported an x-callback-url of codegooglechrome-x-callback:///code. This allowed the calling app to indicate its name and URI scheme to Chrome, which would show a back button in the address bar that closes the tab and invokes the specified URI. This feature was removed a few years ago when iOS 9 added the “Back to …” button in the status bar (but the URI scheme still works).  <answer290891> The easiest way to do this I found is:  ol liRight Click the Desktop and choose new, then Shortcut /li liHave it find C:\Program Files (x86)\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe /li liGive it whatever name you want then close the newly made icon/li liFind the URL you want to open and copy it.  /li liRight click the new Icon and Click properties/li liOn the tab, paste the URL in the TARGET: box  after the words "C:\Program Files (x86)\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe" and leave a space in between  /li liHit Ok  /li /ol  <comment168265> That may work on iOS—I don't have Chrome on my iPhone—but it does not work for me on Mavericks. <comment168268> I was about to say the same. How are you proposing this should work. Firstly on Mavericks if you click a link with this protocol or go to it in a web address. The OS asks you to select an app that can open it. Even when Chrome is selected chrome will try and open the URL `file:///googlechrome:///www.example.com` each time <comment168269> @markhunte OP did not specify OS X or iOS, I've clarified that this is just for iOS <comment168270> @GeorgeGarside Cheers saved me wasting more time trying to figure it out. <comment168322> That part of the url is referred to as the "protocol" <comment374158> Note that this doesn't apply to Chrome for Mac.
