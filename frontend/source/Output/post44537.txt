ethtool Equivalent for OS X Lion <body> Other than ifconfig, is there an app/script for OS X Lion that produces similar output/info to ethtool?  Specifically, I would like to be able to query the following:  ul lidriver info/li lionline/offline/li lispeed/li liduplex/li /ul  Output from ethtool looks like this:  precodeajc@ajc-3] sudo ethtool eth0|grep Duplex                                                                                                                                                    ~     Duplex: Full ajc@ajc-3] sudo ethtool eth0|grep Speed                                                                                                                                                     ~     Speed: 100Mb/s ajc@ajc-3] sudo ethtool eth0|grep Link                                                                                                                                                      ~     Link detected: yes ajc@ajc-3] sudo ethtool -i eth0                                                                                                                                                             ~ driver: pcnet32 version: 1.32 firmware-version:  bus-info: 0000:00:03.0 /code/pre  <answer44548> My primary tools for reading OSX details on hardware are codesystem_profiler/code and codeioreg/code. For network interface details, codeifconfig/code is the best bet. The first two will show you connection paths for the hardware as well as software driver information. In your example - media and status provide most of the details you listed.  precodemac:~ me$ ifconfig en0   en0: flags=8863&lt;UP,BROADCAST,SMART,RUNNING,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST&gt; mtu 1500     options=2b&lt;RXCSUM,TXCSUM,VLAN_HWTAGGING,TSO4&gt;     ether 00:1b:63:a8:33:33      inet6 fe80::21b:63ff:fea8:3333%en0 prefixlen 64 scopeid 0x4      inet 172.16.1.8 netmask 0xffffff00 broadcast 172.16.1.255     media: autoselect (100baseTX &lt;full-duplex,flow-control&gt;)     status: active  mac:~ me$ system_profiler|awk '/^Ethernet Cards/{c=15;next}c--&gt;0'          ethernet:            Type: Ethernet Controller           Bus: PCI           Vendor ID: 0x10de           Device ID: 0x0ab0           Subsystem Vendor ID: 0x10de           Subsystem ID: 0xcb79           Revision ID: 0x00b1           BSD name: en0           Kext name: nvenet.kext           Location: /System/Library/Extensions/IONetworkingFamily.kext/Contents/PlugIns/nvenet.kext           Version: 2.0.17 /code/pre  In your case, you are grepping for Duplex, Speed and Link and on Mac hardware you can get all of that data from codeifconfig en0 | egrep [media|status]/code as desired.  <answer45611> Maybe networksetup can give you some information you're looking for:  precodenetworksetup -getinfo Ethernet networksetup -getmedia Ethernet /code/pre     NETWORKSETUP(8)           BSD System Manager's Manual          NETWORKSETUP(8)      NAME        networksetup -- configuration tool for network settings in System Preferences.   But it's not really lean and may give you less information than ifconfig  <answer45619> I would mix both ifconfig and networksetup:  ifconfig:     alex@smiley:~|⇒  ifconfig en0 | grep status      status: active   Then networkstatus     alex@smiley:~|⇒  networksetup -getinfo "Ethernet Adaptor (en0)"       DHCP Configuration      IP address: 192.168.1.11      Subnet mask: 255.255.255.0      Router: 192.168.1.1      Client ID:        IPv6: Automatic IPv6       IP address: none      IPv6 Router: none       Ethernet Address: 1c:6f:65:98:de:81   Grep out whichever lines from both tools that you want. Would be easy enough to combine the various lines into a simple script to output all the information together.  <comment50639> Information about the features you're looking for would be helpful.

I'd rather avoid that if possible...I wonder if there's something networking-focused? <comment52039> I disagree with this comment, you can easily replicate the suggested output of `ethtool` simply by adding a grep statement in the same way you did.  `ifconfig en0 | grep Media:` supplies the same details as the first 3 of your ethtool outputs in a single command and without any extraneous information. <comment52060> The only difference remaining is that macs list autoselect and the negotiated link speed and don't simply report just the link speed. Piping output to awk and cut can help there is desired. <comment52863> @stuffe - the "two commands" to which my comment refers were system_profiler and ioreg.  i agree that ifconfig is less resource-intensive. <comment283003> bash-3.2$ networksetup -getinfo Ethernet Ethernet is not a recognized network service. ** Error: The parameters were not valid.
