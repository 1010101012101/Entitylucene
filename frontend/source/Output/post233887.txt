Where is the local Google Drive folder? <body> all.  I need to find the local directory for Google Drive. So far, all I see is the "virtual" folder in the sidebar.  I'm trying to do network transfers, but it won't recognize the sidebar folder.  <answer233888> The Google Drive physical folder seems to be located in code~/Google Drive/code.  You should be able to just go to your home folder and see it there.  If for some reason it is hidden, you can always get there by going to a finder window, pressing Command-Shift-G and then typing in code~/Google Drive/code in the popup window.  <answer233889> Zumi, it looks like it stores the local directory under the User folder.  So for the user 'maclover' it would be at /Users/maclover/Google Drive (or Google\ Drive because of the space).  JW
