Disable iPad Passcode access to students <body> Our school system uses 100's of iPads.  Occasionally students start locking them with the Passcode which take a great deal of time to set back up for use.  I'm interested to see if there is a way to remove passcode access all together so they can not even access the settings.  Is this possible?  <comment220855> Your schools Apple for Education IT staff are the people in control. You need to consult that staff, they have many controls that are not available otherwise.  I don't specifically know if that is one of them.
