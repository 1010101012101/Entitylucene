Network Folder Removed from Sidebar if Clicked and Not connected to Network <body> If I don't connect to the network (at work properly) and try to click on a sidebar icon to a folder on the network, the folder gets removed from the sidebar.  Is there any way to make these to remain in the sidebar, even if the network resource isn't available. I'm constantly rebuilding my favorites sidebar!
