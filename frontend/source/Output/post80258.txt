play order in the iPhone Music app <body> iPhone 4 running iOS 6.0.1.  I have Settings - Music - Shake to Shuffle turned off.  Without tapping the shuffle icon, if I select the first track on an album or a playlist, Music emwill not/em run through those tracks in start-to-finish order. It's always randomized in some way.  Needless to say, this makes listening to a "live" album fairly distracting...  Google has been no help, and other questions here get as far as "close, but not quite."  Am I missing a setting, somewhere?  <comment92604> So the shuffle icon is *not* orange? Maybe you could post a screen shot? Can you play any album with the tracks ordered correctly? <comment92746> The shuffle icon is grey/blue. So far, no album/playlist has played in order.
