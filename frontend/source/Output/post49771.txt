Is there a way to use a Finder hot key to open a folder in TextMate? <body> I have setup a System Preferences - Keyboard - Keyboard Shortcuts - Services item to allow me to use a hotkey to "Open in TextMate". It works fine on files, but does not work on folders.   If I Control+Click on the same folder, select "Services" from the pop-up menu and choose "Open in TextMate" the folder is opened as a project in TextMate. This is exactly what I'm looking for. Is there a way to setup a shortcut to have the same open folder as project behavior as the Control+Click method?  <answer49773> Looks like you can do this with a piece of software called Shortcuts.  <answer49780> I think that's a bug with Finder. Services that receive folders as input don't seem to be listed in the Services menu when folders are selected (but it only applies to column view; they are listed in other view modes).  In any case, one alternative would be to just use an AppleScript without wrapping it as a service. You can give it an app-specific shortcut with FastScripts.  precodetry     tell application "Finder"         open (get selection) using path to application "TextMate"     end tell end try /code/pre  <answer49795> After seeing @Lri's answer I discovered that my original service would work in the Finder as long as I wasn't in column view. Since that's the view that I use most of the time, I decided to see if I could get @Lir's basic solution working without the need for an external application. Here's what I did:  ol liOpen Automator and choose "Service" from the options of what to make./li liSet "Service receives" to "no input" and "in" to "Finder.app". /li liDrop a "Run AppleScript" action onto the main window. /li liDrop the code @Lri provided into place so you end up with:  precodeon run {input, parameters}      try         tell application "Finder"         open (get selection) using path to application "TextMate"         end tell     end try      return input end run /code/pre  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fr8lD.png" alt="enter image description here"/li liSave the action as "Open via TextMate"./li liUnder "System Preferences" - "Keyboard" - "Keyboard Shortcuts" - "Services" - "General" add my preferred shortcut to the "Open vie TextMate" item.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/BQLgb.png" alt="enter image description here"/li /ol  This works in all my Finder views (including column view) for Mac OS X 10.7.3 and TextMate 1.5.10.   <comment57024> After seeing @Lri's answer I did a little more investigation. The keyboard shortcut did work for folder in any view *other than column view* in the Finder. I don't know if it's a bug or an intentional change, but I've seen multiple reports of the problem. <comment57025> It does seem to be a bug in Lion's version of the Finder. The original shortcut I setup works in the other three Finder views that aren't column view.
