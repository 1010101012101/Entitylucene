Can't Read Font on 2560x1080 Late 2009 Mac Mini Connected Using Dual Link DVI <body> I have a late 2009 Mac Mini Server connected to an LG 29UM58 21:9 29 inch ultrawide. The native resolution for the monitor is 2560x1080. I have the Mac Mini connected to the monitor using the Apple Dual Link DVI adapter. The specs for the Mac Mini state the highest resolution supported is 2560x1080 using a dual link DVI adapter. When the resolution is set to 1920x1080 everything looks fine except it is a little stretched because it is not the native resolution. When I set the resolution to 2560x1080 everything becomes pixellated and has very jagged edges like there is no anti-aliasing. It's so bad I can't even read text. I have a photo to show the difference: http://imgur.com/a/2oFPg and the issue is not the quality of the photo I took. Is there anyway to fix this?
