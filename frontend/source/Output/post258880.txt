Incomplete formatting <body> I'm trying to format my Macbook Air mid 2011.  I restarted my macbook, and then held down the Command (⌘) and R keys while the computer restarted. It was going great until it froze a bit before reaching the middle and after 15 minutes of continuously holding Command+R, I stopped holding it. It then proceeded to continue on going but got stuck again midway.   I've done it again a couple of times but it keeps freezing in the middle. I haven't even reached yet the “Disk Utility” step.   Can anyone tell me what's going on?  <comment323733> It is trying to boot over the internet. You should se a spinning globe, when you see that icon, you can release the keys. It all depends upon your internet connection, are you using wifi or usb-ethernet? <comment323734> im using wifi. would ethernet be better? <comment323741> Depends on the wifi, but most likely the answer is yes, it would be better to do a internet recovery boot with ethernet. <comment323818> You could try using the computer's internal recovery partition. Hold down "r" at boot (without the "command")
