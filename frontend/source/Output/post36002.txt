How can I open a new Finder window on every click on the Finder Icon? <body> is there anywhere a script or a workaround, or even just a .plist file, where i can manage to open a new finder window by clicking on the finder icon in the dock?  When a Finder window is already open, a click on the Finder icon just shows me the opened window, but doesn't open a new one.  Can anyone help?  <answer36013> This behaviour happens beacuse the dock just launches an app. Finder is classified as an app, so it will open/show the app window, you will need to open a new window within the app.  You can use the keyboard short cut CMD + N, and if you are not in the app press CMD + Tab to open it first.  You could possibly try using Quicksilver, which makes custom keystrokes, so you could assign O to opening a new finder window  <answer36034> You can do this using Hyperdock.  I do this for most of my software (Finder, Terminal, Chrome, etc...). Clicking on the application icon sends the application a codeCommand + N/code.   It's non-free though.
