Cannot SSH Ubuntu server <body> I am trying to SSH an Ubuntu server from my MacBook Pro (OSX Sierra). I systematically get an "Operation timeout", and I have run out of things to try (based on online searches).   I can ping the server, and the output of codenmap -Pn -p22 server_name/code is:  precodeStarting Nmap 7.60 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2017-08-16 20:04 BST Nmap scan report for server_name (server_addr) Host is up.  PORT   STATE    SERVICE 22/tcp filtered ssh  Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 2.04 seconds /code/pre  Here is the output of code/usr/bin/ssh -vv user@server_name/code:  precodeOpenSSH_7.4p1, LibreSSL 2.5.0 debug1: Reading configuration data /etc/ssh/ssh_config debug1: /etc/ssh/ssh_config line 53: Applying options for * debug2: resolving "server_name" port 22 debug2: ssh_connect_direct: needpriv 0 debug1: Connecting to server_name [server_addr] port 22. debug1: connect to address server_addr port 22: Operation timed out ssh: connect to host server_name port 22: Operation timed out /code/pre  (line 53 in code/etc/ssh/ssh_config/code is simply codeHost */code). Same result with of code/usr/local/bin/ssh -vv user@server_name/code (the version installed with Homebrew):  precodeOpenSSH_7.5p1, OpenSSL 1.0.2l  25 May 2017 debug1: Reading configuration data /usr/local/etc/ssh/ssh_config debug2: resolving "server_name" port 22 debug2: ssh_connect_direct: needpriv 0 debug1: Connecting to server_name [server_addr] port 22. /code/pre  A colleague of mine with an older MacBook Pro has no problem connecting to that machine. His version of ssh is codeOpenSSH_6.9p1, LibreSSL 2.1.8/code and I am trying with the same network cable as his. I have no idea what's going wrong!  This post mentioned something about a location setting being wrong if set to codeAutomatic/code (afaik?), but I don't know what this corresponds to. Any help very greatly appreciated!  <comment372998> What is the result of using the default `ssh` that came with macOS?  `/usr/bin/ssh -vv user@server_name`  Please post the results <comment373012> @Allan Thanks for your comment, please see the updated post. Both outputs are essentially identical. My firewall is enabled. <comment373016> @Allan I just disabled the firewall and opened a new terminal, same result with both versions. <comment373017> @Allan I can't remember where it was, but I read an old post that mentioned today's usual key-size (RSA 4k is that right?) could not be processed by older SSH servers. Do you have a take on this? Is there a way to try different-sized SSH keys? <comment373019> Let us [continue this discussion in chat](http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/63952/discussion-between-allan-and-sheljohn). <comment373023> @Sheljohn Please add the Ubuntu Server and its openssh version
