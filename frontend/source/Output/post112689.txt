USB Mighty Mouse odd behaviour <body> I am having an issue with my mouse, it seems to slow down by about 50% when the cursor gets to a button or something clickable.  Dose any one know what this issue might be?  I have plugged in a wireless Microsoft mouse and its not displaying the same issue.  <answer112917> Ok this is how I sorted the issue out.  So apparently this is a system feature.  I installed a application called Steermouse found here.  The application has a option to disable this feature.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ut44h.jpg" alt="enter image description here"
