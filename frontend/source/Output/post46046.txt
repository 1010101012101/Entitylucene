Is there a keyboard shortcut to move the position of the Dock? <body> Can I move the Dock using a keyboard shortcut?   If there is no default keyboard shortcut, is it possible to set this up using a program?  <answer46048> There's no default, but you could probably use AppleScript to accomplish this.  Hmm...  h1EDIT:/h1  Make an AppleScript to run this shell script:   precodedefaults write com.apple.Dock orientation -string left;killall Dock /code/pre  <comment52529> I'm in the 'extreme idiot' category with regard to AppleScript. What would such a script look like? <comment52531> Yep: create an AppleScript to run shell script:     defaults write com.apple.Dock orientation -string left;killall Dock ...then use the Keyboard system preferences, or your favorite launcher app such as the awesome Quicksilver, to assign a keyboard shortcut. <comment52534> macscripter.net is a good starting point for learning AS.  opening the Terminal and trying: defaults read com.apple.Dock will help you start to learn what the preferences are and how to manipulate them.
