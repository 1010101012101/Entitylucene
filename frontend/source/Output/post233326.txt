How to connect Profile Manager to LDAP <body> I'm trying to setup a MDM solution using Profile Manager on OS X Server on El Captian. It works so far with local users.   Now, I want to open this up for all the users of an ActiveDirectory server. I want to use the LDAP global catalog (port 3268) from AD for the relevant data. (This kind of AD connection works so far with a Mobile Iron instance and other different services).   Thus, I've tried to add it as an LDAPv3 server using the Directory Utility, but I can't get it to work. Connecting to the AD via ldapsearch on the Terminal is working perfectly, but I fail integrating this in the proper tools.   So far I was unable to find any helpful tutorial on the web, as most of the scenarios on connecting Macs to AD want to completely bind a Mac into a AD - which I explicitly don't want to do, as for the purpose of working as a MDM for mobile devices, it needs to be accessible from the Internet, so I want to have the minimal possible link to any internal services.   Any ideas?
