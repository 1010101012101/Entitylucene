Prohibition Sign after restoring backup from Time Machine - MacOS Sierra <body> I've just formatted my Macbook Pro Retina 2012 running Sierra and I was trying to restore from my previous backup made it successfully yesterday.  When I switch my laptop on now, after half of the loading bar it shows a "prohibition sign".   Really don't know what to do, I tried to follow few guides online but nothing worked. I've tried to reboot holding Cmd+Option+R+P and I had the same issue again. I've tried to boot in Recovery mode Cmd+Option+R, checking the HD, everything was fine, same issue again.  I can't believe that my SSD is malfunctioning because I never had any kind of issue.  Really appreciate your help!   <comment336071> Try booting into Safe mode, hold shift at the chimes
