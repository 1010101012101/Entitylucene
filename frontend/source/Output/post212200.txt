What are the different internet connection types used by ifconfig and ipconfig? <body> Typing codeifconfig/code on the command line gives me listings for several devices. I've seen at least the following ones:   ul licodelo0/code/li licodegif0/code/li licodestf0/code/li licodeen0/code/li licodeen1/code/li licodeen2/code/li licodeen3/code/li licodep2p0/code/li licodeawdl0/code/li licodebridge0/code/li /ul  What specifically do each of them refer to? I know codeen0/code is a wireless connection, codeen3/code is a connection using a Thunderbolt-to-ethernet adapter, and codeen1/code is an ordinary ethernet connection. What about the rest?   <answer212202> These are properly known as BSD names, so you can look at the BSD / Darwin source code to see what these mean.   ul licodeen/code is Ethernet/li licodelo/code is loop back or local host /li licodeawdl/code is air drop peer to peer (a type of mesh network)/li licodebridge/code is a connection between networks /li licodep2p/code is sometimes a virtualization link and also some people have reported it being used with AirDrop before that changed to be codeawdl0/code/li /ul  The numbers added to the end just increment as you add a second interface of the same type. The rest are tunneling interfaces for VPN and bridging between IPv4 and IPv6:  ul lisee Ian's answer on question Unexpected interfaces in ifconfig/li /ul  <comment256214> If your first discovered network interface is WiFi, en0 would be wireless, but Macs with physical wired Ethernet have en0 as wired in most cases. <comment256218> Not all `en` refer to a wired ethernet connection. Are wireless connections considered a form of ethernet? (If so, how?) <comment256220> @jvriesem The media section will let you know if an Ethernet connection uses wired connections in most cases (and which flavor)  - the `en` tag commingles both wired and wireless hardware.
