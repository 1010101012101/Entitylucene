Skype stuck on "Signing in" window <body> After upgrading OSX to Yosemite and Skype to 7.7 (335), Skype gets stuck on "Signing in..." when starting.   It does sign in, as kbdContacts  Add Contact/kbd forces the main window to open, but "Signing in..." never goes away.  Already tried, but didn't work:  ul liSigning out, quitting ("Signing in..." stays even when signed out), then signing back in./li liEverything on the Skype support page for Why can't I sign in to Skype for Mac OS X?./li liRemoving code~/Library/Application Support/Skype/code./li liReinstalling Skype/li /ul  I'm using my Microsoft ID to sign in.  Any clues?  hr  Following the @Buscar advice I used codenettop/code in terminal to monitor Skype connections.  After quitting Skype, I see 3 connections still there about 20 seconds after quitting. Two of them use port 443 (status LastAck and FinWait1), the other is on a high port (12k+), status FinWait1. Last one to go away is to blu403-m.hotmail.com:443 with status FinWait1.   <answer187335> The following procedure seems to have solved the problem:  ol liSign out from Skype/li liQuit Skype and wait until all connections listed in codenettop/code are cleared/li liOpen Skype/li liChoose "Sign in with a different account" from the Microsoft ID login screen./li liTry to sign in with Skype Name (but fail, since I can't do that anymore after I linked my Skype account to my MS account)./li liGo back and sign in with my Microsoft ID./li /ol  The "Signing in..." window was displayed for a few seconds, then the home window opened normally. Problem solved. I'm guessing steps 4-6 solved the issue, but I have no idea why.  <answer234182> At some point skype on my office mac was unable to connect. After trying all the mentioned solutions (update, re-install, delete all preferences files) the problem was still there. On other PC/Mac/Phone I was able to connect.  After some investigation I found that on my office mac I had a public IP address and a secondary private IP address (non routable; like 10.xx.xx.xx) for internal use. Looking at the skype network activity I discovered it used both address.  strongAfter disabling the private address it started to work again./strong  Beware: if you are connected to internet through a modem router (wifi or cabled) your router is doing NAT and so you have a private address that is routed to the public network and so your case is different from mine.  PS Solved the connection problem, if I re-enable the private address, skype is able to work and even to login. emReally a nice piece of software!/em  <comment221416> That is good enough for me a + <comment305487> `ifconfig` to show the IP addresses that you have, then something like `sudo ifconfig en0 delete 10.0.0.1` to delete the one that is wrong.  I had a bad address from a previous VPN connection, and as soon as I deleted it, Skype could connect again. <comment308710> Voting this answer up. I had the same problem and I fixed it by disabling a secondary IP address I had on the same network interface. On OSX it's called Virtual Interface. After that Skype could log in normally
