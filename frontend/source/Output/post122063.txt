Can't see the image or movie file dimensions in Finder <body> I can't see the image or movie file dimensions in the Finder when browsing files on a server. Local files are shown as usual; it's just when I pick a file on the company server that the dimensions are not shown.  The screen shot below shows the dimensions of a local file, correctly, as 1280 x 720. Why is this information missing from server hosted files?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fXjRm.png" alt="Example with dimensions"  <answer122279> Files on the remote server are not indexed by Spotlight. Try using identify or ffprobe:  precodebrew install imagemagick ffmpeg identify image.png ffprobe -i video.mp4 /code/pre  <comment142373> Please revive your question, this is very vague. And what are you relating to with "I have the same issue"? Could you please write it down as a question instead of a brainwave? <comment142411> I would expect it is because the files are not indexed by spotlight
