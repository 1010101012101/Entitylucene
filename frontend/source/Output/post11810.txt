This isn't really a question about the Apple part of your setup (hardware or iOS) it's a question about Linux. I recommend that you ask on the Stack Exchange site dedicated to Linux, http://unix.stackexchange.com/. Please take a look at the [FAQs](http://apple.stackexchange.com/faq) for more info. Thanks.
