Is there anyway to disable network connections on 3G for some application? <body> I want some applications connect to Internet only when wifi connection is available. How can I do that?   <answer85536> strongYou can't/strong, at least at user level.   The App's Developer can, of course, detect if the device is connected either by WiFi or 3G, and act accordingly.     <comment98540> That's not possible, at least at the moment.
