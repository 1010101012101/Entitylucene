How can I change the resolution of a PDF <body> I have scanned a document into a PDF at 300dpi.  The document file is larger than I would like.  Is there a simple way to down-sample the document so that it has a lower resolution?  Or do I just need to re-scan the original document?  <answer31282> You can use ImageMagick's scale or resize operators.     ImageMagickÂ® is a software suite to create, edit, compose, or convert   bitmap images. It can read and write images in a variety of formats   (over 100) including DPX, EXR, GIF, JPEG, JPEG-2000, PDF, PhotoCD,   PNG, Postscript, SVG, and TIFF.   For example, from a terminal:  precodeconvert input.pdf  -resize 50% output.pdf /code/pre  or  precodeconvert input.pdf -scale 50% output.pdf /code/pre  <answer31318> Apple's Preview comes with a feature allowing you to save a file with a reduced file size.  Open your file in Preview, and click FileSave As.  Scroll down to the bottom where you will see a "Quartz Filter" drop-down menu and choose "Reduce File Size".  If you want to retain a copy of your original but larger file size, rename this file and click save.  Otherwise you will overwrite the larger file when you click save.  <comment57018> I have very bad experiences with this tool. There is little control for the user as to how much the resolution is lowered. In most cases, the text pdfs that I use are unreadable when applying this filter. <comment342302> If you aren't afraid of some harmless XML editing, you can create custom quality size reduction filters for `Preview`. http://www.macworld.com/article/1168311/software/shrink-preview-files-without-ruining-image-quality.html explains how.
