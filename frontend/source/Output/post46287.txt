App to plot my hike on google map? <body> I'm looking for an app that will periodically plot my coordinates on a map which I can directly or through an export/import, put onto a google map. Is there something that does this?  <answer46288> h2Kinetic/h2  For all my tracking needs I've become a fan of Kinetic. Accuracy is good. The customizable screens mean you can tailor the view for the activity. For example: I have a simple screen for when I ride my bike that's easy to access when I'm moving fast, versus a more complicated screen I'll use on hikes.  The routes are exportable via email in formats that Google Earth and Maps will happily read (like KML).  <answer46290> This article had a recommendation for the hiking apps - AccuTerra. The app seems to provide the functionality that you're looking for. The review notes that:     The app tracks your trail as you hike, allowing you to place markers   at significant points along the way and review your hike duration,   distance, pace, and elevation gain at any point. strongAll maps are stored   in your phone’s memory, so no reception is no problem./strong   From the iTunes app page, the app claims to:     ul   liUnlimited Tracks! There is no limit to the number of hikes/tracks that can be recorded./li   liUnlimited Waypoints! There is no limit to the number of geo-located points that can be recorded./li   liUnlimited Geo-coded pictures! Photos taken within AccuTerra On Demand are linked to your adventures and can be displayed in the   location in which they were taken. /li   liReal-time elevation profile and travel statistics. /li   liEasily toggle and track between AccuTerra Maps and basic online maps/li   listrongShare your adventure.

You can export the code.gpx/code files and see them in google earth right on your iOS device.      ul   liRecord waypoints with altitude for multiple tracks./li   liEdit recorded tracks on the map: name waypoints or delete unwanted ones./li   liSee the distance, speed and duration of your track while you record./li   liNo internet connection required during tracking./li   liDisplay your tracks OpenStreetMaps and select between road and topographic maps (that include cycle roads)/li   /ul   <comment52875> Most of the apps I'm familiar with store your track online, and you can usually download it from their site.  Would that be suitable? <comment52876> @AdamDavis I'm ok with having to go through a browser - as long as the map isn't stored in some proprietary way, or accessible only through their site. I need to be able to access it through google maps. <comment52879> There's a review on the app about it not having any (or many) apps for areas outside of California. Any idea about this? <comment52881> I've been able to get by with this version, since I mainly hike in California. You may want to check out the Unlimited version of their app if you need more maps in the US (http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/accuterra-unlimited-maps-gps/id355787609?mt=8). It claims to have "over five million square miles of terrain and trail maps in the contiguous US and Hawaii" <comment52882> Well they have one new customer.  I'm impressed with all this app does, and how well it does it.  Or claims, to anyway, I'll have to take it out for a spin and see if it lives up to its claims. <comment52888> @AdamDavis you're not the AD user I've turned on to Kinetic.
