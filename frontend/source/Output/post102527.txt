Run themed dock on login without affecting other users <body> I would like to know if there is a method for preventing the dock from starting on login, as I would like to run the stock dock with a different theme instead (but don't want it to affect other users).  I'm running OS X 10.7.5 (Lion)  <comment120694> See this previous post.  http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/59556/is-there-a-way-to-completely-disable-dock <comment120696> @Dave I've changed my question to be more precise. I would like to still use the stock dock, just with a different theme (and without affecting other users).
