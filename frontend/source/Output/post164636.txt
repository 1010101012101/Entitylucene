Command Backspace keep going past the line <body> I'm running OS X Yosemite. kbdâŒ˜/kbd-kbdDelete/kbd deletes a whole line in every app. In some apps, it deletes a whole line and keeps deleting lines after that. In some, it deletes a whole line and stops, so I have to hit delete to move up to the previous line and then Command-Delete to delete a whole line again.  Is there a way to make it keep deleting lines in every app. The one I'm specifically talking about is Xcode.  <answer164653> I think kbdControl/kbd + kbdOption/Alt/kbd + kbdDelete/kbd may be what you are looking for.  Edit: mistyped the shortcut :P  <comment193215> Option Delete is close, but it deletes just one word. It's quick and spans multi-line which is nice, but I'm specifically looking for Command Delete multiline.
