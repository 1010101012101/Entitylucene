How do I use CC knobs on my midi controller inGarageband? <body> I have an Akai Mini Mpk Mk2 midi controller that I use with Garageband. I can use the modulation "stick-thing" and knob number 7 can control volume. Other than that, I figured out that CC (midi "continuous control") # 10 can control the pan, but I can't figure out how to control any of the settings in synths (neither the built-in ones in Garageband nor third-party plugins like the Tyrell N6 or Zebralette).   I found out most of what I learnt from here: https://www.thegearpage.net/board/index.php?threads/assinging-midi-controls-in-garageband.1709222/
