Can I edit the "Open with..." menu in Apple Mail / Finder? <body> I am aware of ways to remove duplicate entries from the Finder "emOpen with.../em" menu. But in this instance I simply want to cull down the list of apps that appear when I do "emOpen with.../em" on pictures. Right now, in Mail (although it's the same in Finder, of course), when I do emOpen With/em on .jpg files, I get a LONG list of apps, many of which I would never consider opening a picture in. Even a music editing app, that has nothing to do with jpg files (in my opinion) shows up.  Is there a way to edit this list? To cull it down to the essentials? Having to look through 44 applications (in my case) just to find the app I'd like to open a picture with is inefficient and tedious. Please tell me Apple were kind enough to make a way to decide which apps I want to see in that list... :-)  Thanks.  <answer105059> You can remove entries from the codeCFBundleDocumentTypes/code dictionaries in codeInfo.plist/code files, but it is not very practical.  For example DVD Player won't be listed as a supported application for code.dvdmedia/code files if you:  ol liRun codesudo nano /Applications/DVD\ Player.app/Contents/Info.plist/code and remove the entry for codedvdmedia/code./li liRun code/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Versions/A/Support/lsregister -f /Applications/DVD\ Player.app//code./li liQuit and relaunch Finder./li /ol  Sandboxed applications like TextEdit and Chess have crashed on launch since 10.8 if their codeInfo.plist/code has been modified. Changes to codeInfo.plist/code files might also get reverted by updates.
