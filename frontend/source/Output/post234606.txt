Create a new space using a keyboard shortcut <body> I am aware you can do it from Mission Control by clicking and there is no shortcut available in 'Keyboard'.  strongAre there any ways to do this by using a 3rd party program or Applescript?/strong  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5iTK4.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/PT1W7.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer234640> Update: This method works in OS X 10.11 and earlier at least to OS X 10.8 (didn't test it on anything older then OS X 10.8) but no longer works as coded in macOS 10.12 due to significant changes to Mission Control made by Apple.  hr  To programmatically add a Desktop in Mission Control the emcode/em below can be used as an AppleScript or a BASH Script in conjunction with an Automator Service using Run AppleScript or Run Shell Script, respectively, and a key sequence assigned to the Service in System Preferences in Keyboard Shortcuts.  hr  strongAppleScript Code:/strong  precodedo shell script "open -a 'Mission Control'" delay 0.5 tell application "System Events" to click (every button whose value of attribute "AXDescription" is "add desktop") of group 1 of process "Dock" delay 0.5 tell application "System Events" to key code 53 /code/pre  hr  strongBASH Script Code:/strong  precode#!/bin/bash  open -a 'Mission Control' osascript -e 'delay 0.5' \           -e 'tell application "System Events" to click (every button whose value of attribute "AXDescription" is "add desktop") of group 1 of process "Dock"' \           -e 'delay 0.5' \           -e 'tell application "System Events" to key code 53' /code/pre  hr  ul liOpen strongAutomator/strong and select strongService/strong./li liSet: Service receives no input in any application/li liAdd either a strongRun AppleScript/strong or strongRun Shell Script/strong emAction/em./li liAdd the appropriate emcode/em for the target emAction/em./li liSave the emService/em as, e.g.: emAdd New Desktop/em/li liAssign a keyboard shortcut for the emService/em in strongSystem Preferences/strong./li /ul  strongNote:/strong You'll have to assign a key sequence that is not used elsewhere on the emSystem/em or in emFinder/em if you choose is over emany application/em in the emService/em.  I tested it with: ⌃⌥⌘D (Control-Option-Command-D)  <answer281460> OK, using the Automator recording, I made it work with a revised version of the AppleScript in the other answer.  Replace "of group 1" with "of group 2 of group 1 of group 1 of":  precodeon run {input, parameters}      do shell script "open -a 'Mission Control'"     delay 0.5     tell application "System Events" to click (every button whose value of attribute "AXDescription" is "add desktop") of group 2 of group 1 of group 1 of process "Dock"     delay 0.5     tell application "System Events" to key code 53      return input end run /code/pre  <answer281565> Yep, that works, sort of. Problem is that user3439894's solution ends up throwing an error if the active application (Finder, textedit, etc.) hasn't been added to the Security &amp; Privacy Accessibility pane.  To get around this, we need two workflows, user3439894's service with the updated group list as an Automator application, and a second Automator service to launch it.  The Automator Application (Saved into /Applications as "New Desktop".)     on run {input, parameters}      do shell script "open -a 'Mission Control'"      delay 0.5      tell application "System Events" to click (every button whose value of attribute "AXDescription" is "add desktop") of group 2 of group 1 of group 1 of process "Dock"      delay 0.5      tell application "System Events" to key code 53      return input      end run   Then we just need to create the second workflow as a service, using the "Launch Application" action and save it as "New_Desktop"  Last steps are to add “New Desktop.App” to  System Preferences  Security &amp; Privacy  Accessibility  Then add your keyboard shortcut in System Preferences  Keyboard  Shortcuts  Services  General for the New_Desktop.workflow.  <comment287351> Thanks this worked great. Do you think you could make a second script for deleting spaces? <comment287355> @Jonathan, Adding a Desktop is sort of a kludge, programmatically, to begin with and possible because there is an AXButton with the AXDescription of "add desktop" that can be clicked however the AXButton(s) under Mission Control with AXTitle, e.g. "Desktop 2", while it has a close element (a circle with a x, in the top left corner of the button) it is not addressable in the same manner as there is no "remove desktop" button. So I really do not know of an easy way to remove one programmatically, sorry. <comment287360> That makes sense. Thanks for taking the time to explain it to me <comment338815> I've tried this in macOS (10.12.1) and haven't had any luck. It opens Mission Control for the .5 seconds but the New Desktop button isn't pressed. <comment338817> @portOdin, If you look at the Tags on the OP it shows el-capitan and that is what this was tested under and it works there. Every release of the OS brings about its own issues as well as breaking _code_ that worked in previous OS versions. When I get a moment I'll try it under macOS Sierra and see if I can get it to work there. <comment338821> @user3439894 Yes, I was just commenting in case someone had an answer for MacOS. I hadn't considered creating a separate question; should I? Thanks though, I appreciate the help. <comment345439> Very helpful question for my workflow. I'd also like to know about your desktop background! <comment345442> Glad you liked the question :) Here is a link to the wallpaper http://www.somethingpeach.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/wallpaper_2880x1800_001.jpg
