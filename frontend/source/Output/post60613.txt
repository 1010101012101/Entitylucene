Change DMG capacity <body> When changing my mac HDD to an SSD I ran into the following problem:  I've created a DMG image of my old HDD which has a capacity of 320GB. The DMG file remembered and saved the capacity in the image, and the problem is my SSD is only 120GB.. So the DMG can't be used if I can't decrease the capacity somehow..   strongEDIT/strong: The total amount of used space on the image is only 15GB..   I've looked at codehdiutil/code but I'm actually a ruby on rails developer so I don't really get this stuff..   Is their any way with this or another util to decrease the capacity of the DMG?  Thanks!  <answer60614> Try this one:  precodehdiutil compact image.dmg /code/pre  But as you can see in hdiutil manual:  precodeDepending on the location of files in the hosted filesystem, compact may or may not shrink the image. /code/pre  <answer60615> After cjc pointed out to ask the question at apple.stackexchange.com, I did. When asking the question I got to a related questing answered by someone saying to try Carbon Copy Cloner.   Carbon Copy Cloner cloned the files via FireWire to my SSDisk no questioned asked, and everything is how it should be..  Here's the question I'm referring to:  Restore system from DMG (original source disk bigger than destination)  For those of you interested in resizing a disk image:  strongMake your disk image read-write in Mac's Disk Utility:/strong  Mount the disk, select it and click new disk image. Select read-write in the disk image structure drop down and click save. ( My OS is dutch, so these are my own translations ).  strongUse codehdiutil/code to resize the disk image:/strong  In terminal: codehdiutil resize -size 100G /location/of/disk.dmg/code. You can replace 100G by the size you want.  strongOptional (didn't work for me), you can try to compact it:/strong  In terminal: codehdiutil convert /location/of/disk.dmg -format UDSP -o /location/of/NEW/disk.dmg/code.   This creates a sparse image.  Then: codehdiutil compact /location/of/SPARSE/disk.dmg.sparseimage/code  This will try to free up space on the disk image.. If it works I guess you may need to resize your DMG again to lower the capacity (I'm not sure)..  <answer60625> There isn't a good way via GUI that I've seen to do this - you've got to use codehdiutil/code as you asked. It's a quick command. To resize (change 25G to whatever you want),  precodehdiutil resize -size 25G /PATH/TO/DISK/IMAGE.dmg /code/pre  Another way to compress it is to clone your disk image into a sparsebundle, then compress the sparsebundle. This may or may not work, depending on how much compression takes place.  First, create the disk image which mirrors your old disk image:  precodehdiutil convert /location/of/disk.dmg -format UDSP -o /location/of/NEW/disk.dmg /code/pre  Then, compact the resulting sparsebundle:  precodehdiutil compact /PATH/TO/DISK/IMAGE.sparseimage /code/pre  If these commands don't work then it's got something to do with your disk image and/or permissions.  I have spent a lot of time playing with codehdiutil/code and it's far from flawless - I've found &amp; submitted bugs in Snow Leopard that still haven't been corrected in Mountain Lion, so if you do get a bit of odd behavior, don't be off-put!  <comment69772> Thanks for your reaction.. When executing this command I get the response that theirs a permission problem.. Probably because the dmg is a read-only formatted disk image.. I now have Carbon Copy Cloner creating a copy via FireWire.. <comment69773> You can use Mac OS X Disk Utility to convert from ro to rw image. <comment69774> I got it working with CCC, thanks for your help anyway! <comment69816> I've tried this, but the resize verb throws a permission problem, I'm now creating an RW disk image of to see if that works. <comment69820> With my RW disk image, I was able to use the resize verb and shrink the image to 120G, this resulted in a 128,85 GB capacity.. So that's the right way, but it's still not enough to fit on my SSD.. The compact verb doesn't work, it says `compact failed - function not implemented`. <comment69828> I've updated my answer, with a more detailed description of how it should be done.. If you can check if I'm explaining it right and update your answer I can flag yours as the right answer. Your answer is confusing because resize doesn't create a sparseimage which you refer to. And compact doesn't compress **into** a sparseimage, but it needs one. At least this is what I figured out.. Thanks! <comment70164> Updated to reflect your correction; sorry I hadn't included the part where you clone your image over. Slipped my mind! <comment70210> Great! Flagged your answer, hope it can help some others! <comment70280> Glad you were able to figure it out & correct my mistake :) <comment338370> @TimBaas Kinda late, but if you get permissions problems (maybe you don't have write access on the DMG), you can use `sudo hdiutil resize -size 25G /PATH/TO/DISK/IMAGE.dmg`. I just did it with my Time Machine backup disk image, and it didn't seem to break any permissions.
