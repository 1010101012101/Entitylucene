What does each cellular connectivity indicator mean? <body> I'm used to "3G" and "E" on my AT&amp;T iPhone 3GS, and I understand I may see "4G" on my new iPad when I enter a 4G area.  However, I recently saw "o" on the new Verizon iPad, and had no idea what it meant.  h3What network connectivity indicators can I expect to see on my iOS devices, and what do they generally mean?/h3  h3Are the connectivity indicators the same for all iOS devices (with expected carrier differences) or should I assume "3G" on the 1st gen iPad means something different than "3G" on the new iPad?/h3  <answer47308> The "o" means that you're on a 2G network. In Verizon's case, that would be 1xRTT. If you see it on an AT&amp;T device, that means you're on GPRS.  Here's a screenshot from the iPad User Guide detailing what the various signal indicators mean:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6AYiz.png" alt="enter image description here"  "3G" means exactly the same thing on the 1st generation iPad as it does on the 3rd generation iPad. However, if you have AT&amp;T, the 3rd generation iPad reports HSDPA+ as "4G". Since the 1st generation iPad is incapable of using HSDPA+, you will only ever see 3G or below on that device.  <answer47309> On CDMA networks, the codeÂ°/code symbol means that you're connected to a 1xRTT network. You might not be able to receive calls while transferring data over the network. On GSM networks, it means that you're connected to a GPRS network.   This Apple support article goes into further detail on possible connectivity indicators for different cellular networks.
