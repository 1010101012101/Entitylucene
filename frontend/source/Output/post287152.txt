My earphones don't work with my phone? <body> My earphones don't work with my iPhone (5) anymore. I tried to plug my earphones in a diff. device AND IT WORKED! I've tried cleaning my earphone jack with a q-tip (the kinds with the pointed tips because the regular ones didn't fit.  Anyways, is it a problem with my earphones or my phone? I don't want to replace my phone unless really needed to because everything else works just fine.   Thank you in advance.
