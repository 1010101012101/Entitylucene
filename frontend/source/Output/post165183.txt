When not, you can drag the video's into itunes.  Connect you device with the lightning/30-pins cable to your pc and open iTunes if it doesn't pop up automatically.  ul liAt the upper left corner there should be a small iPhone/iPad icon. Click on the icon to view more information about it./li liIn the left panel is a menu called video (or something like that)/li licheck the checkbox that you want to sync video's with your device. When the video's are correctly loaded into iTunes they should popup here./li liselect the video('s) you want to have on your device./li liin the lower right corner click on apply/sync (if i'm right) /li /ul  This will start syncing the video's from iTunes to your device.  When i'm right the video's can be found in the app called "video's".
