iTunes library file damaged after manual migration to new Mac <body> On my old computer, I had the following setup:  ol liiTunes Folder containing strongiTunes Library.itl/strong on my main hard disk (~/Music/iTunes)/li listrongMusic folder/strong on a second HD where all the actual music files lived (I had checked "Keep library organized")./li /ol  My new laptop has only one HD, so manually I copied the strongMusic Folder (2)/strong to the new HD and put the strongiTunes Library.itl/strong, strongiTunes Library Extras/strong and strongiTunes Library Genius/strong into it (both from a time machine backup).   Opening iTunes brings up a blank library. When I open iTunes by clicking the app icon while holding alt, choose the library it says:      iTunes library is not valid. iTunes has created a new library and renamed the original to "iTunes library (damaged)".   (translated from German)  I am using Apple Music, too. Am I missing something?  <answer266722> As user33958 has pointed out, strongiTunes Library.xml/strong needs to be copied too.   <comment334427> There's should be another iTunesLibrary.xml which needs to be moved too <comment334468> ThatÂ´s it! Thank you!
