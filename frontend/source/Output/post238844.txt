Apple iPhone 6 Plus display languages <body> I want to buy an iPhone, and would like to ask whether the iPhone 6 Plus has either Persian or Farsi language support.  <answer238849> The language capabilities of an iPhone are listed in its tech specs.  They are the same for all current models.  See for example  http://www.apple.com/iphone-6/specs/  There is not yet any Persian/Farsi user interface or keyboard, but webpages and emails and messages in this language should be displayed without problem.  Keyboards are available via 3rd party apps.  <comment293333> Nope. Neither language is supported (sorry!)
