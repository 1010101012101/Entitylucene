Macbook Pro not starting after multiple drops. <body> I've found a 'cheap' Macbook Pro mid 2012 13" laptop for sale on eBay and it would seem to be a great bargain if I were to get it. Even with all the repair costs, about half the price of a fully working one on eBay.    It reads "Dropped multiple times, finally given up this time, needs new glass and will not start up past the apple logo" Now, I've fixed many Laptops, Phones, etc in the past and have a good understanding of what I'm doing and the tools to do it but my understanding of a macbook is zilch.   The glass is the easy bit, it mentions it won't boot past the apple logo and a quick google bought up many fixes. (Resets, HDD replacement, etc) but what are the chances of something wrong that I can't fix?  Thank you!   <comment232192> logic board might cost you few !
