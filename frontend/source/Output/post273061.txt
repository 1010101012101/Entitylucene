Hold power 10 seconds to completely shut off your mac. Then press power to start it, immediately after, hold the following keys to get their corresponding effects:  precode⌘ + r - OS recovery system ⌘ + c - boot choice menu ⌘ + v - verbose /code/pre  If you don't have the OS recovery system present, get a USB drive, download the latest OS your system supports on a different working mac, and create a USB boot drive.  <comment343256> Please add details: which macbook air model, and what your latest operating system was (e.g. lion, el capitan)
