Shutdown keyboard shortcut on MacBook Pro with Touchbar <body> So on previous Apple computers, one could shutdown using the keyboard shortcut codeCtrl + Option + Cmd + Eject/Power/code. However, the new MacBook Pro w/ Touchbar has neither an eject nor a power key. Does this mean that the shortcut no longer exists for this computer?  <answer261643> You can add a sleep or shutdown button to the touch bar in system preferences  keyboard  (set touchbar options - it's not called this but I can't recall the option name, it's toward the bottom of the screen) and then drag whichever optional button you desire to the touchbar  <answer262984> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mWOpU.jpg" alt="Customize TouchID Control Strip"  Unfortunately it's not an option. There is an option for a sleep command, but there is nothing for Shut Down or Restart. Modifier/command keys on the sleep button don't work either.  <answer278256> Build custom keyboard shortcut to bring up shutdown dialogue (apple.stackexchange)  Touch ID button shuts down the computer (Apple Support) Another button on touch bar would be redundant.     Unlike with older Mac notebooks, holding down Touch ID on your 2016   MacBook Pro doesn't display a dialog with options to Sleep, Restart,   or Shut Down. You can find these options in the Apple menu. If your   MacBook Pro is unresponsive, you can hold down Touch ID for six   seconds to force a shut down. Note that you'll lose any unsaved work   if you do this.   Shutting down your 2016 MBP is not required unless not using for 36 hours (apple.stackexchange)  <comment329491> Maybe a bit unrelated but I wonder why the Touch ID sensor is a button (i.e. it depresses). It doesn't work in my shutdown shortcut unfortunately. <comment331179> There is a sleep option but sadly no shutdown. <comment341236> @Amja the reason that the button depresses is so that you can power it on after a shutdown while the lid was open. It also acts as a force shut down button when you hold it for about 10 seconds, but you should only use this in emergencies. <comment348017> I just tried adding the sleep button and various key combinations (command, shift, option, control) hoping something would trigger a shutdown but as of 10.12.3 -- nothing appears to work. <comment349723> why would you add a shutdown icon when the Touch ID button is a power button already? <comment350137> @JBallin pressing the TouchID button does not shutdown the computer. <comment350138> Really? You held it down for a while? <comment350139> Anyways you don't need to shut down these new MBP's. You can just put them to sleep, that's probably why it isn't an option on touch bar. <comment350140> @JBallin What do you mean specifically by that? Are you saying that they are efficient enough not to need shutdown? <comment350143> See new answer addressing both Touch ID power button and necessity of shut down.
