Using iMessage with my phone number when I don't have an iPhone anymore <body> Until recently, I was using iMessage on both iOS and macOS. Now, my phone is dead with a black screen, so I did a full erase from iTunes. ("Find my iPhone" and iCloud was turned off already.)  Currently, I am still able to use iMessage from macOS. My iMessage account is connected only to my phone number, not my email address, and I'd like to keep it that way.  If I don't buy a new iPhone, but a basic phone, can I use my phone number for iMessage on macOS forevermore? Or will this "time out"? What must I do to avoid running into a situation where I will be forced to have an iPhone to continue using iMessage with my phone number?  <comment354208> I've removed your second question, please ask it separately.
