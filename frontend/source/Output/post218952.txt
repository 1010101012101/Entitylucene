How to focus and walk through menu bar on OS X using keyboard <body> I'm using OS X 10.11, How can I navigate through items on menu bar using keyboard, like press Alt + letter with underscored in Windows?  <answer218956> The Alt + Letter is a Windows things doesn't appear in OS X. There are two native options to navigate the menu bar. First, very quick, and intuitive, is a Mac universal shortcut Command(kbd⌘/kbd)+kbd?/kbd (which is: kbd⌘/kbd+kbdShift/kbd+kbd//kbd) which will take you to the Help menu. From there you can search whatever menu bar item you wish, and get the shortcut if one exists; just start typing. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qiAl2.png" alt="Help Menu"  Second if you manually want to navigate the menu bar then, open strongSystem Preferences  Keyboard  Shortcuts  Keyboard  Check and Set shortcut for/strong emMove focus to the menu bar/em. This way you can move focus and navigate using arrow keys. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ONt00.png" alt="Move Focus"  If you go to the emApp Shortcuts/em category in the same pane, you can also change the emHelp Menu/em shortcut to your liking.  Tertiary option would be, investing in a third party application to help you find/remember shortcuts faster. Personally, would recommend KeyCue. There are several others, just search on Google or App Store.  <answer219005> See the official Apple Documentation: Mac keyboard shortcuts for accessibility features  Another helpful trick:  Using your keyboard with dialogs won't work by default. Pressing Control+F7 toggles this option. The setting can also be found in codeSystem Preferences &gt; Keyboard &gt; Shortcuts &gt; Full Keyboard Access/code.
