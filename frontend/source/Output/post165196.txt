Cannot trash old shared PC <body> There is an old shared connection that I had setup to a PC to transfer files from the PC to the Mac and I cannot get rid of it.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kr0m2.png" alt="Here is a shot of the old connection I&#39;m trying to trash."  Here is a shot of the message when I drag to the trash; control click give no trash option.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/PPAe0.png" alt="Shot of file with delete message"  <answer165205> Devices shown in Network are reported by the network, not by your machine, hence they can't be deleted. Try restarting your router to clear any persistent assignments.  <answer165206> Try disabling / re-enabling Bonjour:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xLwGT.png" alt="Finder --&gt; Preferences"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5iXZV.png" alt="Sidebar --&gt; Bonjour"  Uncheck Bonjour computers, wait a few seconds, and re-check it. That should clear out the shared computer.  <comment193768> why not? what does it say/do? did you disable it in Sharing? <comment193772> In other words, what did you try?  And then, why didn't it work? <comment193780> Restarting the router makes no difference. <comment193781> This simply prevents Bonjour computers from showing in the sidebar in Finderâ€”this neither disables Bonjour or refreshes Bonjour? <comment193783> Yes that is correct checking or unchecking Bonjour does nothing and I have never had Bonjour checked. <comment193784> Just a thought. I've seen this happen before and doing what I described worked. <comment193786> Is the PC still connected to your network? <comment193788> No, PC hasn't been connected for at least a year.
