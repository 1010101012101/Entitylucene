Is there any way to search image by image in Mac finder? <body> Mac version is OS X EI Capitan What I want is just the same like google image Search by image service but the search region is a specific folder of my Mac disk.  <answer295674> Seems this similar image detector could let you do like this, it stated " Add a photo to compare against the photos in chosen folders and find duplicate and similar ones from the folders " https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/similar-image-detector/id892627565?mt=12  <comment263600> No, nothing like this is currently available in OS X (at least nothing part of the OS).    There may be some third party apps that do this...  but I'm not aware of any. <comment263651> Would [PhotoSweeper](http://overmacs.com) be something appropriate? <comment334742> Issue with PhotoSweeper is you need to first add the images in and then run a comparison. That's probably not going to be easy to add all your images on all your drives. May not even cope?
