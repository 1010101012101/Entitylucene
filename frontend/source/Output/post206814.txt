iPhone recent calls list reappears after clear <body> Today I've cleared my recent calls list about 6 times, and it keeps coming back. What gives?  <answer284865> it's a bug. not only Facetime on iPhone but iMac also. Apple have no solution!  <comment249312> What version of iOS are you running? <comment249319> @grgarside iOS9 but it did it on iOS8 as well. <comment249327> Works as expected on my iPhone 6 iOS 9.0.  Does the problem persist after a hard reset?
