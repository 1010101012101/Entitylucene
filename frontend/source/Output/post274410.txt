Is there a way to control which Apple Pay is chosen when I pay from macOS? <body> When I choose to pay for something in macOS using Apple Pay (e.g., from Safari or the App Store) from Mac hardware that doesn't have a touchID hardware itself, I'm sometimes offers my iPhone and sometimes my Apple Watch. However, I don't see any pattern in which device is offered, and often the least convenient device is selected.  Is there a way to control which device is chosen for paying with Apple Pay, or to select or change to a different watchOS/iOS device?  <answer275408> Ctrl-Alt-backspace || possibly Ctrl-Alt-Delete  <comment346462> Welcome to Ask Different!
