My iPad 4 is dead and the Apple logo will not appear <body> Last night my iPad 4 went flat as I was working with it. I had failed to notice it was on low battery. I immediately plugged it into my charger and waited to see it turn back on and carry on working. It did not. So I proceeded to google hacks. I have cleaned 6 different wall sockets. I have changed the wall sockets obviously. I have tried to force restart it. I have tried a different cable. All have been in vain as it says that it is charging. There is no lightening bolt and charger symbol just the empty battery with a bit of red. but it has been like this for the entire night. Does anyone have any suggestions on how I could fix this before I went to the iStore?  <comment354045> Try these in order: **1.** Use a small folded piece of paper to clean up the inside of the device charging port of with it. **2.** [Make sure power adapter wattage is enough](https://apple.com/power-adapters). So I guess you should use 12W adapter **3.** Try different cables and adapters. If possible test them with another device first. **5.** Try to [force restart](https://support.apple.com/HT201559#force) when you see the red battery icon. **4.** Try to leave it charging for like 30 minutes or overnight. I might try force restart after 30 minutes if it's still not showing signs of life. <comment354046> iPad user guide (first link ˆ): Important: "If iPad is very low on power, it may display an image of a nearly depleted battery, indicating that iPad needs to charge for up to twenty minutes before you can use it. If iPad is extremely low on power, the display may be blank for up to two minutes before the low-battery image appears. Rechargeable batteries have a limited number of charge cycles and may eventually need to be replaced. The iPad battery isn’t user replaceable; it should be replaced only by Apple or an authorized service provider. See www.apple.com/batteries/service-and-recycling/.
