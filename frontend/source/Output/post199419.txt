Why Is the Apple Watch Activity App Distance Incorrect by 500m on a 7km Run? <body> Today, I went for a 7 kilometer run on a course with an established distance. I set the MapMyRun app on my iPhone and the Activity App on my watch to record the run. MapMyRun recorded the distance accurately, but the Activity App was off on the distance by 500 meters.

Engst's Exercising with the Apple Watch: The Hardware insightful. Adam is a serious runner and he too noted the difference in distances measured:     strongAccelerometer/strong -- Happily, the Apple Watch does have an accelerometer that enables it to detect your steps, from which it can determine both distance and pace, even if you’re not carrying your iPhone. It calibrates itself when you use it with the iPhone around, and I’m impressed at how accurate it can be. After a few runs, its numbers match quite closely with those collected by my Garmin and with the quarter-mile markings on San Francisco’s Bay Shore Trail, where I was running recently. Unfortunately, accuracy drops significantly if you run uphill (where your stride is shorter) or faster than normal (where it will be longer).
