deactivate growlmail rss notification <body> Is it possible to tell growlmail to stop notifying me on RSS feeds and just show me the new mails I get?  It is getting really disturbing when I get some 30 or more RSS Notifiers when I'm working!  <answer8893> If you want just notifications on the new mails you have in your emInbox(es)/em, then there is a setting for that in GrowlMail configuration tab. Not in Growl System Preferences, but in Mail.app Growl Mail preferences.  <comment10141> Thanx! Didn't know that in the mail.app there was a growl tab where I could configure the notifications
