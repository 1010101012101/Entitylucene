Getting full HTTP request from website <body> I am doing a project in which my Arduino needs to connect to a simple web page and retrieve the content of a text file. I want to use codecurl/code to see the response I would get if I sent the following HTTP request once connected to codeexample.com/code (the website in my actual project is a different one) so that I can devise a parse for the contents of codecommandPage.txt/code:  precodeGET /commandPage.txt HTTP 1.1 Host: example.com Connection: close /code/pre  How can I use codecurl/code to send the request and see the full response?  <answer225463> What you're asking for is simply:  precodecurl http://example.com/commandPage.txt /code/pre  This will get you the contents of that URL.  If you need to see the headers as well, you can add code-v/code.  Otherwise, you can even use codetelnet/code to do so. Just use:  precodetelnet example.com 80 /code/pre  And paste the full request as quoted above, followed by one empty line.  <comment273652> Thank you! The telnet did not work for me, but the curl worked! Yes, I didn't mean to put the mail.horacemann.org. Oops. <comment273654> I have edited your question (pending approval) and my answer.
