Got a blue screen and my mac crashed <body> I just got a blue screen and the computer crashed. I restarted the computer with the start button and it started, but much slower than usual. Now the mac is a little bit slower, my wallpaper was changed to default and I had some "Recovered files" in my trash bin (pdf-files). I don't know if some data was lost, and I cannot find anything about this when i google. When I look at my harddrives activity, I can see that it i acting very strange, it is reading and writing alot even if I am not doing anything.  Does anyone know what happened and if this is going to continue? I have the late 2011 Macbook Pro and are running OS X 10.8.4.  <answer95455> 911 :)  Do not know what caused it without you telling us what you did last.  Go to Utility and Open Activity monitor, that will show you what is slowing it down and report it here.  To find out what crashed it....go to Utility Console and then we will look for the reason.  <comment111962> added this now: When I look at my harddrives activity, I can see that it i acting very strange, it is reading and writing alot even if I am not doing anything. <comment111963> probably still recovering, so let it do. <comment111964> Last i was just surfing the web. In the system messages, the last thing it "reports" is about coreaudiod <comment111965> no idea what is coreaudiod ? <comment111967> How is the patient ? <comment111969> there are some reports on coreaudiod so check it out!
