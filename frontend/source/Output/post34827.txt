What is a Mac OS X equivalent of McAfee Security network mapping? <body> We have multiple computers of different OS in a network. Mine is Mac OS X and most others are Window XP or 7.  I will need to help monitor what computer gets connected. In past, I use Windows and have McAfee security which products a real-time map of all connected computers including each IP and Computer name.   Now using Mac OS X, I find nothing I can use. I tried nmap and Zenmap, but neither provides computer name, and neither is real-time monitor and scanning takes forever. There is NetworkView but it only works on Window machines.  What can I use?  <answer34830> You can try ProteMac. I have no experience with this software bundle, but it looks like it does what you are looking for!  <answer38452> Zenmap can strongAbsolutely/strong provide NetBIOS names (the names you are referring to).   Furthermore, you can tweak the nMap scan to only scan for up IP addresses, and NetBIOS details, which should really significantly reduce the scan duration.  Furthermore, it should, if you are willing to fall back to the terminal, be possible to make it update pretty rapidly, maybe every ~30 seconds.  For example, with the Zenmap command of:  precodenmap -sU -p 137 --script nbstat.nse 10.1.1.1/24 /code/pre  Note: I use the code10.1.1.1/code IP prefix. in your case, this will likely be code192.168.something.something/codebr The code/24/code is the netmask. In this case, it causes nMap to scan everything from code10.1.1.0/code - code10.1.1.255/code. To use, you just paste the line above into the "Command" entry box in Zenmap  Here is a scan of my LAN:  precodeStarting Nmap 5.51 ( http://nmap.org ) at 2012-01-27 05:59 Pacific Standard Time Nmap scan report for 10.1.1.1 Host is up (0.00s latency).

It also did all the above in ~9.4 seconds.  supI did this on my windows computer because my mac (Apparently appropriately named iCrap, as you can see in the scan results) is freaking out at the moment, and I cannot restart it because I have some big file transfers in process. Nmap is platform agnostic, so the platform on which you do this scan should not matter. I did test this on the mac from the command line only, and it worked fine there too (well, it did trip the flood protection on my managed switch, but that's another issue)./sup  supI've edited the MAC address out from the scan./sup  I can add more information on how to set this up to scan continuously from the command line, if you would like.  hr  You can see more information on the codenbstat.nse/code script that I am using to query NetBIOS information here.  The nmap brief man page is also very useful, for understanding what is going on.  <comment43530> He wants a tool to *monitor what computers are on his local network*, not what processes on his computer are *accessing* the local network.
