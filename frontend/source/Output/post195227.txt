If not, Apple Music will/li liUpload them to the cloud. /li liAll these songs will be available from the Music app on iOS. If you play them, you will stream them from the cloud. If you would like to save songs for offline listening, tap the triple dots next to a song, and tap: Make available offline. /li /ol  Because it works this way now, it is no longer necessary to sync via iTunes  <comment233237> It appears that most of the tracks downloaded aren't copies from the Apple Music catalog - I've got mostly ALAC copies of music and on the phone, it shows that they're ALAC as well. <comment233238> @remus That doesn't change step 4 :). You should be able to select the songs from your iCloud Music Library you want stored on your phone, while all of them will be available for streaming. <comment233239> Awesome. Thanks for the info!
