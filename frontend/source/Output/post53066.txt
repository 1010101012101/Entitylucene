TextEdit key bindings modified in DefaultKeyBinding.dict stopped working <body> I have customized text editing bindings in ~/Library/KeyBindings/DefaultKeyBinding.dict but they all stopped working in TextEdit.app when I upgraded to Lion. They still work fine in other Cocoa apps like Safari.  The system default bindings like kbd^F/kbd for codemoveForward:/code work as usual.  Has anyone else who uses DefaultKeyBinding.dict noticed this? Is there a way to fix it or any other way of customizing the key bindings in TextEdit?  <answer53110> The problem was that I had moved the actual DefaultKeyBinding.dict file somewhere else for version-control purposes and symlinked to it.  Most apps were loading the file through the symlink, but TextEdit (and, it turns out, a couple other apps that I thought just didn't support key bindings) must do something different and didn't see it.  So, oops, lesson learned. Don't symlink your system configuration files.  <answer224074> I had the same problem myself with symlinking this file, but I didn't want to give in to this limitation, so I created a git codepre-commit/code hook to update ~/Library/KeyBindings/DefaultKeyBinding.dict whenever my version was committed.  Here is the code (for Git):  precode#!/bin/bash   if [[ $(git diff --cached --name-only | grep '.configurations/DefaultKeyBinding.dict' | wc -l) -eq 1 ]];   then    FILE_PATH_IN_LIBRARY=~/Library/KeyBindings/DefaultKeyBinding.dict    BASE_DIR=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)    FILE_PATH_IN_SCM=${BASE_DIR}/.configurations/DefaultKeyBinding.dict     NORMAL=$(tput sgr0)    BRIGHT=$(tput bold)    GREEN=$(tput setaf 2)     printf "${BRIGHT}${GREEN}The file &lt;%s&gt; was modified, updating %s${NORMAL}\n" $FILE_PATH_IN_SCM $FILE_PATH_IN_LIBRARY     cp $FILE_PATH_IN_SCM $FILE_PATH_IN_LIBRARY fi /code/pre  To use it all you need to do is replace codeFILE_PATH_IN_SCM=${BASE_DIR}/.configurations/DefaultKeyBinding.dict/code with the location of the file in your Git Repository.  If you never created a git hook before (this was my first) - you need to place this code in:    precode&lt;your-git-repo&gt;/.git/hooks/pre-commit /code/pre  Don't forget to run codechmod +x &lt;your-git-repo&gt;/.git/hooks/pre-commit/code to make it executable.  Afterwards every commit involving this file will show something like:  precodeThe file &lt;/Users/myuser/.scripts/.configurations/DefaultKeyBinding.dict&gt; was modified, updating /Users/myuser/Library/KeyBindings/DefaultKeyBinding.dict /code/pre  <comment60664> The custom keybindings work normally for me in TextEdit. Have you tried replacing your DefaultKeyBinding.dict with something like `{"a"=(insertText:,"test");}`? <comment60706> @LauriRanta thanks; knowing that I was the only one with the problem got me to finally investigate it properly.
