Set up smart mailbox to hold all messages to AND from a particular person <body> I want a smart mailbox that will display all the emails sent to me by a particular person as well as all the emails I've sent them.  I assumed that setting the rules to be   precodeContains messages that match ANY of the following; From Is Equal To Person Any Recipient Is Equal To Person /code/pre  but all I get is messages from Person.  This doesn't do the trick so what am I missing? Shouldn't it return any emails sent from Person and any emails wherein Person is a recipient?  <answer100104> For both rules, change this portion:  precodeIs Equal To /code/pre  to this:  precodeContains /code/pre  Utilizing codeIs Equal To/code requires an exact match against whatever you trying to match. Depending on how Mail is looking at a recipient's address, it may include brackets around it and/or include the person's name, in addition to the actual email address. These strings wouldn't match just the email address, obviously. Using codeContains/code instead allows it to match the string you know should be there - the email address - no matter what Mail is actually matching against.  <comment117823> Did you check the box for `Include messages from Sent` and/or have you moved your sent messages out of the Sent folder into other folders? <comment117824> Yes I have include sent messages set, but it doesn't seem to do anything. I haven't moved anything out of my sent folder. <comment117826> Let's narrow down - remove the "From is equal to" line. Do you get anything then? What if you change `Any Recipient Is Equal To` to `Any Recipient Contains`? If that still doesn't work try changing `Any Recipient Contains` to `Entire Message Contains`. <comment117827> Changing it to `From contains` and `Any Recipient Contains` worked. Thank you! I wonder why that is.
