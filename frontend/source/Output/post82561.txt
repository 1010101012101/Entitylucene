The answer is here:  https://discussions.apple.com/thread/4056096?start=0&amp;tstart=0  <comment95232> The tool to use is `dns-sd` but I don't have much to offer on the process of using it. I've gotten awesome answers using dns-sd from [DrFrogSplat](http://apple.stackexchange.com/users/1587/drfrogsplat) but most google hits I see are old RFP and manual page entries. <comment95233> Also, I'd start by isolating my Mac from a network to ensure you are not just seeing a very chatty network. I'd place a second router between my Mac and the internet so I'm on an isolated NAT protected route to the world. (or a private VLAN if you have one) and reboot with networking disabled. Then you can watch as zeroconf runs in a garden before subjecting your Mac to all the devices on your network. <comment95235> @bmike Thanks for the suggestion but I don't have access to a second router to test this. Maybe I could just clear all known networks and then reboot with networking disabled? How should I monitor "zeroconf"? <comment109685> Answers on Ask Different need to be more than just a link. It's okay to include a link, but please summarize or excerpt it in the answer. The idea is to make the answer stand alone.
