Installing fonts from terminal instead of Font Book? <body> I know how do install new fonts using Font Book.  Is there also a way to install fonts from the terminal, using some smart shell command?  <answer240382> You can simply copy them into code/Library/Fonts/code (for system wide use) or code~/Library/Fonts/code (for use by current user).  <answer240436> By manually copying to a fonts folder used to be the only way to install fonts before Font Book was introduced. (barring 3rd party sw)  <comment295441> Awesome, I even noticed the font shows up in 3rd party software (e.g. photoshop) immediately. Thanks! <comment295442> You could also make Automator `Service`: `Get selected finder items`  `Move finder items` ( to the fonts folder ). This way you could select fonts in Finder and either find the correct `Service` from the right click context menu or use a hotkey you've given the `Service` at: `Preferences  Keyboard  Shortcuts  Services`. Of course if you really want to do it via Terminal, that's another thing. <comment295485> @RocketNuts it should, because this is pretty much identical to what FontBook does.
