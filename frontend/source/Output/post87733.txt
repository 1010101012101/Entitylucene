How to deploy Mac OS X 10.6.8 to several clients? <body> I am working for an Apple Premium Reseller and we are looking for strongthe best way to deploy installations Snow Leopard and newer/strong. Before I started looking into this, we were using the retail version of Snow Leopard (10.6.3 via DVD) and 10.7/10.8 from MAS (first available builds).  Currently we are able to install 10.7, 10.7.5, 10.8 and 10.8.3 from our Mac mini server (using NetInstall) without any problems on all supported Macs.  Unfortunately it isn't that easy with Snow Leopard. The most recent retail version is 10.6.3, but will only work on Macs that shipped with a build lower than 10D575 which excludes some machines from 2010 and 2011 since they shipped with 10.6.4 or 10.6.7...  Now I'm looking for the best way to solve that problem. I've set up a NetInstall image for the machines from 2010 using a 10.6.4 dvd (build 10F2108) and another one for the machines from 2011 using a 10.6.6 dvd (build 10J4139).  The build numbers are listed here: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1159?viewlocale=en_US&amp;locale=en_US  I read it should be possible to make a 10.6.7 universal installer (from a iMac 2011 10.6.7 dvd)â€”maybe we could drop the other images then.  But stronghow about NetRestore/strong? What if I installed retail 10.6.3 on an older machine (e.g. from 2009), then update it to 10.6.8 and maybe install all updates? Couldn't I simply delete the user account I'll have to create and get back to the setup screen and make a NetRestore then?  How would you solve this problem?  Thanks in advance, Ben.
