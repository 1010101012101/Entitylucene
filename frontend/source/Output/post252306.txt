How to completely remove Garage Band from macOS? <body> I have GarageBand taking 2.46 GB space on my system even after I deleted the app. Couldn't find any other files when searched via spotlight.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/TLup2.png" alt="Manage Storage"  Is there any way to find these files and remove them?  <answer252319> I used CleanApp to remove apps from mac. You can try it or any similar uninstaller, but you need app installed to remove it. Also check this link https://www.tekrevue.com/tip/delete-garageband/  <answer252323> The app that I have been using to completely delete apps from macOS is called AppDelete. It is a very small app that does one thing and does it well: it finds all of the files associated with an app and asks if you want to delete them. It even does a dry run to show you which files will be deleted, and lets you cherry-pick the files you do or do not want to delete.   A-ppDelete is available @ http://www.reggieashworth.com/appdelete, and gives you a fully functioning app to try before you buy it. OThe developer keeps the app up-to-date and it does run on mac)S 10.12 Sierra.  <answer268848> On a fresh install of Sierra 10.12.2, the GarageBand files are:  precode/Applications/GarageBand  /Library/Application Support/GarageBand  /Library/Audio/Apple Loops/Apple/Apple Loops for GarageBand  /Library/Receipts/com.apple.pkg.GarageBand_AppStore.bom  /Library/Receipts/com.apple.pkg.GarageBand_AppStore.plist  /System/Library/Receipts/com.apple.pkg.MAContent10_AssetPack_0325_AppleLoopsGarageBand1.bom  /System/Library/Receipts/com.apple.pkg.MAContent10_AssetPack_0325_AppleLoopsGarageBand1.plist  ~/Library/Application Scripts/com.apple.STMExtension.GarageBand  ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.STMExtension.GarageBand /code/pre  Delete those and you should be GarageBand free  <comment313904> See http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/38184/how-do-i-remove-garageband also http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/149205/how-do-i-remove-purchased-garageband-content & http://support.apple.com/kb/ht1045 <comment313905> @Tetsujin Second link (http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/149205/how-do-i-remove-purchased-garageband-content) helped me remove 1 GB of data but I still cannot find where is the rest 1.45 GB data stored. <comment325697> [AppCleaner](https://freemacsoft.net/appcleaner/) is very nice and free. <comment349028> Still GarageBand using 1.45 GB !!! <comment363100> Also removing this helps a lot!: Macintosh HD/Library/Audio/Apple Loops <comment363843> last one should be `~/Library/Containers` not `~/library/containers`, and <comment365170> AppCleaner isn't detecting Garageband files. <comment372597> @jason-harrison your edit touches the ability of other apps to work with GarageBand. can you confirm that reinstalling GarageBand reinstates the iLifeMediaBrowser and StorageManagement files? <comment372649> @henry, I cannot but I can add a warning. <comment372796> In that case your edit takes takes this question in a different direction from my intention. Good info though @JasonHarrison! Reverting, but I hope you to post your version as a separate answer
