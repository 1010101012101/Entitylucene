Where file revisions are stored on OS X? <body> Most Apple applications in newer OS X versions, like OS X 10.9, automatically save all changes to all files and documents without your approval, and file versions and revisions are automatically available from within a submenu within the File menu.  Where are such revisions saved, filesystem-wise?  If one is to exchange such files, how would one ensure that none of the history gets exchanged, too?  What if one did want to exchange the history, is there a way to accomplish that as well?  <answer146461> Versions are stored within the same file so a myfile.pages will have all there versions stored within it.  A version is only stored when you save from the file menu or use kbdcmd/kbd- kbdS/kbd  The version is just a bit of text that details the changes made since the last version so is not a copy of the file at that stage.  So if you sent the file to someone else they should get all the previous versions as well.  <comment172573> What about the files like the `.png` images?  Clearly a version is stored not only when `âŒ˜S` is used. <comment172581> Preview doesn't make versions for pictures. The file type of png does not work with versioning on OSX natively. Any pngs within a pages doc for example will be contained within the pages package. (A pages a "file" is in fact a directory of smaller files that are built into the document when opened). Only certain document types are version able. <comment172587> But I do have different versions of a `.png` file in Preview -- it offers the option of getting back to an older version, all through the File menu on OS X 10.9.
