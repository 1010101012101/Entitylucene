Can 2013 MacBook Air output to 2560x1080? <body> I recently purchased a 21:9 LG monitor (model 29UM57) and I'm having difficulty getting my 2013 MBA to output to 2560x1080, which is the monitor's resolution. My max resolution is 1080p.  I purchased this MDP-HDMI adapter, Cable Matters® Gold Plated Mini DisplayPort (Thunderbolt™ Port Compatible) to HDMI Male to Female Adapter - 4K Resolution Ready, hoping that it would help my situation, but my max resolution has not changed.  I'm wondering whether ordering this HDMI cable, AmazonBasics High-Speed HDMI Cable - 6.5 Feet (2 Meters) Supports Ethernet, 3D, 4K and Audio Return, will fix my problem. I don't know what version or whatever my current HDMI cable is.  Please advise.  <answer208050> According to the technical specifications page for the MacBook Air (13-inch, Mid 2013) you should be able to output at 2560x1080.  You might want to consider using one of the two mDP-HDMI adapters that Apple sells on their online store: in the US, at least, those are the Belkin 4K and Moshi.  <answer244885> strongI believe the problem is your HDMI cable - it's not capable of displaying 2560x1080./strong  In other words, it's pre HDMI spec 1.4.  (Also, the link provided to the cable in the original question is out of date; it's no longer available).  Per Apple Support, the 2013 MacBook Air (11" and 13" model) has a Thunderbolt port which also supports mini Display Port  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kL05u.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Since the HDMI cable referenced in the original question is 4K capable (HDMI v1.4 specification), the cable is not the issue.  strongWhat wasn't mentioned was the mDP to HDMI adapter/strong I believe this component to be the "weak link" in this chain because if the mDP to HDMI adapter isn't 4K capable, nothing else will matter.  I recommend getting an strongactive/strong mDP to HDMI adapter (rather than passive) and then connecting your HDMI (v1.4 or above) cable from the adapter to the TV.     img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/VR97Fm.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  That said, I would strongonly/strong recommend this solution for this particular setup, because the LG monitor 29UM57-P only supports HDMI connections.  Ideally, I would want to use mDP to either mDP or DP connections to get the most reliable connection.  <comment248148> **All the HDMI cables are the same!** Did you try changing it from Display Pref's? I've a cheap Thunderbolt to HDMI cable and I was able to run 4K. Keep in mind your PC wasn't made to run that, so it'll take up a lot of resources. <comment248154> Yes, I have tried changing it from Displays in Preferences. Currently it is selected at "Default For Display", but it's maxing out at 1920x1080, which is still not the monitor's native resolution of 2560x1080. The other option,  "Scaled", only gives me options of 1080p, 1080i, 720p, 1600x900 – none of which are of course 2560x1080. <comment301874> I have also ordered the same mdp-hdmi adapter after reading that comment on reddit. Were you able to solve it somehow? Please let me know. Thanks in advance! I was able to solve temporarily using switchresX on MBA after turning off SIP (which I don't feel good about).
