osx - cannot open images or pdfs <body> When I try to open images or pdfs with preview, the application starts but the files never open. When I try to open them from the command line, I get the error message:  precodeLSOpenURLsWithRole() failed with error -1712 for file [...] /code/pre  This was working yesterday, so presumably I did something to break it since then, but I can't for the life of me figure out what it could have been.  <answer154857> There can be a few reasons for this to happen, but the most likely cause is a disk permissions problem.   Disk permissions are flags set for each item in the file system. They define whether an item can be read, written to, or executed.   The codeLSOpenURLsWithRole/code is a function that is used to associate a file with a program.  Open Disk Utility in your Utility folder and run repair permissions.  <comment182168> Try opening the pdf with adobe reader, and images with something else (using the Open with..) to narrow it down to preview it self. For example use the space bar to open in Quick View.
