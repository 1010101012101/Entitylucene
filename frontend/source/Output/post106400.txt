OS X Mavericks App Compatibility? <body> Is there an efficient, quick way to check whether an OS X App is compatible with 10.9 Mavericks (rather than tediously going to each application developer's website) ?  <answer106402> strongRoaringApps.com/strong provides a compatibility list for multiple versions of OS X. You can search for an application by name or compatibility status, to quickly scan for apps that are known to be incompatible.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HBouK.png" height="120" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/SBZsz.png" height="120"  Apps can be submitted by users, and also includes iOS compatibility if applicable.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/g6EUT.png"  You can also check for feature support, to see if apps contain the latest features available in the new OS, such as iCloud Keychain and App Nap.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/azrY7.png" width="400"  <comment124968> Thats just too cool, it works for previous versions of OS X too !!
