How to change the cmd-h command to cmd-e <body> I would like to make kbdCmd/kbd+kbde/kbd do what kbdCmd/kbd+kbdh/kbd does.  I can do this in keyboard config, but I have to do it for every single program, as the title in the menu is "hide safari" for safari, and fx. "hide photoshop" for Photoshop.  Therefore I seek a solution, so that kbdCmd/kbd+kbde/kbd and kbdCmd/kbd+kbdh/kbd does the same thing in every single program.  <answer207622> You can do this with BetterTouch Tool (free) or Keyboard Maestro (paid).   In BetterTouchTool:  ol liChoose the strongKeyboard/strong tab /li liCreate a new strongglobal/strong action with shortcut ⌘E and action ⌘H/li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/CpOkv.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment250416> Cmd-E already has functionality assigned, I assume you are not interested in that? <comment250458> i dont use cmd-E and i think it makes sense that:   cmd+q is quit cmd+w is close window cmd+e is hide app  three combinations that are easy accessible with left hand, i cant reach cmd+h with ease :-) <comment250480> Thank you very much, exactly what i needed
