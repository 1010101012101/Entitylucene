Formatting HTML signature in Mail (Lion) <body> I have created an HTML signature with a local image. I have formatted the signature using a Table.  I have tried to add my signature to mail using the method described here, i.e. open the sig in a browser, Cmd+A on the browser and Cmv+V on the mail signature pane.  This appears to work, but when I go to use the signature the image formatting went bananas on me. Like shown on the pic bellow (mail on top and safari on bottom).  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/cyotD.png" alt="Formatting Went Bananas"  I am not very knowledgable of HTML. But here is my code in case I have something wrong there.  precode    &lt;table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"&gt; &lt;tr&gt;     &lt;td rowspan=3 style="padding-right:5px; border-right:solid 1px #7F7F7F;"&gt;         &lt;img src="waveform-logo_no_quote.png" /&gt; &lt;BR&gt;     &lt;/td&gt;     &lt;td style="padding-left:5px;"&gt;         &lt;font face="Arial" color="#0F243E"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tiago Veloso&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;          &lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt; &lt;font face="Arial" color="#404040"&gt; / Junior Software Engineer &lt;/font&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;BR&gt;     &lt;/td&gt; &lt;tr&gt;     &lt;td style="padding-left:5px;"&gt;         &lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt; &lt;font face="Arial" color="#404040"&gt; t: &lt;/font&gt; &lt;/span&gt;              &lt;font face="Arial" color="#0F243E"&gt; [+XYZ] 555-555-123 &lt;/font&gt; &lt;BR&gt;     &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt;     &lt;td style="padding-left:5px;"&gt;         &lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt; &lt;font face="Arial" color="#404040"&gt; e: &lt;/font&gt; &lt;/span&gt;         &lt;font face="Arial"&gt; &lt;a href="mailto:mail@example.com"&gt;mail@example.com&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/font&gt; &lt;BR&gt;     &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt;     &lt;td align=right style="padding-right:5px; border-right:solid 1px #7F7F7F"&gt;         &lt;font face="Arial" color="#7F7F7F"&gt;&lt;i&gt;adding possibilities&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;     &lt;/td&gt;     &lt;td style="padding-left:5px;"&gt;         &lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt; &lt;font face="Arial" color="#404040"&gt; w:              &lt;/font&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;font face="Arial"&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.website.com"&gt;www.website.com&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/font&gt; &lt;BR&gt;     &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/table&gt; /code/pre  <answer42042> If your code is copied and pasted, the first thing I realize is the following:  precode&lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt; &lt;font face="Arial" color="#404040"&gt; / Junior Software Engineer &lt;/font&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;BR&gt;     &lt;/td&gt; &lt;tr&gt;     &lt;td style="padding-left:5px;"&gt; /code/pre  which means, the end tag  precode&lt;/tr&gt; /code/pre  is missing. This might be the problem due to different renderings between mail and Safari. It's worth a try.   <comment47754> If I may inject something a little off-topic, I would *strongly* encourage you *not* to do that in emails. Most people view emails in plain text, and will not only miss out on the formatting, but receive your image as an attachment. I have never known anyone in a corporate setting to have anything positive to say about mini web pages in signatures. You won't be impressing anyone with this and will likely upset a large subset of people you email. Just a suggestion before you implement this. A simple, plain text signature really is the best way to go. <comment47756> Good catch, but still the same end result. <comment47757> I know, and agree with you. I was asked to use the same signature as my colleagues, they did theirs in MS Outlook. I can't copy and edit theirs, the text formatting as well as the image goes funky. HTML formatting was the closest I could get. <comment193671> I would suggest you to stay on a short text only signature. This is much more professionnal and respectful of your contacts in search of efficiency. For example: I can't wait any image load in my E-mail, my brain have already switched to another space, and my fingers obeyed within the 50 ms (because they are slow :)).
