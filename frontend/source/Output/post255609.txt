iPad Pro iCloud backup without passcode? <body> I bought my wife an iPad Pro for her birthday, a couple weeks ago.  Today, the passcode didn't work.  (She did NOT forget the passcode.  It's a very simple -- perhaps too simple -- code, and she wrote it down besides.)  We attempted a factory reset and restore, since there was an iCloud backup from last night.  But it demands the passcode from the backup.  (It seems to suggest that a PIN from any device will suffice, if you've "forgotten" your passcode.  But nothing happens when she enters that.)  Is there any way to restore an iCloud backup without the passcode?  Or is she now stuck setting up this horrible product again, less than two weeks later?  <comment318522> iCloud backups are encrypted using the passcode set when enabling backups. Nobody (not even Apple) can decrypt them without knowing the passcode. What happens when you tap on Forgot Passcode on the screen where it asks for it during restore?
