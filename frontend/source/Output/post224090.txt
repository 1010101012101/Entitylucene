Large PDF's not opening in IOS mail <body> We have an issue where our users are experiencing problems when opening large PDF's, typically over 2MB in size with iOS Mail. The attachment will download but when opening displays a black screen, sometimes this can be mitigated by installing chrome but not always, installing Adobe Reader has mixed results also.  We run an exchange Active Sync environment with Mobile Iron managing the Apple Devices, there are no policies via Mobile Iron for attachment sizes,  Initial thoughts seem to point to downloading over mobile networks, when the same attachment is downloaded via a good Wi-Fi connection, it will open fine. We have looked on Apple tech support and cannot seem to find a similar problem to ours. Has anyone else been experiencing the same problems and can maybe share some thoughts or possible resolution?
