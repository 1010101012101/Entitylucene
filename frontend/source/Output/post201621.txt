dd cloned NTFS partition not working <body> I have a MacBook Pro with OS X 10.10 and a Windows 7 Boot Camp install.  I just bought a 64 GB flash drive that I would like to put a bootable copy of Windows on, to reestablish the hard drive as OS X only, and figured it would be easiest to just clone the BOOTCAMP partition that I already have.  I formatted the USB to GUID/NTFS and used codedd/code to clone it:  precodedd if=/dev/rdisk0s3 of=/dev/rdisk2s2 bs=512 conv=noerror,sync /code/pre  After 12 hours it finished, and does not work. Windows displays the partition as "RAW"  Anyone have any tips?  <answer201631> You cannot boot windows off a USB flash drive.  You need a special type of flash drive then windows ultimate which comes with a USB bootable creation tool and a specialized USBkey.  There are other methods with which to install USB bootable windows onto and I have tried them and they do not work.
