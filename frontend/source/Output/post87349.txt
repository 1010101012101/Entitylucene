How do I get into boot options with a non-mac keyboard? <body> I boot my mac mini, hold down alt on my non-mac keyboard, but it does not go to boot options.  How do I get to boot options with a non-mac keyboard then?  <answer87376> Apparently, I had to plug the keyboard into the USB port closest to the middle (Mac Mini Late 2012), then it worked.  <answer213079> For iMac retina, I have to plug the windows keyboard to the outer usb port and then press alt key on the left side to boot into the boot menu and see things like bootable usb drive.  <answer268572> I had to plug in a wired USB keyboard.  Wireless Logitech K800 did not work in any ports.  <answer282951> This helped alot. Moving my keyboard to the inner usb worked retenia  <comment102083> Are you holding right or left "alt" key? It should work with left key. http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/5822/can-i-use-a-non-apple-keyboard-with-os-x <comment102087> Left key. Nothing happens except it boots like normal in OS X. <comment102088> Hm, it should work though. Alternatively, you could use the rEFIt Boot menu http://refit.sourceforge.net <comment102102> @bluewoodtree That's what I was thinking, then I tried rEFInd (the fork of rEFIt) and now my mini is stuck in a boot loop. :( <comment102103> @Pier I replied to you above. ^ <comment102149> @trusktr I saw your reply... but I didn't know you had to use a specific port. I'm glad you made it! <comment177793> After about an hour of frustration I found this. Awesome <comment313880> I had to plug the keyboard on the usb near the headphone jack on my iMac 2011, and unplug external drives. <comment337239> This answer was already provided, and accepted.  Can you please explain how your answer differs from the accepted answer? <comment358400> @fsb the difference with Austin M's response is that using a wireless Logitech keyboard did not work for him, however a wired keyboard does. This is exactly the response that brought me here because I had the same problem (Logitech K330 in my case), and it helped me. In this case, there are multiple possible causes for the problem in question; 1) plugging the keyboard into the correct USB port, and 2) using a wired rather than wireless keyboard <comment358415> That's great!  That info should be included in your answer.  It will help others who, like you, had a problem and searched for a solution.  See [answer] for tips on how to leave a good answer and help others.
