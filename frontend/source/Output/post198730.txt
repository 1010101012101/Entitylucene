Pages: How do I change the column size in the footer? <body> In my Pages document, the footer has 3 columns. All three have the same width. Now I want to add text in each footer column but for that I have to change the width of the columns. How do I adjust the width of the columns in the footer?  <answer198733> If I remember well, the column extends itself if the text is longer than the cell.  <answer198821> @Matthieu Riegler is correct.  The portion will automatically resize to fit.  Simply type in or paste your text.  See screenshot below:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8c6xj.png" alt="Footer expansion"
