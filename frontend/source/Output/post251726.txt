Reinstalling GarageBand without purchasing it <body> When I first got my MacBook Pro (10.10.5) it had GarageBand installed on it. However, when I tried to reinstall it, it cost Â£3.99 on the Mac App Store. I'm not sure what version I had previously - all I can say is it looked a lot like the latest version of Logic Pro X, and I think it was the latest. How can I get GarageBand back for free?  <comment312957> For clarification, did you verify you were logged into the App Store with the same Apple ID you used to first purchase GarageBand? <comment312958> Yes, I had the exact same Apple Id - I've never changed it. And I didn't purchase it, It came pre-installed. <comment312959> It should be free to download for everyone now with an IAP for more instruments.  Make sure you're trying to access it from the **Purchased** tab.
