How to move files between Ubuntu and iPhone <body> I recently got an iPhone 6s. At home I do not have Windows or Mac computers, only Ubuntu.  Is there a way to transfer files (music, photos, PDF, or really anything actually) between the PC and the phone? It should not involve syncing via an internet service, as I may have the need to transfer large or private files. Also, I do not want to jailbreak the device.  <answer217846> Yes - there are open source libraries to do this without needing to jailbreak the device.  ul lihttp://www.libimobiledevice.org//li /ul  You might be able to use homebrew to install that package, but I'd guess the http://askubuntu.com people would be better suited to getting the software running now that you know it exists.  ul lihttps://askubuntu.com/a/704677/21224/li /ul  And, it seems you don't even need any software as this feature is built into  ubuntu. Cool!  <comment328282> Since `libimobiledevice` is included in Ubuntu 16.04, you don't have to do anything but plug in the device to your USB and on the first time, you have to confirm **"trust this device" on the iPhone**. Now you can acess the DCIM Folder in Ubuntu. But I found no way to access the Music though, might be a bit more of a hazzle, if someone finds a working answer, please link it here.
