Spam SMS on iPhone - any chance of stopping it? <body> Possibly due to some in-app purchase done by a kid before the in-app purchasing was disabled, an iPhone 5S user receives this type of link weekly  http://wowza1.mobibase.com:8080/apple/emdefinst/em/channel/431/57/57_rtsp.sdp/playlist.m3u8?ticket=.....  Contents:  precode#EXTM3U #EXT-X-VERSION:3 #EXT-X-STREAM-INF:PROGRAM-ID=1,BANDWIDTH=250000 chunklist_w2079735267.m3u8?ticket=same as in url /code/pre  It gos to iTunes but does not does anything further on an iMac so I assume it might only do something on an iPhone.  No-one wishes to click it and I cannot find the url or parts of it mentioned on the net.  I know I can sms STOP to a number if I knew if the number who sent the spam would react and not just be happy I sent a reply and double their effort  Any suggestions as to my next step?  <answer128893> I've never had to block a number but this might work:br Open up the Settings app and go to codeMessages -&gt; Blocked -&gt; Add new/code, this should block all calls and text messages from that number (you have to add it in your Contacts before you can block it, unfortunately)  <comment150928> Ok I'll try it.
