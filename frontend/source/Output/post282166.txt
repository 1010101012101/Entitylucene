I will post more detailed to the answer as I progress through it. Hopefully, this helps someone in the meantime.    BLOCKQUOTE You need to be jailbroken for this to work.  Transfer all your apps to iTunes so you can get them back.  Backup the following file using iFile in the following directory: codeprivate/var/mobile/Library/SpringBoard/codebr codeIconState.plist/code    Backup this file to dropbox using iFile.   Restore iPhone as new. Sync apps back using iTunes. Re-jailbreak phone. Install iFile.  To restore springboard organization, rename the backed up file codeIconState.plist/code to codeDesiredIconState.plist/code and then copy to codeprivate/var/mobile/Library/SpringBoard/code.   Overwrite the existing file if necessary. Respring and springboard layout should be restored.  /BLOCKQUOTE
