Alternate application for using the Photos library? <body> The new Photos application is great for viewing photos. However it's not great for editing them or organizing them, I dearly miss Aperture for that.  Is there any alternate photo application that can work on the Photos library?  I want to keep the iCloud integration, that's why I don't want to switch to Google Photos or Lightroom for example. While Aperture could work, it is not maintained anymore and doesn't work on the same Photos library so I'd rather not switch back to it.  <comment303337> I think Apple's new strategy is to use extensions to send photos out to 3rd party apps like Pixelmator for edits, then round-trip them back into Photos.
