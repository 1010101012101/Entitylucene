How do I download folders through FTP in Terminal? <body> How do I download a whole folder through FTP in Terminal?  <answer18157> Use codescp/code (documentation) or codesftp/code (documentation)  precodescp -r login@myserverip:/remote/directory/path/ mylocaldirectory /code/pre  <answer18158> Another way is to use curl   precodecurl ftp://ftp.com/mp3/* --user login:password -o /myfolder/* /code/pre  I think this is working, or file by file   precodecurl ftp://ftp.com/mp3/mymusic.zip --user login:password -o mymusic.zip /code/pre  I hope this helped.  <answer18181> codemget/code is the closest you can get with the included FTP binary. You have to mkdir and cd/lcd and then get all the files than match a pattern like code*/code  The codeprompt/code toggle may come in handy.   FTP works within a directory, not on directories as containers of files. If you absolutely had to get the job done and ftp was the only tool you could use - you could cobble together an codeexpect/code script to drive ftp for you.   Thankfully there are alternatives like codescp/code|codersync/code|codewget/code to get whole directories worth of files.  <answer121396> follow this instruction :   type  precodeftp /code/pre  then you are in ftp looking like  precodeftp&gt; /code/pre  then you open ip of server  precodeftp&gt; open xx.xxx.xxx.xx /code/pre  then it will ask for username, you will provide  precodeName:(your ftp server): your_username /code/pre  then it wil ask for password  precodePassword:  your_password /code/pre  then you should be logged in and see the ftp shell again, you can type "ls" to list all files and you can navigate like in inix with cd  when you found your filename you can download it with  precodeftp&gt; get filename /code/pre  et voila, the file will be downloaded to the directory you opened shell localy from  you cant download directorys, but you could navigate into your directory and download multiple e.g all files   Task: Download Multiple Files  You need to use mget command as follows to copy multiple files from the remote ftp server to the local system. You may be prompted for a yes/no (Y/N) answer before transferring each file (you can disable prompt by passing the -i option to ftp client). To download all files, enter: ftp mget *  information from http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/linux-unix-ftp-commands/ cheers  <answer213510> I had to download 22'000+ webcam pictures from my web server, which is a bit of a challenge for both the Finder and my FTP program CyberDuck.  So I did the following (based on @bmike's answer):  precodemkdir ~/Desktop/image-dump-myserver ftp ftp://myuser@myserver.com # enter password  # You're now in the ftp console (where the world is still okay)  # Set the local folder lcd ~/Desktop/image-dump-myserver  # cd into the desired folder (`ls`, `pwd` etc. all work here) cd /httpdocs/images  # Toggle the interactive mode prompt  # Download the desired files (all the images in my case) mget *.jpg /code/pre  Then the files are being downloaded into the desired folder:  precodelocal: image1433509292_1582.jpg remote: image1433509292_1582.jpg   229 Entering Extended Passive Mode (|||50001|)   150 Opening BINARY mode data connection for image1433509292_1582.jpg (63626 bytes)   100% |***********************************| 63626        1.51 MiB/s    00:00 ETA   226 Transfer complete   63626 bytes received in 00:00 (0.98 MiB/s)    local: image1427279963_0841.jpg remote: image1427279963_0841.jpg   229 Entering Extended Passive Mode (|||50053|)   150 Opening BINARY mode data connection for image1427279963_0841.jpg (67194 bytes)   100% |***********************************| 67194        1.64 MiB/s    00:00 ETA   226 Transfer complete   67194 bytes received in 00:00 (1.04 MiB/s)   local: image1439798493_1783.jpg remote: image1439798493_1783.jpg   229 Entering Extended Passive Mode (|||50357|)   150 Opening BINARY mode data connection for image1439798493_1783.jpg (48876 bytes)   100% |***********************************| 48876        1.80 MiB/s    00:00 ETA   226 Transfer complete   48876 bytes received in 00:00 (996.81 KiB/s)   ....   /code/pre  <comment19818> That's not what I'm asking. My question is: How do I download a folder via FTP in Terminal? In other words, what commands in FTP do I use to download a folder? <comment19826> OK, thank you very much, but is there a way via FTP to do this? <comment19839> sftp is far superior to FTP +1 <comment19840> Awesome! I was unaware of curl's FTP proclivity. Thanks! <comment19959> Ok...so the bottom line is that I can't download a whole folder at one time; I have to download the individual files, right? <comment19960> Yeah...neither was I. I'll probably use it more often. <comment19968> Yup. Everyone wouldn't be showing wget, sftp, scp and rsync if ftp were up to the task. <comment19971> Thanks...does SFTP allow folder downloading? <comment19980> Oops (sorry) - no. sftp is the same syntax and limitations of ftp - just securing the connection using ssh instead of ftp authentication. <comment19986> Ok...thank you very much!! <comment131901> If you're bound to the FTP protocol you can use [lftp](http://lftp.yar.ru/) to do a recursive download of a directory tree. Old school solution to this problem. <comment282670> @bmike: yes, but older ftp servers may not support sftp. <comment283541> first suggestion does not work. <comment318964> I'm trying your suggestion but getting this: `curl: (78) RETR response: 550` <comment364332> `curl` absolutely cannot handle this. `wget` can.
