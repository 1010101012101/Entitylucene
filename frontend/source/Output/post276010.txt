Regain space from failed attempt to install Windows Using Boot Camp <body> I'm kind of stuck with a 30GB partition on the hard drive of my MBP that I cannot regain. This is what happened:  ol liI used boot camp to try to install Win 10 on a partition/li liOnce it rebooted into Win10 setup, it failed to install the system on the partition/li liI tried to use Boot Camp Assistant to remove the partition but I'm getting this message: /li /ol     The startup disk cannot be partitioned or restored to a single   partition.   Then, I used disk utility to try to merge my main partition with the mentioned above but it won't let me remove it (I tried from recovery mode with the same results)  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mXqmm.png" alt="Minus icon is disabled"  I'm using macOS Sierra 10.12.3 on my Late 2015 15" MBP.  <answer276015> If you're not afraid of the command line  First show your partitioning  precodesudo gpt show /dev/diskX /code/pre  Remove the partition  precodesudo gpt remove -i 2 /dev/diskY /code/pre  Replace X with your disk number, and the index "2" with the partition number of the windows partition.  Afterwards, use the gui to enlarge your partition.  <comment347289> You have to boot to another disk (or Internet Recovery Mode) to accomplish this. You can't simply remove a partition with gpt! <comment347317> Thanks to both. I tried it from the Recovery mode and every time I got an error: `gpt remove: unable to open device '/dev/disk0': Resource busy` <comment347332> run "sudo diskutil unmount /dev/disk0" before? Maybe it got automatically mounted (or with force : sudo diskutil unmountDisk force /dev/diskX)
