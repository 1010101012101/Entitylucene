Twitter client for OSX that posts via proxy? <body> I am looking for a Twitter client for OS X, which does not directly connect to Twitter.  I mean something like Hootsuite, brought to Desktop.  And why I want this? Because Twitter is blocked in my country, and I want a client acts like a proxy by connecting to their own service, and their own servers connect to Twitter.  PS:  ul liHola does not work. I think it's blocked too (maybe I am wrong)./li liTor works, but it is too slow. It takes ages to load the first page of Twitter. I am still looking for a better solution./li /ul  <answer121114> If I understand your question you can use Hola as a free VPN and simulate you're in an other (selectable) country. Works great, installable as plugin in firefox and google chrome.  <answer121125> You can use Spotflux. It runs on system level which means you can use Twitter for OS X and other apps without having to install additional plugins in browsers.  There are also other paid alternatives like TunnelBear or NetShade. I personally use NetShade because it doesnâ€™t require Java like Spotflux.  <comment141170> Upvote because "blocked in my country" makes me want to see you get a solution to this. <comment141171> A VPN (or Tor) might be the better solution in this case though
