OS X - List all active sockets <body> I'm looking for a simple command that will list strongemALL/em/strong currently active and/or otherwise bound TCP &amp; UDP sockets, corresponding port numbers and their respective states (i.e. ESTABLISHED, LISTEN, WAIT, etc.)  Sort of like a strongemreverse/em/strong codenmap/code scan is what I'm going for here.  <answer207241> man netstat(1)     The netstat command symbolically displays the contents of various network-related data structures.  There are a        number of output formats, depending on the options for the information presented.  strongThe first form of the command        displays a list of active sockets for each protocol./strong   precodepse@Mithos:~$ netstat Active Internet connections Proto Recv-Q Send-Q  Local Address          Foreign Address        (state)     tcp4       0      0  localhost.8228         localhost.52662        ESTABLISHED tcp4       0      0  localhost.52662        localhost.8228         ESTABLISHED tcp4       0      0  192.168.1.30.52661     stackoverflow.co.https ESTABLISHED tcp4       0      0  localhost.8228         localhost.52656        ESTABLISHED tcp4       0      0  localhost.52656        localhost.8228         ESTABLISHED tcp4       0      0  localhost.8228         localhost.52651        ESTABLISHED ... /code/pre  <answer262485> This is old, but came a across it when trying to find an ultra quick way of doing this to monitor a script I'm writing, so figured I'd post for your purpose in case anyone else is interested...  Another way to do it is to use lsof.  precodelsof -n -i | grep -e LISTEN -e ESTABLISHED /code/pre  One benefit of this is it shows the process that has established the socket. To see wait, just add -e WAIT on the end of it. I know certain versions of netstat show process with the -b switch, but not the OSX/BSD one apparently...  <comment328844> You need to run this as root (i.e. use `sudo`) to see other users' processes. Also, you can skip the `grep` by telling `lsof` you only want sockets in those states: `sudo lsof -niTCP -sTCP:LISTEN,ESTABLISHED` <comment332098> Yeah sorry. Root access is required to see all ports. Good catch!
