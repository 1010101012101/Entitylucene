Text Alignment in RTL languages issue in some applications <body> As you well know the conventional alignment for RTL languages is Right to Left. Whenever in TexPad--my LaTeX editor, I switch to Persian the input method changes but the alignment does not and it ends up in something like this:   سلام   I want the text to start from the right part of the screen. Hopefully Apple provides this solution:  Control+click--Paragraph direction--Right to left, but it's so cumbersome to repeat this process, or its shorter version Command+Control+Left Arrow Key to make sure the text is in the right position. How to make the app switch the alignment automatically whenever you switch to an RTL language?  Applications like Mac Pages easily do this. Whenever I switch to Persian the cursor springs to the right part of the screen. I want TexPad do this too.  <comment237739> It is the app maker who has to provide this feature, not apple. <comment279006> In addition to @TomGewecke 's comment, if this feature is important for you, TeXstudio and TeXShop do this. But I prefer Texpad because it's more handy.
