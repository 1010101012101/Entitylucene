IOS 9, Calendar Alerts Don't allow setting two different alerts <body> When I enter or edit an event in Calendar I was getting a problem where when you selected a first alert (say 1 day before) then selected a second alert (say 2 hours before) they would sometimes switch order. You could then select them again and they would be stay in the correct order.nNow when you choose a second alert time it becomes the time for both alerts and there is no way to correct them. I tried with the default alerts set to None and to 1 Day doesn't make any difference.
