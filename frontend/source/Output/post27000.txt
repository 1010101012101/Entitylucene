My dashboard widgets are “inactive” since Lion upgrade <body> Since my upgrade from Snow Leopard to Lion, my dashboard widgets are inactive. I can enter the dashboard, move widgets around, add and remove them, but their content is not updated and I cannot interact with them (they do not respond to mouse clicks in their normal fashion).  I have looked through the Console, but there are no warnings there about the dashboard. How can I troubleshoot this?  <answer27227> I ended up deleting all codecom.apple.*dashboard*/code files in code$HOME/Library/code, and then rebooting. That did the trick.
