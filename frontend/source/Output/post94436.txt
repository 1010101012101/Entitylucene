2G iPod touch with iOS 4.2.1 <body> I need a PDF reading app for my 2nd generation iPod touch. I downloaded Adobe Reader, Cloud Readers, iBooks and PDF Reader iPhone edition from the App Store, but all of them require iOS&nbsp;5.  Please suggest the best PDF reading app for iOS 4.2.1, or suggest some steps to upgrade to iOS&nbsp;5.  <answer94437> The 2nd generation iPod touch can’t be upgraded to iOS 5.  One PDF reader that still works on pre-iOS&nbsp;5 devices is strongGoodReader/strong, although according to their site it requires iOS&nbsp;4.3.  If you connect your iPod touch to iTunes, then there should be an option to update to iOS&nbsp;4.3. The instructions in this Apple Support article explain how to update an iOS&nbsp;4 device (see strongUpdate your device using iTunes/strong).  There may be other PDF readers that can run on iOS&nbsp;4 devices, but I don’t know of any by name. Pre-iOS&nbsp;5 devices are now a very thin sliver of the iOS installed base, so most developers have dropped support for them.  <answer94631> Here are some I discovered using vintapps 3.1.3: Advanced PDF Reader, iPDF, PDF Word Excel File Viewer, PdF+, ReflowPPDF  <answer94635> Sorry, but your iPod cannot upgrade to iOS 4.3.1/5.0.1. Many PDF readers have dropped support now as we'll. Sorry.
