iMac Wi-Fi detects internet networks but it doesn't connect to any, but my other PC connects fine to them <body> My iMac Wi-Fi detects internet networks but it doesn't connect to any, but my other PC connects fine to them.  It is a second hand iMac, it worked fine when I set it up, it connected for a day or 2 then no more. It still can detect the network but can't connect. With another PC of mine I can connect fine to the network I'm used to and the same one that the iMac worked with for the first 2 days.  <answer287659> Assuming you've already tried rebooting the iMac, you could try totally removing your Wi-Fi service, restarting your Mac, and adding your Wi-Fi service back again to see if that resolves the issue.  While you don't specify your version of macOS, the steps below should work:  ul liGo to Apple  System Preferences  Network/li liSelect the Wi-Fi service on the left-hand side/li liClick on the cog icon at bottom-left and select Make Service Inactive/li liNow delete the service by clicking on the minus sign (i.e. the kbd-/kbd button) at left of the cog/li liClick on the kbdApply/kbd button/li liExit Network preferences/li liRestart your iMac /li liGo to Apple  System Preferences  Network/li liClick on the plus sign (i.e. the kbd+/kbd button) at left of the cog/li liIn the pop-up window, ensure that Wi-Fi is selected from the drop-down menu/li liClick on the kbdCreate/kbd button/li liMake sure Wi-Fi is on/li /ul  Let me know if this resolves the issue.
