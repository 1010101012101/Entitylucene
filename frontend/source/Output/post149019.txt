Unable to install Wi-Fi printer drivers on one of our 20 MacBook Pros <body> We have 20 or so brand new MacBook Pro's and I've successfully installed the Officejet 6500 E709n [DBB4c0] printer on all of them except for one.  This one MacBook Projust fails to find the driver for the Wi-Fi-printer. It see's the printer &amp; tries to find the driver. But then fails and offers to install the generic driver.  I've updated all the software on the MacBook Pro via the App Store.  The MacBook Pro can surf the web. I haven't messed with any firewall settings and all the other MacBook Pro have installed the driver properly and work wonderfully with the printer.  Is there some trick I can use to figure out what's going on?  Can I manually copy the drivers from my MacBook Pro and manually select those drivers, during the printer install step?
