Determine xcode command line tools version <body> How do I determine what version(s) of xcode command line tools I have?  I tried doing  precode$ gcc --version Configured with: --prefix=/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr --with-gxx-include-dir=/usr/include/c++/4.2.1 Apple LLVM version 6.1.0 (clang-602.0.49) (based on LLVM 3.6.0svn) Target: x86_64-apple-darwin14.1.0 Thread model: posix /code/pre  Is the Apple LLVM version the same as the version of xcode command line tools?  <answer181953> I'm answering against the more recent version (where the tools actually are in the Xcode.app pkg, but I'm pretty sure that if the path &amp; output returned by codexcode-select -p/code, codegcc -v/code,  and codellvm-gcc -v/clang -v/code are harmonious then they should be the same, i.e.   precode$ xcode-select -p /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer  $ gcc -v Configured with: --prefix=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/usr --with-gxx-include-dir=/usr/include/c++/4.2.1 Apple LLVM version 6.1.0 (clang-602.0.49) (based on LLVM 3.6.0svn) Target: x86_64-apple-darwin14.3.0 Thread model: posix  $ llvm-gcc -v Apple LLVM version 6.1.0 (clang-602.0.49) (based on LLVM 3.6.0svn) Target: x86_64-apple-darwin14.3.0 Thread model: posix  $ clang -v Apple LLVM version 6.1.0 (clang-602.0.49) (based on LLVM 3.6.0svn) Target: x86_64-apple-darwin14.3.0 Thread model: posix /code/pre  Note that llvm-gcc is a link to clang,    precode$ls -al /usr/bin/llvm-gcc lrwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel  5 Oct 19  2014 /usr/bin/llvm-gcc -&gt; clang /code/pre  so the output of codellvm-gcc -v/code and codeclang -v/code should be identical although that may or may not be the case for you (see https://stackoverflow.com/a/5708732/602581 for some more details)   <answer181994> Finding the CLI version number depends on the combination of which particular OS and which particular CLI Tools are installed. One of these should work:  On Yosemite &amp; Mavericks:  precodepkgutil --pkg-info=com.apple.pkg.CLTools_Executables /code/pre  on Mountain Lion:  precodepkgutil --pkg-info=com.apple.pkg.DeveloperToolsCLI /code/pre  <comment298703> +1. It was really hard to craft a Google search to find an answer to this. I searched `xcode command line tools installed version` but got a lot of irrelevant matches. Btw, did Dog G.'s answer work for you? <comment298705> The version that these tools output isn't necessarily the same as the Xcode command line tools version. Example, `clang --version` returns `Apple LLVM version 7.3.0 (clang-703.0.31)`, while Doc G.'s `pkgutil` command returns `version: 7.3.1.0.1.1461711523`. <comment298706> If they ever change the pkg name again, running `pkgutil --pkgs | grep -i tools` should help locate it.
