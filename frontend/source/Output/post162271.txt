How to remap F4 to Dashboard or Notifications on a MacBook Pro in Yosemite? <body> I had this working fine in Tiger thru Mavericks, but it broke in Yosemite. Pressing kbdF4/kbd now launches Launchpad, and only kbdfn/kbdkbdF4/kbd triggers Dashboard.   Launchpad is useless compared to Spotlight or even the Dock. I'd much rather have the kbdF4/kbd key triggering Dashboard again, or even Notifications (which is really starting to come along).   I have:  ul licodeSystem Prefs / Mission Control / Keyboard and Mouse Shortcuts / Show Dashboard/code set to codeF4/code./li licodeSyst Prefs / Keyboard / Keyboard / Use all F-keys as standard function keys/code unticked./li licodeSyst Prefs / Keyboard / Shortcuts / Launchpad &amp; Dock / Show Launchpad/code unticked. /li licodeSyst Prefs / Keyboard / Shortcuts / Mission Control / Show Dashboard/code set to codeF4/code. /li /ul  Ideas? Hopeless?

From what you’ve described as your settings, it should be working…  <answer195773> I have the same settings described in the message above and I don't get the Dashboard either. I have ended up assigning the top-right corner as a "hot corner" that shows the Dashboard.br System Preferences  Mission control  Hot corners (left-bottom corner of the window).  <answer248897> System Preferences  Mission Control  Dashboard (drop-down) Change dashboard drop down box from "off" to either "As overlay" or "As space"  Side note: I do have Show Dashboard set as F4 as seen below in this same Mission Ctrl window. Also, I have the same settings as was mentioned in the original posted question.  <answer275114> I mapped dashboard to F6 on my Mac Pro with a desktop keyboard. It doesn't require pressing the fn button since this key does not have a special use. But I think on Macbooks the F5 and F6 keys do keyboard illumination so that might not work on a laptop.  <comment189863> I know the warning icon you mean, but I don't see it on any of the Keyboard Shortcuts submenus. <comment189864> Are you able to produce my desired behavior on a similar machine build?
