Sudo askpass not working on macOS Sierra <body> I use askpass to run commands as root. In file pass.txt I have this written:  precode#!/bin/bash  echo mypassword /code/pre  And then I run it like this:  precodeexport SUDO_ASKPASS=pass.txt ; SUDO_ASKPASS=pass.txt ; sudo -Ak true /code/pre  Before Sierra this worked just fine, but now I get an error:  precodesudo: unknown defaults entry `askpass' /code/pre  But askpass actually works. BTW, I get this error every time I run sudo. That's the end of shudders file after exports:  precodeDefaults:ALL askpass=/Users/username/pass.txt /code/pre  How to fix this?  <answer252158> Remove the line codeDefaults:ALL askpass=/Users/&lt;username&gt;/pass.txt/code from the file /etc/sudoers. I don't know the purpose of the line â€“ at least it seems to be malformed compared to other emDefaults/em entries and reading codeman sudoers/code.  A proper line may be: codePath askpass = /Users/&lt;username&gt;/pass.txt/code. I can't test this though.
