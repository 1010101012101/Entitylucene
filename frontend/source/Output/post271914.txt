Transfer from iPhone SE to computer <body> I recently built a new computer and I am about to jailbreak my phone. I am also going to reset it, but I want to be able to get my music back to my phone after it is restored. My problem is, most of the music on my phone I ripped from CD's and I don't have those files anymore. I really, really don't want to rip those 13 gigabytes of CD's all over again. Is there a way I can transfer music from my iPhone to my PC?
