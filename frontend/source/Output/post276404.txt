What are those "._<filename>" files show in tar verbose output, but are not in the untarred directory? <body> Some hidden files appear in the verbose output of codetar/code, but then do not exist in the directory where the codetar/code output is deposited. I am surprised by this because I thought working in emTerminal/em command line was pretty brass tacks. What you see is always what you get?    pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"code/tmp$ tar xfv drills_grp01.tar x Drills_grp01/ x Drills_grp01/._.DS_Store  // &lt;-- what? x Drills_grp01/.DS_Store x Drills_grp01/._symm_hrz.txt  // &lt;-- what? x Drills_grp01/symm_hrz.txt x Drills_grp01/._symm_vrt.txt  // &lt;-- what? x Drills_grp01/symm_vrt.txt x Drills_grp01/._table_similarKj.txt  // &lt;-- what is this? x Drills_grp01/table_similarKj.txt /code/pre    pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"code/tmp$ cd Drills_grp01 /tmp/Drills_grp01$ ls -a .DS_Store     symm_hrz.txt     symm_vrt.txt     table_similarKj.txt /code/pre  In the codels -a/code output, where are all those code._*/code files I saw in the verbose output?  The life cycle of this tar file is:  ol lifiles created in emWindows XP/em, using emTextEdit/em, saved to FAT32 file system.  /li licompressed using the "emZIP/em" file format.  /li licopied to MacOS (Extended / Jounaled).  /li lidecompressed using codeunzip/code  /li licodetar cfv stuff.tar Stuff/code  /li licodebzip2 stuff.tar/code/li /ol  I'm curious.br Why does the verbose output of codetar xfv stuff.tar/code not match the actual output?br Also, this means that the verbose output of strongany/strong command in emTerminal/em might not match the actual output? Trivial yes, but just something to be aware of.
