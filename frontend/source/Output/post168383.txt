Removing a contact from a folder in Yosemite Contacts software <body> I created a folder in the Yosemite Contacts program and added some people to it. I'd like to remove a contact from the folder but keep the contact in my overall contacts database.  How do I do this?  The delete button deletes it completely.  Here is what I see if I select a name in a group and press delete.  I don't get the dialog box above with the "Remove from Groups" option:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yn5vg.jpgk" alt="enter image description here"  If I select the contact and use the Edit menu the "Remove from Group" item is greyed out:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/npNMK.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer168404> By Folder I think you mean Group.  When you hit the delete button or use the Menu. Contacts.app will give you a choice of deleting the Contact (card) from everywhere or just the Group.  You should choose the strongRemove from group/strong. This will then only Remove it from the group and not delete it from the Contacts.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rLDAT.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer168772> There's a strongRemove From Group/strong Menu item.  Select Your contact in the Group and open codeEdit/code - codeRemove From Group/code.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YwNkz.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer168995> It turns out that I was creating my groups within an Exchange account.   If I made the groups in the "On my Mac" area then the "Remove from Group" functionality works normally.   <comment197640> This doesn't really seem to belong on SO. It should be on the Apple Stackexchange. <comment197641> There's an Apple Stackexchange?  I didn't know that. Thanks! <comment197867> Strange. I don't see groups in Yosemite. I only see "Folders." and I did not see the dialog box. Did I set something up wrong? <comment197876> What app are you using? Show some screen shots <comment198339> Thanks for the update. Can you edit the contact? <comment198343> The reason I ask that was I suspect its a permission issue. You can try the normal `Disk Utility.app` repair permissions or try the suggestion on this page I just found. https://discussions.apple.com/thread/5011903  There is to much in there for me to repost as an answer and I have not tried it. But try `Disk Utility.app` first. <comment198418> The permission idea was a good clue, and I figured it out, will post answer below.
