QuickTime can't play 4k video while VLC can <body> I'm on mountain lion 10.8.5 and recently my friend gave me a 4K resolution video. When I used QuickTime player, the video is very sharp and some of the text in it can't be seen correctly. However when I used VLC to play it, it played without any errors and I can clearly see the text. I like the UI of QuickTime player, so is there any way to make it appear on QT?  <answer108017> Let's be honest : appart of the UI, Quicktime X a crapy software in term of compatibility. And it became crappier since the development of Perian has stopped. And on Mavericks it's even worse (Perian doesn't work anymore ...). The cause : QuickTime X is based on the AV Foundation Framework which is only powerful with H.264 stuff (yeah the file format sold on iTunes).   VLC is powered by a different video library than QuickTime and it's know to be one of the most compatible player yet.   strongTLDR:/strong So no there is no there is no solution yet. Let's hope the situation will evolve.   <answer108019> You might want to consider using MPlayerX. It has a very clean interface and works very well, supporting pretty much any format like VLC (and unlike QuickTime, which supports pretty much nothing).  <comment126669> Is your video file an mp4 or an avi/mkv  ? <comment126670> @MatthieuRiegler It's a `.mp4` file <comment126671> Think I'm going to stick with VLC. <comment126672> Think I'm going to stick with VLC. <comment172902> Perian was the bomb!
