DNS resolution got extremly slow after issuing ipconfig commands <body> I wanted to inspect DHCP messages. To produce them I issued these 2 commands:  precodesudo ipconfig set en0 BOOTP sudo ipconfig set en0 DHCP /code/pre  After that, I am having severe DNS resolution difficulties. It takes up to a minute and several refreshs to even resolve google. What could be the reason for this behaviour?  Output from ifconfig en0:  precodeen0: flags=8963&lt;UP,BROADCAST,SMART,RUNNING,PROMISC,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST&gt; mtu 1500     ether "IPv6 goes here"      inet6 "IPv6 goes here"%en0 prefixlen 64 scopeid 0x4      inet6 "IPv6 goes here" prefixlen 64 autoconf      inet6 "another IPv6 goes here" prefixlen 64 autoconf temporary      inet 192.168.1.5 netmask 0xffffff00 broadcast 192.168.1.255     nd6 options=1&lt;PERFORMNUD&gt;     media: autoselect     status: active /code/pre  EDIT: nslookup does not work  <answer275884> Could your DNS server be very slow and you are clearing the local cache of results and then seeing the delay of the actual resolution / forward / lookup after running the codeipconfig/code  You can time DNS crudely from the command line before and after the script commands:  precodetime host www.google.com &gt;&amp; /dev/null /code/pre  <comment299066> LQ/too broad "...inspected some DHCP messages. To get them flowing..."? Please add the "messages" and what does "flowing" mean? Please add the output of `ifconfig en0`. <comment299069> What's so special about google's domain names that you expect those to resolve quicker than others? <comment299071> I edited by question. I heard about google circumventing tier 1 ISP by building it's own network, therefore avoiding congestion (and fees from tier 1 ISPs), resulting in faster user experience. Not sure if circumvention also applies for DNS lookups regarding google domains.
