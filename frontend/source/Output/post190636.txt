iOS third-party keyboard with functionality to swipe down on letters to enter numbers/symbols? <body> On some Android keyboards (for example), the main display is a full QWERTY keyboard with numbers or symbols under the letters. You can either press directly on a letter to type it, or swipe down on the letter to type the associated number/symbol. This allows you to enter numbers/symbols much faster than if you had to switch to a separate numbers/symbols pane. Is there any third-party iOS keyboard with this functionality?  <answer190638> FancyKey by Pinssible Labs allows for this, and is the best replacement keyboard for iOS I've used. Setup is simple, and turning on Swype is as easy as switching to the FancyKey Keyboard, tapping the gear icon, and tapping the "Swipe input" switch on. Your keyboard with default to the custom keyboard until you change it by tapping the globe icon.
