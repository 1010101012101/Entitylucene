How to check VT-x status on MacBook Pro <body> I need to enable VT-x on my MacBook Pro but I don't know if it's already enabled or not. is there a command for checking the status, enabling or disabling VT-x?  Those are the device specifications:  MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Early 2015)  strongOS/strong: OS X El Capitan 10.11.2br strongCPU/strong: 2.7 GHz Intel Core i5 br strongRAM/strong: 8 GB 1867 MHz DDR3  <answer224879> According to Intel® Core™ i5-5257U Processor, it supports Intel Virtualization Technology (VT-x).  You can also from Terminal use the following command:  precodesysctl -a | grep machdep.cpu.features /code/pre  If you see strongVMX/strong in the output, then the CPU supports the Intel VT-x feature.  If you don't want to have to read through the output of CPU features and just see if VMX is there, then use: codesysctl -a | grep -o VMX/code  From Intel-based Macs: Using VT-x virtualization technology:     Intel VT-x technology is enabled on Intel-based Macs. Make sure your Intel-based Mac has all available EFI updates installed; also update any third-party virtualization software.   Therefore there is no reason to check the status.  As to enabling/disabling, there is no direct user interface for that.  Since it is enabled by default, the only way I can think of to disable it would be to hack the EFI Firmware. Which is not something I'd recommend doing!  <comment351102> This link indicates it is possible for virtualization to be disabled: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT203296 <comment365046> I see **VMX** in my output, but still get errors from Android Studio saying `/dev/kvm is not found`
