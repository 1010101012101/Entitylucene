Have Mountain Lion Messages running but hidden from dock? <body> I use Mountain Lion (10.8.3) Messages exclusively to monitor text messages sent to my cell phone. When I first start my computer or login Messages is hidden (I don't want it in my dock) and if I receive a text message I get a banner alert from notification center. If I open the message I enter the Messages application and the running application shows up in my dock.   What I would like to do is have Messages behave as it does when I first start the computer (receiving notifications but not visible in the dock as running) all of the time (I assume it's running in the background somehow).   If I click 'Hide' on the Messages icon in the doc it remains visible, and if I quit messages entirely after reading a message I stop receiving notifications.  I have tried editing its codeInfo.plist/code to include  precode&lt;key&gt;LSUIElement&lt;/key&gt; &lt;string&gt;1&lt;/string&gt; /code/pre  as suggested in the Hide a running app from dock thread, but the behavior remains the same.  Thanks!   <answer89812> 10.8 is a bit more strict than previous versions, with respect to what should be a boolean value.  If you change as below, it should work like you want.  precode&lt;key&gt;LSUIElement&lt;/key&gt; &lt;true/&gt; /code/pre  Note that in this mode, not only is an app hidden from the dock, but the menu bar does not display either when the program is active.  <comment105506> Works (although, as you said, it hides more than just the icon from the dock)- Thanks!
