Wired mouse detected but not responding <body> I have a wired mouse connected to my Macbook Pro, OS X 10.9.5.  The mouse is powered, but completely unresponsive.  The mouse works on my windows machine, and the usb port on my Macbook works with other mouses/devices.  The mouse is detected in my System Information as   precode  USB OPTICAL MOUSE:   Product ID:   0x0a4c   Vendor ID:    0x15d9   Version:   1.00   Speed:    Up to 1.5 Mb/sec   Location ID:  0x14100000 / 8   Current Available (mA):   500   Current Required (mA):    100 /code/pre  I have tried resetting my PRAM, with no effect.    Does anyone know what steps I can take to fix this?  <answer177089> I think your Mac book not providing proper current and voltages. A normal wired mouse requires 5 volts of voltages and 0.9 ampere of current to work properly   <comment209291> Looks like you're not the only one to have problems with this [particular brand of mouse](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/5233168). <comment209336> 1 ampere for a mouse? Must be a heavy duty mouse then :-) USB 2.0 allows up to 500 mA, USB 3.0 up to 900 mA. <comment209341> sorry it was my mistake... :-) <comment311451> I have a very similar mouse i guess. My problem is it gets disconnected randomly.  ```    USB OPTICAL MOUSE :            Product ID: 0x0f97           Vendor ID: 0x18f8           Version: 1.00           Speed: Up to 1.5 Mb/sec           Location ID: 0x14100000 / 26           Current Available (mA): 1000           Current Required (mA): 100           Extra Operating Current (mA): 0```  So it looks like we got to buy a new mouse :(
