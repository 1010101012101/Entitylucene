Auto-fill username and password in Fluid.app webapp <body> I'd like to have my Fluid.app webapps auto-login to various sites (Gmail, DropBox, etc.) using passwords stored in AgileBits 1Password.app.  I'd appreciate directions or suggestions on how to go about this, if it is possible.  <answer212935> 1Password only integrates with a browser that supplies an API which Fluid does not see this thread on AgileBit's website and Fluid does not seem to be able to read any OS APIs to get stored information   Patrick Welker has used using Keyboard maestro to copy around but this uses Apple's keychain, I have not tried this
