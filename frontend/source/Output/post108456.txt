MacOffice 2011 crashes on Mavericks <body> I know that this has been posted several times and each time it's a slightly different description. Neither one fits to the behaviour on my iMac (Mid 2011 / 32GB RAM) nor does any of the solutions solve it.  But, long story short. Any app from Office 2011 for Mac (Word, Excel or Powerpoint) crashes upon rightclick with the same error message.  from MERP it says:  precodeMicrosoft Error Reporting log version: 2.0  Error Signature: Exception: EXC_CRASH (SIGTRAP) Date/Time: 2013-11-05 19:43:30 +0000 Application Name: Microsoft PowerPoint Application Bundle ID: com.microsoft.Powerpoint Application Signature: PPT3 Application Version: 14.3.8.130913 Crashed Module Name: merp Crashed Module Version: 2.2.4.130913 Crashed Module Offset: 0x00004422 Blame Module Name: MicrosoftComponentPlugin Blame Module Version: 14.3.8.130913 Blame Module Offset: 0x0000c4d8 Application LCID: 1033 Extra app info: Reg=en Loc=0x0409 Crashed thread: 2 /code/pre  so I took Solution 1 that i found (Update MERP to version 2.2.8) -- without success :-(   precodeit didn't update correct somehow, in Finder it shows as Version 2.2.8 but in it's report it lists itself as version 2.2.4 /code/pre  Now I found Solution 2 (re-install 14.3.8 aka SP3) -- no success either :-(   precodeMERP now displays version 2.2.9 in Finder but still 2.2.4 in it's report. /code/pre  Solution 3 was disabling MERP -- didn't help so far but shed some brighter light on the issue as follows  precodeProcess:         Microsoft Excel [301] Path:            /Applications/Microsoft Office 2011/Microsoft Excel.app/Con- tent/MacOS/Microsoft Excel Identifier:      com.microsoft.Excel Version:         14.3.8 (14.3.8) Build Info:      Unknown-130913~0 Code Type:       X86 (Native) Parent Process:  launchd [154] Responsible:     Microsoft Excel [301] User ID:         501  Date/Time:       2013-11-05 20:35:44.179 +0100 OS Version:      Mac OS X 10.9 (13A603) Report Version:  11  Crashed Thread:  4  Dispatch queue: com.apple.datadetectors.dynamiclookup  Exception Type:  EXC_BREAKPOINT (SIGTRAP) Exception Codes: 0x0000000000000002, 0x0000000000000000  Application Specific Information: *** Terminating app due to uncaught exception 'NSInternalInconsistencyException',  reason: 'condition "DDABAddRecord should not be called with NULL type"' /code/pre  Everything else that i tried before was:  ul liuninstall Office 2011 German completely according to MS KB 23987668/li liinstall Office 2011 German/li liupdate MERP and MS AutoUpdater/li liuninstall Office 2011 German completely according to MS KB 23987668/li liinstall Office 2011 strongEnglish/strong/li liswitch OS language from German to English/li liupdate MERP and MS AutoUpdater/li li...

(in German here: http://www.bitprotect.de/loesung-abstuerze-von-office11-nach-upgrade-auf-macos-10-09-maverick/)  for all others, the short summary is:  ol lidisable MERP  ul liGo to /Library/Application Support/Microsoft/MERP2.0  /li liopen Microsoft Error Reporting.app/li ligo to Preferences and uncheck "Enable Microsoft Error Reporting"/li /ul/li liopen Terminal/li liexecute "defaults write com.Apple.Finder AppleShowAllFiles TRUE;killall Finder"/li liin Terminal go to /Library/Contextual Menu Items/li lidelete all files and directories in this folder "rm strongfilename/strong" or "rm -r strongdirectoryname/strong"/li liexecute "defaults write com.Apple.Finder AppleShowAllFiles FALSE;killall Finder"/li /ol  open office program and rightclick to check if it works. -- yes it does!  optionally you can now re-enable MERP.  <answer110113> I had a similar problem - MS Office crashes after the Mavericks update. The problem was solved once the following recent update was manually applied to Office. Hope it helps.  http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=40352  <answer111278> The Office 14.3.8 update did NOT work for me but the following DID. This was via phone with a Microsoft Level 2 Tech Support agent - they are aware of this issue with Mavericks and will be releasing an update in the next month.  ol listrongRestart your Mac in Safe Mode/strong (press shift key when the initial screen is blank, release it when you see the progress bar in grey Apple icon screen)/li liGo to strongSystem Preferences/Users &amp; Groups/Login Items/strong/li listrongRemove/strong any items which have a warning triangle next to them (unlock if you see them greyed out) and are tagged as "Unknown"/li liIn strongApplications/Font Book/strong, go to strongFile/Restore Standard Fonts.../strong/li liAfter "Proceed", you should get an all clear/li liTry to open any Office application (still in Safe Mode) - they should be fine/li liRestart and have a cup of tea/li li:)/li /ol  <answer113152> Many people have written that the only working version of Office on Mavericks is the English one. There seems to be a language issue (I have the German version 14.3.9 which still crashes).  <comment132795> thanks, but didnt help here <comment132797> thanks, didn't help either with Excel 14.3.9 <comment132798> not even 14.3.9 works here
