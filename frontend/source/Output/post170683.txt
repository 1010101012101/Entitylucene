Disable iPhone numeric keyboard auto-toggle <body> When using the iOS keyboard and inserting an apostrophe or a space the keyboard automatically toggles from the numeric screen back to the qwerty input screen. I'm finding this really annoying, so how do I turn this 'feature' off?  E.g. When typing in a UK postcode or commenting numbers in a spreadsheet cell  <answer193448> I only have experience with iOS 7 and iOS 8. Sadly I don't have any experience with iOS 6 or lower.  Ok I might have found a solution:  IOS 7, 8 AND 9 beta 1 and 2:  1) Go to settings, then keyboards   2) Uncheck ALL the options on that page.  3) Test it (in the app where it's affecting you)  OR:  Just uncheck split keyboard and see if that works.  <comment230597> Not an option. Not going to disable half the functionality for the occasional postcode. <comment230598> Added a new line. Try to see if it fixes it by us checking split keyboard <comment230599> I don't have an option for split keyboard, that's iPad only. <comment230645> Your 1st solution doesn't work on 7.1.2 :(. <comment230799> Do you have your keyboard set to English UK? You can check this in Settings  General  Keyboards <comment230802> Should we expect it to?
