Unlock delay for iPhone 6 <body> So I waste too much time on my phone. Checking Facebook and Twitter, browsing to read unproductive things, etc. I should just stop, but I'm curious if there is a technological deterrent to my habit.  I suspect that an unlock delay would be perfect. If I knew that my phone would take 30 or 60 seconds to unlock, then I would be significantly less likely to pick up my phone at all, when I don't emneed/em anything. I need to have my phone near me and on for work, but I would like it if the time-wasting aspects of my phone were less convenient.  Is there any sort of setting or app that could help with this?  <answer193045> There's no setting to delay the unlock, but what you could do is go to codeSettings/code  codeTouch ID &amp; Passcode/code, switch off codeUse Touch ID for iPhone Unlock/code, and then switch off codeSimple Passcode/code.  Switching off codeUse Touch ID for iPhone Unlock/code will disable your fingerprint's ability to unlock your phone, and switching off codeSimple Passcode/code will make you write a passcode that can be any length you want, with any characters you want. You can make the only way into your phone long/inconvenient enough to not be worth the hassle of typing on such a regular basis.
