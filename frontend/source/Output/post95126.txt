Safari clear cache on quit <body> Is there any way of convincing Safari to clear the cache when it quits? If not from Safari's options, then maybe an extension that does this?  I would use private browsing instead, but unfortunately it doesn't seem to work well for me (some sites say they can't use cookies, and a lot of functionality is broken with this enabled).  <answer95130> You can enable the emDevelop/em menu to clear the cache if you don't want to clear your history.  From your Safari menu bar click strongSafari  Preferences/strong, then select the emAdvanced/em tab, then emShow Develop menu in menu bar/em.  Now, from the menu bar click strongDevelop   Empty Caches/strong or use the keyboard shortcut, kbdOption/kbd+kbdCommand/kbd+kbdE/kbd.  <answer95131> The menubar app Cookie can clear exactly what you want to clear at quit, at timed intervals, or both.  Can also clear thosenefarious Tracking Cookies, as well as non-favorite cookies, Flash and other databases -- and do this for all your browsers.  Not part of the company--just think especially with Tracking, it's a must have.

Let's do this job by Safari by automated action:  precode# clear cache and history of safari # LB 10'2016 Ver 05  set SafariQuit to false # say to Safari good bye if we want  tell application "Safari" to activate # a good way to start safari without cookies tell application "System Events" to tell process "Safari"     set frontmost to true      click (menu item "Verlauf löschen …" of menu 1 of menu bar item "Verlauf" of menu bar 1)      if exists sheet 1 of front window then # check, if safari is runnung without of window         click button "Verlauf löschen" of sheet 1 of front window     else         click button "Verlauf löschen" of front window         set SafariQuit to true # safari is running without window and also not used actually     end if end tell  if SafariQuit then     tell application "Safari"         quit     end tell end if  # accessibility Inspector.app (Xcode) # http://www.leancrew.com/all-this/2012/04/accessibility-inspector/ /code/pre  Make'n App from this, add a nice "Safari in Waste".icns, put it in the dock and have fun. Don't forget to give this new App the rights to act in   precodesystem|safety|privacy|helper. /code/pre  <comment320346> This script works now for Safari Version 10.0 (11602.1.50.0.10)
