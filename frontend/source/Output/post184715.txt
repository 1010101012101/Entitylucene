Icon is not disappearing after removing the app <body> I've jailbroken iPhone4s (iOS 7.1) with pangu. Through cydia I've installed Terminal app. Then I've uninstalled the app. But the icon on the screen is not going. Does that mean uninstallation was not successful? If so how can I remove that completely?  Steps taken to uninstall  ul licydia - installed(option) - chose terminal - modify (top right corner) - chose remove/li /ul  <answer184716> Run codeuicache/code as mobile, then respring (codekillall SpringBoard/code).  <comment219030> I did uicache.. then how about respring? <comment219031> @Venu `killall SpringBoard` <comment219032> yep! But it is showing 'No matching process belonging to you were found' <comment219035> What steps precisely did you take to "uninstall the app"? Did you power cycle the device? Is a total wipe an option? (Just use the edit button to clarify things if the existing answer isn't what you seek) <comment219037> please refer the edited question :) <comment219038> @Venu SpringBoard is case sensitive.
