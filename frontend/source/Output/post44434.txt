Cannot rearrange Launchpad Icons <body> I just installed Lion over Snow Leopard.  I was trying to rearrange the icons in Launchpad into folders/groups.  It worked for a while, but sometime in the middle of rearranging I could no longer take previously foldered/grouped icons out of the group I had previously put them.  I performed the killall tutorial to reset Launchpad, only to have to start over again.  I tried restarting, etc., but I ran into the same problem again after a while of rearranging.  I cannot find anything online regarding being locked out of rearranging in Launchpad.  Has anyone else had this problem?  How can I fix it?  <answer44488> You can either...  ul linuke the Launchpad data and start clean or/li lirefresh the Launchpad database to get all apps loaded and movable./li /ul  Let me know which one works.  <comment50491> Are you the system admin?
