Where should I store command line applications? <body> When I download command line applications they are located in my code~/Downloads//code directory. But I feel this is wrong place to have a command line application located. Where in the Mac OS X filesystem should I store command line applications?  code/Applications//code also feels wrong, itÂ´s more for desktop applications. And code/bin//code sounds more for applications that belongs to OS X.  <answer98626> Since OS X comes from a unix heritage, you will want to store system files in code/usr/local/bin/code for command line applications and scripts that belong to the system locally and not to a specific user. You may need to create this directory first by running:  precodesudo mkdir -p /usr/local/bin /code/pre  You can move any command line application to that folder by running:  precodesudo mv my-binary /usr/local/bin/ /code/pre  To make sure that code/usr/local/bin/code is part of your standard search path in Terminal, check the content of code/etc/paths/code and add it if necessary:  precodegrep -w /usr/local/bin /etc/paths || sudo sh -c 'echo /usr/local/bin &gt;&gt; /etc/paths' /code/pre  hr  Some users make a second directory for user level scripts, but this is even more subject to personal preference.  I typically make a bin directory in each user folder and then hide it from Finder - but you can make that decision yourself whether you want it hidden:  precode mkdir ~/bin  chflags hidden ~/bin /code/pre  In this case, you'll want to have each user's path include this location by modifying the shell startup scripts (code~/.bash_profile/code for bash which is the standard shell)  precode export PATH=$PATH:~/bin /code/pre  or by hard coding the path to each app when you run it.  <answer98627> Consider creating an code/opt/code directory, which is another location that custom Unix software would appear by convention.  <comment115817> I agree with your sentiment that putting things directly in /bin or /Applications is generally poor form. Patrix's answer is the most canonical location I've seen for general command line storage of programs and scripts. <comment115853> Duplicate: http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/80902/20459 <comment115867> I don't see these as duplicate since the [linked question](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/80902/where-should-shell-tools-be-installed?lq=1) seems more about juggling several third party choices and this is more a pure - where do my manually downloaded apps go. <comment115904> `/opt/` is very useful for complete applications whereas `/usr/local/bin/` is more appropriate for standalone command line scripts. It is often preferable to use `/opt/` in instances where a collection of related scripts act as a library (e.g., `/opt/myscriptslib/bin/`). <comment116188> This is absolutely the best suggestion, and the one that I would give to anyone who asked. I'll add only 2 things: 1) /etc/launchd.conf might also be a place where the path needs to be added, 2) although I use /usr/local/ for Unix utils installed via `homebrew` for my own shell scripts I have a ~/Dropbox/bin/ which I also added to my $PATH so I have all my custom shell scripts on all of my Macs. But I do that in addition to /usr/local/bin/ not instead of it. <comment153106> /usr/local/bin is **the** traditional UNIX spot for a user's scripts, which gives access to any other user on the system. Placing scripts there will put the scripts in all users' $PATH effortlessly. But I believe the **Mac** way, since most Macs have a single user, is to create a `~/bin` directory, make it invisible with `chflags uchg ~/bin`, and add it to the users `~/.bash_profile` to make it part of the users $PATH. `~/bin` is a superior location for security and migration. Otherwise, you have to remember about the stuff you left in /usr/local/bin. And `ln -s ~/bin ~/Dropbox/` is also nice. <comment213153> Thanx for your advices. I personally created the folder /opt/ to put my software and then I just made  symbolic links to /usr/local/bin for all the executables... then no need to add the /opt/myspecific-soft in the path environment variable.
