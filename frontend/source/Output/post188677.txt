Permanently Enlarging the "Open File" dialog box in Yosemite <body> Whenever I open a file in any application I'm presented with the standard "Open" dialog box which I find to be frustratingly small (less than 50% in each dimension on my 11 inch screen). I can enlarge it to a more generous size, but the new dimensions don't seem to be made permanent, so next time I open a file the standard small-size dialog is shown.  Is there a way to permanently resize this dialog box?  <answer189473> I tested this with codeTextEdit/code and it does not remember the size of it's open dialog window. I tested it with codeScript-Editor/code and codeBBEdit/code and they both remember the size.  After reading something about another, maybe related situation, I tried this:  I resized the open dialog in codeTextEdit/code like it is described here (second screenshot).br [ emwhich is: hold the SHIFT-key and click into the right side of the dialog and start dragging it/em ]  And when I do that this way, codeTextEdit/code remembers the size, also between relaunches.  So may be this is possible with all applications you want to remember it's open dialog size? It's not a general solution but a workaround. If it does the job it may be a pretty useful one.  I got the idea to try this from here (second screenshot): http://osxdaily.com/2014/12/08/resize-large-open-save-dialog-windows-mac-os-x/ and I found that site with a google query containing the title of your question.  <answer189989> This strongmay/strong help you.  You can set the open dialog to always open in expanded mode - it still will not store the last screen coordinates however that you used - however - always being in expanded mode would help on a 11 inch screen  Open the strongTerminal/strong  and type:  precodedefaults write -g NSNavPanelExpandedStateForSaveMode -bool TRUE /code/pre  You may need to restart the finder  precodekillall Finder /code/pre  <answer189998> Click the bottom right corner, hold down Option, drag the window to what you'd like.  10/10 times, it saves this X/Y setting.  <answer255323> Not a 'system fix' but using a 3rd party app, DefaultFolderX (approx Â£30 UK, with 30-day trial period) you can take charge of how you deal with Open/Save file-pickers.  I don't use half of what it's capable of, yet still find it worth the outlay, &amp; have done for 15 years.  My prime use of it is to navigate to any open folder on the desktop, but resizing &amp; remembering file pickers is just one of its features.   emno affiliation, just a satisfied customer/em  <comment224335> It seems the size was saving until 10.10.1 or 10.10.2. At least Script Editor has a menu option to save the size of the Open dialog, but that's the only one I know of. <comment224560> The open dialog is actually provided by the system these days, for sandboxed applications. There are fewer options for controlling its presentation. <comment224646> browse true this : http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/9659/what-window-management-options-exist-for-os-x <comment224798> Have you tried this? Copy and paste the command into Terminal and hit return: defaults write ~/Library/Preferences/.GlobalPreferences.plist NSNavPanelExpandedSizeForOpenMode '{"926, 639"}' <comment224913> @MorganR that command fails with error `Could not parse: {"926, 639"}.  Try single-quoting it.` <comment225135> Doesn't seem to work in 10.10.3, what OSX version have you tried this on? <comment225137> 10.10.3. It works here when I do it like in the screenshot shown. And it persists, it's still as big as I resized it yesterday (in TextEdit). <comment225166> @whitman Did you copy and paste the command? You should have ...OpenMode '{"926, 639"}' (with single and double quotes) as apposed to just ...OpenMode {"926, 639"} <comment225359> To test it, you could try to delete TextEdit's preferences (if you are willing to start with the default set) and try that SHIFT-CLICK-DRAG again (to delete the prefs, run this code in a Terminal.app window:  "defaults delete com.apple.TextEdit" (without the quotes). Quit TextEdit before executing. <comment227054> Is your TextEdit connected to iCloud? I noticed that this trick seems to work on all apps except those which use iCloud. So maybe the dimensions for the iCloud-enabled open dialog are hardcoded instead of being read from the `NSNavPanelExpandedSizeForOpenMode` like regular open dialog boxes. <comment227059> No, I don't use iCloud. <comment227065> Ah yes, that could be, kinda like shared prefs. <comment322507> @MorganR The command as posted does not work for me either: `2016-10-20 15:46:46.157 defaults[58937:6901206] Could not parse: {"926, 639"}.  Try single-quoting it.`
