TimeMachine Backup over NAS was USB connected <body> I have a MacBook Pro running macOS 10.12.1 Sierra that have been backing up with TimeMachine to a WD MyPassport hard drive connected via USB.  I have connected to the Passport via Wi-Fi. When I try to start a backup can't find the disk and it is not offered as a new backup disk.  I can see the relevant updb file in the finder I don't want to start the whole backup over. Any suggestions?  <comment328880> With network drives, MacOS requires backup locations to be in a .sparsebundle disk image.
