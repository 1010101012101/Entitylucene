How to prevent Cmd-Q from typing "q" in the new foreground app? <body> My background app (the one that gets activated when the current app quits) is some text editor. When I use the kbdCmd/kbd-kbdQ/kbd shortcut to quit it and immediately afterwards let go of strongonly/strong the kbdCmd/kbd key, the text editor types a codeq/code character.  Of course I normally don't intentionally keep kbdQ/kbd pressed. While using the Quartz keyboard layout I never even noticed this, but when I changed to the Dvorak layout, I occasionally saw this happen (probably because of the location of kbdQ/kbd on the keyboard). It happens with both layouts though.  I'm pretty sure it's emnot/em a problem with specifically my Mac (EDIT: It only happens with my strongLogitech/strong keyboard). It's quiet annoying, especially while coding since I quit the developing app a lot and the codeq/code in my source code makes it not compile anymore.  My questions are:  ol lisDoes this only happen on my Mac? Can someone test this?/s It only happens with the Logitech keyboard./li listrongHow can I prevent this from happening?/strong (other than always paying attention to let go of kbdQ/kbd before kbdCmd/kbd)/li liWhy is this even happening?

I fiddled with lots of keyboard settings, but none of them stopped the errant "q" from happening.  But I've found a (poor) solution that emdoes/em work:  strongSolution:/strong Whenever you press codecmd+q/code, make sure you release the codeq/code key embefore/em releasing the codecmd/code key.  As long as you release the keys in this order, the "codeq/code" character won't be sent to the new foreground app.  <comment305223> Ahh yes! It's the Logitech keyboard that's doing it! I didn't even think about that. I'll look up anti-ghosting now I guess <comment305224> Cool np, let us know! :) <comment305225> So the Apple keyboard works? <comment305226> Yes, the Apple keyboard works. I couldn't find anything else regarding this problem though, no idea how to solve it. I'm probably gonna buy a new keyboard soon anyways though.
