How do I view the lifetime total from the Health app? <body> Is it possible to see the lifetime totals (steps, distance, etc) from all data in the Health app? Perhaps with a third party app?  <answer253695> While it is not possible anymore with iOS 10 to export your health data, you can export and view it with this app: QS Access by Quantified Self Labs https://appsto.re/de/ocQ22.i  <answer253701> That's true. QS access only displays your data and can export it.  Do you want to view your lifetime totals on a regular basis on your iPhone? In this case there is a two step solution possible using workflow.  <comment315731> That's very painful though. Surely if a third party app has access to the full Health data it can add up the totals. Or am I missing something?
