Unable to connect to iMac using SSH on 10.12.1 (Sierra) <body> I've recently updated my iMac to Sierra (From El Capitan). I used to be able to connect to my Mac via SSH from another box. Now I am unable to do so.  If I go to the terminal on my Mac and enter ssh myuser@localhost, it works fine. If I try to connect through another system, it won't connect.  Initially, I thought it was the firewall, so I turned that off (and even rebooted just in case) and it did not change anything.  I've looked in my logs, and the only error I see is "Unknown key for string: SHAuthorizationRight". If I remove the line from my ssh.plist file, ssh won't even start.  Has anyone encountered this issue before? Any ideas on how to fix it?  Edit: Here's the verbose log that PuTTY generates:  precode=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=  PuTTY log 2016.12.05 07:23:42  =~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=  Event Log: Writing new session log (SSH raw data mode) to file:  putty.log Event Log: Looking up host "x.x.x.x" Event Log: Connecting to x.x.x.x port 22 Event Log: We claim version:  SSH-2.0-PuTTY_Release_0.64 Event Log: Failed to connect to x.x.x.x: Network error: Connection timed out Event Log: Network error: Connection timed out /code/pre  Edit 2: Here's the SSH output from another Mac device  precode$ ssh -vvv x.x.x.x OpenSSH_7.2p2, LibreSSL 2.4.1 debug1: Reading configuration data /etc/ssh/ssh_config debug1: /etc/ssh/ssh_config line 20: Applying options for * debug2: resolving "x.x.x.x" port 22 debug2: ssh_connect_direct: needpriv 0 debug1: Connecting to x.x.x.x [x.x.x.x] port 22. debug1: connect to address x.x.x.x port 22: Operation timed out ssh: connect to host x.x.x.x port 22: Operation timed out /code/pre  Edit 3: Apparently the issue is being caused by the firewall.  Despite the firewall being turned off in System Preferences, it is still on.  I had to add the following line in an anchor file:  precoderdr pass inet proto tcp from any to any port 22 -&gt; 127.0.0.1 port 22 /code/pre  and then I ran:  precode$ sudo pfctl -evf /etc/pf.conf /code/pre  Why the firewall continues to be enabled at this point, I don't know, but this solved the issue for the moment, although upon restarting it may come back.  <comment329732> Pos the verbose log from `ssh` and the errors you get. <comment330315> @Jakuje - Edited to include log. <comment330338> @klanomath The .44 in there was an error on my part - I was replacing my IP address with x.x.x.x but I missed the .44 in there.  I am attempting to use a password, but it is failing even before it gets there.  The host OS is Windows 7, but even another Mac client is unable to connect, but I can connect to the other Mac client. <comment330344> @klanomath  See my most recent edit.  It seems like it is a firewall issue, even though the firewall should be disabled. <comment330348> @JeremyVanderburg macOS provides two different firewalls: pf (no GUI) and the Application Firewall (GUI: System Preferences  Security...). pf is disabled by default! <comment330350> @JeremyVanderburg You may write an answer how you solved your problem. To get the current status of pf enter: `sudo pfctl -s all | grep Status`. A good GUI is [Murus Lite](http://murusfirewall.com/). The *rdr pass inet...* rule doesn't survive a reboot. <comment330366> @klanomath I was hesitating a bit to write an answer because it seems incomplete at the moment.  I'm still unsure as to why disabling the firewall in System Preferences seems to have no effect.  I'd also like to find a way to fix this in a way that will survive a reboot.  Once I get that down, I certainly can (and will) write an answer. <comment330368> @JeremyVanderburg I may also write an answer, but then you have to either check whether the pf firewall is enabled after a reboot (`sudo pfctl -s all | grep Status`) or `cat /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.pfctl.plist` shows an -e or -ef option. As mentioned earlier in my comments macOS provides **two** completely different firewalls. To add/load a pf firewall rule while booting you may use one of my [answers](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/230300/what-is-the-modern-way-to-do-port-forwarding-on-el-capitan-forward-port-80-to) as a blueprint.
