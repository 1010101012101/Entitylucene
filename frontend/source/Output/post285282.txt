How to stop iOS from suggesting old numbers in messages? <body> A contact of mine changed their number and I edited their contact info in my contacts to update to their new phone number. Now, whenever I try to create a new message, it suggests the new number, but also the old number.  The old number has the circle with i next to it so if I'm paying attention I will notice it. However, I don't want iOS to suggest this to me anymore regardless. Once the number is updated it should never suggest the old one to me again according to my needs. Perhaps someone else could find this useful but if there's a way to tell iOS to stop suggesting it to me that would be great.
