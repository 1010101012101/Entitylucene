How to make @ key work? <body> Have bought Mac air 11 inch today. Cannot make kbd@/kbd key function. I Have pressed kbdalt/kbd and the kbd@/kbd key together.  Nothing happens. It seems that other signs on the right side are not the same as what I see on the screen. For example, if I press kbd?/kbd, it gives me kbd-/kbd.  Is something wrong/broken?  <answer114705> Maybe your keyboard does not match the settings in your System Preferences. It would be good to include the layout of your keyboard i.e. English UK, English US, or maybe another language's default.  To check your System Preferences setup go: codeSystem Preferences/code -- codeKeyboard/code -- codeInput Sources/code. There you will find which button layout is set.  By matching that to your actual keyboard layout you may be successful resolving your issue.  <answer114706> It seems like a localization problem, your keyboard seems to be configured to a profile different the one represented on its key's markings.  ul liOpen System Preferences:/li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2fm5a.png" alt="enter image description here"  ul liGo to codeKeyboard/code:/li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/np89z.png" alt="enter image description here"  ul liGo to codeInput Sources/code:/li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9OqVW.png" alt="enter image description here"  ul liOn the bottom left, click the code+/code and add whichever keyboard is appropriate to your MacBook.
