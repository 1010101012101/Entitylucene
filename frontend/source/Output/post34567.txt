Move iTunes library from Windows XP computer to Windows 7 computer <body> On the old laptop, I just changed the library location from the default codeC:/code to codeD:/codebr I also did a consolidate and now I have the entire music, movies, iTunes folders, etc. in my codeD:/code drive, and want to move it the new laptop.   I know I need to open iTunes by pressing kbdShift/kbd, but my problem is, that I cannot find the strong.itl/strong file on my old laptop (at the new location of codeD:/code). I need this to select it on the new laptop. Where do I find my strong.itl/strong file ?   Thank you for your help!  <answer34576> Read Apple's technical support documentation article: iTunes: How to move your music to a new computer  <answer34577> Read Microsoft's technical support documentation article: How to search for files and folders in Windows XP  <answer110310> iLounge has a great piece of instructions on how to move the iTunes library from one place to the next: http://www.ilounge.com/index.php/articles/comments/moving-your-itunes-library-to-a-new-hard-drive/  The ITL file in your case, probably remains on your C:\ drive.   <comment39490> What you are asking is how to search for files on Windows XP. You need to use Window's Search function to look for any files ending in .itl on your D drive. You should post this question on a Windows help forum, not on an Apple help forum. <comment39493> Pls read my question clearly...It is not a Windows question...It is the APPLE ITUNES question.. <comment39496> Someone pls provide me a better answer...the above comments are not at all clear... <comment64527> Would a single answer suffice?
