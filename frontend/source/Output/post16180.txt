Xcode problem with directory permissions <body> I'm trying XCode4. I created a new project, told XCode to put in my code~/develop//code directory, but then I immediately get asked:     strong“Test project” is locked for editing and you may not be able to save your   changes. Do you want to unlock it?/strong      “Test project” is currently locked   because you do not own the parent   folder and have no write permissions   for it.        [Don't Unlock]     [Unlock]   ...which isn't true: my code~/develop//code folder is owned by me (staff group) and has codedrwxr-xr-x/code permissions. I write to it every day. XCode is running as my account.  Is XCode right? What can I do to fix this? If I press “Don't Unlock” it seems to work fine.  <answer52661> If you navigate to that folder from Finder, you can click Get Info and manage the permissions from the bottom of the window.

The work around I used was to create a duplicate of the project.  <answer81963> Launch Finder and right click on your folder and go to emGet Info/em. After this process you can change the permission.  If you like Terminal for this job, this topic on StackOverflow will help you.  <comment19149> Have you tried pressing "Unlock"? What does it do? Also: is the file/folder locked in the Finder? Can you unlock it there? <comment63886> What does `ls -led ~/develop/` - show - the extra information is the ACL for the directory <comment81961> Hello, and welcome to Ask Different! This site tries to be the definitive Q&A reference to all things Apple. For this to work, it is important to stick to the exact question when answering. In this case, while your workaround is a good hint, you fail to address any aspect of the question related to the cause of the behaviour, which makes the value of your solution questionable. If you can’t provide any insight into that, your suggestion would be more adequate as a comment to the original question than as an answer.
