Is there a keyboard shortcut for launching Activity Monitor? <body> I can't seem to find a shortcut for launching the activity monitor. Does it have one?  <answer1521> Not by default, but you can strikecreate one in System Preferences -- Keyboard -- Keyboard Shortcuts.  Or you can/strike use spotlight:  ul litype kbd&#x2318;/kbd + kbdspace/kbd/li listart typing "activity monitor"/li lias soon as activity monitor is highlighted in the spotlight list, hit kbd&#x232B;/kbd/li /ul  <answer1526> Otherwise of Spotloight that @Calavera suggest you can use 3rd-party software such as:  ol listrongQuickSilver/strong/li listrongNamely/strong/li listrongTigerLaunch/strong/li listrongHimmelBar/strong/li listrongLaunchBar/strong/li /ol  I myself use QuickSilver and set shortcut kbd⌘/kbd+kbdspace/kbd to run it and type some part of "Activity Monitor" and press kbd&#x232B;/kbd so Activity Monitor will run.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4NiNd.jpg" alt="alt text"  <answer9662> Save in AppleScript Editor and assign a shortcut in FastScripts or some other way:  precodetell app "Activity Monitor"     reopen -- makes a new window if there are no existing windows     activate -- brings the app to front end tell /code/pre  <answer9665> For starting apps, scripts, etc. with a single shortcut, there exist some specific tools.  ol liNuKit - free trial, download from MacUpdate or their site./li liApptivate - 2.0 is no longer free and as of now, it's unfortunately traded usability for eye candy./li /ol  Apptivate offers to switch away from apps with the same shortcut. The NuKit team promised to add it soon.  <answer38008> You can use System keyboard shortcuts, Services and Automator to do this. See my answer to a similar question here  <answer90298> You can you use BetterTouchTool to create keyboard shortcuts and even use the trackpad to create a gesture instead of keyboard shortcuts.  <answer228351> Create in Automator an Action to run shell script codeopen -a "Activity Monitor"/code:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hqbn8.png" alt="enter image description here"  Then in System Preferences - Shortcuts Tab - Services set a keyboard shortcut for the created service:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/px7f2.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer229680> Hammerspoon is my favorite and is probably the most easiest to install and configure.  Here is the init.lua code for launching the Activity Monitor.   precodehs.hotkey.bind({"cmd","shift"}, "Escape", function()    hs.application.open("Activity Monitor") end) /code/pre  PS: I mapped my command key to control. So by mapping the hotkey to "cmd+shift+escape", I get similar functionality that I get in Windows(for opening the task manager)  <comment1350> Sadly, I don't believe System Prefs can set keyboard shortcuts to launch apps. <comment1352> @Dori: wow, you're right.  That's what I get for assuming... I've seen the application shortcuts section in keyboard shortcuts and assumed it would allow me to create one for launching an application.  I just never tried it since I always use spotlight.  I struck through that text in my answer since it's incorrect.  Good catch. <comment1389> Add to that list [LaunchBar](http://www.obdev.at/products/launchbar/index.html), personally I prefer typing just `ac` to launch the Activity Monitor. <comment3458> Tho' I prefer LaunchBar over QuickSilver, both can launch Activity Monitor by simply typing ‘ac’, it’s a matter of training. :) <comment29905> I think Alfred is the best. <comment30059> You may want to add [Spark](http://www.shadowlab.org/Software/spark.php). <comment153004> Is there a way to change this script so that the Activity Monitor window opens up in a normal size (i.e. not maximized). <comment280205> The (global) AppleScript menu used to let you launch Apps via keyboard shortcut, but Apple took that capability out years ago. <comment280945> Why don't you just put it in Dock? <comment288928> related: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/86010/ctrl-alt-delete-mac-equivalent
