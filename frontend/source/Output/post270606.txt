Cannot change anything inside a folder, however it's not Locked and I have all the rights <body> I copied several folders from my TM backup (made in El Capitan) to the current system (Sierra), (I also have different username than on the system where I made the backup if that could matter) and now their contents can be changed only via codesudo/code.  I tried running codesudo chown -R &lt;my_name&gt; &lt;folder&gt;/code — no effect at all. Also tried running codefind . -exec sudo chown &lt;my_name&gt; "{}" \;/code from them — again no luck. Also tried codefind . -exec sudo chmod u+rwx "{}" \;/code, codesudo chmod -R u+rwx &lt;folder&gt;/code. Nothing changed anything.  These folders and all their contents show up in Finder as Read&amp;Write for my user, and they also do not have Locked property set. Somehow this is not true in practice.  What can I do to fix this insanity?  I have found only one thing that actually solves it — copy the whole folder, delete old one with codesudo/code, rename it back. But it's impractical for huge folders because it's slow and hurts SSD life.  <answer270609> h1UPDATE 2 (now I got it):/h1  The culprit is the ACLs. Apparently Time Machine uses them, and copying via Finder preserves ACLs.  They are easy to remove recursively from folders where you know they are not needed:br codesudo chmod -R -N ~/Pictures/code for example will drop all ACL rules in ~/Pictures and everything inside.

Looks like they are actively trying to make me switch to another OS.
