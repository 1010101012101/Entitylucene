Remote Desktop no longer shows local mouse cursor <body> Until recently, Apple Remote Desktop showed the local mouse cursor on top of controlled remote workstations (apparently in an effort to compensate for network latency).  A few days ago, my installation of Apple Remote Desktop stopped showing the local cursor, so now all I see is the remote mouse cursor.  This is frustrating because the network latency makes it much more difficult to accurately position the mouse cursor.  What might have changed?  How can I convince Apple Remote Desktop to start showing the local mouse cursor again?
