Let firefox or chrome use wifi connection <body> I am on a wired network that does not allow access to external websites like stackoverflow etc. but my wireless connection allows that. My mac is connected to both wifi and wired network. Is there a way that I can set chrome or firefox that it will use wifi connection and rest of my applications will use the wired network.  <comment246796> This may be possible using port forwarding but I don't know how, if you just want to priorate WiFi over ethernet you can modify the network priority in system preferences. https://support.apple.com/kb/PH14006
