How to convert .mdf/.mds to .iso? <body> I have an old Alcohol 120% CD/DVD image file that I'd like to convert to an .iso image. I have tried simply renaming the file thus (disregarding the 4 KB .mds file):  video.mdf -- video.iso.  This emsort of/em worked. Most of the video played perfectly (in VLC) but then the final three minutes were silent with a blank screen.  How should I go about doing this?  <answer28915> Handbrake is able to read quite a lot of video formats. It shares a bunch of libraries with VLC anyway so you may be able to convert your files as well.   <answer28927> You can use very simple command line program mdf2iso for this. it is available via MacPorts (for example).  strongPS:/strong This utility can be also used in any Linux, *BSD and Windows systems  <answer136194> Another way, if you only need to mount the image, is to use DAMON Tools for Mac. Not free but if the trial expires it can be uninstalled/reinstalled using AppCleaner.  <comment33235> Did you consider reinstalling Alcohol (on a PC or virtual machine) and converting the image into .iso? <comment33239> Yes, but the image is so old that I don't want to go to the trouble of installing Windows just to access it. I can do this on the command line on my Xubuntu box but I wonder if there's a way on the Mac. Thanks anyway. <comment33240> How do you do it under Linux then? <comment33256> Using the mdf2iso tool @Eir mentions. :) It's late here now but I'll give this a go in the morning. <comment33257> Thanks for this. I'll try in the morning and report back. I may try and find the source and compile it altho' I'll probably only ever use it the one time. Cheers. <comment36067> How is your experience with it? <comment36123> Really sorry, I totally forgot about this. Worked a treat. Many thanks.
