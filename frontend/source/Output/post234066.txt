How to find the last saved file <body> I don't know when I stopped working yesterday, but very likely I saved a file before shutting down my computer.  How can I find the (not system owned) file with the last save timestamp?  <answer234067> Show a finder window sorted by date modified.  ul liOpen a File Menu  New Finder window, or kbd Cmd ⌘ /kbd kbd N /kbd /li liIf 'All my Files' isn't the default, View menu  All my Files or kbd Cmd ⌘ /kbd kbd Shift ⇧ /kbd kbd F /kbd  /li liSort as List  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/RJX1f.png" alt="enter image description here", View menu, or kbd Cmd ⌘ /kbd kbd 2 /kbd /li liBy default this doesn't show, so Right Click the header bar &amp; check Date Modified  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/f4sVr.png" alt="enter image description here"/li liSort by Date Modified, with newest to the top by clicking that column in the header bar  - img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1pAwP.png" alt="enter image description here"/li /ul  Your most recently saved file will now be at the top of the list.  <comment286087> Now this is fantastic! I didn't even know about "All my Files". How handy! I thought I would have to go through the Terminal and do some complicated `find`. Oh God, how I love Apple again ♥ – And, wow, thanks for the wonderfully comprehensive answer. Wish I could give you more than the standard rep. <comment286088> Welcome. The All My Files category is relatively new, maybe since Yosemite [I'm not certain] & is the default view for new users, but not for us old timers who have been updating 'in place' for years :)
