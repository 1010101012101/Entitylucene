How to print page with all pictures under Geolocation or File with Geolocation <body> Just returned from cruise using iPhone 7+ as camera -- over 1000 photos.  Just discovered it categorized my pix by location.  How do I print out all the pictures for one location or get this tag to appear above each print for easy organizing.  I copied all my pix to laptop but the geotagging is missing.  I need an easy way to organize them so I can be done with my scrapbook in one weekend not one year!  <comment324257> Can I print a proof page with the geo location?
