How should I configure my VMware Fusion VM network connections? <body> I've been a long time user of VMware Fusion on my iMac and I've just bought a MacBook Pro to allow me to work on projects whilst I'm away from my desk.  On my iMac, I have a few VMs, each with their own bridged connection to the LAN, each with their own static IP address and each with their own DNS hostname on my DNS server on the LAN. I've been using a bridged connection in this way so that other users on the LAN can connect to the VMs running on my Macs to test projects that I am working on without me having to configure NAT rules and users having to use unusual port numbers, etc.  Now, I'm aware that when I take my MBP away from the LAN and say, for example, I am on a train with no internet connection or WiFi connection, I will be unable to resolve the DNS name of the VMs as my DNS server will not be reachable. A workaround for this, I guess would be an entry for each VM in my code/etc/hosts/code file on my MBP.  However, what I'm not sure of is how my MBP will be able to route traffic destined for the static IP address of each VM, when there is strongno/strong network connection available.  Going through the settings available to me in VMware Fusion, I can only really see two possible configurations that could work for me: emBridged Networking/em and emShare with my Mac/em. I've discounted emPrivate to my Mac/em as this doesn't appear to satisfy my requirement of allowing LAN users to connect to my VMs.  Surely, I'm not the only person who has been faced with this predicament (unless I'm doing it wrong in the first place).  I would like to know if anyone would be able to answer me the following:  How can I setup a VMware Fusion 6 VM to allow bridged network connection to the LAN when I'm at my desk and retain connectivity between my MBP and the VM when I'm "on the road"?
