How to prevent the black screen on iPod Touch? <body> Is there a way to not let the iPod touch switch the screen off? I want to use my iPod as a "count down" timer with the built-in clock app. But after some time, the screen turns black thanks to the energy saver policy. I actually want to see the count down until the time is up!  <answer3774> I haven't got my iPod Touch with me but this works on the iPhone if you go to Settings - General - Auto-Lock and set it to Never. That should work.  Let me know if iPod Touch has removed this. Don't know why they would have!  <comment3561> Ok. I searched after "screen saver", but indeed, it's the autolock :-) <comment3563> No problemo! :)
