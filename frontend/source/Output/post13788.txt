kCGErrorIllegalArgument from com.apple.Dock.agent <body> I have this weird error message showing up in my console. I'm hoping to locate the problem and fix it:  com.apple.Dock.agent - : kCGErrorIllegalArgument: CGSetWindowTransformAtPlacement: singular Matrix  Screenshot:  http://cl.ly/6bJd  <comment14678> care to share a sshot of your dock as well? <comment14710> Is it causing a problem with the Dock? Sometimes log messages are just there for the developers.
