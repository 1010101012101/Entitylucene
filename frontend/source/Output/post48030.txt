Why can't I see the contents of my external HD when attached via USB to third-gen Time Capsule? <body> After using it successfully for months over my home LAN by connecting it via FW800 (and using a Hitachi 7K2000 hard drive (in a Rosewill quad-interface enclosure with Oxford semiconductor bridge chip) via USB cable to my third-generation Time Capsule. It is formatted as HFS+ with a GUID partition table.  It appears in Airport Utility and mounts correctly, but none of its folders appears. Have tried two different USB cables with the same results.  Any ideas as to what could be wrong?  <comment55005> When you attach the drive directly to a computer is its contents still there?
