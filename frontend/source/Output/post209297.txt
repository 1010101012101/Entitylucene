Is there any keyboard shortcut for entering El Capitan’s split view? <body> El Capitan’s new split view is an interesting feature. At last, OS X users have a feature at their disposal that has long been available on various Linuxes or on Windows. However, I have not yet found any way to enter it with the keyboard alone, without any mouse or trackpad interaction.  Yes, I am a keyboard junky and I think the kbd⊞ Win/kbd + kbd←/kbd or kbd→/kbd keyboard shortcuts that are available on Windows or on many Linuxes are very handy. I would appreciate anything similar – a setting, a menu entry, or even an extra app or script.  The BetterTouchTool allows for setting keyboad shortcuts for emMaximize Window Left/em and emMaximize Window Right/em. However, that is not quite the same, since it does not make use of the proper split view.  So, is there a way to enter the split view with a keyboard shortcut?  <answer209418> There doesn't seem to be any way to achieve this. I've trawled the web in search of an answer.   When I first moved to Mac from Linux, I picked SizeUp for this kind of window manipulation. It's the best tool I could find that has a full range of keyboard shortcuts. I'll be sticking with it for the foreseeable future. (It costs $12.99 but the free trial version doesn't expire)  <answer209990> BetterTouchTool (starting with version 1.22, currently available as alpha version) let's you assign gestures or keyboard shortcuts to trigger the native split screen.  <answer210096> I just saw that the BetterSnapTool, a dedicated spin-off of the BetterTouchTool, claims it supports the Split View, see BetterSnapTool El Capitan Compatibility.  Unfortunately, I have not been able to test the trial version. It does not open, probably because I had already tested a previous version in the past.  <answer229190> You may also consider Spectacle, which explicitly apes the winkey+arrow behavior from Windows 7/8/10.  <answer235334> I've used BetterTouchTool which has now branched into BetterTouchTool and BetterSnapTool to resize windows using programmable multitouch gestures and keyboard shortcuts.  Link to BetterSnapTool in the app store: https://itunes.apple.com/en/app/bettersnaptool/id417375580?mt=12  <answer236940> As a long time Windows user, I find Magnet by CrowdCafe, to be a very nice window snapping tool.   It includes keyboard shortcut commands for:  ul liLeft/li liRight/li liUp (half)/li liDown (half)/li li1/4 screen (left top, right top, left bottom, right bottom)/li liMax screen /li liMulti screen support and others/li /ul  Can be found in the App Store.   Only thing missing is the auto adjust slider when apps are side by side and you resize them.  <comment253361> Thanks – SizeUp seems to be a more dedicated app for this than the BetterTouchTool, and it provides a nice visual feedback. <comment253512> Thanks – I have not been able to find that alpha version, though. <comment253644> It's currently only available when checking for alpha versions in BetterTouchTool. However the public release will be available sometime this weekend.
