Booting Windows 7 in Boot Camp shows a black screen with a blinking cursor <body> I am trying to restore a DMG image of a Windows 7 Boot Camp partition back to Boot Camp. (I know that I should have used Winclone, but I didn't have that option because the drive was already dying and so I couldn't even access OS X anymore.)  So far, I've gotten to the point where I can start up the computer, hold Option, choose Windows, but then when it boots up, it shows a black screen with a blinking cursor.  I've tried a few things so far to try and fix this, none of which has worked. I have used the Windows 7 install DVD to run codebootrec/code and all its possible arguments. I've ran codechkdsk C: /b/code. I've also used the "Automatically fix startup problems" button, of course, as well.  Anyone know what else I could try to fix this?  <answer69315> Since it is an Image-File frome a previous (working) Bootcamp Installation it should not be necessary, but there is an upgrade for the graphics and bluetooth driver from Apple with an installation instruction found here "Boot Camp: iMac displays a black screen during installation of Windows 7" which adresses this problem.  <comment343867> I had the same problem after resizing my disk partitions. This breaks bootcamp. I found a way to solve this, I googled and had to do something very elaborate in terminal. Don't remember the details sorry.
