How does Apple track the origin of a program? <body> So, I downloaded an Xcode DMG from Apple's website from my main Mac. I copied this DMG to a samba network share. Later, I went on an entirely separate Mac and copied the DMG off the samba network share and installed it. When I went to run the program for the first time it reported it's origins "downloaded with Chrome at date XXXX".  How does it know!? I don't see any special files tracking the origin on the network share and it seems unlikely they'd be modifying the DMG file to inject it's origin  <comment229969> Look at the file with Get Info - it's injected into comments usually. <comment229973> @Tetsujin I wasn't aware meta data could even be put on files in samba shares <comment229974> It was added at download, then presumably copied to the SMB share in an apple double file ._sameFileName.dmg, then copied back to a single file at the 2nd Mac.
