need to script connection to telnet and send commands to remote device with no user input <body> Ok I need some help making a script that will connect to a server and send 2 commands  Ideally I would have telnet 192.168.2.230 9993  and once it logs in (no user name or password required - the server is air gapped)  once the connection is created the script would send the following commands:  remote: enable: true  record: true  So far I can only get it to connect to the remote device - any help is greatly appreciated!!  <answer127838> h2Expect/h2  Mac OS X includes the command line tool expect:     expect - programmed dialogue with interactive programs   codeexpect/code is ideal for scripted interactions with other tools, like codetelnet/code.   The following questions discuss how to use codeexpect/code and codetelnet/code together:  ul liHow to automate telnet session using Expect?/li liexpect script to automate telnet login/li liShell script successful telnet login, how to issue commands after that?/li /ul  h2Connect and Send/h2  The following shell script may be enough for your two commands:  precode#!/usr/bin/expect -f spawn telnet 192.168.2.230 9993 send "remote: enable: true\n" send "record: true\n" /code/pre  There are a number of ways to use the above script. One is to save the script as a text file called codemyscript.command/code; opening the file will then launch Terminal.app and run the script.  Alternatively, the script could be wrapped in an Automator action or AppleScript.
