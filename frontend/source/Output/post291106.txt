Show preview when switching windows with ⌘+Tab <body> The code⌘+Tab/code key combination switches between active and background windows on my MacOS on MBP.  When hitting this combination, a small preview of the selected window appears. Another hit on the codeTab/code key while code⌘/code is pressed previews and selects the next window. Releasing the code⌘/code switches to the currently selected window.  Recently, this preview does not appear, so I can't efficiently switch to other windows using a key combination.  Any idea how to restore that preview, please?  <answer291109> Try going to System Preferences  Keyboard  Shortcuts  Restore Defaults  Further steps below:  Have you tried restarting your machine and doing your system updates? Have you tried using the right and left command key with tab to try and make it work?  <answer291110> Solved by rebooting. The preview appears correctly now.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/S3d8e.jpg" alt="enter image description here"
