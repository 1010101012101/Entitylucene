Is MacBook Pro 2016's screen stain proof? <body> Want to buy a MacBook Pro. But afraid of codeStaingate/code. Do anybody heard about stain on MBP 2016 like it was on older MBPs?  <comment356707> Non-issue. Haven't actually seen this ever and I'm constantly around macbooks. <comment356708> Non issue? Apple replaced many displays because of this. <comment356714> My MBP has staingate issue. I live in India where there are not official Apple stores. Only Authorised apple stores where they don't do any "official" replacements.
