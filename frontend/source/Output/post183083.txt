Removing an application from homebrew-cask <body> Homebrew-cask provides the possibility for users to conveniently install the applications with GUI, I want to confirm that: while I try to uninstall a software which was installed by homebrew-cask, will it remove those codeApplication Supports/code, codeCaches/code, or related files too?  By the way, If I manually update a software (which was installed by cask) without using command provided by cask, will it corrupt the cask function (such as updating that software in the future with cask again)?   <answer183125> No, uninstalling from brew-cask’s codeuninstall/code command will not remove the files in Application Support, Caches, Preferences etc. For that you’ll need  a third party app, like AppCleaner or iTrash. I just delete one app this way and it didn’t even remove the symlink it made to the code~/Applications//code folder.  Though homebrew cask is an easy solution for installing app, it’ not perfect. On the man page of codebrew-cask/code you can read about the problems with uninstall command.  You can use the codezap/code command that does a little more than uninstall but that too has limitations, see the man page.   I don’t know if updating app will corrupt, have never tried it. You might have to codefetch/code information for the cask using the command, or even re-install it with codefetch —-force/code.  <answer183134> For full remove try:  precodebrew cask zap any_program /code/pre  Manual update should not corrupt anything. It updates the same program copy which was installed by cask.  <answer183142> Additionally to @user14492 answer, which is right, check out the last line of the following paragraph, that answer your last question.     strongUpdating/Upgrading Casks/strong      Since the homebrew-cask repository is a Homebrew Tap, you'll pull down   the latest Casks every time you issue the regular Homebrew command   codebrew update/code. Currently, homebrew-cask cannot always detect if an   Application has been updated. You can force an update via the command   codebrew cask install --force/code. We are working on improving this.      strongemIt is generally safe to run updates from within an Application/em/strong.   Source: How to Use Homebrew-cask.  <comment331027> thx. worked for me
