Slow network copy between iMac and MacBook Air <body> I am getting a maximum lousy 1,5 MB copy speed between two Macs on my local network. My hardware is:  ul liiMac6,1 (2006)/li liAirPort Express A1264 (2008)/li liMacBook Air3,2 (2010)/li /ul  The AirPort and the MacBook are both 802.11n-compliant according to my findings, but the iMac says "802.11a/b/g (draft-n disabled by default)".  ol liIs 2MB/s the best I can expect with the current hardware?/li liIs "draft-n" something I can "enable" on the iMac? If so, how?/li liWhat speeds are the best possible between units that are all 802.11n?/li /ol  <answer98318> 1) I do not think so.  2) You need strongApple Extreme 802.11n Enabler for Mac/strong, more Information is How to tell if 802.11n-enabling software is installed or an OSX Update. See HT2447.  <comment115403> "enter link description here" <comment115440> @dor: Using the "How to tell" method, it says "/n" on the end on the iMac. What next?
