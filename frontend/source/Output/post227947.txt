Ghost apps under settings showing allow (null) to access <body> I had a few apps that were hung on update a while back.  I thought I had caught all of them and re-downloaded them.  One in particular sends reminders at specific times of day.  For the last few days I have noticed notifications coming up as com.habitlistapp.habitlist.  The app was no longer there when I went to look for it, however when I looked under settings there are three ghost apps.  That is, apps with wirefram icons that all say allow null to access instead of the name.  So in the case of habit list, I went to the app store and sure enough it registered as an app I could download again...  Once I did that my three ghost apps became two.  This leads me to believe the app was caught in some in-between state where it was still running but was partially removed from the ui.  I got lucky with the weird notification name and was able to figure out which app it was.  What about the other two?  Anyone know of a way to figure out what they might be?  <comment293169> Updating iOS seems to have cleared the bogus entries out.
