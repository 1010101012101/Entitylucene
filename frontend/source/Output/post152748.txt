Disk Utility won't let me remove partition. No matter what <body> Since Yosemite was released this month, I decided to inaugurate it by downgrading from Mavericks to Snow Leopard. I decided to back some files up in a partition (on Mavericks) before wiping the main partition out and installing Snow Leopard.  The installation was successful, but now the backup partition is useless, and I would like to get it back. Except that when I try to remove it I get the infamous:     This operation requires a newer version of Mac OS X for this disk   So I read that it's caused by some encryption that was introduced after Snow Leopard. It makes sense. I read that you can wipe it out with a command line tool (codediskutil/code), so I did that. You can find the specifics in this Apple thread.  precodediskutil eraseVolume HFS+ Blank /dev/disk1s3 /code/pre  Great, so now I have a Blank disk. Problem is it still doesn't let me remove the partition. I've tried to close both Terminal and Disk Utility as well as rebooting. Nothing. I just can't get rid of it.  I tried to reinitialize ("erase") the backup partition to Mac OS Journaled. Successfully. But that doesn't change the fact that I can't remove the partition.  What is going on?  <comment179835> confused...so you still have what OS up and running ? <comment179836> ok, reading your post again, you created a partition in Mavericks then installed Snow Leopard, and now the partition created in Mavericks is not accessible in Snow Leopard? <comment179838> @Buscar웃 Is not modifiable in Snow Leopard. Exactly. <comment179847> so going back to Mavericks is not a option? But, using Target disk mode you could recover the files, and maybe remove the partition as well, but requires second computer. <comment179916> @Buscar웃 Nope. The whole idea of the whole process was to downgrade. Also I don't care about the files in the backup partition. I've already copied them in the main partition.
