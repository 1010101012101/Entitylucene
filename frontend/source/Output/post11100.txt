What's the quickest way to get a graphic on the clipboard saved to disk? <body> I have a graphic on the clipboard on OS X.  What's the quickest way to get it onto disk as a png or jpg?  <answer11101> Maybe the codeFile | New From Clipboard/code menu of code/Application/Preview.app/code.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NPoF4.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer11103> If you have Preview.app open you can simply 'create new' kbdcmd/kbd+kbdn/kbd and that will generate the proper canvas and paste the clipboard image. Only thing left to do is save that file. Presto!  <answer11104> Not nearly as slick, but without using Preview.  Finder - Edit - Show Clipboard  kbdCmd/kbd+kbdShift/kbd+kbd4/kbd to get the screen shot marquee tool, and copy the part of the clipboard you want. It's now a PNG on your desktop. But probably not emprecisely/em the same image file.  But at that rate, you probably could have screen-captured the original source using the same method and went right to the PNG without using the clipboard.  <answer11105> I like to use the command line:  precodepbpaste &gt; myfile.png /code/pre  The pbcopy command is useful as well. See this post for details.  <answer11116> Here is a utility to do just that.     h3pngpaste/h3      Paste PNG into files, much like pbpaste does for text.      However instead of codepngpaste &gt; thefile.png/code, it's codepngpaste thefile.png/code, so one does not accidentally barf binary into the console.   <answer282170> Using strongPreview.app/strong is a way, but a little cumbersome. It can also be done on the command line.   Because codepbpaste/code can only codepbpaste &gt; filename/code text snippets, you want to use codepngpaste/code instead.   Install it with Brew:  precodebrew install pngpaste /code/pre  and use it:   precodepngpaste &lt;filename&gt; /code/pre  <comment11601> I just tested it, and `pbpaste` only works with plain text, rich text, etc. No binary data. See [this SO post](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3146692/binary-image-data-clipboard-os-x) <comment11602> Thanks for the edit Jeff... was trying to do that myself when you changed it. Never noticed that you could format the keys like that! <comment11603> -1 as it doesn't actually work for the question he asked. <comment11604> Bummer, thought for sure it would work with binary but didn't test (mac is at home, not here at work). Got the StackOverflow urge to post something as fast as I could. Tried to downvote my own answer but I couldn't.  :) <comment11612> Additionally, if you add Control to the screenshot command above, it will screenshot to clipboard and not a file.  I realize that's the opposite of the OPs question, but it never hurts to close the circle. <comment11616> Oh hells yeah. This is rad -- despite the obvious failure suggested by others. <comment11617> That rocks. You cranked that out pretty quick. <comment11930> There's always the "delete" link! <comment18851> Pressing âŒ˜N is faster. :) <comment38979> @WTP It does show that in the image. :P I included it for that purpose. <comment225371> You are my hero <comment268199> I custom a shell function to save and then select it in finder:     function pngp {       local path=~/Downloads/${1-000}.png       pngpaste $path | open -R $path     } <comment355261> Delete link is good to use, since the answer is very misleading. Better use `pngpaste` as [mentioned in an answer below](https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/282170/235780)
