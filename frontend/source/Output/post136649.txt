Enable SMB sharing from command line <body> On OS X 10.8, using terminal commands, I'd like to enable SMB sharing as if I had ticked the following checkbox under codeSystem Preferences - Sharing - File Sharing - Options/code:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zabah.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  I've tried the following command:  codesudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.smbd.plist/code  But despite the smb daemon seeming to be up and running, the checkbox is still unchecked, as if something is missing.  The same command works, as an example, for screen sharing (codecom.apple.screensharing.plist/code) and even for AFP (codecom.apple.AppleFileServer.plist/code), only SMB seem to suffer from this problem.  <answer136711> I've found the solution. Two commands are needed in sequence:  precodesudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.smbd.plist sudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/com.apple.smb.server.plist EnabledServices -array disk /code/pre  <comment162167> Read the small print under the Check box for SMB! <comment162168> That's a different thing. When I tick the box on System Preferences I don't need to enter passwords or anything else, so there must be a way to do the same with commands without dealing with passwords.
