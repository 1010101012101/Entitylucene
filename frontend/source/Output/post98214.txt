how to config color when i use iterm2 ssh linux server <body> I use Mac  and use iterm2 ssh login linux Server . but when exec ls  the terminal is Black and White how to config then like  mac colors img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ju176.png" alt="the color"  <answer132374> Set the codeReport Terminal Type/code value to  precodexterm-color /code/pre  <answer132393> The default codeTERM/code type iTerm reports is codexterm/code and that should be sufficient from your Mac's end of things to see colours. The problem is there are two things in play here: your local iTerm terminal and the emremote/em machine and it's shell configuration. If you haven't setup your shell to show colour, it doesn't matter what your iTerm is reporting for codeTERM/code.  It sounds like the problem is on the remote end and that you haven't configured codels/code on your Linux system to output colours.  Try setting LS_COLORS in your environment after you codessh/code in to your Linux machine. Here is one way to do it:  precodeexport LS_COLORS='rs=0:di=01;34:ln=01;36:mh=00:pi=40;33:so=01;35:do=01;35:bd=40;33;01:cd=40;33;01:or=40;31;01:mi=01;05;37;41:su=37;41:sg=30;43:ca=30;41:tw=30;42:ow=34;42:st=37;44:ex=01;32' /code/pre  That should give you a fairly good chance of ensuring you see colours when you run codels/code on any directory. If you like the settings, make them permanent by adding that line to your code~/.bash_profile/code file on the Linux machine.  You can also use the newer, more generic, codeCOLORS/code environment variable and point it to the code/etc/DIR_COLORS/code file that should exist on most modern Linux installations. More tools will key off this than just codels/code so you'll see colour in tools like codegrep/code too. Add the following to your code~/.bash_profile/code:  precodeexport COLORS=/etc/DIR_COLORS /code/pre  to add colours to more tools.
