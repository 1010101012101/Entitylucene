SIM not supported after restoring iphone with iTunes <body> I bought my phone about a year ago. It was iOS 8. I could use any sim on it, even after upgrading iOS. The last iOS version on my phone was iOS 10.  And then my phone was "disabled connect to iTunes". I restored the phone using iTunes. Everything was running smoothly and stuck when activating iphone. The error message was "SIM not supported".  I've contacted Apple, and they said that my phone is carrier locked to japan ntt docomo. So, my question is:  Can someone explain why i can use my phone before i restore it with iTunes ?
