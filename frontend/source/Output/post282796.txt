MacBook Pro I5 2.3 Early 2011 Ram? <body> I have a cousin with a MacBook Pro, CoreI5, 2.3ghz, Early 2011, 13". It came factory installed with two (2gb) memory chips. They're DDR3 1333.  She's looking to upgrade. She asked me, because I'm into computers, but I've never had a Mac. After some research, it appears that for her computer, Apple recommends a max of 8gb. However, OWC says that it can go up to 16gb.  When I followed a link to a similar question on here, it took me to the OWC and showed compatible Mac memory for this PC. It looks like people have confirmed that it's okay to use. I just have a couple of questions I need answered.  One is that the RAM recommended on OWC says it's 1.5v. Her computer is listed as 1.35v. Is that an issue or is that just what the factory RAM are using. Will her computer be able to power the other RAM? I assume that's what that means, the amount of power they draw.  Also, what's the worst case scenario if we use too much RAM in her Mac or use too high of a voltage? I believe in PCs, if I'm not mistaken, you can add more RAM than the OP can handle, but it only reads the max it's able to, and you've just wasted money on the extra GBs.  Thanks for the help. Let me know anything you think is relevant to making this swap that I haven't covered.  <comment356416> Yes, it should be able to support 16 GB of RAM. I've done it a couple of times with that model. However, I would recommend to upgrade the storage to Solid State Drive. That really improved my old Mac's performance. <comment356424> Thanks. I'll talk to her about the hard drive upgrade. I know it's probably cheaper to upgrade the ram and hard drive, but it might also be getting time to get a new one, with it being 6 years old. Do you know anything about the voltage being different. I saw one for sale that was 1.35v/1.5v. Her current one is listed as 1.35v. The one on OWC is listed as 1.5v. <comment356440> 1.5V and 1.35V both work; DDR3 has a maximum of 1.575V.   In other memory standards, there are multiple incompatible voltages, and sockets are keyed so that the 'wrong' voltage won't fit.
