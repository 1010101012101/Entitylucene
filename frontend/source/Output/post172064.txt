Not able to see the archive option <body> Just got a new mac. When I right click a .zip file, I don't see the Decompress/Archive option. Do I need to download something or change a configuration option?  <answer172085> Right-click on the file and choose Open. This will automatically decompress the file with the built-in Archive Utility.  <comment202565> Or just double-click the file :-)
