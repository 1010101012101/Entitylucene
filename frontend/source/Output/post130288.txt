What is this History menu option in the menu bar and how do I clear it? <body> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7ouMW.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Between the menu options strongEdit/strong and strongView/strong and sometimes between strongView/strong and strongGo/strong appears, when you open a web browser, another menu option named strongHistory/strong that show all the recent browsing history.
