Do I need to make my Windows 8 install disk bootable when using boot camp? <body> I have the Windows 8 consumer preview .iso which I plan to copy to a DVD to use with Boot Camp. Though my question is - when I burn the image to the disk, will I need to make the disk bootable to use it to install Windows?  <answer62284> Burn it with Disk Utility by adding ISO file to left pane, then choose it and press Burn on a toolbar. And that is it.
