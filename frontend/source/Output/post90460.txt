How do I get my (lost) device's serial number from its UDID? <body> I lost an iPad, and I need the serial number - all I have of it is the UDID.  The device is not registered, I don't have the box, and I don't have backups of it either.  I suppose that calling Apple could get me the serial number if I provide the UDID. But that's a step I'd like to avoid. Perhaps there is an email address? (Have lurked their site but I've been unable to find such).  For context, this question comes from https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/90459/identifying-a-lost-stolen-ipad-without-connecting-it-to-a-computer-or-downloadin?noredirect=1#comment106184_90459 - from the comments it seems like getting the serial number would be the most appropiate way to identify my lost iPad, since I have certain complications using the UDID to check that.  <answer90496> I found one way.  I am an iOS developer, and I once used this iPad for development. Xcode has an strongOrganizer/strong window, which keeps tracks of the devices I used for development. The iPad appears on the list, and it also displays the serial number.  This of course only works if you have developed with the device using Xcode. I wonder if there is a more standard way to get the serial number.
