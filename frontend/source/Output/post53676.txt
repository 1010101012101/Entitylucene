TPM chip on iPhone <body> Do Apple devices ship with a TPM chip? My Mac doesn't have a TPM chip, but does an iPhone have of a TPM chip or how do I determine if the iPhone has a TPM chip or not? On my Mac, I use this command to check if TPM chip is there or not: codeioreg -x | grep TPM/code.  <answer53720> I'm assuming that your TPM reference stands for "Trusted Platform Module."  According to Wikipedia:     strongDue to legal restrictions TPMs may not be deployed in a number of   countries/strong. Possible reasons for these legal restrictions include the   fact that state security services may not be able to access data or   keys secured with a TPM.      ul   listrongChina/strong/li   liRussia/li   liBelarus/li   liKazakhstan/li   /ul   Since Apple sells iPhones in China (see this NY Times article), we can infer that the iPhone doesn't ship with TPM chips.  <comment193147> i hate inferences.. we need to deal in facts.
