How to add Canon printer that works on Windows machines? <body> I'm trying to add a codeCanon MF8050cn/code to print from OS X Yosemite that works fine from codeWindows 7/code machines.  I installed the codeCanon 8000/code driver Mac_MF_Ver1040_00.dmg for Macintosh.  I can ping the printer successfully at code10.1.10.18/code from my Macintosh.  In the Add Printer dialog on the Macintosh, I enter the static IP address of the printer and codeInternet Printing Protocol/code and use codeCanon MF8000 Series/code, however, when I click codeAdd/code on the dialog, it gives the error:  precodeUnable to verify the printer on your network. Unable to connect to '10.1.10.18' due to an error. Would you still like to create the printer? /code/pre  Choosing codeContinue/code gives a printer that when you print to it gets the error codePrinting - The printer is not responding./code  How can I configure this printer for access from my Macintosh?  <answer177335> As with many modern printers, you'll probably have an easier setup if it's set to auto-IP configuration, getting an IP address from your router rather than you manually choosing one. A manual setup emshould/em also work but as it's not working for you under OS X you may as well let Bonjour do the hard work - as far as I know IPP isn't supported on your printer so this may explain the error you receive.  You then want to install the printer driver using the Bonjour protocol as this will detect the printer regardless of its allocated IP address. In the Add Printer dialogue box your Canon should appear in the "Default" list, with its network name in the left column and "Bonjour" in the Kind column. All you should need to do then is select the appropriate driver from the Print Using pull-down menu, and the unit emshould/em be good to go.  <answer177344> Yo have to download and install the Canon Drivers.  You can find the drivers for your printer here.

I found out from Canon's website that I needed to specify Line Printer Daemon (LPD) as the Protocol instead of Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) which was selected by default. After selecting LPD, there was no "Unable to connect to ... due to an error. Would you still like to create the printer?" message, and my print jobs finally worked.  <comment209768> This is true I have a Canon Printer as well and I have to set it up through Canon's driver. <comment209773> Did you try using the Canon driver for the Mac? The file is    "Mac_MF_Ver1040_00.dmg" http://www.usa.canon.com/cusa/support/consumer/printers_multifunction/imageclass_series/color_imageclass_mf8050cn <comment209894> I did install the driver, that is how I got to this point where the `Canon MF8000 Series` appears in the apple printer setup dialog. <comment209895> @CharlesLindsay Yes this is the driver I have already installed when I get to this issue described above.
