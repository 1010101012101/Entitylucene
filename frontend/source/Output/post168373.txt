What is the difference between "restore backup" and "restore iPhone" in iTunes? <body> Connect the iPhone to the computer, click on the device in iTunes, and under Summary there are two buttons as described in the question.  What is the difference in terms of what is actually restored?  <answer168376> The restore back up is just restoring your data from when it was backed up.  strongWarning:/strong  Restoring iPhone will restore all, including the operating system and leave it as it came out of the box. You will lose your settings and data, but you can get those from restore back up.  <answer168377> Restore Backup restores the contents of an iPhone backup performed sometime in the past. It restores content and stored data such as app settings, home-screen layouts, etc. Saved account login information is restored if the backup was encrypted.  Restore iPhone wipes the iPhone of all data &amp; apps and reinstalls iOS, leaving the iPhone reset to factory settings. The iPhone is left with just the latest iOS and the Apple default apps.  Find My iPhone must be turned off for either to work.  <answer211561> This same thing happened to me. I restored my phone and the. Jail role again. That time the jailbreak didn't complete(there was a blue screen at the end of jailbreak) After that for the third time I jail broke and this time it worked. Now I can use jailbreak freely. I hope that helped. Have a good day   <comment197637> thanks for been so fast and catching my spelling :) +
