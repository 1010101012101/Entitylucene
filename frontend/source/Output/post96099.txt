Unlock locked / readonly Word 2011 document <body> I've got a Word .docx file which is "readonly" in Word (not in Finder-Info).  Usually this problem (this time it occurred after a crash) would self-resolve after a while or I could delete a lock file. Now, there seems to be no lock file (in the same folder). Repairing permissions did not fix it either.  All fixes I found rely on (hidden) lock files being present. Is there a new trick?
