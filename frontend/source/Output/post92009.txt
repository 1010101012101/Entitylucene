publickey error using cvs <body> I'm trying to get a copy of the repository for scrotwm using their cvs repository, but I'm having some trouble. I'm running the pull according to this example: http://onethingwell.org/post/5609933530/scrotwm-osx.  Sadly, when I run the cvs pull I get the following error message:   precodePermission denied (publickey). cvs [checkout aborted]: end of file from server (consult above messages if any)  /code/pre  I haven't managed to get anything else working with cvs, but it looks like an ssh error of some kind. My github is working fine, and I know how to set up new ssh keys for github, but I haven't been able to find anything similar for cvs. Any ideas on places I should look?  <answer92140> It may be because scrotwm has been renamed to spectrwm and I'm guessing the old CVS repository has been removed.  As per the above link, you can clone the new git repository using either of the following:  precode    $ git clone git://opensource.conformal.com/spectrwm.git     $ git clone https://opensource.conformal.com/git/spectrwm.git /code/pre  <comment108149> Ah, thanks. Thought spectrwm was a fork of scrotwm, next step dwm on osx!
