Use HTML as primary source for an e-book usable in Apple's iBooks? <body> Is this possible?  Basically, someone I am working with has a bunch of HTML documents.  He would like to put them into an e-book usable in Apple's iBooks.  Is that possible?  If so, a general pointer to the appropriate documentation would be helpful.  Thanks  <answer51248> I have used Calibre on many occasions to convert HTML files to ePub and mobi format ebooks. It's the ePub format you need to use for iBooks.
