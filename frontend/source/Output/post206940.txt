Does OS X respect Windows Server 2012 AD DS Fine-Grained Password policies? <body> Trying to setup fine-grained password policies, but Mobile Accounts on OS X seem to be hitting the default domain policy versus the fine-grained policy applied to the users.  Does the OS X AD plug-in support the fine-grained policies?  <answer208772> Based on my testing and research, the answer is "no".    Accord to Best Practices for Integrating OS X with Active Directory  "Are subject to the organizationâ€™s domain password policies".    It doesn't reference anything more specifically than the domain password policy, which is the only object that my test clients seem to recognize.
