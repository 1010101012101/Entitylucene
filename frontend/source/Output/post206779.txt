How can I import a PGP public key into Keychain Access.app? <body> I have someone's PGP Public Key (.asc) and would like to import that into Keychain Access.app so that I can email them with my existing PKI certificates which I already use with Mail.app. How can I do this?  <answer206793> I think you're trying to mix two different encryption schemes here: S/MIME and PGP. Mail.app supports S/MIME by default, so I guess that's what you're currently using. PGP support can be added by installing the Mail plugin that is part of the GPG Suite. After you also generate a PGP key for yourself, you can use both S/MIME and PGP encryption. You can receive and decode both, and for each email you're sending, you can choose which one to use.  GPG Suite contains a separate GPG Keychain app for PGP keys.  <answer206794> PGP and PKI are two somehow similar but differently working cryptographical schemes (PGP/GPG vs. PKI). Keychain Access doesn't provide PGP support. Instead you have to download GPG Suite 2015.08 which contains its own GPGKeychain.app.  Here you will find a tutorial how to work with it.
