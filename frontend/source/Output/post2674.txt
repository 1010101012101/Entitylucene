Tool for creating .rar files on the Mac? <body> Is there any good, free program for OS X that can create RAR files? Preferably with a GUI.  It seems there are plenty of options for emextracting/em RAR files, but not that many for compressing them...  <answer2676> SimplyRar will do the trick  <answer2677> Download simplyrar it free and easy to use.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/PrS2A.jpg" alt="alt text"  <answer2690> It's not free, but Rucksack is a great app to create all kind of archives, ".rar" included.    <answer2692> You can use command line rar for Mac OS X, but it doesn't have GUI. On the other hand, it's useful for scripting. (I feel that it should be mentioned here anyway).  <answer2841> BetterZip, it does rar's too, it's easy to use. It does cost though.  <answer208810> Install WinRAR into a WineSkin wrapper. Works perfectly.  <comment2691> Thanks, SimplyRar seems okay. I wasn't sure which answer to accept, but I guess this one, as Simplyrar is free (as in cost), has GUI, and you mentioned it first. :) <comment95816> Actually, Rucksack no longer supports creating 'rar's. <comment183598> Doesn't seem to work with Yosemite. I downloaded from MacUpdate (1.0.8) and the DMG wouldn't even open. <comment353873> +1 for Terminal. But ... how do I install the downloaded files then to always be able to use the commands.
