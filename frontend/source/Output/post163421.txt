Force contacts to sync with iCloud right now <body> I just updated a contact's phone number in the Mac Contacts app.  Now I want to call them on my iPhone (4S), but my iPhone does not have the new number.  Both the Mac and the iPhone are configured to sync to my iCloud account.  How do I force them to sync now, one after the other, so I can make this call?  <answer163521> To summarize, follow these steps:  ol liClose and reopen the Contacts application. Did that work?     strongSide Note:/strong Generally contacts will sync whether the app is open or closed, it doesn't matter, but sometimes devices act up. It tends to happen with older devices, especially if running newer versions of iOS (iOS 8).  /li liTry switching the Contacts tab under iCloud settings on your iPhone. If that does not work, check if that number is visible in iCloud.com/li liIf the phone number is not there, it might be one of two things:   ul liYour Mac is strongnot uploading/strong to iCloud./li liYou might have added that contact under the contacts of a different email account setup on your Mac. /li /ul/li liCheck your iCloud settings on your Mac and open the Contacts app, taking note if the contact is under the iCloud account by selecting the strongiCloud/strong account alone, strongNOT/strong "All Contacts". You will see different accounts (emails) on the left hand side if you allowed contact syncing for email accounts on the Mac.   ul liIf so, drag-and-drop the contact to the iCloud tab./li /ul/li liTo confirm whether your Mac is uploading to the cloud, login to iCloud.com and check the Contacts app.  If you don't see the new contact, you know to focus on the Mac to iCloud sync./li /ol  <answer178266> You can also try to click the circle / arrow thing in the upper left corner in the Contacts app.  <answer180786> I assume it's a little late for your phone call, but for anyone else with this problem you can force both the OS X and iOS Contacts apps to sync with different methods.  strongOS X/strongbr Close (and reopen?) the Contacts app.  strongiOS (8)/strongbr Touch strongGroups/strong on the top left, then drag down until the spinner at the top fills up.  <answer188078> Reboot your iPhone. iCloud contacts started syncing immediately for me. It might work for you.  <answer188994> If you have multiple accounts on your phone such as your iCloud account as well as your work account it is possible that the new contact has been added to the wrong account.  Go to strongSettings/strong-strongMail, Contacts, Calendars/strong and scroll down about 2/3 of the way to the strongContacts/strong section and make sure that strongiCloud/strong is the strongDefault Account/strong.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/SMvKa.png" alt="enter image description here"  If you find that you have been saving contacts to the wrong account there currently appears to be no way to move them to another account using the iOS device. The best way to fix this is to either export them from one account and import them to the correct account then delete from the original (wrong) account. You can also accomplish this via emailing them to yourself from the iOS device.  <answer201167> Open the Contacts app and switch to the groups page (click on "Groups" in the upper left corner). Now drag the screen down for refreshing the groups. This will also sync the contacts itself!  <answer205897> strongSolution:/strong 1) Default account on all devices needs to be iCloud. 2) You can select all of your contacts in OS X and drag them to "iCloud  All iCloud" in Mac OS X Contacts to get them all into the proper account (and thus syncing and showing up on your iOS devices). Apple will even handle the duplicates for you automatically.  <answer210013> Great way to force a sync is to go to iCloud settings and sign completely out and then sign back in - it forces a complete sync and solved my problem with this issue.  <answer212266> The real simple way to force Contacts to be updated is to add a new contact.  I add a new contact with a First Name of "A" and click done.  My contacts are then updated from the cloud.  Then I delete the new contact. **It works both ways - iPhone to Contacts and vice versa.  <answer223955> The iCloud contacts disappeared from my iPhone 6 for no reason. These iCloud contacts were still on the iCloud website, iPad, and mac, but they were not on the iPhone. I tried everything apple suggests on their website several times (https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204150), but nothing worked.   Then I tried turning on Gmail contacts from anther account and magically, the iCloud contacts synced. Why knows why that worked, but it worked for me.  <comment191317> Try switching the Contacts tab under iCloud settings on your iPhone. If not, can you check if that number is in iCloud.com? <comment191327> The change has not made it to icloud.com <comment191330> It seems your Mac is not uploading to iCloud or you might have added that contact under the contacts of an email account. Check your iCloud settings on your Mac and open the Contacts app. Check if contact is under the iCloud account by selecting the iCloud account alone, NOT "All Contacts". You will see different accounts (emails) if you allowed contact syncing for your email accounts on the Mac. <comment191331> The only place I see "All Contacts" is under "iCloud" in the vertical pane on the left.  The place that says "iCloud" cannot be selected, clicking on it does nothing.  The only other thing there is "Smart Groups" (which cannot be selected) and "Last Import" (which can be selected, but has No Cards). <comment191332> Unchecking and rechecking the Contacts option in the iCloud control panel did not trigger a sync. <comment191333> ... but closing and reopening the contacts app did.  WTF? <comment191334> And that's already made it to my phone.  So, to make it sync, I have to close & reopen Contacts?  (Or maybe I could have just closed it?) <comment191338> Generally it will sync whether it's open or closed, it doesn't matter, but sometimes things decide to act up and things like this happen. It might be because it's an older device, especially if your running newer versions of iOS (iOS 8)...it happens. I am glad you got it to work! <comment191405> Care to turn that into a proper answer? <comment195402> To be clear, my iPhone 4S with iOS 8 wasn't acting up - the problem I had wasn't between the iPhone and iCloud, it was between the Mac and iCloud; the contacts app I closed & reopened was the one on the Mac.  After I did that and refreshed the browser tab to confirm the change had been propagated to iCloud, the change had already been propagated to my iPhone. <comment211174> In Contacts Version 9.0 (1563) there is no circle / arrow thing in the upper left corner.  In the leftmost panel there are groups, with no icons at all (unless you count the window close/hide/expand buttons).  In the middle panel there is a search box with a magnifying glass icon, and a clear button, but no other icons.  In the right panel is the contact information, the upper left of which is the contacts picture or the placeholder icon.  I see no "circle / arrow thing" anywhere. <comment243003> It would be nice to leave a comment when you down vote. <comment244022> I didn't downvote, but your answer is already covered here, on April. That might be the explanation.
