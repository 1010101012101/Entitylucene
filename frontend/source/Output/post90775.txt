Keyboard layout for math <body> I usually need to write math with LaTeX, and after seeing this question: Entering unicode math symbols. I came here with some small questions.  I find that not perfectly comfortable, and I was wondering if there is a way in which I could tell the system to differentiate between the left and right kbdalt ⌥/kbd. So I could have much more symbols within one emletter/em.  And, the another question is if there is a way I could turn the kbdcaps lock ⇪/kbd into a different key (with the same use as kbdalt ⌥/kbd, but the system should differentiate them). In this way I could use, for instance,  ul likbdcaps lock ⇪/kbdkbdd/kbd to get the greek letters (in this case the letter delta codeδ/code), and/li likbdalt ⌥/kbdkbdd/kbd to get some math symbol of my decision (in this case the empartial differential symbol/em code∂/code)./li /ul  This is not a great example, but more or less self explaining. Of course then kbdcaps lock ⇪/kbd shouldn't be a turn on/turn off button. It should be emturned on/em ONLY when pressed (exactly like kbdalt ⌥/kbd).  <answer90794> I believe this is all possible. In my answer on TeX.SE, I give the MathUnicode.keylayout file that I made. Essentially, my advice is: go ahead and play around with this file.   A couple of thoughts:  ul liThe XML specification for code.keylayout/code files is available from Apple./li liOn line 22 you can see that I refer to the codeanyOption/code modifier. This refers to the left or right option key. But you can also write codeoption/code or coderightOption/code if you wish to distinguish between the two./li liI'm not sure whether caps can be treated as a "hold down" key, as you want it, rather than a "press on / press off" key./li /ul  <comment106605> Well, that's an advance. Thank you. Probably what I want most is the caps as a hold on, since I almost never use it, and differentiating between right/left options could be messy. <comment106633> I haven't gotten either of those to work with just keylayout files, but [my answer to the question cross-posted at Super User](http://superuser.com/a/593142/69039) describes workarounds using KeyRemap4MacBook.
