Bootable drive for MacBook Air without CD/DVD drive? <body> I'm considering getting a MacBook Air. Since it doesn't have a CD/DVD drive, how can you deal with issues that would otherwise call for a bootable install disk?  <answer97918> Simply with other bootable devices like USB thumb drives or USB/ThunderBolt/FireWire External drives !  Or if you absolutely need a CD/DVD Drive you can use a USB SuperDrive.   <answer97923> The MacBook Air has a hidden Recovery partition that you can use to fix your system and reinstall OS X. Apple has a page on it here. To access it, just hold Command(âŒ˜)-R while your computer is booting up.   If you really need a install USB, Apple has a tool to make one. You can download it here.
