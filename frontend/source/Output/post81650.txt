refresh mail.app inbox when returning from standby (IMAP) <body> When returning from standby mail.app does not refresh my inbox. New mails (or changes to old mails, like move or delete) are not synchronized. I have to manually close mail.app and restart it to make the changes appear.  Is this working as intended or are there settings to change this?  <answer81760> Mail.app doesn't automatically check for mail every time focus is put on it's window or every time the computer wakes up. There are several ways for you to configure how, and how often Mail.app synchronizes with servers:  ol liYou can click the Send/Receive mail button  ul liimg src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/BfCKJ.png" alt="send and receive"/li /ul/li liYou can use the kbdCommand/kbd + kbdShift/kbd + kbdN/kbd keyboard shortcut/li liYou can configure your Mail.app to check for mail every minute by clicking the codeMail/code menu and then selecting codePreferences/code. Under codeGeneral/code change the codeCheck for new Messages/code configuration.  ul liimg src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Li9ss.png" alt="enter image description here"/li /ul/li /ol  This way you never have to wait more then 1 minute for mail to be synced. Keep in mind, if you are on battery, this will impact battery life negatively.  <comment94141> So the clicking the Send/Receive button doesn't work? <comment94147> Well thanks, that's a workaround. Thought it only applied to POP3.
