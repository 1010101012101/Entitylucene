Keyboard shortcut mapping for Ctrl+Alt+Del in Parallels <body> I'm a Windows user with a Windows-oriented keyboard, and I switched the kbdCommand/kbd and kbdCtrl/kbd keys in OSX, because I want to use the same keyboard shortcuts whether in Windows or OSX.  This came back to haunt me though when I installed a Windows VM in Parallels, and it broke the kbdCtrl/kbd+kbdAlt/kbd+kbdDel/kbd key combo to login to Windows in the VM (since the kbdCtrl/kbd key is mapped to kbdCommand/kbd).  I would like to create a shortcut mapping kbdCommand/kbd+kbdOption/kbd+kbdDel/kbd to the Parallels menu item Devices - Keyboard - Ctrl+Alt+Delete, but the shortcuts section of System Preferences - Keyboard does not allow me to use the kbdDel/kbd key.  I tried following the instructions in this answer, adding this:  precode&lt;key&gt;Ctrl+Alt+Delete&lt;/key&gt; &lt;string&gt;@~&amp;#x7f;&lt;/string&gt; /code/pre  to each of  precode~/Library/Preferences/com.parallels.Parallels.plist ~/Library/Preferences/com.parallels.Parallels Desktop.plist ~/Library/Preferences/com.parallels.desktop.console.plist /code/pre  but the key combo is not activating the menu item to send kbdCtrl/kbd+kbdAlt/kbd+kbdDel/kbd when adding the XML to any of those.  What am I doing wrong here?  Do I need something special to activate the options in the "keyboard" submenu of "Device"?  Do I have the wrong code for the kbdDel/kbd key?  Am I putting the XML in the wrong plist file(s)?  strong[Edit]/strong  The problem is worse than I thought, because the keys stay switched in Windows.  Is there a way to set the modifier key behavior on a per-application basis?  It would be great if I could swap the kbdCommand/kbd and kbdCtrl/kbd keys generally, and swap them back in Parallels.  <answer141360> I did not find an answer to the base question, but I did locate a sufficiently good workaround.  Karabiner offers finer-grained control of keys than OSX's keyboard settings, including the ability to add exceptions to key switching.  I used these settings:  precodeKarabiner -&gt; Change Key     Change Command_L Key -&gt; Command_L to Control_L (except Virtual Machine, RDC)     Change Control_L Key -&gt; Control_L to Command_L (except Virtual Machine, RDC) /code/pre  Now all of the kbdCtrl/kbd keyboard shortcuts I am accustomed to work in both OSX and my VMs.  <answer141363> I have always been able to perform the kbdCtrl/kbd+kbdAlt/kbd+kbdDel/kbd key combo functionality in Parallels using kbdCommand/kbd+kbdCtrl/kbd+kbdOption/kbd+kbdDel/kbd. As far as I know this is default functionality (based on the fact that I did not play around with the key mappings in Parallels, and this key combo has always worked for me).  However, I don't know if remapping the keys or playing around with Parallels' settings has broken that functionality for you...  Currently, I am using Mac OSX Mavericks with Parallels Desktop 8 (haven't bothered upgrading to 9 yet, though I doubt they would have changed this functionality).  strong[Edit]/strong  To address your edit: The kbdCommand/kbd key seems to have a double functionality of both being the kbdCtrl/kbd and kbd⊞ Win/kbd keys in Parallels (or at least on my Mac it does... This may be an option I turned on in Parallels' options). However, it has a preference for being the kbd⊞ Win/kbd key.  Therefore, in Parallels using kbdCommand/kbd+kbdC/kbd and kbdCtrl/kbd+kbdC/kbd will both copy, and kbdCommand/kbd+kbdV/kbd and kbdCtrl/kbd+kbdV/kbd will both paste.  Alternatively, using kbdCommand/kbd+kbdD/kbd will show the desktop in Parallels, the way that pressing kbd⊞ Win/kbd+kbdD/kbd does on a regular Windows PC.  However, keep in mind that, as mentioned above, kbdCommand/kbd has a preference for being the kbd⊞ Win/kbd key.  Here is an example of where that may come into play:br/ On a regular Windows PC, kbdCtrl/kbd+kbdF/kbd can be used to search in a program, while kbd⊞ Win/kbd+kbdF/kbd is the shortcut key to find in files. Therefore, in Parallels, kbdCtrl/kbd+kbdF/kbd can be used to search in a program, and kbdCommand/kbd+kbdF/kbd is the shortcut key to find in files.  <comment166603> Using OSX's modifier key remapping screws up a bunch of that.
