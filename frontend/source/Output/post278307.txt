Can't create partition bigger than a few GB <body> I can't partition my start disk, every time I try to partition my disk to a 200GB macOS partition and a 50 GB partition for dual boot it just gives me this error:       "Error: -69787: The partition cannot be resized; try reducing the amount of change in the size of the partition"     I do have over 100GB of free space.br It works if I create a small partition, like 10 or 20GB.br I have tried to repair itbr I have disabled core storagebr I have tried to do it from the Terminal, but it just give me the same error.  The screenshot shows a 200 GB partition is more than enough  I'm running macOS Sierra 10.12.4  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/czqea.png" alt="A screenshot from Terminal"  codesudo "gpt -r show disk0"/code  precode      start       size  index  contents           0          1         PMBR           1          1         Pri GPT header           2         32         Pri GPT table          34          6          40     409600      1  GPT part - C12A7328-F81F-11D2-BA4B-00A0C93EC93B      409640  488555536      2  GPT part - 48465300-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC   488965176    1269536      3  GPT part - 426F6F74-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC   490234712          7   490234719         32         Sec GPT table   490234751          1         Sec GPT header /code/pre
