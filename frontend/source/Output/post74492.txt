Randomly losing CMD+V (paste) functionality <body> I am randomly losing kbdCMD/kbd+kbdV/kbd functionality. Is there a shortcut which might trigger this? So that the keyboard goes into some kind of different mode?  I am working with cmd/shift/option a lot in gfx apps, like Illustrator.   I thought, maybe the kbdCMD/kbd-key is broken, but this happens with both kbdCMD/kbd-keys.  After some time using the system it starts to work again.  I am on Mountain Lion, to which I recently switched, never had this problem prior to Mountain Lion.  <answer91547> I had the same issue, what I found was that using a Software called ShareMouse, and when it crashed, I lost my kbdCmd/kbd+kbdv/kbd functionality; I then forced ShareMouse to close, and kbdcmd/kbd+kbdv/kbd returned.   You may be experiencing this issue with ShareMouse, or some other piece of software.  <comment86544> Have you ever created customized shortcuts in the System Preferences? Maybe you have overwritten CMD+V accidently? I know the probability is very low... but maybe? <comment86659> @cyphorious thanks for the tip, but as I said, it seems to be triggered somehow. So paste works most of the time, but sometimes not. I double checked, no custom shortcuts in sysprefs.
