What is a good use for my old PowerPC Mac? <body> PowerPC processors were rendered obsolete when Apple released Snow Leopard in 2009. Like many other people, I have an old PowerPC Mac. More specifically, I have an older PowerMac G4. It can't even run Tiger, so I can barely run any software on it.br What can I use this computer for?  <answer31186> Using it as a Doc/Print/Music/Video/Graphic server seems to be the normally advised course of action, however my main machine is still a G4 MDD with a G4 17 inch PB (Alli) as my secondary device and i still find them useful on a day to day basis. Why don't you pass it down to a younger/poorer member of your family or a friend?  <comment35739> This is rather vague. Make it useful for what? <comment35758> why is it not useful? what do you want to do with it? <comment35760> Doorstop?  Or more seriously, stick Linux on it. <comment35762> You will not have any fun with Linux for PPC. <comment35765> take of the side, take all the bits out, wipe a liquid plastic all over the inside, add a perspex side instead of the metal one, fill with water and fish. <comment36107> This still seems open-ended and discussiony. Answers range from Andrew's "stick Linux on it" to Graeme's "fill with water and fish". <comment187836> I still use my Powerbook G4 for web development and general browsing, thanks to the latest TenFourFox browser and Leopard-Webkit. PowerPC architecture is still very efficient and stable.
