How can I play chess over Game Center in Mountain Lion? <body> I've looked in Game Center on Mountain Lion and in the Chess game, but I can't seem to see a way to play Chess over Game Center. Does Chess for Mountain Lion  support turn-based play? If it does, how can I enable it?  <answer57722> First of all, make sure you have added your systems knows about your Apple ID (go to emSystem Preferences - Users &amp; Groups - Your User - Apple ID/em).  Then launch Chess; obviously you'll need to have an internet connection.  After a short wait (a second or two in my case, might depend on your internet connection), a badge like the following should appear in the Chess window:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5XZ9w.png" alt="enter image description here"  After it appears, you should simply be able to go to emGame - New.../em and select emGameCenter Match/em in emPlayers/em.
