iPod Nano (6th Generation) Lyrics Support <body> I'm thinking of getting an iPod Nano (6th Generation) and I'm not sure if it has support for lyrics.  Does anyone know if it does?  <answer41818> It certainly does; I've had one.  <comment54294> What do you mean by "support" for lyrics"? <comment73884> If they're in iTunes, they'll also be on the iPod.
