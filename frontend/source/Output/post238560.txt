Has Apple completely dropped support of the COM API for iTunes? <body> Apple used to provide a COM-based SDK for iTunes on Windows. This could be found via https://developer.apple.com/downloads/ and a search for codeiTunes COM/code. It appears as if the download has been removed.  The API hasn't been updated in years, so pulling it from the download section makes sense.  Is there any official communication from Apple, that the iTunes COM API has been discontinued?
