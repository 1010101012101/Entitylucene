What does the clear key do on Apple's numpad? <body> Apple has a keyboard with a numpad. What does the kbdclear/kbd key on the top left of the numpad do? Is it different from the kbddelete/kbd key, if so, how is it different?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4CJOD.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer73129> The standard OS X behaviour is for it to act similar to a kbddelete/kbd key, but only when text is selected. It won't delete forwards or backwards like the standard kbddelete/kbd keys. It also acts as a standard clear button in the Calculator app. This can vary by app however - in Excel for example, it functions identically to the kbdbackspace/kbd key.  <answer160188> I just found out by accident that it is also equivalent to clicking the cancel button on dialogs.  <comment84895> It seems to do the same thing that Escape does in Calculator.
