Can't create new partition macOS Sierra <body> I created a partition on my Fusion Drive (macOS Sierra, iMac) and delete it after a while from the obunto.  Now I want to create a new one and I receive an error message:     Running operation 1 of 1…br   Checking prerequisites for resizing Logical-Physical volume stackbr   You can’t perform this resize unless it has a booter (target partition is probably too small).   Operation failed…   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vhz9J.png" alt="the terminal diskutil list"  <comment348594> obunto = Ubuntu?
