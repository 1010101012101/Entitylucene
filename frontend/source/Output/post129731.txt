Launching/showing calendar from the menu bar <body> Is there any app that would allow me to preview the calendar from the menu bar (i.e. show calendar with a single click)?  It's all I need, I don't even need to open calendar from that app, though it would be nice.  <answer129734> h2iStat Menus/h2  You can do this with the Date menulet as part of iStat Menus.     strongDate &amp; Time/strongbr   A highly configurable date, time and calendar for your menubar, including fuzzy clock and moon phase. Open iStat Menus’ calendar to display upcoming events, or events for any day. Plus, a world clock with sunrise, sunset, moonrise and moonset times for over 20,000 cities.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QUblW.png" width="262"  <answer129736> h2Fantastical/h2  A dedicated calendar menu bar item, Fantastical lets you view and modify your calendar from your menu bar.     strongYour events have never looked better/strongbr   Plan your day in style with the most attractive calendar you've ever seen.

It’s free, as-is (which means I’m not providing support,   taking feature requests, addressing perceived inadequacies or   releasing the source code).   <answer218401> I just started using Itsycal which I like so far:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/PQ7tE.png" alt="Itsycal"  It's free and very simple.  <comment162738> I don't need Fantastical bells and whistles. I just wanted to have a month display in my menu bar. And this is perfect!
