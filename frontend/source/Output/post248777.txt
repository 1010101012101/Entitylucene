How to use AppleScript to un-hide a file's extension? <body> In Finder, if you right click a file → emGet Info/em, you will see a checkbox in the emName &amp; Extension/em section that offers users the ability to emHide extension/em.  If you press Command (⌘)-Shift-3 to take a whole-screen screenshot on your Mac, a screenshot is saved as a .png file. By default, the .png extension for a screenshot is hidden.  Can I change this hide extension status using AppleScript?  hr  If you are curious as to why I'm trying to perform this action in AppleScript, it is because I have a script that involves taking &amp; saving a screenshot, and then naming the file based on the text on the clipboard. And, in this process of renaming the file, Finder no longer recognizes the file as a .png file, so I have to manually change the filename.  <answer248778> Never mind! I found the answer here:  Super User: Show/hide extension of a file through OS X command line  I will delete this question now!  EDIT -   Since some are upvoting this question, I will echo the top answer in the linked question (supplied by @slhck).  A straightforward solution exists, because AppleScript specifically offers a codeset extension hidden/code command designed to do exactly what I'm looking for.  precodetell application "Finder"     set some_file to (choose file)     set extension hidden of some_file to false end tell /code/pre  And that will make the file extension visible!  <comment308381> Rather than delete - maybe explain the script here and keep the link to the other answer? <comment308382> Are you sure? I know how strongly SE frowns upon redundancy, and the question linked is practically identical to mine. <comment308384> @rubik'ssphere Well... Um... True... (Problem with when site topics overlap each other.) <comment341370> Note: It is necessary to insert `file` before the file path when one is not using `(choose file)` to get the file.
