iMovie on iPhone 4 : How to separate audio <body> How can I separate the audio from an existing video file on iPhone programatically?  <answer994> iMovie for iPhone 4 does not offer the ability to separate the audio from the video of a movie. It only allows one track of audio - either a background song emor/em the audio from the clip you're using. If you click and hold on a clip it brings up the Clip Settings view where you can turn off the audio for the clip.  iMovie for iPhone 4 doesn't allow you to do anything programatically. If you're wanting to develop something with the iOS SDK to pull the audio from a movie I suggest editing your question and reading up on what you can do with AVFoundation  <comment841> k, how i mix the existing audio to existing video file pro-grammatically!!! any ideas! <comment1046> If you're looking for an answer to a programming question, please ask on [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/).
