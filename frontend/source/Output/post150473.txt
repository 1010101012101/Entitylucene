VPN won’t work with AirPort Extreme <body> I have a VPN server set up on my MacMiniColo machine running OS X 10.9.5 server.  My iPhone (running iOS 8.0.2) can connect to the VPN server via LTE.  My MacBook Pro (also running 10.9.5) can connect to the VPN server emIFF/em if it (the MacBook Pro) is connected directly to my U-Verse modem.  So far so good.  strongemHowever/em/strong (here’s where it goes wonky) if I connect my MacBook Pro to the AirPort Extreme (either by Wi-Fi or Ethernet), then I can no longer connect to my VPN, and I get this message instead:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5DNC0.png" alt="VPN Error Message"  If I connect my iPhone to the Wi-Fi network created by the AirPort Extreme, then I can no longer connect either, and I get a similar message.  Google taught me that the usual problems are:  ol liAirPort Extreme has Back To My Mac enabled (but I have disabled BTMM on the AirPort and have restarted the AirPort)/li liThe IP address for the VPN is the same as the local LAN (but my VPN IP range starts at 10.0.0.150 and the local LAN uses 192.168.x.x, and I confirmed that I do get a 10.0.0.15x IP when I connect.)/li liPort Forwarding can interfere (so I have removed all of the port forwarding settings)./li /ol  I am at a loss.  strongI can conclude that:/strong  ol liThe username/password is correct on my iPhone and MacBook Pro, because I can get them to work, just not through the Wi-Fi./li liThe VPN is setup correctly on the server side, because I emcan/em connect to it, just not through the AirPort Extreme./li liThe problem would emseem/em to be something to do with the AirPort Extreme, but I am at a loss to figure out emwhat/em it could be, since I have tried everything I can to eliminate known problems with the AirPort./li /ol  So… What should I try next?  Could this be related to IPv6 somehow? I have no idea what I should use when it comes to IPv6 settings.  emUpdate:/em Just to be thorough, I reset the AirPort Extreme to its default settings and tried again. I still get the same errors on the iPhone and MacBook Pro.  emUpdate 2:/em  I turned on “verbose” logging and these are the only messages which appear:  precodeThu Oct 16 12:55:12 2014 : publish_entry SCDSet() failed: Success!

If I recall Uverse does not like it when you use 10.0.0.x ranges internally as well but that may be specific to certain modems.
