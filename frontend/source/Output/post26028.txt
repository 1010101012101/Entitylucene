How do I restore my .bash_profile? <body> I've accidentally overwritten my code~/.bash_profile/code file.    Does anyone have a "sample" one I could copy, or know where I might be able to find one?  <answer26029> Search for dot_files in Google or Github if you like a sample one.   If you like to restore it, you could try to get it from your TimeMachine backup (if present)  <answer26060> Unfortunately this is what revision control is for. There is no way to undo modifications, while deletes strongthrough finder/strong are actually moves to the trash.  Use TimeMachine in the future. Aside from this, it will also give you piece of mind when your current hard drive dies. I know people facing this problem now and if they only invested $30-$50 into a backup hdd, the problems would not happen. I recommend you just learn from this and back up using timemachine periodically.  Github as mentioned by emIan C/em is a great place to back your dotfiles, also you can find dotfiles from others'. Version control to the rescue here, don't know how many times it saved me, but definitely more than I can remember. The advantage of TimeMachine is that it also does version control, problem is that its stored by snapshot time, not logical version.  Good luck.  <answer26066> By default, hidden files cannot be seen in Time Machine or Finder.  If you are trying to restore your file from a backup but can't see the code.bash_profile/code file listed, you need to enable the display of hidden files in Finder.    To enable the display of hidden files type the following two commands into Terminal  codedefaults write com.apple.Finder AppleShowAllFiles YES/codebr codekillall Finder/code  Now perform your restore from your backup of your home directory.  To make these files hidden again, type the following commands into Terminal    codedefaults write com.apple.Finder AppleShowAllFiles NO/codebr codekillall Finder/code    strongNote:/strong Case is important in the commands above.  <answer101883> If you can't use Terminal to access your code~/.bash_profile/code (e.g. it's corrupted) you can use BBEdit or any other GUI editor that can open files from a location and open your corrupted file in order to fix it.  BTW. if you know the location and name of any hidden file, this method can be used to open it (assuming it is a text based file).  <answer120263> There is a backup located at:  precode/etc/skel/.bash_profile /code/pre  Just copy it over your current file.  <answer245965> You can try to recover it using TestDisk.  If that doesn't work, type:  precodex56~:$ alias &gt;&gt; ~/.bash_profile /code/pre  and   precodex56:~$ echo "PATH=$PATH" &gt;&gt; ~/.bash_profile /code/pre  to at least recover your PATH and aliases, which you can paste in your new profile file.  <comment29644> or any other backup - if no backup start producing one now  before doing anything else <comment29649> A good time to mention that [GitHub](http://github.com) is an excellent place to store your dotfile customizations. For an example of how to do this see: http://sursolid.com/managing-home-dotfiles-with-git-and-github <comment29659> Tip: Use Time Machine to make regular backups of your files so you can recover them if accidentally deleted or edited. The single best investment you can make in your computer is a backup plan. <comment29704> Just FYI, I don't think os x has a "default" .bash_profile. <comment29707> This really could have been answered by google ("sample bash_profile"). The 3rd hit provides a rather massively complete sample: http://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/sample-bashrc.html <comment29750> Or just open Terminal and use cp <comment141510> Might be worth to add that this is the standard template, so any changes the user made to his local `.bash_profile` will not be reflected in it. <comment318929> As of macOS Yosemite (10.10) this appears to no longer be true.  It is the standard arrangement on other Unices, but I can no longer find the skeleton file for new users in the file system.
