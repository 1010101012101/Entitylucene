Where can I find a list of changes to Terminal.app in Lion? <body> I'm thinking of upgrading to Lion after hearing that they've upgraded Terminal.app somewhat. The main thing I've heard is that Terminal.app now supports 256 colors, but I don't care about colors. I want mouse events in screen without using MouseTerm.  Where can I find all the changes to Terminal.app provided by Lion? Are mouse events included in this update?  <answer19393> I don't use mouse events, but they appear to at least partially work in iTerm 2, which does not require Lion or MouseTerm.  I tested with "set mouse=a" in vim and was able to select using the mouse, etc.  <answer19396> The Terminal changes in Lion aren't very major, from what I've seen, but they're listed here. Still no mouse events, unfortunately. If you have access, I suggest filing a feature request.  <comment20934> I'm also curious. All I can find from Apple is [this](http://www.apple.com/macosx/whats-new/features.html#unix). Maybe that's it?
