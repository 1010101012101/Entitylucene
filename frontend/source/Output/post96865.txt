How, if possible, can you chat using talk or write in the app Terminal? <body> I have heard you can send messages to other users in Terminal with the command "talk" or "write". If you can in fact do this, how?  <answer96867> The command is just talk. It's disabled in OSX by default. See the comment at the end.  eg.  precodetalk alex /code/pre  It will then open a split screen and ping the other person to chat to you. They have to be logged into your computer at the same time though. Given that most Macs are single-user, this is unlikely, but possible. Have a friend connect in via SSH or screen-sharing and give it a go.  write allows you to write straight onto the other users console. By default though users have it disabled. You can turn it on with 'mesg y'.  precodewrite alex /code/pre  Then type away to irritate the other user.  These are pretty old unix commands. Been around on linux/UNIX for years and years.  The man pages will help you too:  precodeman write man talk man mesg /code/pre  You can test this on one computer by creating a different ID and opening up Terminal with two windows. In the first window log back into your box with the other ID:  precodessh otherid@localhost /code/pre  Then write to the main users Terminal:  write mynormaluser  eg:  precodewrite alex /code/pre  You'll see the text appear in window 2 of the Terminal  To get talk to work on OSX you need to enable it first. As root run this:  precodelaunchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/ntalk.plist /code/pre  or, as a super user:  precodesudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/ntalk.plist /code/pre  <comment113658> ok thanks. Is is possible to do with another computer? Tried the talk command but keeps saying "checking for invitation on caller's machine" <comment113659> talk alex@anothermachinename   -- but, if you're going across the internet you'll probably be blocked by a firewall. On the local network that's less likely but still possible. It's not a command service to have running. <comment113660> what is the machine name? Haha sorry- not too computer savy, maybe this is a dumb question <comment113661> The bit after the @ sign. The name is whatever the hostname of the other computer is. <comment113662> is the like the network it's on or what? <comment113663> run hostname from Terminal. It'll tell you. <comment113664> ok got it, still keeps saying it's checking for invitation on caller's machine". <comment113665> It's off on OSX by default - see the note I added at the end. <comment113666> says permission is denied. <comment113667> Use the sudo version, assuming you're admin the box. Type in your regular password when it prompts. <comment113668> ok I'll try that. thanks for your help <comment113671> ok perfect! now say waiting for party to respond and on other computer, the icon bounces in the dock and it shows a message is being started but how do I accept or respond? Is there a specific command?    Nevermind this comment- I found it! thank you again <comment113672> It actually tells you how to accept. You type the reverse talk command. So, if userA is talking to you type talk userA <comment113675> Also, why the need for ancient unix talking? <comment113677> haha actually saw something like it on a tv show and my brother and i wanted to try it out ourselves
