Engineering software and Bootcamp <body> Need to run DIgSILENT for a laboratory at uni (power system analysis software) and it performs really slow on bootcamped windows 10 (not just this software, the entire OS). Sometimes it closes showing an error while trying to simulate but maybe it's not RAM or MBP specs related.  Macbook Pro specs: 13" Mid 2012, 8GB RAM DDR3, 2.9 GHz i7  What do you recommend me to do? I have these options in mind:  ul liUpgrade RAM: 2x Corsair 8GB SoDimm DDR3L 1600MHz/li liInstall Windows 7/8.1/li liInvest in a new laptop/li /ul  <comment353669> Check out the task manager for clues as to why the machine is running slowly. Try reinstalling Boot Camp drivers. If this fails, consider reinstalling Windows 10. Windows 10 should not in general be running slow on a MacBook Pro. However make sure you compare the performance to other 2012 laptops, and not to a brand new 2017 laptop.
