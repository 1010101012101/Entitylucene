How to disable emoji substitution for pictographs/symbols in special characters? <body> When I try to insert a special character/symbol/pictograph that has an emoji equivalent, it always changes into the emoji instead. Is there a way to make it not do this? I am not asking about how to disable emoji substitution when typing smileys in Messages. This is happening wherever I try to insert a symbol--in Safari, TextEdit, and I even tried symbol and text substitution in System Preferences but the symbols turned into emoji there also.
