Did I really Install GIT 2.0.1? <body> I'm following instructions from http://coolestguidesontheplanet.com/install-update-latest-version-git-mac-osx-10-9-mavericks/   But when I type in "git --version", I'm seeing:  precodegit version 1.8.4 /code/pre  Prior to this, I'd installed GitHub Mac and allowed it to install git. Is it possible that I have 2 git versions installed?  If so, how do I make sure that I'm actually using GIT 2.0.1?  <answer155124> You probably now have two versions of git installed. If you type  precodewhich git /code/pre  in the Terminal, it should tell you which one is in your PATH. For me, the above command returns  precode/usr/local/bin/git /code/pre  The instructions you mention apparently install another copy of git here: code/usr/local/git/bin/git/code  You need to add this new location to your PATH variable. To do so, navigate to your home directory and edit your .bash_profile by typing  precodecd edit .bash_profile /code/pre  and add the following line to it:  precodeexport PATH="/usr/local/git/bin:$PATH" /code/pre  Save the file, open a new Terminal window and try typing codegit --version/code again. Hopefully, it should now run the newest version.   <comment182729> That works . . . thanks!
