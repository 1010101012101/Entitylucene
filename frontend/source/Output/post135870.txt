Is there a keyboard shortcut for 3 fingers slide? <body> I really like having applications in full screen mode and switch between them using the 3 finger swipe feature.  But can I have a shortcut for it?  Maybe like command + - , something like this?  <answer135876> Yes.   kbdcontrol/kbdkbd→/kbd and kbdcontrol/kbdkbd←/kbd do this by default.  Check under System Preferences  Keyboard  Shortcuts  Mission Control.  <answer135877> That would be the      Ctrl-Left or Right Arrow   to slide between full screen applications.  <answer293652> I just realised this. When working on multiple monitors, the shortcut kbdCtrl/kbd + kbdLeft/Right Arrow/kbd will work on the screen with the mouse pointer in it.   For example, if my mouse pointer is on the Mac screen, the shortcut will switch full screen apps opened on my Mac not on the externally connected monitor. This despite my keyboard cursor being present on the external monitor.   <comment161090> is the Ctrl-Left or Right Arrow not working for you ?
