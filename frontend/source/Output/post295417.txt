Display fn keys by default in Touch Bar <body> I would like to configure the Touch Bar of my MacBook Pro (13-inch, 2016) to display by default the static fn keys (esc, F1, F2, ...) all the time, since they are the keys I use the most.   For now, I only managed to configure the touchbar to be static selecting the 'Expanded Control Strip' option (in System Preferences  Keyboard  Keyboard), so it shows the esc, brightness, mission control, etc.   Is there any workaround to do that yet? Running macOS Sierra 10.12.6.  <answer295431> In System Preferences &rarr; Keyboard &rarr; Shortcuts, under Function Keys, add apps to the list to show the function keys by default. The fn key will then be used for the inverse function, hiding the function row instead of showing it.  <comment373289> so I have to add in that list every app for which I want this behaviour to be executed? <comment373290> @Amina Yes that's true
