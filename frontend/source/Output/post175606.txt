Start QuickTime and set camera to iPhone from command line <body> I'm attempting to start QuickTime from AppleScript and select the camera of my iPhone like I do from QuickTime. I can't seem to make it change the camera.  The script I have now is:  precodetell application "QuickTime Player"     set newMovieRecording to new movie recording     tell newMovieRecording         set camera to "iPhone"         start         delay 10 --(seconds)         stop     end tell end tell /code/pre  Of course the part of setting the camera to iPhone is not working.   <comment207128> What do you mean by "select the camera of my iPhone"? Could you explain what you are trying to do, because (to me) that's unclear. <comment207129> In Yosemite you can see your iPhone (ios 8+) screen in Quicktime, you just need to start a movie recording and switch the camera. I want to automate that exact behavior. <comment301276> Pam: I got your script to work, but when I saved it as an App, it will only start recording the regular webcam, unfortunately.
