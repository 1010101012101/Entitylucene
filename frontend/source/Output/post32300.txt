external hd mac ntfs 3g could not mount <body> I got an external hd "clickfree hd" but when trying it with my Mac I get the following error:     ntfs 3g could not mount, error   I have tried NTFS-3G, MacFuse and FuseOSX. I'm running Lion but this seems not to be working. So I'm missing something to mount the drive with read and write capabilities.  The second question is, is it better to format the HD, as I will only use it in my Macs and when using Linux? So if I format it, can I use it for time machine with the machine running Lion as well as backup for another Mac and a Linux machine?  <answer32556> Install NTFS-3g in here: http://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/24481/ntfs-3g  Then install OSXFUSE: http://osxfuse.github.com/  MacFuse has been abandoned for a while now. Someone picked it up and rename it to OSXFUSE  If you want to use it for Mac and Linux, use FAT. If you want to use it for time machine, use HFS Journaled.  <answer43257> Here is a good article that describes helps to setup NTFS on macosx.  <answer79205> This solution helped me without problem, since I couldn't finish last step, immediately after that could not mount stopped. I have Lion 10.7.5 Macbook Pro 2011 and have NTFS Mac-fuse solution installed from early beginning. Don't stop be interested in know, there are solutions for Paragon and some other to. This looks quite dificult for me at first look but now I finally tried it and it takes about 10 minutes. Just don't be scare if you don't know terminal yet, then you'll be prompted to type password it looks like you can't type but you can. Just type and press enter.
