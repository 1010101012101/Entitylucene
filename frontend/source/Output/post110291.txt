How to switch between fullscreen applications in OSX (Mavericks) <body> I use a lot of different spaces for my fullscreen applications to get me focus on the different tasks I have to do. For example, I have a space with my mail app, subversion app, safari and so on.  To switch between my active apps I use kbd⌘/kbd + kbdtab/kbd all the time. Even though the icon of my fullscreen apps appears when tabbing and the menubar getting active, I don't see the app. Only when I go to Mission Control and click the app it will switch to the fullscreen window.  Is there a setting or a shortcut to achieve this without using the mouse?  <answer110297> yes, there is.  Activated System Preferences - Mission Control - When switch to an application, switch to space…   <answer126011> This doesn't let you switch straight to a target app, but ctrl + cursor keys will let you move left and right through your spaces to reach the full screen app.  The shortcut can be changed in system preferences - Keyboard - Shortcuts - Mission Control.  <answer264219> I spent a really long time looking at this and found that under keyboard  shortcuts there is a section under the name keyboard called mission control. It says that ctrl + arrow key, whether it be left or right, will switch "spaces". "Spaces" are your full-screen applications you have running. You can use cmd + tab to switch the focus window that will appear at the top, but it didn't seem to work for full-screen apps as quickly as the ctrl + arrow key. All of those keyboard shortcuts work, but if you wanted a quick way to switch between full-screen apps, just use ctrl + arrow key. I don't know what to tell you for minimized apps though because those don't work. You could just set focus to the app and use the "show available windows" option in mission control by using ctrl + arrow down.  <answer278225> I suggest Apptivate app for this.  Easiest way for switching between apps. No need for complicated shortcuts, jus stroke sequence like: F1, than any key for yours app. No problem to use single key (F1 / F2 / F3 ...), or longer sequence (F1,F2,F1 / F2,F2,q).  <comment129917> This setting is already activated, so unfortunately not a solution for this/my problem <comment132910> Did you turn it on and off again? ;)  This works, the only exception is Finder! <comment207463> Does not work for me either in a specific app (Project Zomboid, works fine elsewhere. <comment227569> is there a way to jump directly to a full screen app when you have more than one? Similar to switching tabs on Chrome using using command+[number]? <comment227589> You can use the regular application switcher (cmd + tab) <comment274326> Works like a charm! <comment328240> problem is when there are multiple full screen windows for a single app.  you cannot seem to bind the control-number sequence to them.  real bummber. <comment336038> @KevinGrabher, however, this only works when there are no other non-fullscreen windows of the target app.
