USB Flash drive not mounting OS X <body> Some months ago I bought a USB flash drive 16 GB, and I have used it on my Windows machine with no errors or bugs, whatsoever.  Since that I need to move some files from my Mac, the flash drive does not appear to be mounting in OS X at all.  When I run in codediskutil list/code in Terminal, the flash drive does not appear, not even in Disk Utility.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/XZvCv.png" alt=""  I am starting to think that maybe something is wrong with the stick? However, the strange thing is that it's working just well in Windows. How can that be? Other flash drive (have tried with a 256 MB) works well on the mac, except the 16 GB.  Any suggestions or thoughts?br I am running Mavericks on a MacBook Pro (older one).  <answer193252> Based on the answers you've given in the comments.  ul liThe device doesn't show in Disk Utility/li liIt doesn't show in System Information under USB/li liIt works in other computers/li liOther USB sticks work in this computer – Changing USB ports makes no difference/li liThe device is getting warm – It also doesn't work in another OS X system/li /ul  I would suggest that there is an incompatibility between this USB stick and OS X, it could be there is some kind of damage to the sticks Firmware or a wider issue with the product that you've not been able to trace down other reports of.  Short of opening up USB Prober and understanding more about how USB communications happen, I would suggest the stick is defective and you try to get a replacement from the retailer.  <answer193303> Today I bought another USB Flash drive, more specific: SanDisk 16 GB. It works perfect with no errors. So my conclusion is that the other USB that did not work was too cheap and not working.  <answer210346> For my case:  ul liThe device doesn't show in Disk Utility /li liIt emdoes show/em in System Information under USB /li liIt works in other computers /li liOther USB sticks work in this computer /li liChanging USB ports makes no difference/li /ul  I just strongemrebooted the system/em/strong, then it's mounted and working correctly.  <answer276945> From this MacWorld article, sometimes a drive can be "connected" and visible in DiskUtility (not Finder), but not mounted.  If that's the case, then you may be able to select the volume in DiskUtility and click the Mount button in the top toolbar, in order to successfully connect it systemwide.  It's not clear to me (perhaps someone would comment) if this indicates a problem with the drive, or perhaps even with the computer or port.  Also I should note I experienced this with a hard drive.  I am not 100% sure that the same problem and solution apply to flash drives.  <comment230205> Check to make sure the device is being recognised by going to: Apple menu  (hold alt) System Information  USB and look through the list for the stick. <comment230207> Its not showing up anywhere in the system :/ <comment230210> So you've checked this screen on your computer... https://support.apple.com/library/content/dam/edam/applecare/images/en_US/osx/usb_rev2.png <comment230213> Yup - Unfurtunately no usb flash shows up there <comment230214> I have questions: Does it show up on other computers? Has it ever worked on this computer? Does it work on any other Mac? Do other devices work in the port? Have you tried rebooting? Have you tried using another port? Is it USB 2 or 3? <comment230217> It shows up on my Windows PC, Laptop etc. However i tried to install hackingtosh on my PC, and there id also did not show up (just for info). I have tried other ports yes, with no result, it is USB 2.0. <comment230218> Do you know the exact make and model, could you google to see if its just this particular device or the whole product range. <comment230224> It is a Nashua 16GB USB flash pen - As far as i can see, there have not been reported any bugs out there. Have googled a lot :) <comment230225> And other USB sticks work fine? <comment230229> Yup. I only have 2 sticks i can check with though. Just for info. I can feel that the stick is being warm (like it's working) so something must be running, it's strange... <comment230230> Ohh. I found out that it has been formatted at MBR, could it do the trick with formatting it to GPT? <comment230231> I am sorry if this isn't a solution, but I think we've exhausted all options, there is some kind of conflict between the USB stick and OS X. <comment230232> MBR won't affect this issue, it should still show in the System Information tab, and in Disk Utility as a device you can format back. <comment230238> I think i will leave it with it's a fault of the USB stick. I mean. I bought it for only $15 so i don't want to do a lot of writing to the company in stuff. I think i will buy a better quality drive and hopefully this time it will work :) Thanks for your patience so far :) <comment230392> Shame not to get the credit as I sis say you should try to get a replacement... <comment232247> I marked your answer as solution, I see what you mean :)
