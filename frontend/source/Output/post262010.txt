Keynote: How to skip "open presentation" window? <body> When I launch Keynote on my new MacBook Pro, the window used to open existing presentations is opened:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/SJQzP.png" alt="Example of window"  I would like to simply open a new document instead, but cannot find an option for this.  Is there any way for me to set Keynote to default to creating a new presentation, instead of defaulting to opening an existing one?  <answer262012> This is determined by the ‘NSShowAppCentricOpenPanelInsteadOfUntitledFile’ key. Setting this preference to false will show the new document view by default.  precodedefaults write com.apple.iWork.Keynote NSShowAppCentricOpenPanelInsteadOfUntitledFile -bool false /code/pre  If you would like a new document to open with a set theme instead of with the theme chooser, go to Keynote Preferences and set For New Documents: Use theme.              img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lTv95.png" width="562"
