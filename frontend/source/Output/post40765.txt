Is there a way to run one application in Full Screen mode on one display and still be able to view and access applications on a second display? <body> When I make an app go full screen on my primary display - ema 24" Apple Display/em - everything previously visible and accessible on my second display - emmy MacBook Pro screen/em - is hidden by the default Lion background image.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3szLW.png" alt="/System/Library/Frameworks/AppKit.framework/Versions/C/Resources/NSTexturedFullScreenBackgroundColor.png"  Is there a way to run one app in Full Screen mode on one display and still be able to view and access applications on secondary display(s)?  <answer40766> The built in full screen (Lion) dominates both screens - and I've not been able to find any setting which lets me use the other one for anything else.   The fix I use for this is Divvy - which enables me to maximise on each screen - but this isn't quite full screen and doesn't provide entirely the same experience. It is, however, a good compromise.   <comment46135> This is clearly the main workable "non-solution" since the full screen dark linen effect on secondary screens hasn't been tweaked, hacked or adjusted in a reliable way yet. <comment46152> I agree - although this functionality is something that OSX should have baked in. They took the hint with Growl, I wonder if they will with Divvy. <comment46500> I'll take a look at Divvy. Thanks.   Hopefully this will be resolved soon within OS X. <comment46508> It will be interesting to see what Apple do with window management as OSX draws closer to iOS, but divvy is definitely my favourite so far.
