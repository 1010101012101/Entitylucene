Is there an AirDrop client for Microsoft Windows? <body> It would be nice to have an AirDrop client for Microsoft Windows. Does anyone know if such a program exists as a shipping product or an open source work-in-progress?  I'm aware that there are many other file sync options, but I'm looking for something that works with Apple's implementation from the Windows OS.  <answer18971> No, I don't believe you can. Apple advertise AirDrop as: "emAirDrop, a remarkably simple way to copy files wirelessly from one Mac to another with no setup;/em" . Key part of that sentence being "emfrom one Mac to another/em" - Second bullet point: http://www.apple.com/uk/pr/library/2011/02/24Apple-Releases-Developer-Preview-of-Mac-OS-X-Lion.html. It's highly unlikely Apple would open this feature up to Windows or Linux because it's a selling point for them in new Macs running Lion.  <answer26361> I have a Mac and AirDrop is pretty good, but Windows laptops and PCs can just use peer-to-peer Bluetooth instead.  <answer29105> If you're a Windows user looking for some of the same functionality as AirDrop, check out Flik. Through it, you can share all sorts of files plus message between friends, like iMessage. Everything happens over wi-fi/internal network.  Also, if you're on a mixed network with Windows and OS X users, those on Macs can run Flik from within Parallels or VMware Fusion.  <answer29132> I install Pidgin on my Windows machines and enable its Bonjour account, which enables file transfers - including with Macs running iChat.  AirDrop is Lion-only, but iChat file transfer works 10.4+.  <answer29775> No, AirDrop for Win does not exist. I think you could use Dropbox with "Enable LAN Sync" option enabled. It will sync your files over local network. If you want to use it at home and in the office, you also might turn on "Selective Sync" to avoid large files transfer over the internet.  <answer29781> You might want to try Dropbox. It works with almost all internet-compatible operating systems, even iOS and android. You'll get 2 GB free storage space for free and you can buy additional storage.   <answer31644> You can try Transfer on LAN. You can transfer files with machines running on Windows, Mac and Linux because it uses Java. It needs no configuration and it's open source.  <answer62051> Try Filedrop. It works for both win and mac computers. www.filedropme.com  <answer113046> There's Bump. its like airdrop, but you have to bump the phone to the keyboard. www.bu.mp  <answer141079> easy way it use iCloud - it's simple and fast. Only need to set it up on a computer and share your screen to you account.  <answer232806> As other answers have said there's currently nothing for non-Apple OSes which can talk to Apple's AirDrop.  However there is Snapdrop which offers similar functionality to AirDrop via a cross-platform and open source web app.  It does require the sending and receiving devices to be connected to the same LAN (rather than creating an ad-hoc wireless network like AirDrop) and uses WebRTC (with a fall back to WebSockets) for peer-to-peer communication directly between them.  More technical details about it can be found on the GitHub page.  <comment20064> I don't think so. It's a peer-to-peer encrypted connection that only works on Lion-to-Lion transfer. If they don't support Snow Leopard (for example), I doubt they'll support Windows. <comment20341> From what I know, Air Drop is built on top of the Wi-Fi Direct protocol. This might help you in your googling attempts but i'm unsure as to how successful you might be. For those who don't know, Wi-Fi Direct is a hardware feature and that's why apple is limiting airdrop to newer macs only <comment20781> And yet airplay which is only for iOS devices to aTV and 3rd party speakers, has clients for Macs, PCs and iOS devices themselves. <comment20782> I don't think it uses the WiFi direct standard, it is peer 2 peer, but I'm pretty sure I read somewhere it's not WiFi Direct <comment20784> That's an interesting point Jonathan, I wasn't aware of that! But given Apple's wording in the AirDrop blurb I think it's unlikely the same would happen. Not impossible, of course. Jailbreak, anybody? <comment20785> I meant to say those extra clients are 3rd party and without documentation from Apple. I think if it uses the network it is easier to duplicate the functionality because the communications can be intercepted. <comment28142> It would be detrimental to sales of the iOS devices that support Airplay if they didn;t support it on a subset of customers setups.  After all, they sell far more iOS devices than Macs, and therefore have a Windows market for those devices.  AirDrop is Mac to Mac, and as such not supporting Windows isn't detrimental to the market in the same way.  Not having Win Airplay would reduce iOS sales.  Not having Win Airdrop will not reduce Mac sales. <comment35206> DropBox is great, but it really offers a different feature set than AirDrop. <comment43875> ...but only for small file transfers.  Bluetooth tops out at around 2-3 Mbps; 802.11n will go to 600 Mbps. <comment76935> Welcome to Ask Different! Answers on Ask Different need to be more than just a link. It's okay to include a link, but please summarize or excerpt it in the answer. The idea is to make the answer stand alone. Please take a look at the [FAQs](http://apple.stackexchange.com/faq) for more info. <comment85350> Is this an actual AirDrop client - if not could you describe if it sets up a zero configuration mesh network (encrypted or not) or is just a UI for file sharing? <comment121033> Doesn't answer the question.  Not AirDrop compatible. <comment166234> How does this answer the question asked? <comment169337> @stuffe You are missing the point. Windows airplay is not supported by Apple. Windows airplay is created by third parties without Apple's permission. <comment170188> @daviewales OK, to be clear, of course there is no product from them that is supported, but it's officially available because the AirPlay protocol is available to be licensed to allow other companies to produce their own products using it.  It's also been reverse engineered from when it was called "airtunes".  New versions of the protocol include Fairplay encryption and and Apple TV for example will only accept client data that uses it, thus removing support for these reverse engineered versions, and yet products (HW and SW) built on the formal licensed protocol still work and are 'supported'. <comment176843> This is like saying building PC is impossible because x86 PC is proprietary to IBM. Apple may not support Airdrop for Windows, but what about thirdparties?
