Folder icons missing on Desktop <body> all of the sudden my folder icons disappeared on OS X Yosemite. It looks like this: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lKbhD.png" alt="enter image description here"  These are all folders, they are not missing their icon in finder tho, only in the primary  view.  <answer219387> Perhaps a relaunch of Finder helps: Apple menu → Force Quit → Finder  <answer219457> First of all a quick reboot might fix your problems. If that does not work, you could try relaunching finder.  Apple icon → Force Quit → Finder → Relaunch. If that does not work you could try deleting the Icon Cache. Go to Terminal, which you can just search for, or go to Applications → Utilities → Terminal. Paste strongexactly/strong these commands in one at a time.   precodesudo find /private/var/folders/ -name com.apple.dock.iconcache -exec rm {} \;  sudo find /private/var/folders/ -name com.apple.iconservices -exec rm -rf {} \;  sudo rm -rf /Library/Caches/com.apple.iconservices.store /code/pre  Do note that when you put in a sudo command, you must put in your password once. The characters do not appear when typing them, so don't worry.   If strongthis/strong does not work, you should do a complete restore of the Mac. Look up tutorials online, but make sure to do a backup of your Mac with Time Machine or a cloud based service.  Good luck!  <comment265323> If you reboot are the icons still not showing correctly?
