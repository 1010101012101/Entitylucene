Is there a way to disable the command+up/command+down key combinations? <body> Command+Left and Command+Right are both incredibly useful key combinations. By contrast, Command+Up and Command+Down are incredibly irritating. I almost never actually need a shortcut to the top of the document. 99 times out of 100, when I press Command+Up or Command+Down, it's by accident, usually when meaning to press one of the useful combinations. Is there any way to switch those two off?  <answer114918> You can use strongKeyRemap4MacBook/strong with a private.xml such as this:  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt; &lt;root&gt;   &lt;item&gt;     &lt;name&gt;Disable ⌘↑ and ⌘↓&lt;/name&gt;     &lt;identifier&gt;DisableCMDUPandCMDDOWN&lt;/identifier&gt;     &lt;autogen&gt;       __KeyToKey__       KeyCode::CURSOR_UP, VK_COMMAND | ModifierFlag::NONE,       KeyCode::VK_NONE     &lt;/autogen&gt;     &lt;autogen&gt;       __KeyToKey__       KeyCode::CURSOR_DOWN, VK_COMMAND | ModifierFlag::NONE,       KeyCode::VK_NONE     &lt;/autogen&gt;   &lt;/item&gt; &lt;/root&gt; /code/pre  Just codeCURSOR_UP, VK_COMMAND/code without code| ModifierFlag::NONE/code would also disable for example option-command-up.
