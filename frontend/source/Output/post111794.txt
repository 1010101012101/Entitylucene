How to download pkg files from iTunes? <body> I need to download a pkg(ipa) file from the Apple Store (using iTunes, i guess iPhone apps are only in iTunes not in the Store App).  How can you download the pkg file(ipa)? (Alternatively, if I downloaded it with iTunes, it says downloaded, where can I find it on the hard drive?)  I was running find / on the entire filesystem but still cant find it.  <answer111802> Downloaded iOS applications are stored in your iTunes library. To find the physical location on disk  ul ligo to the Apps section in iTunes, right-click on the app and select "Reveal in Finder"/li liuse the Goto command in Finder to open code~/Music/iTunes/iTunes\ Media/Mobile\ Applications//code/li /ul  <comment131407> iOS apps are distributed as .ipa files which is a different format than .pkg. It might be easier for people to help you though if you could add some details about what you want to do with the file afterwards/which problem you are trying to solve. <comment131408> Thanks patrix. I can't find ipa files either on my drive. <comment131490> @istvan - take a stepor two back and explain what you want to do - downloading the .ipa might not be the waty to do it (I can't think of a reason to do that) <comment131513> I would like to install an application in the simulator to be able to see what is happening. I am not the developer of that app but I need to get something fixed. I would like to install it and tcpdump the network communication it does.
