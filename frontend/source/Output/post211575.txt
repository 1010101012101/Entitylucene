Lost my mail from Apple Mail <body> I was moving from Hosted Exchange to Google Apps, figured the easiest way would be to drag and drop my email from within Apple Mail (I added both to Apple mail). Unfortunately, my VPN connection dropped midway. This killed the job. The problem is that Apple Mail zapped all that mail from my Mac and it synced at the same time and zapped the mail from Exchange.   Using the time machine is not an option as the only reason I was using Apple Mail was for the migration so it wasn't captured by the time machine.   I'm currently waiting for feedback from my hosting provider to see if there's a previous snapshot of my mailbox.   The mail isn't in any other folder. It's gone.   Any ideas how to recover?
