How can I rename a song in iTunes with a keyboard shortcut? <body> I can hit the up and down arrows to navigate a playlist in iTunes 10.5 but hitting F2 doesn't allow me to rename a song.  I have to grab the mouse and do a finicky click, wait, click to highlight the song and then rename it.  Can I just assign F2 to this?  Or can I use an existing keyboard shortcut?  Incidentally, I know I can hit Command-I, and then Command-2, tab to Name, change the name, and hit Return, but this sub-optimal.  Bonus points if you can explain how I would assign such a shortcut to highlight the Genre of a song, which is my more common use case (long story).  <answer28881> kbdfn/kbd + kbdreturn/kbd works while navigating with the up and down keys. Edit the song, then press return again to submit changes.   For the other columns just press kbdtab/kbd to reach the desired column.  <answer29189> ul liPress kbd↑ Up/kbd or kbd↓ Down/kbd to go to the track in iTunes./li liPress kbd⌘ cmd/kbd + kbd↩ return/kbd.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/98YxM.png" alt="Editing Track Name"  The track name will now highlight and become ready to edit/li liEnter the text of the title.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wvjC7.png" alt="Typing New Track Name"/li liPress kbd↩ return/kbd to commit the renaming of the track.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/RBc3X.png" alt="Committed rename"/li /ul  I made a page of this (with pictures) at: http://goo.gl/eAO6s  See Apple KB Article PH12110 for an exhaustive list of keyboard shortcuts.  <comment33190> Perfect!  Thank you! <comment33192> For keyboards without a `fn` key, use the `enter` key from the numeric keypad (`fn`+`return` is often equivalent to the keypad `enter`). Also ⌘+`return` seems to work for this purpose in iTunes 10.5 (probably on either type of keyboard). <comment33231> @ChrisJohnsen everything you say here is true.  I'll just use the Enter key on my numeric keypad since it's only one button to press.  Thanks!
