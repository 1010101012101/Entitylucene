My MacBook Pro won't exit out of iPhotos <body> I was importing pictures from my Nikon d3200, i had to stop it early, so i pressed the stop importing, and the delete the pictures that you have already imported, then I left. Now, it won't close out of iPhotos and it says it is importing photos, but it said that all day. Since it won't close out, i can't shut down my Mac or restart it. And I can't import the rest of my photos either. What should I do?  <answer163686> There are two ways to exit an application that is stuck:  Hold kbdalt/kbd+kbdcmd/kbd+kbdesc/kbd and then Force quit the application that is not responding.  If that did not work force shutdown the computer by holding the power button for 5 seconds or longer.  In both case you will lose all unsaved information.
