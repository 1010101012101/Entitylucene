Apple ID main setting <body> I have successfully changed all my new information in my icloud account however. When I go into my icloud account it still shows my old email with my name.br I can change and delete everything except that section.br How do I do that?  <comment265956> Can you be more specific about exactly what you changed successfully, and also where the old email address is still showing up?
