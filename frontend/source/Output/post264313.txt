Transferring purchases unnecessarily? <body> Pardon me for not listing thirteen related but strongnot/strong duplicate questions about transferring purchases.    What is happening to me is that strongevery/strong time I sync, I get (not an exact quote) "there are purchases on the iPad that are not in iTunes.  Copy them in?"  Even though I haven't purchased anything in a LONG time, and I say "OK" every time, it still asks again the next time.  My library is in my home account, and due to an unrelated issue, not long ago I removed all ACLs from my account and recursively ensured I owned and had write access to everything in it.  There is no diagnostic message saying it failed to copy anything.  Why might this be and how can it be stopped without stopping a legitimate transfer?  <comment331209> The purchases are likely just updates to apps you have bought previously. <comment331218> That's possible.  I do update frequently on the iPad.  But the MacBook is online every day as well.  Why wouldn't they be updated directly? <comment331249> The auto download feature within iTunes could be turned off... <comment331254> More than one of the related questions suggested that.  But I don't want to turn off all downloads; only _unnecessary_ downloads.  That's the meaning of "without stopping legitimate downloads."
