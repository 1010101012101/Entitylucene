What formats does Quick Look for iOS support for presenting 3D information? <body> I want to present some 3D models to my clients via email. I don't know what apps they have installed and I can't have then install any apps, most of them have a strict app policy.  What 3D formats does Preview for iOS support?  <answer218659> You probably should look at what is listed here: QLPreviewController  Clipped from the developer site:     A Quick Look preview controller can display previews for the following items:      ul   liiWork documents/li   liMicrosoft Office documents (Office â€˜97 and newer)/li   liRich Text Format (RTF) documents/li   liPDF files/li   liImages/li   liText files whose uniform type identifier (UTI) conforms to the   public.text type (see Uniform Type Identifiers Reference)/li   liComma-separated value (csv) files/li   /ul   As far as I know, the only format that could embed 3D information in the format is the PDF file. But does QLPreviewController render it? I do not know.   Maybe an alternative for you would be to make a WebGL website that you link your customers to?  <comment264391> Preview for iOS? It doesn't exist as an app, though mail will preview some things. Empirically, .dae isn't one of them <comment264446> You're right. I'm looking for something UIDocumentInteractionController can handle. <comment264509> Guess I did not read the iOS part of the question... I will remove my answer.
