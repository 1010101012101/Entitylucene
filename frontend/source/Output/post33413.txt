"Hide Input Source Name" changes to "Show input source name" on every reboot, on Lion <body> I use three keyboard layouts (three input sources), and I chose to show the source in the toolbar (I mean the main bar at the top).    Since I moved to Lion, in addition to the icon for the input source (usually the flag of the country speaking that source) it also shows the name (which takes a lot of precious space). I choose the "Hide Input Source Name" from the menu and the name goes away until I reboot.  Any solutions?  <answer33456> As suggested by @Lribr     coderm ~/Library/Preferences/ByHost/com.apple.HIToolbox*/code  works, but you need to get the order right,  first make sure the label is not showing "Hide Input Source Name"  then remove the files as suggested, I guess it is also necessary to restart as well, then add the keyboards (input sources) back.  But it comes back!   This is a bug or something,   For the record I am using  Dvorak-Qwertybr U.S.br Persian    <answer33669> Another thing you could try would be to lock code~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.menuextra.textinput.plist/code in Finder. (OS X performs atomic saves on preference files so codechmod 600/code wouldn't work.)  At least on my account the file contains just a codeModeNameVisible/code key:  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt; &lt;!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"&gt; &lt;plist version="1.0"&gt; &lt;dict&gt;     &lt;key&gt;ModeNameVisible&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;false/&gt; &lt;/dict&gt; &lt;/plist&gt; /code/pre  <comment38113> Have you tried `rm ~/Library/Preferences/ByHost/com.apple.HIToolbox*`? <comment38508> thanks, It was locked already but I now made it read only, let's see what happens. <comment38675> Nop! comes back again! even when locked and I have only read access!
