Upgrade from Mac OS 10.6.8 doesnt work <body> I have a MacBook Pro on OS 10.6.8 I have tried to upgrade to the current OS. The download appears to work fine, but when I select restart to install, the Mac starts to shut down, then just hangs.  I can only start the Mac again by holding down the on/off switch to turn off, and then turning on again.  What is the solution?  <answer174592> Do you have the required hardware for the system you want to run?
