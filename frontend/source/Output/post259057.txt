There's any way to make an Application to "speak" in a specific language? <body> I mainly use OS X in english, but I would like to assign Skype a specific Spanish voice so it doesn't destroy my contacts' name with english pronunciation when it announces different users events ('You have a chat message of...'). I live in spanish speaking country and all my contacts are latino names.
