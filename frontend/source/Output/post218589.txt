Tunneling ssh via ssh with foxyproxy <body> I'm tunneling over ssh with this command (under El Captain)  precodessh -D port_number -N -C myusername@server.url /code/pre  and enable foxyproxy on the browser. Everything seems to work just fine on the browser. However, on the terminal I keep getting messages of the form     channel X: open failed: administratively prohibited: open failed   for various channel numbers. I set codeTunnel yes/code in code/etc/ssh_config/code but that did not do anything. I repeat, things work despite the error messages.   <answer218593> Again. many things mixed up together. What are you trying to achieve? There are few things wrong, in your post:  ul licodeTunnel/code option in codessh_config/code does not do anything related to the SOCKS5 Proxy, which is the command you are describing. It is related to VPN and "ethernet" (layer 2) tunnelling, which is initiated by code-w/code option/li liPort forwarding and SOCKS5 proxy (code-D/code) is allowed by option codeAllowTcpForwarding/code in codesshd_config/code on the server!/li liIf you would really want to user layer 2, forwarding, you need root login on the remote server./li /ul  <comment264262> Does this answer help: http://unix.stackexchange.com/a/215262 ?
