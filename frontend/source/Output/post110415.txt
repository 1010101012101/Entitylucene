PPC emulator to run MacOSX 10.5 <body> Is there any PPC emulator (for either Intel Macs or any Linux) which can run MacOSX 10.5 PPC?  My current research only points me to PearPC and the latest post/release was from 2011. On the homepage, they say that they have support for MacOSX 10.3 with some caveats. Also, it doesn't seem to emulate a soundcard which is relevant for me. Some totally outdated forum posts are asking about MacOSX 10.5 but without any real answers, e.g. here or here.  <answer186835> To do a 100% accurate test your best bet would be to get an actual PowerPC Mac. Alternatively, you can install 10.6 (Server) in a Virtual Machine, which can test PPC Applications through Rosetta.  <comment130055> If you se Snow Leopard then Tosetta will run many PPC programs - in general is there a specific reason to run 10.5 ? <comment130056> I have only MacOSX 10.9. I'm developing applications and want to test if they run on MacOSX 10.5 PPC. <comment130058> Might be simplest to get an old Mac :)
