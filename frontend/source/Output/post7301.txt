Font Book does not Install all fonts <body> My Mac decided to delete all but 19 fonts, which is fairly annoying. It didn't really delete them, as in I still have the original files in the code/Library/Fonts/code folder, but they've disappeared from Font Book, so I can't use them.   Now, Apple says that you can select a folder to install emall/em fonts in that folder, but when I try that, the spinning wheel (not the beach ball) comes up in the lower right hand corner for a few seconds and then leaves, without installing any fonts. The same thing happens if I use the code+/code sign in the menu bar, select multiple, or if I try validating and then installing (actually, that installs one font).   Is there any way to mass-install these fonts or will I have to install them one by one?  System info: Mac OS X 10.5.8 running Font Book 2.1 (123).  <answer7308> Try opening two windows: a Finder window with all your fonts, and Font Book. Select all the fonts and drag them into "All Fonts" in Font Book's left pane. That worked for me, but (a) I don't know if it'll beachball on your system, (b) I'm on 10.6.   <answer7318> I'll bet you have a font corruption problem.  ol liSplit the uninstalled fonts into two groups./li liImport the first group./li liCheck to see if they imported successfully. ul liIf yes, you know the problem is in the second group, so go to step #1./li liIf no, the second group might be okay, so try importing that./li /ul/li /ol  And so on.  You should be able to narrow down the problem without having to import each font one at a time. But my guess is that one or more of your fonts is corrupted.  <comment8243> That's thinking like a programmer ;o)
