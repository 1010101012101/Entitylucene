DNS Issues after Updating to Mountain Lion <body> I've updated to Mountain Lion, and I'm having some DNS problems. I always PPTP/L2TP VPN connections on my macbook. Recently after a while of working with Mountain Lion, VPN stops sending and receiving data and I have to disconnect/connect again to make it work again. I'm not having the same problem with iPad, iPhone and PC.  and without the VPN, when I try pinging 4.2.2.4 , 8.8.8.8 and other DNSs and all I get is timeouts! But the ping works fine on my other devices. I also tried setting the DNS to Google and OpenDNS DNSs (8.8.4.4, 4.2.2.4, 8.8.8.8, ...) but it still didn't help. I also tried emptying DNS cache and other solutions. but nothing.  I'm guessing that these two problems are tied together. Any solutions?  Thanks.  <answer61507> change the primary DNS to your local gateway address, like 192.168.1.1 or 192.168.0.10... I have the same problem in PC, try it, It may be useful ;)  <answer61508> in windows too but set it manually, and use the "4.2.2.4" in secondary DNS server... if u have this Problem without VPN, use one of these DNSs : 217.218.155.155 or use the "namebench" software to find best local DNS server for u... ;)   <answer61796> Updating to OS X 10.8.1 fixed the bug.   <comment71030> In Mac OS it is set to local gateway by default if you don't provide any other DNS. So that's not the case <comment71031> http://code.google.com/p/namebench/
