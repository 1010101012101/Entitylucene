How can I change default X11 application? <body> I compiled my own X11 Server for Mac OS X and want it to replace the original outdated X11.app supplied by Lion. How do I do that?  <answer32246> ol licd to /usr/X11/bin /li lirename the existing X symlink to Xquartz (to X_orig for example) in case you need to revert in the future to the "vanilla" config/li lisymlink X to your compiled binary./li /ol  <answer35295> The XQuartz install docs have an alternate approach for installing their X11 binary. They use launchctl and set the DISPLAY to point to the socket for their server. I believe the program it runs (launchd_startx) listens on the socket and starts the X server when a connection is made. The nice thing about this approach is it leaves the original X11.app unmodified.  <comment35033> How did you compile the server - ie where is its documentation? <comment35089> Actually I installed the MacPorts xorg-server-devel package. <comment37020> I'd like to replace the original X11.app with my own build. <comment37021> By symlinking X from /usr/X11/bin/X to your compiled binary, you're already using your compiled binary. Not sure if I'd recommend rm instead of mv the original X.
