Migrating Mail.app rules from 10.6 to 10.8 <body> I want to move my Mail.app filtering rules from my old 10.6 machine to a fresh 10.8 install. I've seen people talking about moving these by copying over  MessageRules.plist, but I haven't seen anyone address whether these are compatible between 10.6 and 10.8. Thanks!  <answer63125> I copied all of the user-created code&lt;dict&gt;...&lt;/dict&gt;/code items from my old codeMessageRules.plist/code and added them to:  precode~/Library/Mail/V2/MailData/UnsyncedRules.plist /code/pre  When I launched Mail.app again, they were in my rules, but disabled. One click on each and they ran fine.  strongNote/strong: Simply replacing the entire set of code&lt;dict&gt;...&lt;/dict&gt;/code items in codeUnsyncedRules.plist/code will not work. You must add them into the current set of items in order for it to work properly.  <answer78935> For all those who tried copying the MessageRules.plist file over from 10.6 to 10.8 and got nothing here's what I did to get them working.   Essentially copy all the rules via copy/paste from  MessageRules.plist (10.6) to SyncedRules.plist (10.8) - use a text editor to copy and paste everything from the code&lt;/array&gt;/code tags in the old file to the new one. Then restart Mail.  Longer version: Copy MessageRules.plist from UsersUserLibraryMail on your 10.6 machine to anywhere your 10.8 machine. Open up the file in a text editor and copy everything between the code&lt;array&gt;&lt;/array&gt;/code Tags. Then paste it all in the file SyncedRules.plist on your 10.8 machine in LibraryMailV2MailData inbetween thecode&lt;array&gt;/code tags. Restart the Mail app and all the rules should show up in preferences section.  Mail will slowly even create the folders/mailboxes to store the messages in folders that don't exist but are pointed too in your rules that you imported.  <comment109904> I also had to make various edits because the folder references needed to be changed to reflect new paths with V2.  It helped to make a dummy rules refiling to subfolders in each of my accounts, so that I could see how they should look.
