Can one use a 2nd external monitor together with the new iMac 5k? <body> Sometimes I like to have monitoring data to be displayed on an external monitor to be less 'in my face', even so I would have place for it on my main screen. So, is it possible to attach an external monitor to the new iMac 5k?  And can somebody with powers maybe generate a new tag iMac5k, if it is considered useful?  <answer155955> Yes. According to Apple's website, under the device's "Connections and Expansion" section:     Headphone portbr   SDXC card slotbr   Four USB 3 ports (compatible with USB 2)br   Two Thunderbolt 2 portsbr   bMini DisplayPort outputbr   Support for DVI, VGA, and dual-link DVI (adapters sold separately)/bbr   10/100/1000BASE-T Gigabit Ethernet (RJ-45 connector)br   Kensington lock slotbr   iMac with 5K retina display specs  <answer157216> I know there's an accepted answer, but I'm running a BenQ GW27605HS as a second monitor via a Thunderbird - HDMI adapter and works great.  There seems to be a Yosemite bug (ANOTHER Yosemite bug) where the screens will always start up mirrored, but a visit to the system prefs quickly fixes it.  Btw, I would definitely upgrade to the faster graphics card if you're going to do this -- I'd do it anyway with the 5K display but especially if you're going to use an additional monitor.  <comment183442> where did you look up ? <comment183447> yeah, sorry, i looked at Apple specs but was confused with the issue that the iMac does not work as external monitor itself.
