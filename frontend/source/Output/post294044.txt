9 Keyboard keys not working <body> So I've been "suffering" from my hardware issues for months now. br My entire keyboard and trackpad stopped working (while all other I/O devices were working perfectly) so I've been using the bluetooth keyboard/mouse for the time being. The IT guy at my work said I needed to replace the entire top case, which I couldn't and still can't afford. br So I brought it to Apple for diagnosis, just in case it was the flex cable problem. They said it was, and after replacing it, my keyboard and trackpad worked!..EXCEPT the 9 keys in the top row. br All my keys work except QWERTYUIO (P works, oddly). What's the problem here? How can I fix it besides replacing the entire top case? br Apparently replacing the top case is for replacing the tiny connection chip that's permanently attached to the case. It's really wasteful (in terms of money and resources) to re-purchase and discard the entire case when the problem lies in the tiny chip. Any way I can perhaps take that off and then replace it? br
