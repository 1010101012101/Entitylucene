Disable iPod at certain time <body> I find my self on my iPod (5th Gen) late at night (until 12 or 1 in the morning), and want to know if there is a Cydia tweak that locks me out of my device at a specific time.   <answer235517> You can do it with codeActivator/code. After installing it in the Cydia you can assign Actions to the Events. For example you can assign this workflow:  precodeAnywhere &gt; Build &gt; Scheduled &gt; Sun,Mon,Tue,Wed,Thu,Fri,Sat 12:00 AM &gt; Save &gt; Done /code/pre  Now select:  precode12:00 AM &gt; Lock Device /code/pre  Although this workflow just locked your device and does not strongrestrict/strong the usage after the 12:00AM, it acts like an alarm.  The other tweaks that can do the restriction are: AppCap, Parental Controls.
