DefaultKeyBinding.dict: moveWordBackward: is not overridden on macOS Sierra <body> I've recently started using a new computer (actually a Hackintosh) on macOS Sierra. My previous development machine is still on El Capitan. In the process of setting up the new machine I've added code~/Library/KeyBindings/DefaultKeyBindings.dict/code.  Most keybindings (specifically option+f for moving the cursor a word forward) work fine. However, option+b for moving the cursor a word back simply acts as a dead key and types a codeË˜/code character.  The relevant section of DefaultKeyBindings.dict looks like this:  pre class="lang-xml prettyprint-override"code&lt;key&gt;~b&lt;/key&gt; &lt;string&gt;moveWordBackward:&lt;/string&gt; /code/pre  Adding this specifically to, e.g. TextMate's specific code~/Library/Application Support/TextMate/KeyBindings.dict/code file results in option+b working in TextMate, but obviously has no effect elsewhere:  pre class="lang-xml prettyprint-override"code&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt; &lt;!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"&gt; &lt;plist version="1.0"&gt; &lt;dict&gt;     &lt;key&gt;~b&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;string&gt;moveWordBackward:&lt;/string&gt; &lt;/dict&gt; &lt;/plist&gt; /code/pre  How can I avoid having to change my habits with regard to codemoveWordBackward:/code?  <answer265003> I finally solved this after realizing that the difference between my El Capitan (10.11) machine and Sierra (10.12) was the new dead key on Option-b. Whether this is a difference between keyboard layouts or OS versions I haven't been able to determine.  It seems that KeyBindings are unable to override dead keys. Using Ukelele I was able to change the output of option-b to some other character. I then installed this keyboard layout and moveWordBackward: began working with no further modifications.  ol liIn Ukelele, Choose File-New From Current Input Source/li liRight click on the Layout Name and choose Set Layout name and Script  ul liRename to something like codeU.S. No B Dead Key/code/li /ul/li liDouble click on the layout name to open the layout editor./li liHold option, then right click the codeb/code key; choose Make Output/li liEnter any other character; it will be overridden by DefaultKeyBinding.dict/li liSave/li liChoose File- Install For Current User/li liIn the Keyboard Preferences, choose your new keyboard layout./li /ol
