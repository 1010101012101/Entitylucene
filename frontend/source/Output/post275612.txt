Boot into Windows 10 takes multiple tries <body> Since a few days I am running into an issue with my Windows 10 installation on Bootcamp.  I own a strongMacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Early 2015)/strong and run strongmacOS Sierra 10.12.3 (16D32)/strong and have the latest Windows 10 installed via Bootcamp.  Usually it takes 1-2 tries to get the OS Selection screen via Option key and boot into Windows but since a few days I have the issue that it takes 50-60 tries or more before I am presented with the OS Selection screen. I already reinstalled Windows but the issue still persists.  What could cause this and is there a way to fix it or is there an Application for macOS which would allow me to reboot into Windows without needing to use the OS Selection screen.  <comment346729> Could that problem be related to this question I asked about a week ago? http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/274687/178418
