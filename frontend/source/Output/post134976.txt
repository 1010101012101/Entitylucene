Why does my 2.5 TB HDD appear as a 2.2 TB HDD and a 300 GB HDD? How do I merge them? <body> I have a Western Digital 2.5 TB hard drive. (Model WD25EZRS) It's connected through an external USB dock to my iMac, running Mac OS X Mavericks.  In Disk Utility there are two volumes, totaling 2.5 TB but separate as 2.2 TB and 300 GB. How do I format / partition / group the volumes to use this was one large drive with one partition?

Not one of the partitions, but the whole harddrive. Then click codePartition/code in the tabs on the right (see screenshot). Then click on the the dropdown menu (where codeCurrent/code stands in the screenshot), and select 1 partition (see screenshot 2). Click apply, and wait. Then you have 1 volume.  strongNote/strong, your data will go lost. Save it somewhere else. Then you can safely put it back, after it has become 1 volume.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ixV4G.png" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Rw4lU.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer135040> I just figured it out. It's the USB Docking station that I'm using. It has a limit of 2 TB for the drives that it supports.  monoprice link  <comment159949> Do you need to preserve any data on either partition of the drive? <comment160019> Nope. It's a brand new disk. <comment160021> I added a screenshot of my Disk Utility. Notice the bottom two drives are the same physical disk. <comment160056> Okay. Than it isn't solvable this way indeed. I won't delete it though, as it will work 99% of the tjme
