Macbook air 2011-mid keyboard keys Q W E R T Y U I O working sporadically <body> I have an issue where only QWERTYUIO keys are working sporadically or just not working. I have to press them a lot of times to start working and they work for a while and stop again. I have tried reseting PRAM and SMC but with no luck. When I use the Keyboard viewer they keys are not even being registered when I press them.   Kind Regards  <answer251370> here after, you'll find a way to remap some keys with the "Fn" key. It'll give you the opportunity to use your Macbook air while outside.

After 2 months of research and almost spending $600 to replace the top case I found this video:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh88cn_rtLo  I remove the top case of the key and gave a good clean and they start working again!!!  I know this reply is for an old post but I might help other having the same issue. If this doesn't work, it might be a hardware fault :/  <comment266109> Sounds like a hardware issue. <comment266111> Maybe opening up the laptop and cleaning the keyboard from the other side would help. I have no idea what to do now. Don't want to go to AppleStore and drop 200euros just for a simple fix, they would replace the whole keyboard probably <comment266114> If you have a can of compressed air, perhaps a squirt or two under the keycaps would help. Sometimes minuscule food crumbs can be pulverized  by hitting the keys rapidly. Is it possible you spilled something on the keyboard? Because the keys are in a straight row, and not a random selection, I still think its a hardware issue. It <comment266115> Possibility it's the battery swelling. I'd definitely get it looked at. <comment266265> Replaced my battery 4 weeks ago, it said service battery, I thought the issue would stop but it persists. <comment274327> Have you verified that an external keyboard works ok? <comment312469> Welcome to Ask Different!
