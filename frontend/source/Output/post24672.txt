Is it possible to clear Automator logs? <body> How do I clear Automator logs?  <answer24686> Go to ~/Library/Logs/ find the log file, and delete it. Or, if there isn't a log file for Automator there, go to /Library/Logs and find the file there.  <comment27722> Do you mean the logs shown inside the automator app? Or logs generated by workflows or apps you created using the automator app?
