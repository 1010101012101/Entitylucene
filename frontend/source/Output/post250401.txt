Russian keyboard vanishes each time my Mac is started <body> I'm using codeEl Capitan/code on my Mac Mini now but it started when I used codeYosemite/code. I need both English and Russian keyboard layouts on my Mac. However at some point I started finding Russian layout missing once Mac is launched, so I have to go to the settings and add Russian again every time my Mac starts. Did anybody encounter a keyboard vanishing from the system constantly? What makes it dissapear every time Mac is shut down? Ayn ideas how to fix that?    <answer250944> You could also try to delete code~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.HIToolbox.plist/code, code/Library/Preferences/com.apple.HIToolbox.plist/code, or code~/Library/Preferences/ByHost/com.apple.HIToolbox.*.plist/code.  <answer290963> Go to System Preferences - Language &amp; Region.br Set English as Preferred language. Unfortunately, your macOS becomes English, but it's the only way that solved this problem on my Sierra 10.12.5.  <comment310899> By "language" you mean the keyboard/input source, right?  Your OS interface is English? <comment310902> Yes, this is what I mean. No, my OS is Russian. Is it the case? <comment310918> Did you set Russian as your primary keyboard when you first set up your Mac? <comment310919> Try going to system prefs/keyboard/input sources and adding some other keyboards besides US and Russian, such as French and German.  Do they all disappear when you restart? <comment311125> my primary keyboard was English. I also tried adding German, it vanishes as well, along with Russian. my Mac loves English only. Can't stand other languages <comment311132> Try setting up a new user account and see if you have the same problem when logged into that.
