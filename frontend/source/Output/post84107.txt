Mail won't download emails of the last two years <body> I set up Mail ages ago and it won't download emails from my Gmail account from October 2011. Any ideas why? I tried Rebuild with not much success. Interestingly a different gmail account works perfectly.  <comment96765> Is there a mail that is corrupt in Oct 2011. On a proper IMAP server I would try moving those to another mail box to alter the loading order but gmail is different and it might not make a difference <comment96872> Thank you Mark, will try that then!
