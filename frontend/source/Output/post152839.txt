My battery died toward the end of Yosemite installation. Now login screen freezes <body> My Yosemite installation was at "less than a minute remaining" for about 5 mins. Then my battery died. When I charged and turned on the power, I got to the Yosemite login screen. When I log in, the password succeeds, then the login screen reappears but the screen freezes.  I've tried it about 20 times now. Same thing happens every time.  <answer152849> Access OS X Recovery by holding kbdCmd âŒ˜/kbd+kbdR/kbd from the time you boot your system until you see the Apple logo.
