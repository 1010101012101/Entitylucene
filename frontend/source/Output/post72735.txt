Close down all background iPhone apps without clearing task switcher (Jailbreak) <body> I have a 3GS running 5.1. Memory management is key to keeping it running smoothly.  I've tried:  ul liSBSettings processes. Clears apps one by one and clears memory - and leaves them in the task switcher. But you have to clear one by one/li liRemoveBG. One press but removes all apps from task switcher/li liWeeCloseApps - as above. /li /ul  Is there a tweak or app that can:  ul liclear all running apps in one press/li lileave all apps in the task switcher/li liclean up memory/li /ul  This is because I use the task switcher as a "recent used apps" list - which is sort of Apple's model - for example, when you reboot iPhone no apps are running in the background, but the task switcher is still populated with your recently used apps.    <comment84534> Reboot the phone! Clears all running apps but keeps task switcher content. <comment84602> That certainly does it - but takes ages.  When some apps crash (eg Safari) they dump you back to the homescreen, clear all the RAM and leave the apps in the task switcher. Maybe I should just find an app that crashes consistently!
