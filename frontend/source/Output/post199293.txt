Can't connect to Cisco VPN (IPSec) after upgrade to os x server (Yosemite) <body> I have had a working VPN connection to a Cisco VPN on OS X with no trouble for a while now.  Last night, I upgraded my Mac running OS X Yosemite (10.10.4) to OS X server. Since then, I can no longer connect to the VPN (other devices can still connect).   There are no error popups and I can't find anything obvious in the console  (except for what I copied in below). It just "hangs around" trying to connect, doesn't show a password prompt, and then after a while I assume it just times out.  I am at a loss as to how to fix it. I hate problems with no errors. Here is what I have tried:  ol liBased on a suggested fix, verified that I am using DHCP/li liChecked the console for errors (this is all I could find):     8/08/2015 9:49:21.872 am racoon[2403]: IPSec connecting to server   ipaddress 8/08/2015 9:49:21.872 am racoon[2403]: IPSec Phase 1 started   (Initiated by me). 8/08/2015 9:49:21.919 am racoon[2403]: IPSec Phase   1 established (Initiated by me). 8/08/2015 9:49:21.939 am   racoon[2403]: IPSec Extended Authentication requested. 8/08/2015   9:51:21.941 am racoon[2403]: IPSec disconnecting from server ipaddress   8/08/2015 9:51:21.953 am racoon[2403]: IPSec disconnecting from server   ipaddress /li /ol  (so it basically just sits there between "Extended Authentication requested" and "IPSec disconnecting")  ol start="3" liDeleted and redefined the VPN connection/li liRestarted system/racoon/etc/li /ol  Does anyone have any idea about the cause or how to get additional information for debugging this problem?  Much appreciated.  <comment238833> I don't see the relevance of the article you referenced to my question. Is that the one you meant to send? This article refers to an issue with using the caching server on mac os x when a vpn assigns an IP address to the server (oh how I wish I had got as far as having an IP address assigned from the VPN server :) <comment238836> Tentatively, I may have managed to fix this based on the answer here: http://superuser.com/questions/142806/macbook-not-connecting-anywhere-via-vpn Specifically, I think fixing disk permissions and reloading cached extensions may have done the trick. Will see if the problem is still addressed after a restart... <comment239999> I spoke too soon - the problem keeps coming back... <comment242048> OK, so after going through the advice from the superuser question above, it mostly works, except when it stops working. This seems random and the only way to fix it is to restart the Mac. The messages I get for IPSec are the same as the ones above. Sigh. <comment247200> Well, I gave up and uninstalled OS X Server and the problem seems to have gone away. Wish I understood what caused it.
