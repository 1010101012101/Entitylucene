Is it possible to send push notifications to the iPhone Simulator? <body> I am developing a push notification infrastructure and would like to test it with the iPhone Simulator on a Mac.   Is this possible, or do I need to use a physical iPhone?  <answer42871> Push notifications don't work in the simulator.  You have to use a physical iPhone, iPod Touch, or iPad.  Good luck,  Mark  <answer93552> You can test Push Notification using any button Click event. First of all you have to create dictionary, like below.    precodeNSString *StrTemp = @"{'aps':{'alert':'Test alert','sound':'default'}}"; NSData *tempData = [StrTemp dataUsingEncoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding];  NSDictionary *testNotification = [NSJSONSerialization                                   JSONObjectWithData:tempData                                   options:0                                   error:nil]; /code/pre  And you can send notification like below.    precode[[[UIApplication sharedApplication] delegate] application:[UIApplication sharedApplication] didReceiveRemoteNotification:testNotification]; /code/pre
