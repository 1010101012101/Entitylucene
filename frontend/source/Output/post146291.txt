iPhone 4 microphone not working in phone calls but working in other apps <body> People cannot hear me when I make a normal phone call. When I use Skype or Facebook call it works but not during a normal call.  I have done a phone reset already but didn't work  Any ideas?  <answer146295> h12 mics/h1  You have 2 microphones on your iPhone:  ol liOne for normal calls, this one is broken in your case/li liOne for environment sounds. This one is used for video conference calls, video's, sound recordings. This one still works./li /ol  My suggestion is to go to iFixit and replace your dock connecter. This replacement also fixes your mic.  <comment172370> Welcome to Ask Different! I've expanded your title to attempt to summarise the actual problem.
