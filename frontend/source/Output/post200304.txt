How do I plot two data streams in Numbers as a graph? <body> I have two different streams of fractional values I want to visualize using Numbers for Mac.  They both have one value per line and both look would look something like this (with different values obviously):  precode0.04 0.1 0.05 0.0993 1.3 0.534 ... /code/pre  And I basically want it to have the index (so 1, 2, 3, 4, etc.) as the x axis and the amount (in seconds) on the y axis, and have the two data streams. And I'd like to have it as a line graph or a bar graph.  I can't figure out how to do this however.  <answer200306> Add a chart, I used this one:  img src="https://i.imgur.com/FfrkonO.png" alt="Chart to add"  Then click [Add Chart Data] and select the columns for the data streams  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qSogT.png" alt="select data"  <comment241346> My issue with that is that it puts the first one as the x axis and the second as the y axis, which isn't what I want, I want both to be the y axis but on separate curves, and their index on the x axis. <comment241347> that's not what I'm seeing: http://i.imgur.com/TglR5Qq.png <comment241353> How do you get the numbers on the side? They don't show up for me <comment241356> I added them manually. If you type 1, then 2, select both cells and drag the yellow circle down <comment241360> Is there a way without doing it manually? That's incredibly tedious for thousands of items <comment241370> Hmm, lemme see if I can get it to work without that. <comment241372> When I do it without the left-hand numbers, it works but puts no title on X axis, which can be remedied by going to the inspector - axis - X - category labels
