How To Changing Printer Scaling on Mac OS X 10.8.2 <body> I am currently having an annoying problem where anything I print in Mac OS X 10.8.2 is scaled to 3%, and I cannot seem to change this through the printing menu.  I've attached a picture of my printing presets which shows that the scaling is stuck at 3%, though I cannot reset the scaling from this menu. The presets window shows the "scaling" option under "Copies &amp; Pages" but this does not show up in the printing drop-down menu... so I'm stuck.   Does anyone know how to change this setting?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/AGbM5.png" alt="Printing Presets" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9Hgue.png" alt="Printing Menu"  <answer89582> Here is what I did.  In for example TextEdit...  I used the Page set up!  In there you can adjust the scaling  Now go to the print and check you settings in show presets, current.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NWtLG.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer89586> Your first step is to try printing to .pdf from a [virgin] User Account.  Failing that test, I would reinstall the O.S.  <comment105185> What printer is it? those are the printer settings not OS x. <comment105187> The settings are the same no matter which printer I choose. I actually do not even want to print. I only save the document as a PDF, but I can't since everything is scaled to 3%. <comment105188> The second picture is the default Print Menu that pops up in MS Word / TextWrangler... so I'm assuming that it's the same for all OS X apps. I can change it in Preview, but that's about it. <comment105237> This looks promising! Where is the "page setup" in TextEdit? <comment105238> Found it! Page Setup is under the File Menu. This is honestly something that just has to be fixed in OS X.
