Allow different keys remaps for different keyboards <body> I'm using a MBP with a German keyboard. However, as you probably know, it is an annoying layout. Therefore, I use the normal US layout instead. This, however, was not enough. The upper left key (right below the codeESC/code) originally maps to code§/code and code±/code. Therefore, using codekarabiner/code I remapped it and checked codeSwap tilde with section/code. This now works as I want on the internal keyboard.  The problem is that when I attach an external native US apple keyboard, the upper left key is mapped to code§/code and code±/code. Is there a way to disable codekarabiner/code on the external keyboard? Any other idea?  <comment252280> You have an ISO keyboard, but you are mapping to an ANSI layout. Would it not be simpler to map it to another ISO layout, like UK English? see http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/106059/85275 <comment252281> How does it solve my problem? <comment252282> It keeps the key below Escape & the key left of z in their original places - they move on an ANSI keyboard. That way, the Mac itself would be capable of remapping as it recognises a true ANSI keyboard being connected <comment252284> After the remaps I have no issue with the internal keyboard. The problem arises when I plug the external one. <comment252285> You could try it & see if it works... <comment252287> I tried but the problem remains. I guess that the problem is that the two keyboards are different. <comment252288> try http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/200389/85275
