App to organize my photos into folders by date <body> Is there an app on OS X that can sort through all your photos within a folder and organize them into folders and name each folder the date it was taken.  <answer143640> Here's a bash script that sorts files into codeyear/month/day//code directory paths.  pre class="lang-bash prettyprint-override"code#!/bin/bash dir=/path/to/directory find "$dir" -maxdepth 1 -type f | while IFS= read -r file; do   year=$(stat -f "%Sm" -t "%y" $file)   month=$(stat -f "%Sm" -t "%m" $file)   day=$(stat -f "%Sm" -t "%d" $file)   [[ ! -d "$dir/$year/$month/$day" ]] &amp;&amp; mkdir -p "$dir/$year/$month/$day";    mv "$file" "$dir/$year/$month/$day" done /code/pre  strongUntested/strong, have backups, etc  Save the script as codesomething.sh/code, change the second line of the script to the path that you want to sort the contents of, then run codechmod u+x /path/to/file.sh &amp;&amp; /path/to/file.sh/code. However, if you are unfamiliar with shell scripts I wouldn't recommend this hacked-together, untested script that I wrote late at night be the very first script you run!  <answer143767> Aperture can import images and have them sorted by date but you end up with projects inside Aperture (the project names are the dates the photos were taken). Make sure the Preferences » Import settings are set to split import into "One Project Per Day". If you don't want to keep them in Aperture, you can easily export them back out into folders.  <comment169177> How would I go about running that script? <comment169180> Save the script as `something.sh`, change the second line of the script to the path that you want to sort the contents of, then run `chmod u+x /path/to/file.sh && /path/to/file.sh`. However, if you are unfamiliar with shell scripts I wouldn't recommend this hacked-together, untested script that I wrote late at night be the very first script you run :) <comment169208> This is using the filesystem timestamp - depending on the files, might be worth checking the EXIF data (if it's available) using something like ExifTool. You could have the script check Exif and use that, then fall back to the filesystem data, or log differences. <comment169228> @Alex This was never meant to be a finished, canonical do-all script. I'm [against writing entire scripts for answers](http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/17418018#17418018)—I just happened to have this script already written and the answer wasn't asking for a script but an app. <comment169262> True, I was just looking for an app.
