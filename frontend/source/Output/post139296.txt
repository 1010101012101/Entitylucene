Location not loading <body> When I try to change my location for the App Store, it wint load. i go to fetured, my apple id thing, put in my password and everything, but when i click on the country/region button to change it, the page won't load. I have a working Internet connection.  <answer139301> You can't change the location of the Appstore, it is based on the country you have registered it with. Like if you buy a new iPhone in Brazil and you sign in to the Appstore for the first time, it will redirect you to the Appstore of your Apple-id.  <comment164276> Is it "Country/Region" you are trying to change?
