Is there a good way to control VLC media player on my MacBook from an iOS 5 iPhone? <body> I see a free application in the App Store but the reviews say it doesn't work.  I have a Snow Leopard MacBook that I hook up to my TV to watch videos sometimes. To control the video and volume, it'd be nice if I could do this from my iPhone. How could this setup be done?  <answer31824> Something like VLC Amigo (free) or VLC remote for iPhone would probably work!   <answer38651> HippoRemote is awesome for controlling VLC, iTunes player, and the Mac.   <answer38669> I use Remotebuddy. It has controls for VLC and much, much more. You can trial it for 30 days to see how you like it.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GCPkN.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer80982> Have a look at Sybu Data Remote Control for VLC  It works perfectly with OSX and iOS 5 &amp; 6, easy to install, NO ads, and FREE.  A must have App if you have an iPhone and use VLC  <comment84013> What exactly makes HippoRemote awesome?
