Is there anything other than ZDnet Clock that I can use to overclock Macbook Pro (Zdnet version incompatible) <body> It's a mid-2011 Macbook pro model.   I tried with Zednet but it said my model is not supported.  I've added more ram to my Mac but am still looking for a way to make it faster.  <comment126013> what is this ZDnet or Zednet? are you asking about OSX or using another operating system? <comment126087> Zednet is overclocking software for OSX. I'm running OSX.
