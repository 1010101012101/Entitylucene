Couldn't Unlock WD External Harddrive <body> I used a WD My Passport to backup my Mac Mini. Now I'm unable to unlock it after trying all the possible passwords I used. Whatever I entered, the same prompt appeared "Enter a password to unlock the disk...".  When I deliberately put in a wrong password, the same box popped up (i.e., no specific error message). Can anyone please help?  <comment340442> What is a MacBook Mini? Do you mean MacBook Air or Mac Mini. As for unlocking the hard drive, the encryption is too strong to bother with. Would just wipe using Disk Utility. <comment340445> [Western Digital's hard drive encryption is useless.
