Applescript - wait for window/dialog to appear/disappear <body> I am scripting iTunes and have bumped into two problems when I in one step of my script need to verify wether windows/dialogs are displayed or not.  ol liAccording to Waiting until a window exists in Applescript? this should be valid code  coderepeat until window "Print" of process "Evernote" exists/code/li /ol  but when I compile it I get this error message "Expected end of line but found “"” (" refers to the " before E in Evernote). Why? That question is 2,5 years old, has anything changed since then? I am running OS X 10.11.  ol start="2" liI can use this code to verify wether the song info-window is open in iTunes  coderepeat until (not (exists window "Song Info"))/code/li /ol  but when I try to look for en Open dialog with a similar line  precoderepeat until (exists window "Open") /code/pre  the window is not detected. I have used Accessibility Inspector to get some properties of the Song Info window and the Open dialog and the only differences I have noticed is the name as well as the type. Song Info is a "window" while Open is a "dialog". Hence, I also tried these two variations on the previous code:  precoderepeat until (exists dialog "Open") repeat until (exists window dialog "Open") repeat until (exists dialog window "Open") /code/pre  but none of them compile.  How do I detect the Open dialog?  <answer274503> The reason you're getting "strongSyntax Error/strong Expected end of line but found “"”." when using coderepeat until window "Print" of process "Evernote" exists/code is because you're using it out of context of the calling application. You might say meaning, within the context of the calling application, it doesn't understand the command and the AppleScript Editor is not that well written to express what the error really means.  Anyway, the example emcode/em below when run in ScriptEditor, by itself, will wait to display the "Your wait is over!" emdialog box/em until strongiTunes/strong is open and you press kbd⌘/kbdkbdO/kbd or click strongFile/strong  strongAdd to Library…/strong on the strongiTunes/strong emmenu/em.  precodetell current application     tell application "System Events"         repeat until (exists window "Add To Library" of application process "iTunes")             delay 1         end repeat     end tell     activate     display dialog "Your wait is over!" end tell /code/pre  ul liNote the use of the codedelay/code emcommand/em within the coderepeat/code emloop/em. Obviously the emvalue/em can be set to something else, even emfractions of a second/em, however you should alway use a delay to avoid strongSystem Events/strong from needlessly triggering the emloop/em hundreds of time a second until the emcondition/em is meet./li /ul  As a general rule I've found that anytime I'm using emcode/em that has code... process .../code or code... application process .../code it's a emcall/em being made emto/em or emby/em strongSystem Events/strong and as such in this use case, the coderepeat/code emloop/em has to be within a codetell/code emstatement/em or emblock/em of strongSystem Events/strong in order to not get the emerror/em mentioned in your OP.  <comment345127> I just realised that if I inspect an Open dialog in iTunes its type is "dialog" but if I inspect an Open dialog in Script Editor its type is "window". <comment345148> If the example _code_ in my answer doesn't address the "Open dialog" you're referring to, then please edit your question to better reflect exactly what it is you're trying to do. <comment345160> Thank you and thank you for your general rule. It makes very much sense when it is pointed out like that. Interestingly enough, I needed to add Script Editor System Preferences - Security & Privacy - Accessibility when I added the "tell system events" block. <comment345161> However, I am not done yet: this »repeat until (exists window "Add To Library" of application process "iTunes")» works fine but when I add a "not" to it: »repeat until (not exists window "Add To Library" of application process "iTunes")» the code fail to compile with a warning and refuses to run with the same warning "Can’t get not (exists window "Song info"). Access not allowed." What access is required for this negative case to work? <comment345167> @d-b, Please use proper _code formatting_, a backtick '`', not '»' when expressing _code_ in a comment as it makes it easier to read. <comment345168> @d-b, In my example _code_, changing `repeat until (exists window "Add To Library" of application process "iTunes")` **to** `repeat until (not (exists window "Add To Library" of application process "iTunes"))` works for me. That said, anytime you're looking for help debugging _code_ please follow [How to create a Minimal, Complete, and Verifiable example](http://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve) so as to enable us to reproduce the issue as you've encountered it. Otherwise, we have to guess at the context of the issue and that's not conducive to providing quality answers. <comment345169> @d-b, BTW In my example _code_, changing the `repeat` _loop_ to `repeat until (not (exists window "Song Info" of application process "iTunes"))` also works of me. <comment345229> @d-b, You can also use, e.g.: `repeat while not (exists window "Song Info" of application process "iTunes")`
