Automatically maximize windows when cycle through them using cmd + tab <body> I'm pretty new to macOS and today I tried to find out how to maximize a window as I cycle through them using kbdCommand/kbd+kbdTab/kbd.   Here I found that I can maximize window just clicking kbdalt/kbd before I release kbdcmd/kbd.But I'd like to have Windows/Ubuntu like behaviour.   Is there any way to always hold kbdalt/kbd key automatically so that any toggled window will be maximized?  Is there any way to adjust so through standard macOS settings or through third party software, e.g. such as BetterTouchTool?  <comment346264> Do you actually mean maximise, or restore? <comment346272> He wants "alt" to be pressed automatically when releasing the âŒ˜Tab shortcut, without having to press it himself <comment346324> @Tetsujin I'm not sure which word suits better, but here is the scenario: e.g. you work with chrome and then minimize it by cmd+M. I want to be able to switch back using just cmd+tab (not cmd+alt+tab) <comment346384> Ah, OK. tbh it's a situation I simply avoid. I have 6 Spaces across 2 screens, so 12 'desktops' in all. I put specific apps in specific places & toggle between them using the Spaces shortcut keys. No minimising or Cmd/Tab required; I just go straight to the Space for the app I need.
