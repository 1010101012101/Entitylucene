Can apps purchased for iPad be downloaded on MacBook <body> I purchased the iA Writer app for my iPad. Can I download it free on my MacBook?   Thanks.  <answer110993> Some software companies do have such a policy, but Apple certainly does not require it.  So inquire from the producers of that app.  <answer111001> You can download it, for the purposes of backup/syncing etc with iOS devices via iTunes, but it is not an OS X application so it will not run.  Some companies release software for both platforms, often with the same name/version number/price point, but they are separate applications, and when you buy you are purchasing on a platform specific basis, so even if you own iA Writer (or Byword, or any other cross platform app) you only own it on the platform for which it was purchased.  <comment130645> You can download the iOS app using iTunes on your MacBook.  But it will not run in Mac OS X. <comment130646> Thanks. I see the same-named app for sale in the store when I go there from my MacBook. I was hoping that because I bought their product on one platform I could get it for free on another platform. <comment130647> Although Apple does not allow offers like tis on their AppStores - the cost must be the same for all purchasers. They can off this from the producers own site <comment130660> I believe I saw one app ... when you buy the OS X app, you also get unlock codes for the "free trial" version of the iOS app and their other mobile versions.
