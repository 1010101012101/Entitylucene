iTunes 12.5 - Add photo of artist / edit rainbow microphone thumbnail <body> In the "Artist" view of iTunes 12.5, is it possible to make a photo of the artist (or at least one of the album covers) appear in place of the rainbow microphone?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/CEHLx.png" width="400"  strongUpdate/strong (2017)  It appears that with 12.5.5.5 (possibly earlier, but I didn't notice), Artists that are known to Apple now have their photos set correctly:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qpDwJ.png" width="240"  There still doesn't appear to be a way to manually set or override this image though.  <answer272076> No, missing artist images do not depend on the source of the music. Even if you bought it from Apple, you may get the ugly microphone images!  <comment318814> It's supposed to. I have no idea how to force it to do so, though. (I'd think Adele would have one at least.) <comment318818> This is music from CD that I ripped myself as ALAC -- wonder if that's the reason? <comment318820> Yeah that's entirely possible. Looking through my library now, it does seem as though the only ones that have photos there are ones where I have at least one track purchased from the iTMS (even if there are other, non-iTMS tracks for that artist as well). <comment341975> Hi Ulli, once you've spent some time around the site, you'll be able to reply to comments...
