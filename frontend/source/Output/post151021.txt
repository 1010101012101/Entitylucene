How to automatically share my iPhone's internet connection with my MacBook <body> I believe I heard from the Apple keynote that with the release of Yosemite and iOS 8 we will be able to automatically share the iPhone's internet connection without having to connect every time with hotspot (when within range). I now have Yosemite on my MacBook and iOS 8 on my iPhone, but I cannot see any options to enable this automatic connection. I currently connect with bluetooth to get my iPhone's internet connection.  Did I misunderstand or is there such an option?  <answer151024> iOS 8.1, I believe, releasing next Monday 20 Oct.
