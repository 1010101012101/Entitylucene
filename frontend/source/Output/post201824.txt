Safari searchbox doesn't save page in the history <body> When I use searchbox (the same text area used for the URLs) and Google Page is loaded, after clicking on a result, if I try to undo to the previous Google Page, the undo button appears disabled.  How can I save the Google Page in the history in order to call back the page clicking on undo button?  Update: The problem appears only with same pages (e.g. Wikipedia).  <comment243354> Do you have the page open in a new tab?  If so, the "undo" or Back button  has no history for that tab.  What does your actual History show?  Menu bar **History**? <comment243383> Just so we're on the same page, so to speak...Try a simple test. Cmd/T for new tab; type 'mac apps' in the search & Enter [first hit will probably be Apple Store] click that. Check there's a  arrow & that Cmd [ will return you to the Google page.
