Macbook screens inverted after reconnecting <body> I use two external screens with the Thunderbolt ports of my Macbook. I organize the two external screens on the left and use the Macbook screen as the rightmost one.  However, if I disconnect the Macbook from the screens and reconnect it again, all the windows from the Macbook screen and the leftmost screen are exchanged: the windows from the leftmost screen are in the Macbook and the other way around. The center screen still has the same windows.  For example: code| external screen with window 1 | external screen with window 2 | Macbook screen with window 3 |/code  Becomes, after reconnecting: code| external screen with window 3 | external screen with window 2 | Macbook screen with window 1 |/code  Is there a way to make sure MacOS keeps the windows in the correct screens?  <comment373129> Have a look at this answer:  https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/257864/119271 <comment373656> I'd prefer to avoid a 3rd party tool and Stay doesn't seem to do what I want, it expects user input to work. MacOS remembers pretty well where my screens are without any manual work. The only think it does wrong is that it switches the monitors.
