How to make a playable DVD iso from a VIDEO_TS folder? <body> I used to have a script that converts a VIDEO_TS folder into an ISO that plays ok in VLC but it's gone.  Anyway, this command gets me most of the way there:  precodehdiutil makehybrid -udf -udf-volume-name $folder -o $fullpath.iso $fullpath /code/pre  Except that when I tried it on one DVD, it skips the menu selection. Is this likely a problem with the one DVD I tried or do I need a different tool / different options to get the menu to render properly?  <answer125191> just tried this on several VIDEO_TS and works perfectly.  precodehdiutil makehybrid -iso -joliet -udf -udf-volume-name $folder -o $fullpath.iso $fullpath /code/pre  ps. I've never found out how to make ISOs out of VIDEO_TS using handbrake. I don't think this is possible.  <comment144462> Maybe better asked at http://video.stackexchange.com/ <comment144514> I have always used Handbreak for doing this if you have the actual DVD and not a ripped copy of the VIDEO_TS. http://handbrake.fr/downloads.php not only does it work great, but it's updated regularly. <comment144537> can you please enlighten me on how to make an ISO out of a DVD disc using handbrake? I've been using it for years and just checked now and I don't see such a feature. thanks
