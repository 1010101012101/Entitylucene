How to require a smart card to log in <body> I've setup smart card authentication on macOS Sierra using a Yubikey 4. https://www.yubico.com/support/knowledge-base/categories/articles/how-to-use-your-yubikey-with-macos-sierra/  The default behaviour now is, that both smart card only and password only logins work.  Is there a way to configure the smart card as a requirement? Login with a password only should not be possible, except for unlocking filevault at boot time.
