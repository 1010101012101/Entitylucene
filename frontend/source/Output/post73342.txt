How to add new keystrokes to the system settings from Terminal <body> I am currently creating a list of terminal commands to set up a new mac system according to my needs. Now I would like to add new keystrokes to Preview (normally in the system settings = keyboard) from the Terminal. This is probably possible using the codedefaults write/code command but so far, I haven't found the concrete plist or path I would have to change.  Has anybody already tried this or knows a good resource for such settings?  <answer73348> You're better off using the Keyboard Shortcuts tab of the Keyboard pane in System Preferences.  Click on Application Shortcuts, click the + button, and choose Preview; for example, I use option-command-S to "Adjust Size..." and option-command-0 to "Zoom to Fit."  As with all custom keyboard shortcuts, you must enter the menu item exactly, including ellipsis, for the new shortcut to work.  <answer73434> You can add an NSUserKeyEquivalents dictionary to ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.Preview/Data/Library/Preferences/com.apple.Preview.plist.  precodedefaults write -app preview NSUserKeyEquivalents '{ "Single Page" = "@1"; "Two Pages" = "@2"; "Continuous Scroll" = "@3"; "Adjust Size..." = "~@i"; "Adjust Color..." = "@u"; }' /code/pre  The shortcuts for all applications are in ~/Library/Preferences/.GlobalPreferences.plist.  precodedefaults write -g NSUserKeyEquivalents '{ "Show in Finder" = "$@r"; "Reveal" = "$@r"; "Delete Row" = "~@\b"; "Delete Rows" = "~@\b"; "Delete Column" = "$@\b"; "Delete Columns" = "$@\b"; "Minimize" = "\0"; "Minimize All" = "\0"; }' /code/pre  The shortcut format is described in the Cocoa Text System article. The -app option doesn't work with some applications like Finder or Notes. If a menu item was assigned to nil, pressing L would trigger it in Audacity.  <comment85207> I know how it works in the system preferences, but that is not how I would like to do it. I prefer a script I can just run on different machines instead of fiddling around on every machine. <comment85221> Found the answer on StackOverflow: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7219134/programmatically-add-keyboard-shortcut-to-mac-system-preferences <comment85321> Yes that is exactly what they propose in the link from the comment section. I will mark this as answer anyway, thanks.
