macOS equivalent of `cmdtool` <body> I recently saw someone on a Unix system run the command  codecmdtool &lt;some_log_file.log&gt;/code  and the terminal showed a logging window that live-updated as text was entered into the log file. (I'm probably missing some arguments there.)  Is there a Mac OS equivalent to get this behavior?  See emcmdtool/em on Ubuntu man pages.  <answer294654> You can use the codetail/code command to see live output of a textual log file:  precodetail -f &lt;some_log_file.log /code/pre  codetail/code does not open a new Terminal.app window, but this could be achieved with AppleScript or Automator.  <answer294726> If you want to use an application, Console will do this. It's not restricted to just the log files it knows about, you can open any file.  <comment371894> this seems to be specific to Sun/Solaris boxes. <comment372115> Clarified my question - this is exactly the command I was looking for, no need to "pop up" a new window.  Thanks!
