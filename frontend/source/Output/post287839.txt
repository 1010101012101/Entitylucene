Is it possible to migrate email, etc. from Mac to iPad? <body> I want to help a friend switch from a Macbook to an iPad. He has on the order of 2G of email on the Mac. Is there a way to move this to the iPad, preferably via USB?  I know that we could set the iPad up with the same imap account that the Mac uses, but that will only transfer the mail that's still on the imap server. What about all the emails stored only on the Mac?  I don't think he uses iCloud for anything. I was able to transfer his photos and such via iTunes, but email remains an issue.
