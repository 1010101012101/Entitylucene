What character is this possessive apostrophe: ’ <body> In a recent answer I needed to include a a possessive apostrophe in a path name within Time Machine for a command line operation. I have it saved in a text file, but what the heck is it? I don't see it on my keyboard.    code"/Volumes/Seagate Backup Plus Drive/Backups.backupdb/david914’s MacBook Air/2015-08-30-221221/Macintosh HD/Users/david914/"/code  I first tried to look at it with python, but no luck.  These I know:  precodethings = ["'", '"', "`"] names = ["single quote", "double quote", "backtick"] ascii = [ord(thing) for thing in things]  for (a, b, c) in zip(things, ascii, names):     print "  " + a  + "  " + str(b) + "  " + c    '  39  single quote   "  34  double quote   `  96  backtick /code/pre  but the apostrophe in question is: --  ’  &lt;--  and all I can get is:  precode&gt;&gt;&gt; ord("’") Unsupported characters in input /code/pre  Then I used Excel:  precode=CODE("’") /code/pre  and got:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9cNBP.png" alt="Excel code for a character"  Checking the opposite direction in Excel:  precode=CHAR(213) /code/pre  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/E3BE5.png" alt="enter image description here"  Back to python:  precode&gt;&gt;&gt; chr(213) '\xd5' /code/pre  Does this character appear normally on English MacBook Air keyboards? How else can I make them besides resorting to some kind of Office or Open Office product ?? What it is, anyway?  <answer204300> Section 6.2 of the Unicode Standard 7.0.0 states:     U+2019 […] is preferred where the character is to represent a punctuation mark, as for contractions: “We’ve been here before.”   The character does not appear directly on any keyboard I own.  On an British or US English keyboard you can use kbdOption/kbd+kbdShift/kbd+kbd]/kbd to type the character: code’/code == codeU+2019/code; thanks to @tom-gewecke for this key combination.  h1Emoji &amp; Symbols Palette/h1  In OS X 10.10, you can access this character from the menu item: strongEdit  Emoji &amp; Symbols/strong:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mY9J4.png" alt="Character Palette"  Control-Click on the character to copy additional information.  In earlier versions of OS X, this palette was called the Character Palette.  h2Smart Quotes/h2  The character code’/code is can be automatically substituted by OS X through the strongSmart Quotes/strong feature of the default text system:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HVEE4.png" alt="Smart Quotes screenshot"  h2Unicode is Complex/h2  Copying and pasting a few of the candidate character information to a text file results in:  ul licode'/code - APOSTROPHE, Unicode: U+0027, UTF-8: 27/li licodeʼ/code - MODIFIER LETTER APOSTROPHE, Unicode: U+02BC, UTF-8: CA BC/li licode՚/code - ARMENIAN APOSTROPHE, Unicode: U+055A, UTF-8: D5 9A/li licode＇/code - FULLWIDTH APOSTROPHE, Unicode: U+FF07, UTF-8: EF BC 87/li /ul  Ted Clancy's article Which Unicode character should represent the English apostrophe? (And why the Unicode committee is very wrong.) reveals just how involved the unicode character set can become.  <comment246215> Wow! Thank you for putting all of that in one place. I am relieved to see that my question was at least not trivial. After reading all of that, I am hesitant to use the possessive form or contractions ever again, lest I use the wrong character and Ted finds out about it! :) <comment246219> Good to hear the answer helped. Internationalisation is a difficult problem to tackle. <comment246224> char 213 (decimal) or d5 (hex) is the right single quote represented in the old MacRoman character set.  OS X uses Unicode, where it is U+2019.  From the keyboard this is normally made via option shift ] <comment246225> The US keyboard makes U+2019 via option shift ] <comment246227> Thanks @TomGewecke ! That is in fact an alternate answer - *what the heck is this thing and how can I make more of them?* <comment246228> Does it not work to make them using option shift ]    ? <comment246283> I meant that as a compliment @TomGewecke ! It works perfectly! I wanted to highlight the fact that in 201 characters you both explained what that character is, and gave me a way to easily make more of them. So you actually answered both parts of my question with one sentence. Great!
