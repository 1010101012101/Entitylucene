Scroll down in Safari on iPhone/iPad? <body> When using Safari from iPhone/iPad I can scroll back to the top of the page in one touch by touching the upper bar of the device. Is there any similar trick for scrolling to the bottom of the page? Is there strongany/strong way of scrolling down fast?  <answer12550> There is no keypress or gesture to do this unfortunately.  But here is a quick way to achieve a similar thing.    ol liCreate a new bookmark in safari (of any web page)/li liEdit this bookmark (press edit in bookmark screen)/li liRename the bookmark to End/li liIn the address field cut and paste this text   precodejavascript:scroll(0,document.getElementsByTagName( 'body')%5B0%5D.scrollHeight); /code/pre/li /ol  Once you save this bookmark, you will be able to hit the bookmark button, select End and it will take you to the bottom of the web page.  I know it's not as simple as the current scroll to top feature (this solution requires two taps), but its really the only option at the moment.  <answer12553> If you are willing to jailbreak, the application Action Menu has a Scroll feature which can scroll both to the top and bottom.  <answer251753> Adding to the answer by @RobZolkos, this more readable script will work in newer versions of iOS. In Rob's Step 4, you can substitute the text:  precodejavascript:scroll(0,document.body.scrollHeight); /code/pre  The source claims this works in iOS 8 and newer. It worked for me under iOS 9.  <answer251754> If you use an external keyboard, kbd⌘ cmd/kbd kbd↓/kbd will scroll to the bottom of the page, and kbd⌥ opt/kbd kbd↓/kbd will scroll one page down.  <comment13111> There is a bookmarks bar like on the Mac in newer versions of iOS for iPad, so that would be one tap. <comment13112> @waiwai933 good point :) <comment43812> Why or why is there no way to "quick-scroll" ?
