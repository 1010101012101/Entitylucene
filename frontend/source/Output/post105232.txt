Can I put my Windows HDD in a caddy for new iMac? <body> I was wondering if this is possible:  I have a PC with Windows 8. The HDD for this PC is a SATA hard drive (can't remember the size off the top of my head). The HDD has a lot of work documents on it I would like to transfer to my new iMac 27â€³.  Would it work if I buy a caddy, put my old HDD into the caddy and plug the HDD in the iMac's USB port?  <comment123738> That should work fine. I've done that kind of thing many times. In fact, I usually use the new external hard drive as a boot camp partition. <comment123748> OSX can only read NTFS drives by default. If you need to write to it from OSX you need a specific application. <comment123778> What kind of format should it be right now? I don't think it's fat32 cause thats old hat? Am I correct?
