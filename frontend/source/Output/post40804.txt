Strange user named "Otherâ€¦" on 10.6 <body> Recently, I tried logging out of my machine (rather than just shutting it down) and I noticed that a user with the name "Other ..." was present. I don't recall adding the user. I tried checking out System Preferences  Accounts and it just lists a disabled "Guest" account and my main account.  Why is this?  <answer40808> "Other" is not a user. It just allows you to enter a username and password into textboxes instead of clicking on an icon.   It can be used to connect to a network domain user. It can also be used for special users, such as "Root" (which gives you unlimited control over all hidden and restricted files) and "console" (which logs into your Mac in command-line-only mode.)  <comment46212> I see. However, I dont recall seeing this when I first installed my machine; are there settings to turn this particular display on and off? <comment46213> Check out post #8 on this site: http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=1166153.
