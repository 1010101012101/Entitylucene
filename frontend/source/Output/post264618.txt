Run a system wide keylogger <body> I'd like to run a system wide keylogger (For purely educational/backup purposes of course) on Mac OS Sierra, how can I do it without buying expensive apps for that?  I've been using logKext from github but it stopped working after upgrade from El Capitan.  I almost got it working, but console is showing me codeError: Daemon must run as root./code, I've tried to codesudo chown root/code each file but to no use.   Any ideas? Thanks!  Update: I got it running but it's not logging any keys. Console shows no errors connected with it.  <comment331668> What have you already tried/attempted to do this?  Editing your question with this info helps prevent answers that propose solutions you've already tried. <comment331683> Have you tried disabling SIP to get logKext to work? <comment331684> It'd also be good to know what **you're** definition of _expensive apps_ is? What someone thinks is expensive may not be what you think is expensive! Maybe a couple of examples would be good. <comment331748> @books453 yes I did, I keep it disabled. <comment331749> @Monomeeth Ok, maybe in other words: I don't want to buy apps for that at all - open source is best. <comment331792> Also: what is your end goal? Perhaps there is another way of obtaining it instead of running a system wide keylogger? <comment331872> Logging every keystroke from every text field
