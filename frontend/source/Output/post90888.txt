How to block bluetooth device that spams me with pairing requests? <body> A bluetooth device that is not mine nor under my control asks my computer to pair, about every minute or so.   Interestingly, it's fairly effective as a DOS attack actually.  Disabling my BT is not an option, since I need it for my BT devices.  I want to tell OSX to ignore this particular BT device, but I can't figure out how.  <answer126741> Open terminal and type:  ol licodesudo rm /Library/Preferences/com.apple.Bluetooth.plist/code kbdEnter/kbd/li licoderm ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.Bluetooth.plist/code kbdEnter/kbd/li liReboot OSX./li /ol  The commands above will remove the MAC addresses of the 'remembered' bluetooth devices from the systems settings. If you want to have a look at the actual contents of those files copy the original file to a user-writable folder and then do:   codeplutil -convert xml1 com.apple.Bluetooth.plist/code,   and then open it with a text editor (it is an XML file).   To convert it back to binary use   codeplutil -convert binary1 com.apple.Bluetooth.plist/code.  <answer153206> Inspired by @ccpizza's answer.  Open terminal and type:  ol licodesudo plutil -convert xml1 /Library/Preferences/com.apple.Bluetooth.plist/code/li liFind the MAC address of the offending Bluetooth device. You can find it by searching code/Library/Preferences/com.apple.Bluetooth.plist/code./li liAdd this section to the plist:  precode&lt;key&gt;IgnoredDevices&lt;/key&gt; &lt;array&gt;         &lt;string&gt;ff-ff-ff-ff-ff-ff&lt;/string&gt; &lt;/array&gt; /code/pre/li /ol  Where FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF is the MAC address of the offending Bluetooth device.  ol start="4" licodesudo plutil -convert binary1 /Library/Preferences/com.apple.Bluetooth.plist/code/li liReboot OS X if necessary./li /ol  <answer232764> ol liFind the MAC address of the culprit Bluetooth device/li liDisable Bluetooth/li liType codesudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.Bluetooth.plist IgnoredDevices -array-add '&lt;ENTER MAC ADDRESS HERE&gt;'/code in the terminal/li liEnable Bluetooth again/li /ol  <comment106707> Is it your device? <comment106713> Good question. No, it is not. <comment106715> If the device is attached to a person who owns it, why don't you ask that person to take care of the problem. BTW/ what kind of device is it? <comment106716> In my particular situation, that's not a problem. The problem even worked it self out already as a different computer nearby was turned on, and the device (a keyboard) happily attached itself to that computer instead. But assume this isn't feasibly. I'm in a cafe where I don't know which device it is, or I have complete control over all devices, but a Bluetooth implementation is buggy and I can't make it behave properly. <comment106718> There could also be real malicious intent behind the behavior. Like the question says, this works as a DOS-attack, as the window that pops up steals focus from whatever else the user is currently doing. <comment148451> That looks promising, but any sort of details about what it does would be good. :) <comment148485> was the device ever paired to your computer in the past? <comment148487> I'm guessing the answer is yes, but not by me, so I can't be sure. <comment181107> does not work for me.  when I restart the bluetooth and check the file, the ignored devices is empty again <comment257404> I have the same issue, every day "Samsung SM-N900A" jumps onto my list of connections and my mouse gets disconnected!  No one in our office has this device but it could be someone else in a nearby office.  I like that things can be easily connected but in cases like this it would be great if there was a blacklist option. <comment293839> After enabling Bluetooth the IgnoredDevices array is empty again for me. El Capitan 10.11.5 (15F34). <comment338017> My changes to this plist get reverted by OS X all the time :/ (macOS Sierra 10.12.2) <comment357053> I could not convert it back, did same as here: /Library/Preferences/com.apple.Bluetooth.plist: Property List error: Close tag on line 924 does not match open tag array / JSON error: JSON text did not start with array or object and option to allow fragments not set. <comment359372> This ***bug*** does still exist in macOS Sierra 10.12.5.
