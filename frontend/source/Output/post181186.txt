Scroll Direction: Natural = On with trackpad, Off with mice <body> I already tried this:br Changing trackpad scroll direction with AppleScript in Yosemite  But don't worked.  What I need is when I use macbook pro trackpad scroll direction it is natural scroll direction; and when I use external mice it is "non natural"  If it is impossible, how can be the following alternative: when i plug in mice switch to "non-natural" scroll direction, and when i disconnect mice switch to natural.  <answer199773> Try this:  Go to strongAccessibility/strong settings for strongMouse &amp; Trackpad/strong in strongSystem Preferences/strong.  Tick the      "Ignore built-in trackpad when mouse or wireless trackpad is present"   option.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nDkMC.png" alt="Accessibility"  Then, with your mouse connected, go back to your strongMouse/strong settings in the strongSystem Preferences/strong and adjust scrolling accordingly.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3h4Rt.png" alt="Mouse and Trackpad settings"  <answer254945> Hi just found a great app that totally fixed this and so simple! You can set the scroll direction for each device separately.  SCROLL REVERSER http://pilotmoon.com/scrollreverser/  <comment240594> Thank you, this helped other issue I had.
