X11 for CrossOver on Mountain Lion <body> In my newly-installed Mountain Lion system: when I try to run CrossOver, which requires X11, I get the following error message: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GLYGo.png" alt="enter image description here"  Apple's Web Page indicates that this is not the expected behavior:     h1X11 install on demand/h1      X11 on Mountain Lion now uses install on demand. When you first launch an app that requires X11 libraries, you are directed to a download location for the most up-to-date version of X11 for Mac.   Does anyone know how to download X11 for Mountain Lion?  <answer57381> If Apple's dialog for X11 does not appear, you can grab the package directly from the XQuartz website.  Version 2.7.1 was the first to support Mountain Lion, but 2.7.2 is the current release as of this writing.  <answer57390> Normally, Mountain Lion should show the following window:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/OWzba.png" alt="enter image description here"  Clicking Continue just takes you to http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5293, so simply go there for official instructions for installing X11.  <comment65898> Is this the official download? <comment65899> @DanielLawson Yes, it's the one Apple links to. <comment66594> Time to put the GIMP back in it's box :( <comment66642> This appears to be an issue with CrossOver – not an issue with Apple's method of directing the user. Please, which version of CrossOver did you use?
