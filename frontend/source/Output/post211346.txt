Is Xcode the ideal IDE for most development needs, or is app/web/shell/script development not as narrowly approached? <body> I'm pretty fluent in the basics of web based languages i.e., HTML(5), CSS(3), php, MySQL, Javascript; although now I'm diving emdeeper/em and starting to tackle scripting (Mostly strongPython/strong and Ruby) &amp; compiler code (Objective-C, Cocoa, Swift, Metal).  What do you some of you recommend for someone who is embarking upon the higher tiers of programming, such as the ones I mentioned above (strongIMHO/strong; emno offense to web dev gurus/em ;-) ); should I use the basic text editor &amp; up (BBEdit, TextWrangler, ATOM, Sublime Text) and create my own file hierarchy by hand, or should I learn with the assistance of an IDE like Xcode, Dreamweaver, Eclipse (I know it's java based, and rather not use on OS X just from hearing word of mouth), or is there any others that I don't even have any prior knowledge/experience with? If you prefer not to utilize IDE's what is your favorite syntax highlighting enabled text/file editor?   I know this may seem like a novice question, but I'm a "measure twice, cut once" kind of guy. Yet, don't let that confuse you with my expectations, because I know what a headache debugging can be, especially when you're twenty or so versions already down the line, and are now establishing a small to medium sized user base, and people are posting support comments/inquiries on your software's Git page/repository, emand you're beginning to run out of answers.../em  :-O  <answer211356> h3I have broken down this into several parts:/h3  h2For Scripting Languages/h2  hr  ol liIDLE... It sucks!/li liEdit it any one of the text editors (your choice, but i suggest sublime or brackets) and the run in terminal/li liUse something like pycharm, it is a nice cross between something like xcode and just a text editor/li /ol  h2For Programming Languages/h2  hr  ol liFor languages like Obj-C, C and C++ you have a couple of options like strongCodeblocks/strong, strongXcode/strong and strongEclipse/strong. With Codeblocks, people either hate it or love it (I hate it). Eclipse is versatile but clunky, and Xcode... Xcode I really enjoy it, it is cool, easy-to-use and fun. Probably just starting out, go with Xcode./li liFor languages like swift, you have not many choices but Xcode./li /ol  hr  h2Comparisons/h2  hr  h2Scripting Language Editors/h2  Idle: Simple. Limited options and customization.  Sublime Text 2/3: More complex. Tons of extensions and customizations.  Brackets: Simple but complex. tons of themes. Still very new.  Atom: Large app size. Nice looking. Has a sublime-esk.  h2Programming Language IDE's/h2  Xcode: Easy to use. tons of support. Large community.  Codeblocks: Clunky. * opinion * bad GUI. Has been around for a while.  Eclipse: Versatile, old,large community.  h1Conclusion/h1  hr  In the end, this question, boils down to opinion. What do you find is good?   For me I use brackets and sublime for scripting, and Xcode for programming.  For you as a beginner, start by looking at sublime text 2 or 3 and Xcode.
