Open PDF using Google Chrome <body> I like the fact that I can use Google's built in PDF viewer instead of a separate application (Adobe Acrobat). Normally I would open a Finder Window with the PDF and drag it to a tab on Google Chrome but this process becomes two steps if the PDF is to be downloaded first.  I tried changing the default application for PDF using "Get Info"  "Open with", but it does not seem to work properly. I still have to drag a file to a Chrome Tab. I would like to ideally double click to open as well as drag to the Chrome icon in the dock.  <answer19308> Make sure you click the "Change All" checkbox in the Get Info window.  (Credit for this answer goes to Lyken. There was just no sense in letting this question masquerade as unanswered any longer.)  <comment17352> Are you clicking "Change All" after selecting chrome? <comment17381> Yep it seems that was it. Wonder why it does not work without that option for a single file. <comment19796> I don't get it. What's better about using Chrome than the built-in PDF viewer, preview, or even QuickLook? <comment19797> @fzwo Personal preference. Switching tabs instead of switching applications. Chrome is always open my macbook, whereas Preview or Acrobat is not. So I can always pin documents in Chrome.
