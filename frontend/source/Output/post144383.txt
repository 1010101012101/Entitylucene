How should I organise my plist? <body> I'm creating a game where the player can unlock worlds, where they can unlock levels within those worlds, each levels has a highscore, and so on.  I was wondering in which way should I store this data?  I was originally thinking of making a number of separate plist files, but that seems like an approach which could end up spiralling out of control.  Has anyone approached this problem and come up with a decent solution?  <answer144384> Most apps like that store data in a SQLite3 database rather than property lists. I recommend this route insteadâ€”actual implementation/etc is off-topic here.  <answer144387> I think a good approach would be to save each world under a category, and saving the information for each world.  For example:  precode&lt;dict&gt;     &lt;key&gt;Worlds&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;dict&gt;         &lt;key&gt;TheLand&lt;/key&gt;         &lt;dict&gt;             &lt;key&gt;WorldIsUnlocked&lt;/key&gt;             &lt;true/&gt;             &lt;key&gt;Highscore&lt;/key&gt;             &lt;string&gt;1304&lt;/string&gt;             &lt;key&gt;Levels&lt;/key&gt;             &lt;array&gt;                 &lt;key&gt;level1&lt;/key&gt;                 &lt;true/&gt;                 &lt;key&gt;level2&lt;/key&gt;                 &lt;true/&gt;                 &lt;key&gt;level3&lt;/key&gt;                 &lt;false/&gt;             &lt;/array&gt;         &lt;/dict&gt;     &lt;/dict&gt; &lt;/dict&gt; /code/pre  This way, you can easily point to whatever piece of information you want.  E.g extracting the highscore of the world "The Land"  codeWorlds -&gt; TheLand -&gt; Highscore/code, will print out: code1304/code. Checking what levels are available within "The Land" codeWorlds -&gt; TheLand -&gt; Levels/code, will print out an array: codelevel1: true, level2: true, level3: false/code.  On a side note, this question is more programming related and should therefor be asked over at stackoverflow.  <comment170072> You might want to post your question on the Game Development Stack Exchange site here: http://gamedev.stackexchange.com
