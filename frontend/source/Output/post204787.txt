Dispatch Thread Soft Limit Reached: 64 <body> My 2014 MacBook Air encounters this error when interacting with file dialogs in any application. At first I thought it was an issue with VirtualBox because it happened when choosing a virtual hard disk, but have since encountered it when trying to choose files to attach to emails or Facebook in Chrome and Safari. Additionally it happens when trying to do things such as FileOpen in Word.   The issue is 100% repeatable. Since first encountered I have not been able to interact with any file dialog without the application hanging and having to force quit.  However, the issue does not occur when in Safe Mode. I have verified my disk and disk permissions multiple times to no avail. This related solution has done nothing to help. http://osxdaily.com/2013/11/24/slow-open-save-dialog-problem-mac-os-x/  Other threads I've seen on here all refer to a specific application having problems but not the system in general, so I don't know what to do. Thanks.  Running a 2014 11" MacBook Air with 10.9.5.
