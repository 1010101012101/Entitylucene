Mac equivalent of Ctrl + Space to select an item on a list <body> I want to select non-consecutive items on a list, strongwithout using a mouse/trackpad/strong - there should be no emclicks/em involved.  In Windows and Linux (at least Ubuntu) an item can be selected using kbdSpace//kbd button, which, in combination with arrows and kbdCtrl/kbd key allows me to select multiple items in any environment (file manager, IDE etc.) - e.g.  Enter a directory - hold kbdCtrl/kbd - down arrow twice - press kbdSpace/kbd - down arrow twice - press kbdSpace/kbd.  Now I should have items 1, 3 and 5 selected. Is there a way to do the same thing in OS X?  PS. Sorry for such a verbose description, but so far every answer I encountered advices using kbdCommand/kbd + Click, and this is something I strongdon't/strong want to do.  <answer296329> I don't think there's a native way to do this, but if you install Shortcat you can:  ul liselect the first item using arrow keys/li liactivate Shortcat and type enough to focus on the next item you want/li lihold Command and press Return/li /ul  By the way, if you're as keyboard-centric as I am, you should also look at Karabiner Elements.  <comment216950> Command-Click selects non-consecutive items, so it would intuitively follow that you would Command instead of Control for the functionality you want - however Command-Down Arrow opens the selected file/application, and Space opens QuickLook. The end result is what you are asking is not possible.
