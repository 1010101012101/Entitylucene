Random letters and touch input on iPad <body> A couple of days ago, my iPad started inserting random letters into what I was typing. For instance, I would try to type a C and a V would be typed. This would be the same for many letters. When I pressed Backspace to delete it would either delete multiple letters or insert various random letters. I reset the iPad and it worked better for a couple of days, but now symptoms have arisen again.  This has been happening when using Facebook, Messenger and Mail so it's not restricted to one app. What can I do?  <answer273459> I've seen a couple variations of this problem before, and its usually one of 3 problems:  ol liyour touch screen is starting to malfunction. This is uncommon, but things happen with electronics. Seek repair from Apple./li liPoorly conditioned electricity. Does this only happen when your iPad is plugged in? I had a generic plug that induced symptoms like you describe. Unplug the ipad and see if it still happens./li liLiquid damage. This is probably the most frequent cause of electrical anomalies like this. Did anyone spill anything on the ipad, even if not recently?/li /ol  <comment343936> Funnily enough it has been fine for a couple of days.  I did have a habit of using it whilst still plugged in to charge.  I thought that it was a malfunctioning touch screen but as it is fine again this seems unlikely.  thank you.
