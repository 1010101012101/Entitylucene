Trying to import old video from tape into iMovie 10.0.9, and store it on peripheral drive <body> I can't control which file or folder to target. I can only name a target an event name, and then that event only shows in the iMovie libraries menu on the left. Cant find the even in Finder to copy it to hard drive.  <answer207664> iMovie imports into events, which are stored wherever you have chosen. Once you've imported the media, you can right-click on an event and select Reveal in Finder to reveal its location and either move/copy the event or move/copy the media within.
