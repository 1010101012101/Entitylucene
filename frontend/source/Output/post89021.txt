How to prevent songs from getting uploaded with iTunes match? <body> Is there a way to manually exclude songs from getting uploaded to iTunes match?  <answer89023> strong(take a copy of your songs)/strong delete the songs you don't want on match, re-add them but change the emtype/em (right klick, info) to emaudio-book/em hence emiCloud don't upload audiobooks/em   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/BM2jJ.png" alt="enter image description here"  To be clear - the AudioBooks that are incorrectly marked 'music' cannot have their identifier edited (when already uploaded to cloud), as the Get Info Options Media Kind is greyed out. You must save the audio away from iTunes, and when you reload it, you can change the option before it's uploaded.   <comment104394> Why would you want to exclude certain songs? <comment104396> I'm not sure why this is important to answer the question, however: because this are unreleased recordings from myself and some of my bands which I don't want to be anywhere else than on my local machine and my local backup.
