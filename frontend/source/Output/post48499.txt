Using dnsmasq when not connected to the Internet <body> I'm routing dns requests through dnsmasq so that domains I'm using for local development point to 127.0.0.1. This works great when I'm connected to the Internet via Wi-Fi or ethernet, but I start to have problems when I'm not connected to the Internet at all.  In dnsmasq.conf, I have this setting:  precodeaddress=/gentoo/127.0.0.1 /code/pre  Turning off all network connections, I run:  precode$ dscacheutil -q host -a name test.gentoo name: test.gentoo ip_address: 127.0.0.1  $ ping test.gentoo PING test.gentoo (127.0.0.1): 56 data bytes 64 bytes from 127.0.0.1: icmp_seq=0 ttl=64 time=0.043 ms 64 bytes from 127.0.0.1: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.107 ms 64 bytes from 127.0.0.1: icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=0.177 ms ^C --- test.gentoo ping statistics --- 3 packets transmitted, 3 packets received, 0.0% packet loss round-trip min/avg/max/stddev = 0.043/0.109/0.177/0.055 ms /code/pre  So that seems to be working fine. But if I try to open http://test.gentoo/ in Chrome, I get the message:     Unable to connect to the Internet Google Chrome can't display the   webpage because your computer isn't connected to the Internet.       You can try to diagnose the problem by taking the following steps:       Go to Applications  System Preferences  Network  Assist me to test   your connection. Error 106 (net::ERR_INTERNET_DISCONNECTED): The   Internet connection has been lost.   Chrome sees that I don't have a network connection, and it doesn't even try to make the request.  Any idea how I can work around this? Can I create a dummy network interface to convince Chrome I'm connected to the Internet? Can I make it send the requests even though I'm not connected? Any other ideas?  I tried the solution at https://serverfault.com/q/22419/92378 but it did not work, as I'm on OS X 10.7.3, so resolver is ignored when not connected to a network.  <answer145689> The solution on https://serverfault.com/q/22419/92378 is working for me (OS X 10.9.4). Just make sure to do this step:  Create a file /etc/resolver/whatever:  precodenameserver 127.0.0.1 domain . /code/pre
