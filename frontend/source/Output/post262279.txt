'Esc' key not working on my bluetooth keyboard <body> I bought a Jellycomb Bluetooth Keyboard. All of the keys work except for the escape key. I got Key Codes from the appstore and when I press the esc key nothing shows up. I am on macOS Sierra.  <comment328550> Esc should generate Unicode: 27 / 0x1b Check if the keyboard needs additional drivers, or that it works when paired to something else.
