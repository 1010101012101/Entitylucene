WhatsApp videos are not viewable in iPhone 6s <body> I got a video in WhatsApp from someone with an Android phone. When I open the video I  can hear the the audio, but nothing is visible; it's just a blank screen with audio from the recording.   I forwarded the same video to my friend who has an  iPhone 7 and he is able to view (and hear) the video.   Does anyone know what the problem is and how to fix?  I am using an iPhone 6s.   <answer267720> Try the free VLC video app, it's available for iOS.  <comment335913> Didn't you try to download and play it? <comment335926> It's helpful to know what version of iOS and WhatsApp you are using and what version your friend is using. <comment335965> i always hate to suggest this, but did you try restarting your iPhone? Also, if you have a computer, try using the WhatsApp Web/Desktop option and check if you can see the video on your computer.
