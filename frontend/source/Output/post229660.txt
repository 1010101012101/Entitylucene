Macbook acting weird <body> My 2015 Macbook pro 13" is acting weird, after restoring from a Time Machine backup my mac is running slow and I have a lot of bugs:  The reaction time of the system is very slow, sometimes when I open a new tab or when I write in this textfield, I just see the spinning beach ball for a couple of seconds.    The mail app can't connect to my three gmails, but my iCloud mail is running fine,br Every time I activate Find my Mac it just deactivates after a second.  Hope some of you can solve at least one of the questions  Update:br Many apps (Safari Photos Notes and other) is openning at the same screen every time, (safari at the same 5 specific tabs, Photos at the same pic, and notes at the same sub folder)  I restored March 1. and the slow reaction time started earlier today.  <answer229666> Sounds like spotlight is indexing the disk. Have a look at the cpu usage in "activity monitor" to make sure. The culprits should be processes named "mds" and/or "mdworker"  If it is spotlight indeed this will take a while (hours). Be patient ;-)  <answer230248> Found a solution, used this command in terminal codechmod -RN ~/Library//code  <comment280186> spotlight is not indexing,( mdworker and mds is totally about 2% of CPU) it's about two days ago I restored.
