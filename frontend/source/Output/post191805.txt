OSX: Pick screen for notifications <body> I recently hooked up 2 displays to my MacBook. Now the notifications always show up on my right screen. This means that I have to turn my head and in addition move my mouse a considerable long way to click on a notification.  Is there a way to make the notifications show up on a different screen?  <answer191807> Notifications appear on your primary display. The primary display is typically the one showing the menu bar; however, you can show the menu bar on every display.  To change your primary display:  ul liOpen strongSystem Preferences.app/strong  strongDisplays/strong/li liSelect the strongArrangement/strong tab/li liDrag the strongmenu bar/strong to the desired display/li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/IXFve.png" alt="OS X 10.10 Displays in System Preferences"
