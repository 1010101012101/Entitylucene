How to add WhatsApp chat history from Android to iPhone <body> I've recently moved from Android to iPhone transferred most of my apps.   I've been told that WhatsApp on iOS doesn't detect chat backup from Google drive, so I don't really want to risk losing the chat history and have been using WhatsApp on my Android phone. Plus there's no file manager.  In Android you either backup to Google drive and it automatically detects whenever you install and login to WhatsApp on another Android device.  Or else there's always a nice little file manager in which you go to WhatsApp folder  Databases and find the chat history backup file. This when placed in the new Android device at same place takes the chat backup.  Likewise, is there some proven way in which I can get it from Android to iPhone? I do not want to backup chat over email, since I need it on my phone for past references to any conversation.  Regards, M
