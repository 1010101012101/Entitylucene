Trim Enabler Safety <body> I have a quick question. I am a bit anal about what I run on my Mac, tend to use the apple apps (aperture/terminal) rather than alternatives (Picasa/iterm2) because I like to make sure I'm running safe software.  It sounds a bit tinfoil hat, but as a developer I know there is alot of bad code out there.  I have never hacked about with OSX and as a result I have had a seemless experience through the years, with nearly 0 issues.  Trim enabler has brought my SSD back to life performance wise, but i'm a little concerned that it may be interfering with important system kexts and files.  Do you think TE is safe to use / wont corrupt OS X or the system?  Thanks, John  <answer107741> I've described in the following question How does TRIM Enabler work? how Trim Enabler works and which file it modifies. It won't corrupt your system as it only modifies one specific kernel extension. -- Chrisii  <answer257412> I've done it by   ol lichecking is it active or not (Apple logo on the top left  About this Mac  System Report  on the left hand side SATA/STA Express  then check the drive which you want to enable TRIM Support Yes or No "By build in Apple SSD by default is active by Self service by default it's in active)/li liOpen Terminal   sudo trimforce enable/li /ol  enter password  Then it will ask you are you sure and then Y for Yes then again it will ask you are you sure to enable this then again Y for yes  After a while MacBook will reboot and check by Step 1 Trim is enable.  <comment120290> I've described in the following question http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/88230/how-does-trim-enabler-work/94073#94073 how Trim Enabler works and which file it modifies.
