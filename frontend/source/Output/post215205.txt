How to add a self-signed root CA and always trust it from CLI on OSX <body> I succeeded importing a root CA to the keychain with  precodesudo security add-trusted-cert -d -r trustRoot -k "/Library/Keychains/System.keychain" CA.crt /code/pre  But it's marked as strongUse System Defaults/strong, like  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Qyqjb.png" alt="enter image description here"  How can I mark it as strongAlways Trust/strong from CLI?  <answer216045> It seems that the only way to modify the trust settings via the security command is by the codetrust-settings-import/code option.  The xml file output by codesecurity trust-settings-export/code would be a good place to start; but, it looks a little tricky.  <answer263323> Probably your root CA certificate is malformed, as your method works for me. Maybe your CA root certificate has not been generated with the expected properties. Try with code-r trustAsRoot/code in your case, but I recommend to check your certificate generation.  <comment261108> I just spent an hour. Looks like a bug to me.
