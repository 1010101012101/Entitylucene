How to keep MacBooks keyboard and trackpad functionality when using Windows on Bootcamp? <body> Before installing Windows 7, I used to work with Mac OS X on my MacBook Pro. After the installation I noticed that the functionality of the keyboard and trackpad changed. I really want to keep using Windows 7 and the default/old keyboard and trackpad functionality as in Mac OS X.    <answer115470> Do you have Apple's bootcamp drivers? You should be able to go into Control Panel  Bootcamp and change your keyboard/mouse settings there...  <comment135165> What 'functionality' are you referring to exactly?
