Huge fonts in Skype 5.1 <body> I have huge fonts in the messaging window, and there I can't find a configuration item to change it. brIt's the new Skype 5.1 for Mac.  Why did this happen, and stronghow can I restore the fonts to their normal sizes?/strong  <answer12130> If you are having an application issue on Mac OS X, and it is not something that is expected behavior, a good first step is to quit the program, remove the user specific code.plist/code files for that application, and then relaunch it. If regenerating the code.plists/code doesn't work, it is probably time to reinstall Skype.   If this change is just a result of intended behavior (i.e. an update changed the way the program works), I recommend uninstalling and downloading a previous version to your liking.  http://mac.oldapps.com/skype.php  <comment12629> And what is the question here? <comment12631> Why did this happen? i did not want those huge fonts. They were not there this morning. How do I get my old fonts back? <comment12638> In the future, please leave the rant out of your question. We know you're frustrated, but isn't a great way to get your point across. Please take a look at the edit I've made and add any more info you think is relevant (screen caps may help). Thanks. <comment12641> got you. you're right.
