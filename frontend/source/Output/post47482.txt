iTunes 10.6.1 wrongly syncing apps again? <body> With iTunes 10.5 there was an issue, that you couldn't disable app syncing with your iPhone, without wiping all apps from the device.  Then with 10.6 that got fixed, and I could transfer music and podcasts and finally remove the app from iTunes.  Today I wanted to sync my iPhone again, and iTunes asked, whether or not it should transfer purchased items. I kindly declined, but the next thing it does is syncing my apps.  Is this a regression with iTunes 10.6.1?  <comment55435> I gave this another shot, and on last "sync" it began deleting apps from my phone. I thought Apple fixed this behavior, but now it's happening again.
