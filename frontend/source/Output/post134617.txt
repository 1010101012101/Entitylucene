Mac Mini 2013 wakes immediately after sleep when USB drive plugged in <body> I have a 2013 mac mini running osx 10.9.3. I used to be able to send the machine to sleep by going to the apple in the menubar and choosing sleep. After a recent update, when I do this the displays turn off, and my usb drives spin down. About 5 seconds later I hear a drive spin up and it immediately wakes from sleep.    I disconnected devices and found that my external usb drives are what are causing the issue. If I remove the usb drives, it will sleep normally. If I eject the drives but do not disconnect them, it will still immediately wake. I know this has only happened within the last month or so, as it used to manually sleep normally.    When I run codesyslog | grep -i "wake reason"/code I see the following wake reason codekernel[0] &lt;Debug&gt;: Wake reason: XHC1/code.  codepmset -g assertions/code yields the following output:  precode    Assertion status system-wide:     BackgroundTask                 0     PreventDiskIdle                0     ApplePushServiceTask           0     UserIsActive                   0     PreventUserIdleDisplaySleep    0     InteractivePushServiceTask     0     PreventSystemSleep             0     ExternalMedia                  1     PreventUserIdleSystemSleep     0     NetworkClientActive            0     Listed by owning process:     pid 28(powerd): [0x0000000900000636] 00:15:58 ExternalMedia named: "com.apple.powermanagement.externalmediamounted"     Kernel Assertions: 0x104=USB,MAGICWAKE     id=500  level=255 0x4=USB mod=6/10/14, 1:53 PM description=XHC1 owner=AppleUSBXHCI     id=502  level=255 0x4=USB mod=6/10/14, 6:26 PM description=EHC1 owner=AppleUSBEHCI     id=504  level=255 0x100=MAGICWAKE mod=6/10/14, 6:33 PM description=en1 owner=en1 /code/pre  One drive is a time machine backup, and one has my media. I'd rather not have to unplug the drives before sleeping every time, especially as this seems to be a recent development.
