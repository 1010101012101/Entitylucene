Create a symbolic link do navigate with cd <body> Is it possible to create a symbolic link to easier change directories? like  codeln -s /Users/mles/Documents /usr/local/bin/d/code  so I can codecd d/code instead of codecd ~/Documents/code?  <answer232135> You can define variables pointing to your directories. For example:  precode[~]$ export d=~/Documents  [~]$ ls -l $d [~]$ cd $d [~/Documents]$  /code/pre  In bash you can use codecdable_vars/code option to be able to codecd/code without preceding code$/code:  precode[~]$ shopt -s cdable_vars [~]$ export d=~/Documents  [~]$ cd d [~/Documents]$  /code/pre  But it does not allow dropping code$/code for other commands, so codels -l d/code won't work.  <answer232136> The problem with creating a symbolic link in that manner is that you are limited to where the symbolic link is created.  It also adds to the problem if you have a directory code../d/../code somewhere on your system.  A better way would be to create an emalias/em  In terminal, you can create an alias by issuing the command  codealias cdd='cd ~/Documents'/code  The benefit here is that it will work anywhere without having to add it to your PATH.    To make it permanent, add the command to your code.bash_profile/code in your home directory.
