What program(s) can I use to open an .xlsx spreadsheet for editing on my Mac <body> I can double-click the file and a browser preview opens that looks like excel.... but it is basically just a browser preview feature and it is read-only.  The file came from a Windows machine.  <answer63254> If you have opened it in Excel but you are unable to select or change it, the sheet may be protected.   If the sheet has been protected using the strongTools  Protection  Protect Sheet/strong option then a lock symbol will appear next to the sheet name in Excel 2011.  Sheet protection can be removed by using the strongTools  Protection  Unprotect Sheet/strong command.  <answer63257> This response makes a couple of assumptions:  ul liYou just want to be able to open the document and do basic editing/li liThe document is essentially local to your computer/li liYou want a free / open source solution/li /ul  You should be able to use Apache OpenOffice CALC to edit files in the Microsoft Excel file format of .xlsx as per the OpenOffice website:     Since version 3.0, Calc has been able to read .xlsx files created with   Microsoft Office 2007 or Microsoft Office 2008 for Mac OS X   You may download OpenOffice from this site: http://www.openoffice.org/download/  Alternatively, you can always use the MAC version of Microsoft Office 2011 available for purchase here: http://www.microsoft.com/mac/buy  <comment73048> What programs do you have on your Mac? How did you get the file onto your machine? <comment73051> 1. What app are you opening the file in? Excel? Numbers? OpenOffice/LibreOffice? 2. Is the file being opened from a remote drive? From an email? From your Desktop? <comment73072> i get a .xlsx file and I double click on it it opens as a browser preview, not an editable spreadsheet <comment73074> looks like I should be opening it in a spreadsheet application but which one? how to choose? how to find.  If ones knows windows it is ms office and excel.  If one does NOT know a mac at all, which product to use / pick / download, etc. <comment73075> If you're looking for a software recommendation, you should re-word your question. However what you probably want is [Microsoft's Office for Mac suite](http://www.microsoft.com/mac/products), which includes the Mac version of Excel. <comment73076> I did not know I was looking for software recommendations until trying quite a few things.  Once I did i reworded my question.  Yes open office is the answer.  Post as an answer and I'll accept and give you the points. <comment73102> May I suggest LibreOffice instead? Most OpenOffice developers jumped ship. <comment293090> Apache OpenOffice CALC does not save XLSX files! Downvoted.
