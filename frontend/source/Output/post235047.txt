Log out or sign out of Apple's Bug Reporter AKA Radar? <body> I accidentally signed into Radar with the wrong account and I can't find the log out or sign out button in order to switch accounts. Is there any alternative besides clearing my cache?  <answer235048> Nm, I found it after clicking around. You have to click on the tiny padlock to sign out.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2zUoS.png" alt="enter image description here"
