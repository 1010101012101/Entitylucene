Trying to find how to have FaceTime <body> Last July I went on a holiday to Dubai and have bought my very first iPhone from there, the Gold iPhone 6 plus. Recently I decided to start using Facetime but for some reason I cannot find the app. I am using my iPhone in Malta, in the middle of the Mediterranean with a Vodafone carrier.   Can anyone please show or explain how can I have FaceTime on my phone?   I tried finding various videos on YouTube but could not find the right one.  <answer215228> I have the iPhone6 plus, I don't have an App for FaceTime, I added FaceTime access in contacts. (only works to other iPhone users)  <answer215237> FaceTime is not available for iPhones purchased in the United Arab Emirates.   @jaume answered this question here: FaceTime not working on iPhone 6 Plus purchased from Dubai  <comment259934> Have you tried pulling down on the screen and searching "FaceTime" in Spotlight? BTW, the icon is a big green rounded rectangle with a white camera in it. <comment259935> Are you sure you don't have FaceTime? Perhaps you just don't notice it because you don't use it. FaceTime is a built in app and _all_ Apple devices (or at least those with cameras) have it. <comment259937> iPhones bought in the UAE do not have FaceTime, as it is illegal in that territory. <comment259941> Is there any way I can make facetime activated pls?! <comment259950> @Arc676 Are you really not aware that FaceTime is never included in devices sold in certain countries? <comment259951> Try setting your Region to Egypt.  If that does not work, you are out of luck, you bought your device in a place where this app in never provided and there is no way to fix it except maybe jailbreak. <comment260038> Sorry, I forgot about that.
