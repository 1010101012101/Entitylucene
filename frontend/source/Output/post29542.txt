Is there a Game Boy Color emulator for Lion? <body> Is there a GBC emulator that will run on Lion? I've been in the mood for some nostalgic gaming recently, and I'd love to play some of the games from when I was younger.  <answer29566> http://vba.ngemu.com/ Visual Boy advanced should work on Mac. I haven't personally tried it out, but if it's at all as good as their program for PC you'll be set. Best of luck  <answer54214> VisualBoyAdvance is apparently a PowerPC Application that is able to run on Macs up to OS X Snow Leopard because those versions include a feature of being able to convert Power PC apps to Intel, which is what Macs are now with their Intel chipset.   Unfortunately they took out this feature from OS X Lion so it now ONLY ACCEPTS Intel applications. Therefore VisualBoyAdvance will not work on OS X Lion since it is Power PC. I have Snow Leopard though, so I am currently enjoying a nice session of Pokemon on VisualBoyAdvance on my Mac. Hope this helps  <comment33913> I think this should be on Gaming.SE. I've flagged it for migration. <comment33947> @daviesgeek This is about Mac software, it's OK to ask here <comment33957> Already tried it, doesn't play Game Boy Color games. <comment34516> Never mind, I modified some settings (removed the GameBoy Border, specifically) and it now works. I'll accept this answer anyways, though. <comment62147> It probably doesn't help because the OP asked for a Lion solution...
