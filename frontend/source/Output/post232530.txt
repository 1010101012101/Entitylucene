Apple Numbers Query - Conditional Formatting <body> I am working on a numbers Spreadsheet that compares dates in cells. I am trying to create a condition where a date cell will turn green when the date is 3 months or more later than another date cell i.e.  precodeDate 1  |  Date 2 ----------------- 1/1/16  |  2/3/16 /code/pre  In this case, the second date cell would go green because it is 3 months or more outside of the first cell.  Would anyone know I can do this in Numbers?  <comment284327> I have worked this out by comparing the date to today's date which then goes green of past it <comment284620> That is good to hear!
