How can I find out what carrier an iPhone 3gs is locked to? <body> I'm trying to activate an old 3gs but am unsure of what carrier it is on. I don't really want to go testing all the sim cards I can find to see if I luck out.   Does anyone know of a way to find out?   I was wondering if I could write an app for it and use the codeCore Telephony Framework/code to find the carrier but am not sure if that only show the carrier that is being used by the sim not what it is locked to.   <answer81106> There is a small app which can show you the carrier with which your iPhone is associated.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Cdgwg.png" alt="enter image description here"  The app itself is not free but the sole function of displaying the iphone information you require is free.  <answer102536> If memory serves, the iPhone 3GS was only available for AT&amp;T. Unless it is jailbroken, it will be AT&amp;T.  <comment104588> This program indicates the network of the SIM card. Not the network the phone is locked to. <comment120704> The 3GS was not only sold in the US though... <comment120748> Ah right. Good point. <comment120749> Can you read the model number from the back of the device?
