How can I make auto-hide/show for the dock faster? <body> I really like the auto-hide feature of the dock in Mac OS X. However, the stronganimation for the dock to reappear is just a bit too slow/strong for me. Since this is quite annoying, I disable the feature.     Is it possible to manually shorten the time for the dock   to reappear?   Btw: I am aware that one can use the key-combo kbd⌥/kbdkbd⌘/kbdkbdD/kbd to toggle auto hide/show for the dock. But I want solution without using the keyboard.  <answer33793> This is a bit of a kludge, but it does make the Dock appear slightly faster.  If your Dock is on the right side of your screen (mine is; vary this for your desired Dock location), set upper and lower right Hot Corners to trigger Launchpad. When the mouse hits a hot corner, it triggers the action instantly, as opposed to after a brief delay with Dock Hiding. If the Dock is hidden and Launchpad gets triggered, the Dock appears. Ignore Launchpad; click what you want on your Dock.  So if you move the mouse to the edge, you get the Dock to appear after a brief delay, but hit either corner and the Dock appears faster. There's distracting action on the rest of the screen (i.e. Launchpad), but if you can ignore it, you get your desired results.  <answer33911> Short answer: There's no known way to actually speed up the animation.  But you might be able to make it marginally faster with a few tweaks.  Your best bet is to get one of the 3rd-party "tweaker" apps such as Cocktail or TinkerTool and disable any of the eye candy related to the Dock.  I'd recommend TinkerTool as it has more Dock-related options right now.  In particular, I'd recommend turning off "Use transparent Dock icons to show hidden applications". And turn on "Disable the three-dimensional glass effect of the Dock".  This will likely have only a minimal benefit, but it could help a bit.  And if anyone ever emdoes/em figure out how to speed up that animation, it'll be the teams at Cocktail or TinkerTool, so having one of these apps means you'll probably be one of the first to know.  ETA: Fastest way of all: disable Auto-Hide.   I keep my Dock on the right side and it takes up very little screen real estate. It's mostly the vertical pixels that are precious.  And with Lion's new FullScreen feature, if I ever emreally/em need to hide it to minimize distractions, I just go FullScreen with the current app.  <answer33979> I also find the Dock slow to use and the Launchpad can be sluggish. You might want to try an application launcher such as LaunchBar or Alfred. The former is a paid program (with a free demo), the latter is free. Either let you emvery/em quickly launch apps along with hundreds of other functions with applications, files, folders, and more. I don't use, or miss, the Launchpad or the Dock... even on a new Mac they are too slow, not to mention being mouse driven.  <answer34097> To make the Dock stronginstantly leap back/strong into view when it’s needed, rather than slide, open a Terminal window and type the following:  precodedefaults write com.apple.dock autohide-time-modifier -int 0;killall Dock /code/pre  hr  I find this useful, but if you’d like the animation for the dock to reappear to last for a split-second, try the following:  precodedefaults write com.apple.dock autohide-time-modifier -float 0.15;killall Dock /code/pre  hr  To revert back to the default sliding effect, open a Terminal window and type the following:  precodedefaults delete com.apple.dock autohide-time-modifier;killall Dock /code/pre  <answer46222> You can manually set the time it takes for the dock to appear.  sub Unlike the codeautohide-time-modifier/code tip posted by Marius Butuc, this command does not remove the animation of the Dock when it appears./sub  First, activate auto-hide in strongSystem Preferences &#x2192; Dock &#x2192; Autohide/strong or type kbd&#x2318;/kbd+kbd&#x2325;/kbd+kbdD/kbd Then open the Terminal and type:  precodedefaults write com.apple.Dock autohide-delay -float 0; killall Dock /code/pre  ul licode0/code is the time it takes for the Dock to appear in seconds. You can choose floats and integers e.g. code2/code, code0.5/code,.../li licodekillall Dock/code causes the Dock to restart./li /ul  Restore the default behavior using...  precodedefaults delete com.apple.Dock autohide-delay; killall Dock /code/pre  According to MacOSHints this trick was found by reverse engineering from the developer Christian Baumgart of Hyperdock.  strongThis command only works in OS X 10.7 or newer./strong  <answer62474> @gentmatt, I always install Secrets on my computer. It has lots of various system and application variables that you can toggle or set and the dock animation is one of them. It also allows you to put spacers on the dock to organize it by block a little. And the best thing is that it works as a control panel so no Terminal experience is required. http://secrets.blacktree.com  <answer70598> The modifications in both @gentmatt's and @Marius Butuc's answers are important. I did some testing and in my opinion the delay (before the slide animation starts) should be zero while the animation duration should be 0.4s (to feel natural but fast). You can easily apply these settings by hiding your Dock (  Dock  Turn Hiding On or ⌥⌘D) and entering these commands in Terminal:  precodedefaults write com.apple.dock autohide-delay -int 0 defaults write com.apple.dock autohide-time-modifier -float 0.4 killall Dock /code/pre  You can change the values for code0/code and code0.4/code to see if a different setting works better for you. Don't forget to change codeint/code to codefloat/code if you want to use a float instead of code0/code.  If you don't like it, you can undo the changes using these commands:  precodedefaults delete com.apple.dock autohide-delay defaults delete com.apple.dock autohide-time-modifier killall Dock /code/pre  <answer72088> To make it a tiny bit easier... here jonathan's answer, with semi colons so it can all be copied and pasted into the terminal window in one go. (And I tweaked the animation time to how I like it) BIG BIG Kudos to Jonathan for this suggestion, I tried to vote him up but I don't have enough rep!  Open Terminal and copy the following code into it :)  precodedefaults write com.apple.dock autohide-delay -int 0; defaults write com.apple.dock autohide-time-modifier -float 1.0; killall Dock /code/pre  Tweak the -float number to change animation time  <answer223817> via Cocktail.app  You can modify almost everything with this app.   <comment38307> I dont think there is a way to speed up the animation, you could make the dock smaller and it would reach its largest point quicker? <comment38321> If you're using Lion, have you considered using Launchpad instead of the dock? It's amazingly fast and applications can be arranged in an order that makes finding/clicking them easy. I use the dock but I'm finding Launchpad quite fast and might consider using it more... <comment38324> @GraemeHutchison Making the dock smaller does not change anything, unfortunately. <comment38325> @Richard I don't use Launchpad since its animations have really low fps on my Macbook pro. Also, Launchpad does not sort apps by default (e.g. alphabetically), which is why I prefer accessing the apps via the applications folder in the dock. Moreover, I don't like that Launchpad spreads out over the whole screen. The viewing angle is too big on the eye for me. But that my 2 cents, I guess. <comment38327> @matt cant help sorry <comment38643> Thank you for your answer. Since Launchpad does not perform well, I do not want to use it. The shade effect for Launchpad to appear is not smooth on my MBP 3,1. Because it's that slow, there is no real gain. Besides, all hot corners are reserved for other functions already. <comment38671> Oh, OK. On my machine, this makes the Dock appear faster, but your experience is obviously different. <comment38780> Thanks. I've tried different options using the TinkerTool. Unfortunately, without success. BTW, I'm sure that the slow appearance of the dock is not a rendering issue because its that slow for any Mac. Therefore visualization settings should not make a difference. I guess, the slow appearance is rather a feature in case you accidentally hover over the bottom of the screen. <comment38781> Thank you. I already use Alfred (and Quicksilver before that) over Spotlight. Since I use a SSD this is even more amazing. Results appear instantly. However, since I'm looking for a 'click to pick' answer this is not sufficient. ;) <comment38792> Exactly...it's like a baked-in "Are you sure you need the Dock?" feature. The TinkerTool stuff might be reducing the actual rendering time from 50ms to 25 ms, for example, but if that hard-coded pre-delay is like 400ms, the difference between 450ms and 425ms is going to be minimally   noticeable.   Personally, I just keep my Dock on the right-side and disable Auto-Hide...with all the widescreen real-estate, might as well use those pixels for something.  :) <comment38897> Upvoting as a useful response to the original question. You can't know what solutions the OP has already rejected unless he says so in his question. <comment38898> Upvoting as a useful response to the original question.

I was searching for an answer for 'ages'. Thank you very much. <comment38966> @Matt welcome! :) <comment75867> Thanks! I new about the website, but I never noticed that they have a prefPane for download. Thank you very much :) <comment75881> I don't think that the OP was really worried about the animation itself, which many of the answers have tackled. I think the OP just wants, as I do, to have the Dock come out quicker. And the biggest delay here is the getting-started delay. (Even if it isn't actually the biggest delay, it's where the delay is perceived). For me, the solution posted by genmatt was thus perfect. I applied it, now my Dock feels totally responsive. I recommend this to the OP (if they are on Lion). <comment77073> I don't think that the OP was really worried about the animation itself, which many of the answers have tackled.

I like that too. But I also like it just appearing.. ah decisions decisions.. <comment161567> This works in Mavericks. It not only eliminates the animation but also eliminates the apparent small delay before the animation. It becomes instant! <comment161568> This didn't work for me on mavericks. <comment165867> Same here I've afraid. No difference on Mavericks. <comment167369> Steve Hall, your code (with the semicolons and copy paste) worked for me. Thank you!! Macbook Pro late 2011 OS X Mavericks <comment169359> This works for me on mavericks <comment231354> it's the little things +1 <comment247226> on my iMac, i find the following values make the Dock feel more fluid:  defaults write com.apple.dock autohide-delay -int 0 && defaults write com.apple.dock autohide-time-modifier -float 1 && killall Dock <comment253110> Perfect! Exactly what I wanted - no delay, short duration. Thanks! <comment258010> Works great on El Capitan <comment271336> How do you do this? <comment271497> Open Cocktail - Interface - Dock - Auto-show delay <comment276018> Definitely, the best answer. Should be the accepted one. <comment329168> This is the perfect feel for Dock, in my opinion. <comment330936> This is so perfect. Thanks. <comment335469> Is it possible to do this with the menubar also since that can show/hide animated? <comment340009> Works awesomely on Sierra.
