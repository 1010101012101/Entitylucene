Will my calendar and contacts in iCloud be lost if I delete backups? <body> I cannot do any new backups because my iCloud storage is full.  I want to switch to using my computer for backups and delete the ones I have in iCloud. However I don’t want to lose my contacts and calendar that are also stored in iCloud.  <answer291597> You can safely delete your backup from iCloud. To do this, go into strongSettings/strong →  strongYour Profile/strong →  strongiCloud/strong →  strongiCloud Backup/strong and turn the switch to codeOff/code to disable iCloud Backups.  This will only delete your emiPhone backup/em from iCloud. It will strongNOT/strong delete your iCloud contacts and calendars.  <comment369252> Should contacts and calendars somehow be lost, they can be restored in the Settings of your iCloud.com account.
