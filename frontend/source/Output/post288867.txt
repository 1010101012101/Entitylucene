How Nike+ Run Club app gets data from Apple Watch <body> When initiating run by NRC+ app in Apple Watch, all details related to the running (pace, distance, heart rate) are stored in Apple Health.  How these data made available to NRC+ app in iPhone? Whether NRC+ app reads the data from Health kit and updates its NRC+ app?  The run information is not syncing properly with NRC+ app (few run is synced, lot of runs are not synced), but I can see the data in Health kit properly.
