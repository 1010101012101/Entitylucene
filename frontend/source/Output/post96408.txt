Is TrueCrypt compatible with FUSE for OS X and SSHFS? <body> TrueCrypt 7.1a is already installed on my MacBook with OS X 10.8.4. I plan to install OPENFUSE 2.6 and SSHFS 2.4.1, are they compatible with TrueCrypt?  <answer117222> strongYes, OS X 10.8.4-19.0.1 can/strong use Truecrypt while osxfuse-2.6.2.dmg and SSHFS-2.4.1 are installed. Also I strongdid not observe any/strong 'installation order issues'.
