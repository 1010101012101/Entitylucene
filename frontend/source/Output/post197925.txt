Syncing Photos.app with external HDD <body> I want to have my photo library to sync all the pictures on the HDD, which I can easily reference them by deselecting em"copy items to the photo library"/em and import them.  but I want that if I delete the photo in the photos.app, then it would delete the referenced file too. Is that possible?   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nuLV4.png" alt="Preferences in photos app"   <answer199448> Importing without coping to the library doesn't give Photos.app ownership of the file. So to be safe you can't delete it directly from the application. You can right-click on the picture and select strongShow related file in Finder/strong and delete it from there. Unfortunately, it will not delete it from the photo library so you have to do it by yourself.
