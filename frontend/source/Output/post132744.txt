How do I reset/clear my external display settings in 10.9? <body> I messed up the settings for the clamshell display mode on my MacBook Pro. I can't get my external display to work when I close my laptop. I can get all other modes working (standard mirroring and shared desktop) except for clamshell.  I've tried using codedefaults/code to remove codecom.apple.windowserver/code, but that hasn't helped.  <answer132750> Open the Colorsync Utility.app in your Utility folder.  Click on your external display.  Set the profile to Factory settings.  <comment157193> where did you do the messing up ? <comment157200> I clicked the wrong resolution, one it is supposed to work on, but doesn't. a <comment157201> It is set to factory.
