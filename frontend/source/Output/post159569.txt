Failed to make bootable USB drive and now I can't even format it <body> I want to do a fresh install of Yosemite and I got a brand new 8GB flash drive and I followed this tutorial. I formatted the USB drive and was copying the Yosemite installer, however I got the following error  precodeCopying installer files to disk... The copy of the installer app failed. /code/pre  Great. So I tried to reformat the drive again and start over. No. Disk utility says I can't format it because it "cannot unmount the drive". What does that suppose to mean? Then I plug the USB drive to a Windows computer and tried my luck there. No, you can't format the drive because it's "write protected" (there's no physical write protection switch on the drive or anything). Oh dear so now the drive is completely ruined? How can I force format the drive?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ohNBv.png" alt="enter image description here"  hr  Now in the terminal I used codesudo diskutil unmountDisk force disk1/code to successfully unmount the drive, but still I can't format it! Disk utility gave me a new error "Unable to write to the last block of the device."  <answer159573> Usually when I see this error it is because something on your Mac is accessing something on your USB drive.  It can be as simple as having the USB open in a window, or Spotlight trying to index it.  Try and select the USB drive in Disk Utility and Eject or Unmount it from there.  It may say it can't be ejected and ask if you want to Force Eject it, say yes, and then you should hopefully be able to erase it.  <comment187520> Try the steps mentioned in this page: http://bulenkov.com/2013/09/01/how-to-restore-unreadable-usb-flash-drive-under-mac-os-x/ <comment187521> I was halfway through an answer based on that link - if it's successful let's port it here for future ref. <comment187535> Updated question. I was able to force unmount it in terminal, but format still fails. <comment187554> @IconDaemon, Thank you, but I got the error `Error: -69760: Unable to write to the last block of the device`. <comment187559> 8GB flash drives are inexpensive. Chuck this one, purchase another, and try again. Its not outside the bounds of possibility the flash drive chose to self-destruct at the same time you tried the installation, and the two events are not really connected. Now if the **second** drive crashes when you build the install, then that's something else entirely. You might want to consider getting a different brand of flash drive, too, for the next iteration. I've made at least six bootable Yosemite flash drives, on a mix of Kingston and SanDisk devices. Please report back with your findings. Good luck! <comment187595> Some flash drives have a failure mode in which they are irreversibly write-locked by the internal controller when it detects a write error. <comment231335> problem is, the `createinstallmedia` utility requires the path to the volume which means it must be mounted <comment268280> I had a flash drive giving me the `The copy of the installer app failed` error. I solved it by removing and reinserting the drive, unmounting it with `diskutil unmount /Volumes/yadda`, and then killing its configuration with `dd if=/dev/zero bs=1m count=8192 of=/dev/disk2`. Adjust device to taste. After the dd, removing and reinserting the drive prompted me to initialize, which I did successfully using Disk Utility. <comment287609> Have you tried this diskutil eraseDisk HFS+ Untitled disk1
