Remove iOS 5.1 notification from the main screen? <body> I do not want to update my iPhone 3gs to new iOS 5.1. How can I remove this notification showing all the time on the codeSettings/code images. Please look at the image.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Jwo6Y.png" alt=""  I've tried opening this screen but without clicking the button Download and Install, but the notification is still there.   PS. I am new to iPhone. I have it for a couple of days.   <answer43870> From Macrumors:     Uncheck it from your iTunes so that is won't resync it, and then   delete it from the phone. Then it won't be on the phone anymore but   will still be in your iTunes for later use if you want it back.   <answer43871> I see that your iPhone is jailbroken. There's a tweak for this called noOTA badge. I haven't used it myself, but it looks legit. Give it a shot!  <comment50046> I do not know how to do this. Did you mean iTunes app or App Store app? <comment54714> I thought deleting the Settings app was impossible. <comment54715> It is. But I think Macrumors is referring to the update, not the Settings app <comment58742> use NoOTA Badge from cydia It is the best tweak to do what you ask.
