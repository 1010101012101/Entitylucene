MacBook Pro black screens and shuts off after a few minutes' use <body> I have a MacBook Pro 15" (mid 2014, running Sierra). Recently, it has started black screening and shutting off shortly after, after a few minutes' useâ€”let's say 3 to 10 minutes. The screen will go black but the LCD backlight will remain on for about 5 seconds, then the laptop will completely shut off.  I have reset PRAM and the SMC. Things I have determined:  ul liThe built-in hardware test passes/li liProblem is not tied to my user account (occurs when I'm logged in to another freshly created user)/li liProblem is not tied to my OS installation (I wiped and re-installed)/li liProblem does emnot/em manifest itself in Safe Mode or when booted into Windows 10. (Also didn't manifest during OS X re-installation.)/li liProblem does emnot/em seem to be overheating: I can game with no issues on Windows, graphics performance and fans are fine./li /ul  This behaves like a classic overheating problem, but I'm stumped due to some of the weirdness of it not being an issue in safe mode or Win 10. Any thoughts?  <answer291074> Been having the same issue for about a year now, right now the only way to prevent it from shutting down randomly is to have the Thunderbolt Gigabit Ethernet Adapter plugged in all the time. Brought my unit to Apple multiple times but were to no avail.  <answer295525> I have now hit on a solution. I'm not sure if it's the correct one, but it works for me so I thought I'd at least post it.  My vague suspicion: things worked perfectly in Windows, but not on Mac OS. This means that it's probably a hardware issue manifesting itself due to differing driver implementations between the two OSes. So, I started disabling driver kexts until Mac OS stopped crashing.   I created a folder under code/System/Library/DisabledExtensions//code and moved these files from code/System/Library/Extensions/code:  precodeAppleFWAudio.kext AppleThunderboltDPAdapters.kext AppleThunderboltEDMService.kext AppleThunderboltIP.kext AppleThunderboltNHI.kext AppleThunderboltPCIAdapters.kext AppleThunderboltUTDM.kext AppleUSBAudio.kext AppleUSBDisplays.kext AppleUSBEthernet.kext AppleUSBEthernetHost.kext IOUserEthernet.kext /code/pre  It now works.  <comment367004> Safe mode disables 3rd party kexts. That would be first place to look. <comment367110> The only 3rd party kext was Dropbox. Crashes still happen if I manually `kextunload` it. <comment373175> Interesting. This aligns with my theory that something has gone haywire with ether the Ethernet controller or Thunderbolt controller hardware. Disabling the associated kexts *seems* to have helped.
