Set audio input/ouput device priority <body> I have a MacBook Pro that is almost always connected to one of two Thunderbolt displays. Sometimes it will also be connected to a USB headset. Every time I disconnect the headset the audio input and output gets set to the build in speakers. However, when the headphones are not plugged in, the display speakers should be used and I have to switch it back. Is there any way to set device priority similar to how you can do it with WiFi networks? It would be awesome if I could set a rule like "Prefer headset over Display over internal", just like I do for WiFi networks.  Sounds like a small problem, but it get's incredibly annoying throughout my day, because I switch between display speakers and headphones a lot.  <answer186762> Posted as answer just to be able to inline pictures...  Not really sure how to test this, as I don't have a Macbook - but what happens if you use Audio Midi Setup &amp; mute the unwanted output? It might then skip it when you unplug the headphones.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DVnE2.png" alt="enter image description here"  …or possibly setting up a Multi-Output device, set to be your default output, with only the used connections checked…  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/23eVO.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment349353> Where is that screen?  Using El Capitan 10.11.6 I don't see anything like it, just a really dumbed-down Sound screen. <comment349354> Applications/Utilities/Audio Midi setup
