Locating an app by its bundle identifier from the command line <body> I am looking for a way to find an app's location on the system from the command line using its bundle identifier. I can open it like this:  precodeopen -b 'com.zerotier.ZeroTierOne' /code/pre  ... where com.zerotier.ZeroTierOne is my bundle ID, but what I want to do is locate where the app is actually installed. I want a command that will return (for example):  precode/Applications/ZeroTier One.app /code/pre  in response to a query by identifier 'com.zerotier.ZeroTierOne'.  The "-R" option to open will reveal in finder but I want this to be completely non-interactive and done via a shell script.  <answer115948> The magic command is:  precodemdfind kMDItemCFBundleIdentifier = "com.zerotier.ZeroTierOne" /code/pre  You can determine this by working backwards from codemdls foo | grep kMDItemCF/code  So if you didn't know iPhoto's CF Bundle Identifier:  precodeMac:~ me$ mdls /Applications/iPhoto.app | grep kMDItemCF kMDItemCFBundleIdentifier           = "com.apple.iPhoto" /code/pre  <comment346979> Is there an equivalent API in Foundation for this?
