What is this icon? What's its purpose?  <answer244280> According to Apple's official documentation, that symbol denotes a layout break.  These allow you to change the layout anywhere on the page (for example, a one-column title then a two-column title).  The reason you can't remove it is because it's part of the layout of the document. You could try applying a default style to the text that is part of the layout break (such as "body text").
