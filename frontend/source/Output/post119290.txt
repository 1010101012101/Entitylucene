slim black object on 1st generation macbook air case <body> This is just a curiosity: what is that slim black part (see picture) in the Apple Macbook Air 1,1 (Early 2008) case?img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Z4N5G.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer119296> If memory serves me correctly it is the power light.  <answer119297> According the Apple's user manual it is the Infrared Receiver.  http://manuals.info.apple.com/MANUALS/0/MA394/en_US/MacBook_Air_Users_Guide.pdf  The "Sleep Indicator Light" is next to it on the left.  The MacBook beneath it has the same configuration.  <comment139159> This is correct.  It's only real use was with the Apple remote, for controlling iTunes and FrontRow.
