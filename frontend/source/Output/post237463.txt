Mac OS X El Capitan, Option key alone as keyboard shortcut <body> I am using Macbook Air Mid2012 with El Captian 10.11.3 version.  I have two languages installed (two input sources). Currently my shortcut to toggle the language input is "CMD + space." I would like to use the option key on the right-hand-side as a shortcut for input source toggle.  System Preferences - Keyboard - Shortcuts - Input sources won't allow me to specify option key alone as a valid shortcut.  Is there anyway to do this?  Thank you!  <answer237484> It seems that modifier keys like kbdcmd/kbd, kbdctrl/kbd, kbdoption/kbd, kbdshift/kbd cannot be used alone and have to be combined with other keys as shortcuts. Alternatively you may also try using kbdoption/kbd + kbdspace/kbd as the shortcut to toggle input sources.
