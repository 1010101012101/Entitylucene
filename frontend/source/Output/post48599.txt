Some songs are skipped over/broken on my iPhone; how can I find these? <body> Sometimes when I go to play a song on my iPhone, it skips over it entirely and goes onto a song after it in the list.  The same happens when I try and play it in iTunes directly from the device - it gets a exclamation-mark-circle icon to its left when I try and play.  The songs have all been copied on by drag/drop from MP3 folders, so I suspect the copy process didn't completely properly.  Is there a way I can find all these songs so I can re-copy them?  (Trying to copy the entire album over again creates duplicate entries.)  <answer48624> There's a script to create a list of broken links on Doug's Applescripts called A HREF="http://dougscripts.com/itunes/scripts/ss.php?sp=listmias" rel="nofollow"List MIA's/A :  "This script checks your entire iTunes library for missing (and presumed "dead") tracks–those that iTunes is unable to associate with a file and which are listed in iTunes with a "!"– and creates a text file listing these tracks by Artist - Album - Song Name which you can view using TextEdit."  Once you have a list, you can remove the dead tracks with another script A HREF="http://dougscripts.com/itunes/scripts/ss.php?sp=removedeadsuper" rel="nofollow"Super Remove Dead Tracks/A and then use the list to figure out which tracks to re-import.  <answer55854> Finally found an answer to this, thanks to Galley from iLounge!  ol liCreate a standard playlist called "Not Missing"./li liDrag your entire library into that playlist. Missing tracks cannot be copied to a playlist./li liCreate a smart playlist called "Missing" where:  ul liPlaylist - is not - Not Missing/li liem(additional to this post)/em  Media type - is - Music/li /ul/li /ol  You now have a playlist which contains only your songs with the dreaded exclamation mark, and you can re-add them from your original source.  <answer80778> On your iphone, tap on music. Swipe left or right on a song, album or artist and a delete button will appear. Delete whichever item you don't like.  <comment93209> Nigel, thanks for your comment, but that doesn't identify the songs which have this problem. You can only tell when you go to play them, and they don't play. <comment95091> Absolutely brilliant logic!  Thank you!
