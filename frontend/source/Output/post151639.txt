back up iphone photos from sync <body> How do I back up photos on an iPhone that were synced from a computer I no longer have?  iPhoto and Image Capture only offer to download photos taken with the iPhone.  I have not yet tried syncing photos from iPhoto using iTunes because I'm concerned that it will delete the photos on my iPhone.  The iPhones file system does not appear to be accessible via Finder.
