Photos and apps disappear after updating my iPhone to iOS9.3 <body> All photos in my iPhone disappeared after updating it to iOS9.3. Besides, most app icons in my phone have been darkened and need to 'download' again.  Does anyone experience it? And should it be expected? Or did the upgrade go wrong somehow?  <comment284019> Are you still logged into iCloud with the same account as before? If you log in directly on iCloud.com, are your photos still there? <comment284052> @patrix I haven't uploaded any photos to iCloud yet, but it seemed that my iPhone has removed some of my contacts (added after last reset and before the update), and then added backed the contacts from iCloud.
