Switching between windows doesn't work in some apps <body> (using OSX 10.6.4 if that matters)  I know about the kbdCmd-`/kbd, but it doesn't work everywhere, namely Chrome and Firefox don't seem to react to it. It works in, for example, Finder and OpenOffice.  Any solution to this problem?  <answer17262> Places to check for things intercepting the keystroke:  ol listrongBrowser Extensions/strong: Perhaps the same extension on both browsers/li listrongMacro App/strong: TextExpander or Keyboard Maestro, for example/li listrongServices Shortcut/strong: In the emChrome/em or emFirefox/em menu choose emServices/em then emServices Preferences.../em.

Perhaps it's due to having to run older versions under Tiger. <comment18777> It's Snow Leopard here as well, Chrome 14 and FF 5. <comment18801> Oops, misread, thought you wrote 10.4. <comment18804> Checked 1, 3 and 4, nothing suspicious. I have no idea what macro apps are though. <comment18811> @Mladen Well, you would have had to intentionally installed one. TextExpander replaces text you type with other text in quite sophisticated ways. Keyboard Maestro lets you assign more complex macro actions -- click here, copy, change apps, click there, paste, etc. -- to keystrokes. They're both examples of apps that could be intercepting your keystroke. <comment18822> I don't think that I have anything similar installed. Thanks for trying to help, anyway. Just noticed that Adium has the same problem. <comment18829> Oh, found it. It was just mapped as some other key combination. :( Resetting default settings solved the issue.
