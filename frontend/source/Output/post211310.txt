How to restore the iPhone as a new phone with the same OS version? <body> I have an iPhone 5s. It currently has iOS 8.4.1 on it.  I want to restore it as a new phone, but retain iOS 8.4.1.  Is this possible?  Or will iTunes force iOS 9.x onto the phone?  <answer211318> Erase and Reset from the iOS device.
