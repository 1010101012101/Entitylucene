External drive indexing keep disabling (mac) <body> I have a small home/business network (all iMac devices). I am using a OWC ThunderBay 4 with 4 drives formatted as RAID5 for storing all data. This Bay is connected via Thunderbolt to one of the computers and other computers are accessing all files on this drive via network. The issue what I am having is that I need to be able to search across the drive on every computer using Spotlight in Finder. When I build a new index file, it is working fine for a few hours, and then it suddenly stops working/searching. Then, in order to make it working again, I have to delete/unload current index file (manually in Terminal) and load it again (using this command: sudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.metadata.mds.plist). Searching on the iMac, that is connected directly to the drive, is usually not affected, but sometimes I am also not able to search.  Do you know what could be the reason for this behaviour? Am I doing something wrong? Is there a way how to keep the index enabled anytime? I have a backing up software running every 2 hours, could that be the cause?  Thank you for any suggestions.
