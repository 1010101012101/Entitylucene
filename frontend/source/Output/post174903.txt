Macbook Pro incredibly slow/laggy <body> I have a Mid-2012 15" MacBook Pro running OS X (Yosemite) 10.10.2. It has a 2.6GHz Intel Core i7, 8 GB of RAM, and a 750GB HDD.  Over the past couple of weeks it has become incredibly slow, to the point that simple actions such as clicking on an icon in the dock have caused the spinning wheel to appear. As far as I can tell nothing significant changed around the time that this behaviour started.  There is nothing unusual shown in Activity Monitor: CPU usage is low and there is over 6 GB of free memory with no swap being used.  Some example of the degree of slowness are:  ul liScrolling down the page on an already loaded page in Chrome - strongSpinning wheel for 30 seconds/strong/li liClicking in text field on Github in Chrome - strongNothing happens for 34 seconds/strong/li liRefreshing a page in Opera - strongSpinning wheel for 27 seconds/strong/li liOpening Calendar from the dock - strong70 seconds for Calendar to open, no visual feedback/strong/li liClicking to focus open Pages document - strongNothing happens for 21 seconds/strong/li liOpening System Preferences and clicking emKeyboard/em - strongSpinning wheel for 30 seconds/strong/li liClicking on the emFile/em menu in Finder - strongSpinning wheel for 23 seconds/strong/li liSwiping up with three fingers on the trackpad (show Mission Control) - strongNothing happens for 12 seconds/strong/li liMoving cursor down a single line in codevim/code - strongSpinning wheel for 12 seconds/strong/li /ul  I have tried the following:  ul liTurning it off and on again/li liMaking sure everything is up-to-date/li liPerforming a disk repair/li liResetting the SMC/li liResetting the PRAM/li /ul  Is there anything else I can try to fix this?  strongEdit:/strong Unbelievably enough I somehow didn't think to check the logs. Doing so shows the following message occurring regularly. Does this mean that my hard disk is damaged, despite the fact that the disk repair claimed to have fixed any issues?  precodekernel: CoreStorageGroup::completeIORequest - error 0xe00002ca detected for LVG "Macintosh HD" (C9D97BC3-3A2E-405E-BE14-0E9B3FAD7A0D), pv 90103BF0-50B3-455D-947E-A020BC46F680, near LV byte offset = 161931108352. kernel: disk1: I/O error. /code/pre  <answer174918> ol liYou might want to give Onyx a spin: http://www.titanium.free.fr/onyx.html/li liSMC reset: turn off Mac and press ⇧ + Ctrl + ⌥ + Power-Button for 5 seconds/li liPRAM reset: turn off your mac, turn on mac and press ⌘ + ⌥ + P + R.

UPDATE: if your harddrive is broken, make a backup as quickly as possible if you don't already have one. Buy a new harddrive, set it up and exchange.  TechToolPro might be able to help, but that software is just as expensive as a new harddrive if you're not buying an SSD.  <answer199266> Don't waste even a second because your HDD is for sure suffering from a few bad sectors. I had the same problem, after two days of dealing with a very slow Mac, it failed to boot and I had to regenerate bad sectors of HDD using software available on the market. Really time consuming and risky procedure in case your data on HDD is important.  <answer212444> For me I believed the problem was League of Legends XD. Im not exactly sure why but I do remember there was a file called Kernel within the application...But as soon as I deleted the game...boom problem solved and the error was gone. Took me a while to figure out the problem, hopefully I this helped some of you with the same problem.  <comment206076> Please post the specs of your Mac (esp. RAM installed), post Activity Monitor screenshots (CPU/RAM), possibly related log file entries (Console) and check /var/vm <comment206078> Question updated. Can't believe I forgot to look at the logs. <comment206079> The common disk repair doesn't fix damaged blocks nor other hardware related errors (damaged controllers/cables etc.). So check the S.M.A.R.T status - you might have to config/install [smartmontools](http://sourceforge.net/projects/smartmontools/files/smartmontools/6.3/smartmontools-6.3.tar.gz/download). Probably it's at least 1 bad block though. <comment206143> Did you read the question? I've already tried resetting the SMC and PRAM. <comment206146> The smartmontools long test reported a status of `Completed: read failure` so it looks like I do have some bad sectors on the disk. Thanks for your help. <comment206148> You might erase the hdd to map out bad sectors. Better replace it with a new one <comment206233> So did you try Onyx? Or TechToolPro? How's the backup situation? As others pointed out, as long as this potentially damaged HDD is still running, I'd use every second, to secure my data and prepare a replacement. <comment274218> One word: memtest
