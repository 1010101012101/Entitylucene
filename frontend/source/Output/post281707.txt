Deleting files not freeing disk space on boot drive <body> So I have the get info window open to see available remaining disk drive on my MBP int. SSD. says 3.3 GB delete about 10GB of files including the Sierra macOS Install dmg which is 4.9GB on its own and I get about 300 MB of extra disk space after emptying the trash. I even rebooted just incase it needed to do something low level to process the freed up space. Nada.   Question is a) what is cause of the discrepancy between freed space and deleted files and b) how can I get more space when I do delete files, is there an app for that? Command line tools?  OS X Yosemite 10.10.5, 16GB, 500 GB int SSD. 2015 model MBP (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2015).  <comment354502> If you're on 10.12 please flag for reopening. We might need a better answer to use the new disk cleanup tool in macOS. <comment359647> Thanks bmike, this Mac is on 10.10.5
