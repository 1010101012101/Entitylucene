MacBook Pro boots up, but no display on screen <body> I'm trying to troubleshoot this problem. Even booting from Recovery mode shows no display. Is the display shot / cable from logic board?  Thanks!  ~ Sunny  <comment344018> Does the display come on at all during boot up? For example, a grey screen after powering up or any other time? Also, can you please add more details to your question, such as the exact model of MacBook Pro and the version of macOS you're running? <comment344026> This could be a result of a failed logic board if your macbook pro is a certain model. Please add your model to the answer so we can assess if this is the issue.
