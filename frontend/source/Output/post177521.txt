Any ideas?  <comment210015> Wouldn't it be logical for sound to come out of the Cinema Display when connected? <comment210016> Yes Buscar, but if one connects the headphones, this should override it. At least that is how it was up to last week... <comment210041> @pdeli - what's changed with your setup since last week that may have caused this (new hardware, software updates etc.)? Chances are *something's* changed if it all worked as you wanted before last week... <comment211723> @ScunnerDarkly - I found the problem: in System Preferences - Sound - Output, when the headphones are plugged in, Display Audio was selected. I just had to click on Headphones and now, when the headphones are connected, sound switches to them and when unplugged, it reverts to the display speakers. Must've clicked once and did not remember... (I doubt the system switched on its own ;-) )
