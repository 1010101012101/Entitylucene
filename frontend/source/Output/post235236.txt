Can I re-install OS X on an encrypted drive without the password? <body> I don't know my password to my Mac OS X account and it has file encrypt enabled on drive. If I reinstall Mac OS X, will it require a password to do so?   <answer235239> No, you do not need your FileVault password to erase and re-install OS X.  Without your password you will not be able to recover the existing files, but you will be able to completely blank and reinstall OS X on the Mac.  <comment287717> Thanks for the reply. Once I've reinstalled it, will it have some sort of iCloud lock or way of locking me out of doing anything once I'm logged in. Reason I ask is because I'm buying it from a pawn shop.? <comment287718> If the Mac has been erased and re-installed, I do not believe it will but I am not certain.
