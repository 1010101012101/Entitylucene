how to solve iPhone restore failed issue? <body> I sent my old iPhone 6 to Apple store to replace broken screen and the flat battery. Before that, I have backup my iPhone 6 with encryption.  Apple store believes the easiest way is to give me a "new" iPhone straightly.  I took back the "new" iPhone 6 and tried to restore my latest backup. The restore process took nearly half hour. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/A0xd2.png" alt="enter image description here" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DYokw.png" alt="enter image description here" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/OFgZ8.png" alt="enter image description here"  However, at the end of restore progress, the mac pop up error dialog:   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5RhnD.png" alt="enter image description here"  My environment is an iMac with latest Mac OS,  an iPhone 6 with iOS 10.1 the old iPhone 6 is iOS 10.1 also.
