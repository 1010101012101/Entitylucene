Applescript to retrieve account and password using keychain scripting <body> How can I use keychain scripting to write a script in Applescript that retrieves the login  and password of a website from the stronglogin/strong keychain, given the website's URL?   <answer9509> Keychain is exposed to Applescript via the emKeychain Scripting/em application. There are numerous examples on the web, this being the most basic usage:  precodeset theShortUserName to do shell script "/usr/bin/whoami" --get the short userid. This is how your default keychain is labled.  tell application "Keychain Scripting"     set myKeyChain to keychain theShortUserName     set theKeyList to every Internet key of myKeyChain --email keys are normally Internet Keys     repeat with x from 1 to (length of theKeyList)         set theKey to item x of theKeyList         if the name of theKey is "name of key here" then             set thePassword to password of theKey --grab the password             set theUserID to the account of theKey  --grab the userid         end if     end repeat end tell /code/pre  From MacScripter  <answer9517> If you know the emexact name/em of the keychain item, you could use the following:  precodetell application "Keychain Scripting" to tell keychain "login.keychain" to get {account, password} of (first Internet key whose name is "www.google.com") /code/pre  Thing is, Keychain Scripting is emslow/em and quite buggy. For example, searching for a specific keychain item in the example above using codename contains/code instead of codename is/code does not work. You would have to use a repeat statement similar to what @Philip posted:  precodetell application "Keychain Scripting" to tell keychain "login.keychain"      repeat with x from 1 to (count every Internet key)         if name of Internet key x contains "Google" then             return {account, password} of Internet key x         end if      end repeat end tell /code/pre  If you´re okay to use the command line and just want to look up stuff, I´d rather use: codesecurity find-internet-password -g -s www.google.com/code and then grep what you want.  <answer32875> Keychain scripting is pretty well broken in Lion, so the security command-line tool is your best bet. Alternately, use Red Sweater's scripting addition, which is faster and easier to script for than the old Keychain Access scripts.

I only offered the above as an example, but it is dated from 2002, so you're going to have to do some tweaking on your end to make it work in something up-to-date and particular to your needs. <comment9987> +1 for the command line. Those are typically much more streamlined and optimized ways of doing things. It can even be included in an Applescript with `do shell script` <comment9991> Indeed, a users keychain is called login.keychain and not username.keychain (unless changed).
