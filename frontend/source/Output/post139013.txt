Deleting and Resubmitting an App <body> Since iTunesconnect won't let me delete leaderboards and achievements, I am considering deleting my entire app and resubmitting it. My app is free, without IAP, was just recently published, and has only a few users, so I am not too worried about upsetting them. Can I reuse the same title or will I have to use something else? Are there other repercussions that I am not thinking of? Is this the best way to resolve my problem or should I go about this some other way?
