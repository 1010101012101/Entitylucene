Same shortcuts across input sources <body> OS X by default supports emacs key bindings, for example kbdCtrl/kbd+kbdA/kbd to go to the beginning of the line, My problem is when I switch to a different language these kbdCtrl/kbd key bindings stop working.  Is it possible to either modify the keyboard layout to send English letters when the key is pressed with kbdCtrl/kbd. Or add new binding to OS X that accept the kbdCtrl/kbd binding with the correspoding letters in the other input source. Or is there a third choice?  <answer45155> I tried modifying some non-Latin layouts that came with Ukelele, but couldn't get shortcuts like kbdcontrol/kbd+kbdA/kbd to work with them. I haven't found a way to get them to work with my custom keyboard layout either, but I'm probably just missing something...  Another option would be to create ~/Library/KeyBindings/ save a property list like this as DefaultKeyBinding.dict:  precode{     "^ф" = moveToBeginningOfParagraph:; // ctrl-a on the Russian layout     "^щ" = (insertNewlineIgnoringFieldEditor:, moveBackward:); // ctrl-o on the Russian layout     // ... } /code/pre  Some of the default control key actions, copied from lri.me/keybindings:  precode"^p" = moveUp:; "^n" = moveDown:; "^b" = moveBackward:; "^f" = moveForward:; "^h" = deleteBackward:; "^d" = deleteForward:; "^a" = moveToBeginningOfParagraph:; "^e" = moveToEndOfParagraph:; "^k" = deleteToEndOfParagraph:; "^l" = centerSelectionInVisibleArea:; "^v" = pageDown:; "^t" = transpose:; "^y" = yank:; "^o" = (insertNewlineIgnoringFieldEditor:, moveBackward:); "^P" = moveUpAndModifySelection:; "^N" = moveDownAndModifySelection:; "^B" = moveBackwardAndModifySelection:; "^F" = moveForwardAndModifySelection:; "^A" = moveToBeginningOfParagraphAndModifySelection:; "^E" = moveToEndOfParagraphAndModifySelection:; "^V" = pageDownAndModifySelection:; "~^b" = moveWordBackward:; "~^f" = moveWordForward:; "~^B" = moveWordBackwardAndModifySelection:; "~^F" = moveWordForwardAndModifySelection:; /code/pre  <comment51977> Thanks Lri, I guess that is the only option. <comment52387> Sadly it doesn't work, it gives the error sound as if the key combination is invalid, I even made the keybinding with hex characters and it didn't work. Does it work for you? <comment52457> @AmmarAbdulaziz I did get the examples to work with the Russian layout. Have you tried validating the property list with `plutil ~/Library/KeyBindings/DefaultKeyBinding.dict`? <comment52500> Says it's valid.Maybe it'a an issue with Arabic? Because that's the language I'm trying to use. <comment53812> They work! Thanks a lot. <comment196170> Wow, thanks a lot!
