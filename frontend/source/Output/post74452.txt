Does iTunes sync Volume Adjustment and other per song settings? <body> Does iTunes sync per song settings like Volume Adjustment, EQ, and Start-Stop times?  <answer99857> Start and stop times do sync, as well as volume adjustments.  EQ settings sync as well. However, they only work under the following conditions:  ul liYou used a preset in iTunes (not custom EQ settings); and/li liYou have EQ disabled on the phone./li /ul  As backwards as that second one sounds, if you EQ enabled on the phone, it uses that EQ setting and overrides the per-song EQ settings. If you have EQ disabled on the phone, it uses the per-song EQ settings.  <comment86467> iTunes Sync to my iPod Shuffle: 1) Start-Stop times: YES, 2) Volume Adjustment: Don't know, 3) EQ: NO.
