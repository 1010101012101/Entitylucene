PackageMaker problem <body> I'm trying to include a KEXT in an installer package (via PackageMaker 3.0.6(201) ) but I cannot get past following error:     Could not rename "Payload"   There is pretty much NO INFO on this when Googling. Help ???  <answer218869> PackageMaker is unsupported by Apple and would not of been updated to work on newer versions of OS X, most likely the cause of your problem.   The answer to PackageMaker alternative? seems to provide an alternative codepkgbuild/code.  <comment264832> Thanks Stan. Sigh... :) Packages seems to break on El Capitan, as I get very strange behaviour of the [installation](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/218678/peculiar-behaviour-with-mac-os-x-application-on-el-capitan), so I guess I'm left with pkgbuild + productbuild. Ok. Some studying to do then.
