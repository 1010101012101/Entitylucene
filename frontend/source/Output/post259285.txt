Don't remember security questions and it won't let me reset them <body> I've been locked out of my iPhone. However I don't remember my security question answers and don't have a backup email . And when I tried to reset my questions and said there was not enough information to do so. My iPhone is the only phone that my family has and I need this fixed as soon as possible please help!  <comment324358> 1. Call Apple. They may be able to assist you. We cannot. 2. If you do manage to recover your account, set a backup email, use security answers _that you know_ (don't just make stuff up) and use real information for things like your birthdate.
