Why does a click on a website zooms in on a part of the page? <body> I'm not sure this is even a Mac issue, but when using Gmail on Chrome with OSX, clicking on certain parts of the page makes them zoom in.  It's a little hard to explain, so here's a vid:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_5BAXCWDEI  I'm clicking once on the new message popup for each zoom you see.  What's doing that? How can I make it stop?  Is it even Mac related?  <comment165390> Have you checked the settings in System Preferences  Accessibility  Zoom? <comment165415> Does this occur just with Gmail's text box? Does it occur if you maximise the compose 'window'? <comment165489> @IconDaemon: didn't know about that, but zoom is off. <comment165490> @GeorgeGarside: It does occur with the compose window maximized. I think I saw it happen in other places, but I can't find anything else. Maybe it's a Gmail/Chrome issue. I'll look.
