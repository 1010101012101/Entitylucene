Mountain Lion ssh -X problems <body> How to run on Mountain Lion X11 forwarding via SSH?  Example:  precodessh -X some@example.com xterm /code/pre  my /etc/sshd_config has  precodeX11Forwarding yes #X11DisplayOffset 10 X11UseLocalhost yes  # XAuthLocation added by XQuartz (http://xquartz.macosforge.org) XAuthLocation /opt/X11/bin/xauth /code/pre  Restarted sshd with  precodelaunchctl stop com.openssh.sshd launchctl start com.openssh.sshd /code/pre  (and from the Preferences - Sharing too)  Started XQuatrz, and from the xterm I run  precodessh -v -X mrp@192.168.1.17 xterm        #this part not works :) /code/pre  got the next:  precodedebug1: Authentication succeeded (keyboard-interactive). Authenticated to 192.168.1.17 ([192.168.1.17]:22). debug1: channel 0: new [client-session] debug1: Requesting no-more-sessions@openssh.com debug1: Entering interactive session. debug1: Requesting X11 forwarding with authentication spoofing. debug1: Sending command: xterm debug1: Remote: No xauth program; cannot forward with spoofing. X11 forwarding request failed on channel 0 xterm: Xt error: Can't open display:  xterm: DISPLAY is not set debug1: client_input_channel_req: channel 0 rtype exit-status reply 0 debug1: client_input_channel_req: channel 0 rtype eow@openssh.com reply 0 debug1: channel 0: free: client-session, nchannels 1 Transferred: sent 2656, received 2480 bytes, in 0.1 seconds Bytes per second: sent 29582.4, received 27622.1 debug1: Exit status 1 /code/pre  from the xterm  precode$ echo $DISPLAY /tmp/launch-BHtJfJ/org.macosforge.xquartz:0 /code/pre  changing it to code:0/code doesn't helps  running from the xterm  precode$ xauth list jonatan.local/unix:0  MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1  f4f85682af36ae7d95cd3d244cb6beb2 192.168.1.9:0  MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1  f4f85682af36ae7d95cd3d244cb6beb2 jonatan.local:0  MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1  f4f85682af36ae7d95cd3d244cb6beb2 /code/pre  Any idea?  <answer92225> Not sure how this could happen, but from the SSH source where the error message comes:  precode/* Try to open a socket for the local X server. */ display = getenv("DISPLAY"); if (!display) {     error("DISPLAY not set.");     return -1; } /code/pre  It indicates that indeed ssh thinks the variable is not set at all (i.e. not malformed or something, but missing).    I'm not sure if SSH does change the user context so it gets a different environment.  You can try   precodessh -vvv .... /code/pre  (multiple "v") to get more debug output, maybe this gives a hint somewhere in startup.  <answer105551> You need to open XQuartz, go to strongX11/strong → strongPreferences/strong → strongSecurity/strong, there are two check boxes: disable the first, enable the second. Restart XQuartz and try again. You will also need to define the code$DISPLAY/code variable like this:  precodeexport DISPLAY=clienthost:0.0 /code/pre  <comment108229> Could you clarify what part isn't working for you? <comment108238> @demure My english is not enough good, i was in hope than the error meesage is enough clear. But ok, added an comment to the question, to show exactly what not works. Or more precise, not works the X-protocol tunneling via ssh for some strange reason. Maybe xauth. Thank you for interest. :) <comment108239> wow - good idea the multiple vvv - going to check. Thanx :) <comment108343> ok, hope it helps <comment124115> Meantime i discovered the problem was in the another side - not in my OS X. ; Thank you anyway +1. <comment191678> @jm666, Andreu I have the same problem and this solution didnt work for me, #jm66 could you share your experience in solving this problem. <comment314111> What is `clienthost`?
