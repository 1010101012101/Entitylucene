How often does mail try and send outgoing if `Automatically try sending later` is selected in mail preferences <body> If i set the strong'If outgoing server is unavailable :"Automatically try sending later'/strong option in Mail  Preferences  General. (as per the image below)  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/aQQKI.png" alt="screenshot of mail preferences panel"  How often does mail try and automatically send the message, also how many times will it try before stop trying and when it stops trying will it give me an alert so that i can manually try another server ?
