How to can I stop iTunes from asking whether to "check for an update to the carrier settings for your iPad" <body> How do I stop iTunes from asking me this question every time it's launched?     iTunes needs to check for an update to the carrier settings for your   iPad   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dNNo7.png" alt="iTunes needs to check for an update to the carrier settings for your iPad"  <comment374210> I have the same question but it's for the iphone 6s (iOS 10). **Every** single time I plug in the usb cable connecting to the Mac Mini (OS X 10.5.5, iTunes 12.6.2.20) I get this ridiculous error. Help!
