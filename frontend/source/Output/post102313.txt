Can't connect to App store post MacOSX10.8.5 update <body> I am unable to connect to the App Store after updating my macbook to OSX 10.8.5. Following is the message I get,  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/t68TX.png" alt="enter image description here"  Nothing happens even if I click strongContinue/strong button.   Is this a bug in OSX 10.8.5 update? Is anyone else facing this issue?  <comment120487> Open keychain, find App Store, check that the connection says (https) <comment120490> @Buscarì›ƒ Keychain does not contain anything by the name App Store.
