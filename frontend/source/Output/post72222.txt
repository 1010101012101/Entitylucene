Automatically move files into correct folder on server <body> I often need to move files from one location on a server into a set of hierarchical folders.   The filenames are usually 7 digits long - sometimes with some extra characters at the end.   The folders are set up as nested sets for each digit - 3 deep. So, a file named '6753687a.eps' for example would need be filed in the '675' folder, which is in the '67' folder, which is in the '6' folder, which is in the 'Images' folder at the root of the volume. There is no '6753' folder.   Ideally, I'd like to be able to drop groups of files into a folder or a droplet or something, and have the files automatically moved into their correct folders.   Does anyone know of a way to do this?  <answer72249> I assume that on the source locations all files are in one directory. Open Terminal, change to this directory and run  precodefor i in *; do     target="PATH/TO/Images/${i:0:1}/${i:0:2}/${i:0:3}"     mkdir -p "$target"     mv -v "$i" "$target"/ done /code/pre  PS: This will probably fail if one of files in question has a name which is shorter than 3 characters.  <answer72250> h1Automator Droplet/h1  You can do this with an Automator workflow and a script (I'm using Python, but it could be done with Bash, Applescript or anything else really).  ol liOpen up Automator, and choose strongApplication/strong type./li liAdd a strongRun Shell Script/strong action to the workflow./li liIn the emRun Shell Script/em action, set the emShell/em option to strongcode/usr/bin/python/code/strong, and emPass input:/em to strongas arguments/strong./li liSet the script text to the script as shown below.

If the proper folders don't exist already, they will be created.  <comment83851> Should be possible with an apple script as a folder action. I'll see if I can whip something up later if no one else beats me to it.
