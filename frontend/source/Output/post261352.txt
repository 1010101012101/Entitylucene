stuck on 'loading' Tumblr in my app store <body> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KKeLu.png" width="240"   I tried to download Tumblr and it got stuck on the 'loading' part in the app store and I've tried everything I can think blr  <answer261372> Firstly, have you tried restarting?   If so, you can delete the app while it is downloading and then re-download it from the store. To do this:  Settings  General  Storage &amp; iCloud Usage  Manage Storage  Tumblr  Delete App  I would advise a restart before trying to re-download the app.
