Imported CD into iTunes not showing up on match devices <body> I have imported a CD into my iTunes library on my iMac.  The import worked fine and all songs and art show up in the iTunes library on my iMac.  However, on my iPhone 5s and iPad 4 using music match, the new album does not show up.    On the iPad, I tried turning off match and turning it back on, but no different result.   I did a full sync and backup with my iMac with no different result.  I also updated IOS, no difference.  I logged off iTunes and logged back on, but no different result.  Is there a way to check to ensure the imported CD is being synced with my online (match) account?  Any other advice?  <comment210547> Have you actually attempted to *update iTunes Match* ? In iTunes, choose **Store  Update iTunes Match.**
