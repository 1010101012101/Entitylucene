Keep ethernet connection live during screen sleep <body> I have a MacBookPro running OS X 10.8.5.  My understanding is kbdControl ⌃/kbd+kbdShift ⇧/kbd+kbdEject ⏏/kbd puts the Mac into a sleep mode. This is fine but what I want to know if there is a way to keep the ethernet port active while in this mode?  When I come out of this mode, I notice I am signed out of my messaging, disconnected from VM's I have running, etc... The connection comes back right away but I want to prevent the connection disruption.  I was also looking at this answer to "Equivalent of Win-L on Mac" which I really like as well. But again, it turns off the ethernet which I don't want to happen.  <answer136360> kbdControl/kbd+kbdShift/kbd+kbdPower/kbd …or… kbdControl/kbd+kbdShift/kbd+kbdEject/kbd turns off the monitor without putting the computer in sleep mode.  <answer136361> This is what I do in case of long downloads.  The screen will go to sleep in time set (or when asked)- (5 minutes in my case)  Disable the Put disk to sleep when possible, and set the slider to the right.  Type this in Terminal to keep the connection active  precodeping -i 60 google.es /code/pre  This will keep the connection alive.  the 60 is seconds, you do not need more pings then 1 per minute.  the Google.com or Google.es is irrelevant (you chose yours)  Just hit Restore Defaluts after you do not longer need those settings.  To stop terminal Ping hit ctrl-c  <answer137124> You should check out this software called strongNo Sleep/strong. What is does is it keeps your computer awake even if the lid is closed. This is extremely useful if this is what you're looking for.   <answer198466> This happens on my iMac running OS X 10.10 So think it's a long standing bug. VLC will keep playing but Google hangouts will drop my call.  <comment161737> A connection requires data to be transmitted to keep it open - thus the OSX computer has to be not asleep to do the processing <comment161738> I'm using two different energy saving settings myself: one for running on power supply and one for running on battery. The one running on power supply is set to put screen to rest after a time but hard drives to never go to sleep. I also have the option to put disks to sleep whenever deselected. To add the password lock you go into privacy and activate passcode requirements for sleep/screen saver. <comment161740> @Mark Isn't Ctrl-Shift-Eject supposed to only put the display to sleep? The programs etc... are supposed to keep running in the background. Or maybe I misunderstood that. <comment161741> I understand sleep to mean sleeping the computer and did not consider referring to just the screen. - Given that understanding this is a duplicate <comment161742> possible duplicate of [Locking my machine causes my network Connection to sleep](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/41379/locking-my-machine-causes-my-network-connection-to-sleep) <comment161752> The Point-to-Point protocol (PPP) is a method used when communicating data between computers via dial-up modem connections.!!? and you do not have a dial up modem do you ? <comment162030> @Buscar웃 Correct, I do not have a dial up modem. <comment195141> Wouldn't `caffeinate` or `pmset noidle` from the terminal do the same thing? <comment213957> Out of curiosity, can you just do `ping -i 60 127.0.0.1` instead? Does the address you're pinging every minute have to actually be an external source? <comment213977> it comes with Request timeout for icmp_seq 0
