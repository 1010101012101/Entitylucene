How can I remove Emoji keyboard from iOS8? <body> I updated my iPad to iOS8, and the Emoji keyboard suddenly appears although I have never set for it. How can I remove that? When I go to Settings:General:Keyboards, I see that Emoji is among the keyboards set, but I can't find a way to remove it.  <answer146217> Settings--- General --- keyboard----- Keyboards--- You'll see ENGLISH and EMOJI.  On the top right corner is the word EDIT.  Press EDIT, and then swipe delete to remove the EMOJI keyboard.  <comment171963> Don't you see an Edit button on the list of keyboards? <comment171964> @Tomg That was it. I missed it. Thanks. <comment171965> @Tomg make that a answer, with few more words or screen shot please. <comment172112> Most annoying thing ever for emoticon haters now resolved - thanks @torng <comment172138> I don't particularly hate them. I hate the fact that they are added silently by default. <comment238214> Especially annoying when you need to switch between languages. (e.g. German-English, ends up as German-EMOJI-English)
