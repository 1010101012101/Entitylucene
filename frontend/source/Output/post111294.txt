Cannot create a file with sudo in Apache web directory <body> Suddenly the following problem has happened:br I have an Apache web directory at /www. Everything was ok with the permissions, but at some point (I can't realize what caused it), I become unable to create any new files in this directory.  I have tried two methods:  ol liSaving a new file from Sublime/li lirunning codesudo echo "" &gt; newfile/code./li /ol  But both methods failed. On the other hand I am able to create new files in my home directory (using both mentioned ways) and then to copy or move them to /www. What may be the issue and how to solve it?  <answer111336> codesudo echo "" &gt; newfile/code should never have worked, because sudo only applies to the echo command and not to the redirection. Try using codesudo touch newfile/code or codeecho "" | sudo tee newfile/code.  Sublime Text doesn't seem to support creating new files to a directory you don't have write permission to. It does support authenticating as root when modifying an existing file though. See http://sublimetext.userecho.com/topic/27820-prompt-if-need-elevated-permission-to-save/.  Maybe you did have write permission to the directory earlier but something (like upgrading to 10.9) removed it.  <comment130975> What does `ls -l /` show for www ? <comment130978> Does the `sudo echo` thing fail silently or return an error code/message? <comment130982> `ls -l /` for www returns:   drwxr-xr-x   8 root  wheel      272 19 Nov 23:58 www      `sudo echo ""  newfile` returns:   -bash: newfile: Permission denied <comment130985> does newfile exist already? Can you do the full path sudo echo ""  /www/newfile <comment130991> newfile doesn't exist (I am just new to Mac, but in general I know what I am doing). Running with the full path has the same effect. BTW `sudo mkdir newdir` does work.
