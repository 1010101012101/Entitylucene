Get files from a .inProgress file <body> I backed up my Mac (or tried to) using time machine a few days ago in preparation for having some repairs done on my Mac. Evidently, the backup did not finish because it is listed as a .inProgress file. However, it is mostly complete is seems.   I can look at the contents by right clicking and doing "Show Package Contents." In there are three folder that I think are different backups. One of the folders I think is the incomplete backup I did. If I open it, there is a single file inside: "Macintosh HD." But, it's greyed out.   Is there any way I can make it so I can look in this folder and see whatever data, complete or incomplete, I was able to save?
