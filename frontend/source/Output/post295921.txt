I found a security hole in one of the sites I've visited? <body> I found a pretty big hole in the security of a webpage that allows me to basically do what ever I please. I can get other users on the site to do more the less anything i want them to do.   The question is; should i tell the system admins and risk of getting sued since I've tested it. Or should I leave the site, and not tell anyone?  <comment373725> I'm voting to close this question as off-topic because this question has nothing to do with Apple hardware or software. <comment373743> Welcome to Ask Different! :) Although this question has been closed as off-topic here, it may be okay at the [Information Security](https://security.stackexchange.com/questions) site. I can migrate it for you, but as it's currently written it's very subjective (i.e. it's basically an opinion-based question where every answer is equally valid), and I suspect it would be closed as off-topic there unless it's rewritten. Let me know if you'd like me to migrate it anyway? As an aside, if you own/use Apple hardware and/or software, please feel free to make use of this site. We're here to help! :) <comment373805> Beautiful reply @Monomeeth
