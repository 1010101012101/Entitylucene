Bluetooth headset: why do I have to either re-pair every time <body> I'm using a "Energy BT Sport" headset. Pairing is pretty easy.  Obviously I'm not always using the headset, I'm frequently switching between headset and speakers depending the circumstance I'm in.  The problem is that everytime I want to use the headset, I turn it on and my MBP automatically connects back to it, but audio doesn't output anywhere. The whole sound system seems to have problems because in that period the sound keys are not very responsive and if I'm watching a video (whether youtube or VLC) it freezes a bit.  So strongeverytime/strong I want to put back my BT headset I have to choose between:  strongA./strong Remove the device from BT settings and pair again. An incredible waste of time and very frustrating.  or  strongB./strong Tell MBP to strongdisconnect/strong and after an important lag it disconnects and then snap connects back and I have to click strongdisconnect/strong for the second time (it always works like this) and then after the lag it disconnects and then I can strongmanually click connect/strong and that's when it works.  Is anyone else having the same issue? Any fix?  <comment170945> Does it save the BT profile for the headset <comment170975> What... ? I don't understand <comment170976> In your sys preferences, Bluetooth, is the profile for the headset saved but showing not active? Second question: When you activate the headset what does it shows in the sys pref Sound- output ? <comment170993> This is what it's shown now that I'm using them: http://i.imgur.com/uKEIKml.png And the output is the BT headset <comment171005> next time press and hold the volume button on the headset.
