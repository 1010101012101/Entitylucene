Search in a particular folder and subfolder through Spotlight <body> As the titles indicates, I would like to search a file in a particular folder, and its subfolders, through Spotlight. Is it possible to do that in Spotlight? If so, how can that be done?  <answer113196> Short answer: No, you can not.  Spotlight is designed to be the "central search hub" of your Mac. So whenever you type in something, it will search strongeverything/strong (except "blacklisted" folders and file types that you can set within System Preferences as well as any data from all other user accounts and connected servers unless your account has permission to view them) on your Mac internal storage as well as any additional connected media storage devices.  If you want to search into a specific folder and its subfolders, you will need to go into the specific folder in Finder, use the search bar on the top-right corner of the window, and select the name of the folder on the same bar where it has the button "This Mac". In my example, it's "Developer".  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9gaXm.png" alt="enter image description here" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Wgxc4.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer263370> http://osxdaily.com/2013/03/12/change-finder-search-to-look-in-current-folder-rather-than-everywhere-in-mac-os-x/  From anywhere in the Finder, pull down the Finder menu and choose “Preference” Click on the “Advanced” tab and pull down the menu under “When performing a search:”, selecting from the pulldown menu “Search the Current Folder” instead  <comment132856> Thank you for your explanation.
