Cannot boot to OS X using rEFInd <body> I have installed rEFInd 0.8.7 on my 2015 13" MBP onto another partition however it does not detect OS X.  Here are my disk partitions:  pre /dev/disk0    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *251.0 GB   disk0    1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1    2:                  Apple_HFS Macintosh HD            234.6 GB   disk0s2    3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s6    4:       Microsoft Basic Data Linux                   15.1 GB    disk0s4    5:                  Apple_HFS rEFInd                  423.7 MB   disk0s5 /pre  codedisk0s4/code is where I would like to install Linux when I get rEFInd to work, while codedisk0s5/code is where I have rEFInd installed to by using the command codesudo ./install.sh --alldrivers --ownhfs /dev/disk0s5/code.  The issue I am getting is when I boot up it does not show Yosemite 10.3 (I only have accsess to the buttons at the bottom). To boot to OS X I have to reboot and hold the kbdoption/kbd key and select codeMacintosh HD/code.  How would I get rEFInd to detect OS X?  <answer188651> Edit this file:  /Volumes/rEFInd/System/Library/CoreServices/refind.conf  Add the following text to the end of the above file.  precodescanfor manual,internal,hdbios,external,biosexternal,optical,cd dont_scan_dirs /System/Library/CoreServices menuentry "Mac OS X" {     icon \System\Library\CoreServices\icons\os_mac.png     volume "Macintosh HD"     loader \System\Library\CoreServices\boot.efi     graphics on } /code/pre
