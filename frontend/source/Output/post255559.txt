iCloud Photo Library: store photos in cloud only <body> How can I store photos from all my apple devices in the iCloud only, without taking a space e.g. on macbook's drive?  Currently, they've been also downloaded locally, and the storage is being "optimized" only when the system needs space. I want to store photos in the cloud only.   <comment318376> Optimize storage is the closest you're able to come without removing the Photos library from your computer entirely.
