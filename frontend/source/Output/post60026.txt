Is there a way to view iTunes Store purchase history on a regular internet browser? <body> Is there a way to view iTunes Store purchases without using iTunes? My bank account shows several music purchases I'm not aware of and I would like to verify them but currently don't have access to my main computer.  <answer229344> no you can't but you can you report a problem to list your purchases  https://reportaproblem.apple.com  <comment69090> Are you talking about music or apps? <comment69091> Music because it says on my bank account. <comment69092> Also, i dont have access to itunes here at work. <comment69098> Do you have an iPhone? You can see all purchased music from the `Purchased` tab. However, it's not very helpful, as there's no obvious way to sort by date, which is probably what you're looking for.
