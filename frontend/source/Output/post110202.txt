From command line open package installer <body> From the command line is it possible to open a package installer window (not install the application).  I understand I could run the application using codesudo installer -pkg ..... -target ....../code. Instead i would like to open the package in a similar way to if I double clicked the package within the Finder.  <answer110204> You can just use the open command:  precodeopen package.pkg /code/pre  <comment129838> Do you mean like entering open: /path/to/installer.pkg <comment129840> Yes, thats exactly what i mean, cannot believe i missed it. Was expecting it to be a param of `installer`.
