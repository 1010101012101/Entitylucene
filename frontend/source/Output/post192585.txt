Focusing On An Input Box Quickly Will Delete The First Two Characters Typed! <body> If I focus on a user-input box, select what's in it, press delete, and start typing, the first two characters I type will get selected and deleted.  Let's say this is an input box:     Input Content   I put my cursor there:     Input Content |   I select:     |codeInput Content/code   I delete:     |   I type:     codea/code|      codeb/code|      c |      cd |      cde |   When I type in an input box that I have selected in, the first two characters are selected and deleted.  <answer192598> Surprisingly, I figured out the answer by myself.  Input boxes in web forms tend to lag a little, and so does my selection. If I select all the text in the input box, dragging my cursor from the end to the beginning, the selected area will lag behind half a second.  That lag is what causes the problem. When I start typing afterwards, the selection is still active, causing it to replace one or two characters if I type too fast.  <comment229202> Is this universal in your system, or particular to a certain application?  If universal, you may notice in the Keyboard settings under replace text certain combinations are causing the issue.  Just a little more info regarding the applications it occurs in or other circumstances would help in offering a solution.  Cheers! <comment229203> Universal to system. <comment229205> One more question, do you have a 3rd party auto-enter application like **Text Expander** installed? <comment229206> No, never heard of that. <comment229211> I have seen this bug too. It's too rare for me to figure out its cause though... <comment229219> Not clear to me, what Input box, does it happen in plain TextEdit, or in Notes, or only in predefined boxes <comment229223> I mean input boxes like in online forms and such. <comment229224> Thank you, you know those boxes are preset how much you can type in them. Is it Adobe form or web based (Java). Also I guess the "Input content" is grayed out. <comment229225> No it's just that selecting a text box on Mac will make the following 2 characters I type after that get selected as well. <comment229226> I have not encountered that, on Firefox or Chrome, I do not use Safari.
