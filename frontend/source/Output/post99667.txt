iPad language glitch <body> How do I switch to Australian Store on my iPad, it appears to have gone to the French store and is telling me I can't update unless I switch to Australian store, I don't know what to do as I have checked in settings etc.  <answer99669> Go to codeSettings -&gt; iTunes &amp; App Store -&gt; [your Apple ID] -&gt; View Apple ID/code.  Change the codeCountry/Region/code (below codePayment Information/code).  Select your region, agree to terms, and you're done.
