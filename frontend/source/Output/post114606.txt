How to fix my jailbroken iPhone 3G that won't connect to Wi-Fi and shows one bar of network? <body> My sister gave her iPhone 3G to me and I tried to reset everything but it's frozen on the Apple logo. Then I understood I must not reset a jailbroken iPhone. I Googled about it and I found information that I must restore then jailbreak it.  I attempted to restore iOS 4.2.1, but ended up with error 1015. I used Redsn0w 0.9.15b3 to jailbreak (Cydia: home screen wallpaper and battery percentage) baseband was 5.15.04 (I'm under unofficial carrier).  After this, I found these problems:  ul liWi-Fi turns on and showed my home network, but it disappeared right after I typed the password and tapped the join button. After that it can't show any networks — tried to connect by going through Other… and typing the network name &amp; password of network but no luck./li liNetwork remains at one bar (Googled about it then I understood I have to install UltraSn0w to fix)./li /ul  My mom is using an iPhone 3G fully functional running on iOS 4.1 with baseband 6.15.00.  Then I restored with iOS 4.1 and jailbroken. Managed to upgrade my baseband to 6.15.00 with Redsn0w now it's running on iOS 4.1 but still can't show Wi-Fi, and 1 network bar. (Googled my problem, installed UltraSn0w by the manual way: used iFunBox to show all file folders and copied UltraSn0w files into Cydia's auto install folder, no network).  Tried a few times to restore it, but still fails.  supiOS 4.1 (8B117)br Model: MB046LLbr Serial: 5K009B84Y7Hbr Modem Firmware (baseband I think): 06.15.00br Jailbroken with Cydia installed/sup  <comment134297> Welcome to Ask Different!
