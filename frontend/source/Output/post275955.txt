Bash script for /etc/crontab <body> I want to run after every reboot, with no user logged  precodekextunload /System/Library/Extensions/AppleHDA.kext /code/pre  I tried to do a bash script here :  precode#!/bin/sh PATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:~/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin  kextunload /System/Library/Extensions/AppleHDA.kext echo "Internal Speaker disabled" /code/pre  however trying the bash script in terminal give me this result "command not found"  What do I do wrong if not everything.  PS : when resolved, do I just leave my script in "/etc/crontab" (so he can be run every time at boot) or do I still have to do env EDITOR=nano crontab -e and add the job  <answer275958> The script errors because you have split the command in two lines. Basically you want to remove the newlines between the PATH and the kextunload lines, so it looks like this:  precode#!/bin/sh PATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:~/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin kextunload /System/Library/Extensions/AppleHDA.kext echo "Internal Speaker disabled" /code/pre  But you could also just simplify all that down to a single line you can put in crontab:  precode/sbin/kextunload /System/Library/Extensions/AppleHDA.kext /code/pre  When you add the cronjob with codecrontab -e/code then add it like this to get it run at every boot:  precode@reboot /sbin/kextunload /System/Library/Extensions/AppleHDA.kext /code/pre  <comment347235> that's perfect thank you very much.
