iOS 10 icloud calendars not showing up (gone after upgrade) <body> After upgrading my iPhone 5 from iOS 9 directly to iOS 10.0.1, all my icloud calendars are gone.  They don't show up in the codecalendars/code list in the Calendar app, and dragging said list down to force syncing of the calendars doesn't even show the usual spinning loading bar indicator â€“ the whole iCloud section is just missing from the list. Rebooting didn't fix the issue.  <answer253368> The following finally fixed the issue for me:  ol liSign out of iCloud (Settings - iCloud - Sign Out)/li lichoosing "delete all iCloud data from iPhone"/li lisign in again/li liwait a couple of minutes/li /ol  <answer255245> If you are missing past events, try this: go to SettingsCalendarSync. After an iOS upgrade, it defaulted to Events 2 weeks Back, which is why you may not see other older events. You can change it to 1, 3, 6 months back, or All Events. That restored my missing older events.  <comment321956> No dice for me - had no effect.
