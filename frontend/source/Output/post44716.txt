OS X 10.7 add multiple windows workgroups <body> I have multiple Windows Workgroups on my network, Does 10.7 have the ability to add more than one Workgroup at a time?  I open up System Preferences - Network - Advanced - WINS (Tab) - Workgroup  I select/toggle between the Workgroups I need but wanted to add multiple workgroups.  Any thoughts?  <answer44749> Even on Windows you can only set the computer to one workgroup, so setting multiple on Mac isn't going to be possible.  <comment50896> In Ubuntu I can, going from Ubuntu to OSX <comment50897> Support for MS/Windows networking features on Mac is minimal at best. Whereas Ubuntu is made by people who are much more concerned about it working with other systems. <comment56541> Ubuntu uses Samba, so if it's capable of what you ask why not just install that and set it up like on your Ubuntu machine ?
