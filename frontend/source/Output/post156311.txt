Not all pictures appear in apps <body> Ever since I enabled iCloud Photo Library, only my most recent photos have been appearing in apps. For example, if I go to upload a picture to Twitter, only the last 70 out of 300 pictures are shown. This holds true for other apps like Instagram and Dropbox, but the numbers do vary slightly (anywhere from 70 go 66 photos).  When I change my profile picture on Instagram, I have access to Momements, which includes all the photos, but not when uploading a picture to post.  Is there an issue with my iPhone, or is this a bug?  <answer156695> I believe that imported pictures aren't displayed in the "strongMedia Inspector/strong"  "strongPhotos/strong" tab  "strongiCloud/strong "sidebar item…  In "strongiPhoto.app/strong"  "strongPreferences/strong" kbdcmd/kbd kbd,/kbd check if in the "strongiCloud/strong" tab the followings are ticked :  ul li"strongMy Photo Stream/strong"/li li"strongAutomatic Import/strong"/li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DICNB.png" alt="&quot;iPhoto.app&quot; &gt; &quot;iPhoto&quot; menu &gt; &quot;Preferences&quot; &gt; &quot;iCloud&quot; tab"  If so you might consider creating a "strongSmart Album/strong" kbdcmd/kbd kbdalt ⌥/kbd kbdN/kbd For example "strongiCloud Stream/strong" that will match "strongall/strong" the following conditions :  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yjmep.png" alt="&quot;iPhoto.app&quot; &gt; &quot;File&quot; menu &gt; &quot;New Smart Album …&quot; item"  ul li"strongKeyword/strong"  "strongis/strong"  "strongPhoto Stream/strong" ;/li /ul  emget last month (as for iCloud)/em  ul li"strongDate/strong"  "strongis in the last/strong"  "strong1/strong"  "strongMonths/strong" ;/li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/UtM74.png" alt="Creating a &quot;Smart Album&quot; with name &quot;iCloud Stream&quot; meeting &quot;all&quot; the following conditions date is in &quot;the last 1 month&quot; and keyword is &quot;Photo Stream&quot;"  In a "strongMedia Inspector/strong" you may know select your newly created smart album "strongiCloud Stream/strong" : img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0118W.png" alt="&quot;Media Inspector&quot; &gt; &quot;Photos&quot; tab &gt; &quot;iCloud Stream&quot; smart album"   <answer247180> I have a number of apps that allow me to share photos. Some of them, like StacksExchange, start out with allowing me chose which album I want to upload from. Others, like Tumblr and Line default to the Camera Roll, but provide a dropdown menu, accessible by tapping the word Camera Roll. Dropbox allows me that same option:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZvYWr.jpg" alt="enter image description here" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rI8Dw.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  I do not use Twitter; but I would suggest tapping on the word 'Camera Roll' and seeing if that allows you access to you album and Photo Stream.   <comment184289> Sorry, I forgot to include that this was on an iPhone. <comment184303> With iDevices : It seems the only way is to Share the pictures outside the Photo Stream, how ever I now see in my "Photos & Camera" setting "iCloud Photo Library (Beta)" which should radically solve your issue. <comment185164> Right, but that's a feature I'd like to use.
