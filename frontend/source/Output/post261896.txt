System Data Usage - iOS v10.0.2 AT&T <body> iTunes Accounts in System Services is draining over 3.5 GB of data per cycle (Settings--Cellular--System Services--iTunes Accounts). I monitored it closely during this data cycle.  I have disabled Settings--iTunes and App Stores--Use Cellular Data. I have also disabled Settings--Cellular--Wi-Fi Assist. Does anyone know how I can determine what is causing this?  I have a large data plan and I'm upset, I can't imagine how people with smaller data plans survive at all.  <comment328012> Possible duplicate of [iOS data usage specifics - iTunes Accounts](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/180859/ios-data-usage-specifics-itunes-accounts) <comment328020> Thank you For your reply Jaime.I have 'Use Cellular Data' turned off and the answer does not address my issue. What is posting protocol? Do I leave my thread or piggy back the one you linked? Thanks! <comment328021> If your question differs from the one I marked as possible duplicate, explain the difference by editing your question so it doesn't get closed. <comment328023> Thanks Jaime, I edited my post to reflect I have disabled Use Cellular Data. The question is still similar but the answer must be different (I am not sure if I could have reopened your linked thread, I looked and didn't see a way to do so; all I could find is Add Answer option). <comment328026> Stack Exchange works differently from most forums: you ask a question, and people answer that specific question. Subsequent questions must be asked separately. If you ask a question that has been asked before, it may get marked as duplicate. <comment328027> I don't see an option to disable Cellular Data for System services, could you explain _in your question_ where did you disable it? <comment328030> I see, you disabled it on the iTunes & App Store settings, right? Please explain that in your question if that is the case. <comment328473> Thanks Jaime, I think it's good now. Hopefully someone knows what is causing this.
