I can no longer see the url from where I have downloaded a file in Get Info, can I get that back? <body> I always used to use Get Info to see the URL where I've downloaded a file. Image, PDF, data. Now I can't see this field anymore in any of my recent downloads. I don't see it for old files or new.  strongupdate:/strong based on the comment, I went back and looked more carefully. In the Title and Headline lines I only see the file name and extension repeated in each place.  Did I loose this information when I deleted the indexing? Or is the display just turned off temporarily?

Something like name.pdf, name.dat, or name.png. I've added a screenshot as an example, but spot checks show the same each time, except occasionally one of the subfields is missing (e.g. Headline). Also, I use the Chrome browser, a quick check in Safari shows same behavior. <comment355507> In Terminal, type the following command, followed by a space, `xattr -l ` and then drag & drop the image onto the Terminal window. This populates the fully qualified pathname of the file. Now press `enter`. What output do you see? Do you see a `com.apple.metadata:kMDItemWhereFroms:` output? <comment355691> @user3439894 It seems the correct url is displayed there (see update). I wonder if this means that I can find a way to get "show info" to start showing the links again? <comment355692> I'd start by rebuilding the Spotlight index on your Mac. <comment355714> I have a hunch this might work. I'll report back when I get an opportunity in a few days to try it. Thanks for your help!
