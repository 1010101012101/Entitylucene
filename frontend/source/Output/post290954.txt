Get/Set precise coordinates of a point in a path in Keynote? <body> I am drawing a path in a Keynote canvas (using the tool under Shapes). I need fine control of the coordinates of the points in this path. Is there a way to get/set the exact coordinates of points within paths?  <comment367296> Is this as easy as firing up [xScope](http://xscopeapp.com) and measuring the screen? Perhaps adding an image to your post and details of what OS is in play might help us help you. <comment367299> @bmike, no, I meant to set precisely the coordinates inside the canvas of keynote. For example, I want to put two points precisely aligned, from different lines drawn inside keynote. <comment367302> Oh - so you're more looking for help with guides, rulers and alignment tools on iOS keynote or Mac keynote ? <comment367310> @bmike Yes. Specifically, how to set the coordinates of a point belonging to a path (drawn with the tool under Shapes), in Keynote for Mac. <comment367339> Please edit your question adding that information. Then you will be more likely to get answers. Cheers
