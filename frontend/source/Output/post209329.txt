Output device gone after upgrading to El Capitan <body> I have been using E-MU 0404 for sound output - it's connected to my iMac by USB and outputs sound from my computer to speakers. After upgrading to OS X 10.11, El Capitan, the E-MU 0404 is gone from the list of output devices.  There is a USB audio control panel application, provided by Creative, which used to detect the device and do some basic configuration, but now it does not detect anything.  Any way to fix this?  <answer209414> From Creative's Forum:     Dear E-MU customers,      All E-MU enquiries are now being managed by a dedicated E-MU Team   which took effect on 5 May 2014.
