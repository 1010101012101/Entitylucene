awk/sed output from system_profiler on 10.6.8 <body> If I have:  foobr bar  ..and I'd like to awk/sed this to:  foo-bar  ..what's the syntax?  I'm trying to use:  precodesystem_profiler SPMemoryDataType | awk '/Type/ {print $2} /Speed/ {print $2}'|sed 's/\r$/a\"-"/' /code/pre  to output type-speed (ie DDR-1067).  <answer25157> Use this sed instead:  precode|sed '$!N;s/\n/ /'  /code/pre  system_profiler SPMemoryDataType | awk '/Type/ {print $2} /Speed/ {print $2}'|sed '$!N;s/\n/ /'  output:  precodeDDR3 1066 DDR3 1066 DDR3 1066 Empty Empty /code/pre  <answer25166> Awk can easily do this on it's own, like so:  precodesystem_profiler SPMemoryDataType | awk '/Type:/ {type=$2} /Speed:/ {speed=$2; printf "%s-%s\n", type, speed}' /code/pre  <comment28346> If you don't get any sed/awk help here, there are plenty of other sites that address those unix tools explicitly, rather than by extension that a mac program is generating xml output. Just hop in the chat room if you need help selecting a destination or flag it for moderator help if you prefer. <comment29354> How do you make it stop after the first line though? When I awk using the above command I get: DDR2-667 [carriage return] DDR2-667 I just want the first line. <comment29385> Insert an ;exit after /Speed/ {print $2 **,so it would look like:**   .... /Speed/ {print $2;exit} .....
