New File Action in Finder <body> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Z7Xwx.png" alt="enter image description here"  Why finder doesn't have 'New File', but 'New Folder'? Is there any way/tool for having 'New File' in Finder?  h2ADDED/h2  Pathfinder provides the feature of making 'New File'. I need this function in Finder.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2IB1q.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer8938> The idea in OS X is, that you open an Application and create the file while you are working. This simply because creating the file beforehand is kind of awkward:       Create file  open file  edit   Of course if you just need dummy files, then you can make those from Terminal.app, but I'd be careful with that if you are not used to it already.  The command is: codetouch filename/code  <answer221079> proseek you can add to finder the extension "shellhere", that's great!  <comment9496> Actually 'touch something' is the method that I'm using. However, I need to open Terminal.app, cd to the directory, and run the command to get it done. Just write clicking would be better if possible. <comment42890> What type of file? You would need a large sub-menu like in Windows letting you select the file type. <comment42891> Well, just letting me give the full file name would work to get any type of file.
