What's the easiest way to copy the current URL in Fluid? <body> When I'm in a fluid app, and have navigated somewhere, I sometimes want to share that URL with someone.    What's the fastest way to get it onto the clipboard? It seems like it should be simple, but I'm at a loss.  EDIT:  I just figured out that I can turn on "show toolbar", which will add a url bar, but is there a quicker way?  I don't really want it on most of the time and enabling it is a lot more annoying than a cntrl-c.  <answer83883> Developer of Fluid here.  Yes, there's a very easy way:   kbd⌘/kbd + kbdL/kbd em(That's "Command - L")/em  That will temporarily "show" the toolbar (if it was hidden), and select all the text in the URL location field. From there you can copy it, via kbd⌘/kbd + kbdC/kbd.  Then, to hide the toolbar, you can press:  kbd⎋ esc/kbd em(That's "Escape")/em  If the toolbar was previously hidden, this will hide the toolbar.  <comment96591> awesome - extra points for all keystrokes!  (I've got another question headed your way here soon...)
