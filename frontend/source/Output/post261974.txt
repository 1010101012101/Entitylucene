Puny HFS performance <body> Is it normal to have less than 15 megabytes per second writes on a solid state drive (Evo 850 250GB to be exact)?   precode$ date;dd if=/dev/random of=/var/tmp/test bs=4096 count=81920;date Tue Nov 22 16:59:00 +03 2016 81920+0 records in 81920+0 records out 335544320 bytes transferred in 23.296377 secs (14403283 bytes/sec) Tue Nov 22 16:59:24 +03 2016 /code/pre  This is the order of magnitude less than than the theoretical ceiling of 150 MB/s for SATA 1.0 that Apple chose to keep forcing down the Mac mini user throats. And no, this is not a Mac mini but the very latest iMac 5K.  <answer261975> Nevermind, /dev/random turned out to be expensive:  precode$ date;dd if=/dev/zero of=/var/tmp/test bs=4096 count=81920;date Tue Nov 22 17:05:55 +03 2016 81920+0 records in 81920+0 records out 335544320 bytes transferred in 0.719295 secs (466490534 bytes/sec) Tue Nov 22 17:05:56 +03 2016 /code/pre  <comment328120> Neither question nor answer show much research how proper (SSD|HDD) benchmarking works (sequential r/w, 4k r/w etc) <comment328273> Right, I needed a rough estimate. And I think I got the jist of it.
