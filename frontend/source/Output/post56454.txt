Can I export a list of downloaded iPhone apps from iTunes? <body> I have a long list of apps I've downloaded for my iPhone on a single PC. I would like to export a list of these apps to a text format.  How can I do that?  <answer56473> You could do this with a few Terminal commands.  First, open the Terminal by going to Applications - Utilities - Terminal.  Then, paste in the following and press kbdreturn/kbd.  precodecd ~/Music/iTunes/iTunes\ Media/Mobile\ Applications /code/pre  Then, paste in this next command and press kbdreturn/kbd.  precodels &gt; ~/my_apps.txt /code/pre  Now, in your Home folder (/Users/emyourusername/em/), there will be a text file called my_apps.txt containing a list of all of your apps.  <answer56474> The second answer concerns Mac OS X (as I haven't specified the system when asking the question). Here is the stronganswer for Windows/strong (tested on Windows XP SP2):  Open cmd.exe by clicking emStart menu -- Run/em, then type codecmd/code and click code&lt;Enter&gt;/code. Type:  precodecd C:\Documents and Settings\&lt;your_user_name&gt;\My documents\My musc\iTunes\iTunes Media\Mobile Applications\ /code/pre  Then you execute the following command (to get the list of files in this directory without extensions):  precodeFor %a in (*.*) do @echo %~na &gt;&gt; AppsList.txt /code/pre  You'll have the full list of apps (ordered alphabetically ascending by default) in the 'AppsList.txt' file.  <comment64855> From the question I would assume @REACHUS is using a PC. Besides that, a directory listing of the .ipa files doesn't contain a lot of information. <comment64856> I forgot to mention that I need to do it on Windows :). I've added my own answer with Windows explanation. <comment64857> Oh well, that's fine :).  Based on your answer, the Windows and Mac approaches are not much different.
