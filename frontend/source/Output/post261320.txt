How to keep MacBook awake with lid closed + extended display? <body> Specs:  ul limacOS Sierra 10.12.1/li liMacBook Pro 15-inch, early 2011/li /ul  Basically, when I connect my projector and extend the display, after closing the lid, MacBook "extended display" option cancels out and I can see the full display (not just the extended bit). I understand this phenomenon happens because of the "closed-clamshell" mode, however what I want to achieve is to be able to close my MacBook Pro's lid and see the extended display on the wall - when I open the lid, I should be able to see the usual display on my laptop and still the extended one on the wall.  Used the latest versions of both NoSleep &amp; Caffeine (also tried InsomniaX), but no luck.  <answer261332> Requirements for closed-display mode from, Use your Mac notebook computer in closed-display mode with an external display:     To use closed-display mode with your Mac notebook, you need:        ul   liAn AC power adapter /li   liAn external keyboard and mouse or trackpad, either USB or wireless  /li   liA USB-C to USB adapter if you're using a USB mouse or keyboard with MacBook (Retina, 12-inch, Early 2015) and later or MacBook Pro models introduced in late 2016/li   liAn external display or projector/li   /ul      If you're using a USB keyboard and mouse      ol   liMake sure that your Mac notebook is plugged in to an outlet using the AC power adapter./li   liConnect a USB keyboard and mouse to your Mac./li   liWith your Mac turned on and the display open, connect the Mac to the appropriate port on the external display or projector and turn the display or projector on. /li   liUse an appropriate Apple video adapter if necessary./li   liAfter your Mac notebook's Desktop appears on the external display, close the computer's lid.
