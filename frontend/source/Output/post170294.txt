Internet not working well on MBA, after switching network? <body> Let's say that I turned on my MBAir at home; wifi networking works. Then I close the lid (MBA goes to sleep) and go to different place with different wifi network. When I change the wifi network (eq when I go to nearby coffee shop) something strange happens: from that point I can not reach most of the internet. Even when I come back home, the same problem exists! This is a summary of what I have found:  ul liDNS is working/li lireseting DNS (using codecom.apple.discoveryd.plist/code) does not help/li licodeping/code is working/li licodetraceroute/code works/li liturning wireless off and on does not help (via codeifconfig/code)/li lihowever, I can not connect to port 80, for example, using codewget/code results with "connection timed out"./li librowsers doesn't work (obviously)/li lithis issue is not related to a target web site, this happens all the time./li liother devices in my network work fine, so its not a router issue./li lire-adding network doesn't help./li /ul  The emonly/em thing that helps is switching computer off and then back on; but this is not a solution for me.  Can any one recommend a solution, preferably in terminal (so I can issue the fix everytime when I experience it)?  I have MBA 2013 and Yosemite installed.  <answer171815> I had Wireshark installed, and since I've removed it, everything works.
