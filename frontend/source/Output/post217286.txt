Process not running but app shown in dock <body> I have an applescript that runs automatically and relies on the application "Contacts" to be running. Occasionally, it fails when the "Contacts" process mysteriously disappears from the activity monitor, although the dock still shows it as running.    The following will NOT work:    ol liApplescript "tell application "Contacts" to activate  /li liApplescript "tell application "Contacts' to quit (both respond with "application not running)  /li liApplescript "do shell script killall launchserviced" followed by "killall dock" executes ok but doesn't solve the problem  /li /ol  Only solution is to MANUALLY quit "Contacts" from the dock and then reactivate it but that solution is not satisfactory because it requires a manual intervention.  Any ideas as to a) why the error happens and b) how can I cater for the error by quiting "Contacts" from applescript ?  Any ideas will be appreciated  ....  In response to bmike's comment;  Running OS X 10.10.5 and here is the relevant section of the applescript   set todaysdate to (current date) as text  *tell application "System Events"  precodetry     set myprocessid to (get id of process "Contacts")    on error number errorno     display dialog errorno     if errorno is equal to -1728 then -- process not found         try             tell application "System Events" to run application "Contacts"         on error number errorno             if errorno = -600 then                 display dialog errorno &amp; todaysdate as text             end if         end try         do shell script "/bin/sleep 3" --and allow enough time for the app to activate     end if end try /code/pre  end tell  This section attempts to activate "Contacts" if it finds the process is not running (error -1728). It then attempts to run the app but it always errors out with -600 (app not running). A simple applescript to quit the app also errors out with -600.   So, if the process is missing, the app cannot be activated and quit does not work either.  Thanks for your comments  <answer218637> I seemed to have at last found a way to get over this. It's rather crude, but worked for me.  if errorno = -600 then                      tell application "System Events"                         tell process "Dock"                             click UI element "Contacts" of list 1                         end tell                     end tell                     delay 10 -- allow sometime for the process to appear in the process list                     tell application "System Events"                         tell process "Contacts" to set visible to false -- run hidden                     end tell                 end if  By forcing a click in the dock, the process re-appears in the process list and then the app can be quit, or restarted, or whatever. Weird.   <comment262688> The behavior of doc and running processes changed  recently. Are you working with a specific version of OS X? Also if you could show your code we might be able to add a line that open contacts whether it's running or not there for you always know it's running before the next script step executes
