How can you simultaneously change the name of a song in iTunes and the actual file <body> When I download music it automatically goes very quickly to iTunes before I can change the name of the download to just the song's name. How can I change the name so that it then changes in iTunes as well as the actual file without having to do it twice?  <answer206706> If you're willing to do it using an app, there are a few apps that do it.  1-strongOne is freeware and called "Tagger"/strong,   Here is what Tagger allows you to do, in terms of renaming options:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NYRMg.png" alt="enter image description here"  2-stronganother app is called "Tune Instructor"/strong, which works as an iTunes plug-in (freeware too).   3-stronganother one is called "Metadatics"/strong. This one is shareware (9$).  4-If you're good at more complex solutions, then maybe looking into strong[Applescript]/strong5 would be a good idea.  5-strongDoug's free iTunes scripts/strong also have iTunes applescripts to help you rename your files.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hdN8f.png" alt="enter image description here"  I didn't try the 2 and 3, but they're probably all good solutions. 5 is usually a very good source of scripts. Try them and chose what you like best!
