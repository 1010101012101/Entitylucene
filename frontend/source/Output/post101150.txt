screencapture -l not working: illegal option <body> I've wrongly opened the same question on StackOverflow. I hope to find a better explaination here.  I've seen in many pages (for example here: How do I find the windowid to pass to screencapture -l?) that you have to use the command: screencapture -l in order to capture a single window given its ID.  However when I try to enter screencapture -l into the terminal I get this error:  precodescreencapture: illegal option -- l /code/pre  I've checked a reference and actually I can't see -l as a possible attribute for screencapture: http://guides.macrumors.com/screencapture  How do you explain this? How can I solve this?  <answer101155> The code-l/code option requires an argument for the ID of the window:  precode$ screencapture -l screencapture: illegal option -- l usage: screencapture [-icMPmwsWxSCUtoa] [files]   -c         force screen capture to go to the clipboard   -C         capture the cursor as well as the screen. only in non-interactive modes   -d         display errors to the user graphically   -i         capture screen interactively, by selection or window                control key - causes screen shot to go to clipboard                space key   - toggle between mouse selection and                              window selection modes                escape key  - cancels interactive screen shot   -m         only capture the main monitor, undefined if -i is set   -M         screen capture output will go to a new Mail message   -o         in window capture mode, do not capture the shadow of the window   -P         screen capture output will open in Preview   -s         only allow mouse selection mode   -S         in window capture mode, capture the screen not the window   -t&lt;format&gt; image format to create, default is png (other options include pdf, jpg, tiff and other formats)   -T&lt;seconds&gt; Take the picture after a delay of &lt;seconds&gt;, default is 5   -w         only allow window selection mode   -W         start interaction in window selection mode   -x         do not play sounds   -a         do not include windows attached to selected windows   -r         do not add dpi meta data to image   -l&lt;windowid&gt; capture this windowsid   -R&lt;x,y,w,h&gt; capture screen rect   files   where to save the screen capture, 1 file per screen $ screencapture -l $(osascript -e 'tell app "Safari" to id of window 1') test.png $ /code/pre  Or if you have an older version of OS X, codescreencapture/code might not include the code-l/code option. At least in 10.8 the code-l/code option is only shown in the help message and not on the man page.  codeosascript -e 'tell app "Appname" to id of window 1'/code doesn't work with all applications, but see these questions for other ways to find the IDs of windows:  ul liHow do I find the windowid of Google Chrome to pass to screencapture/li liHow do I find the windowid to pass to screencapture -l?/li /ul  <comment119078> Can you add the full command you are trying to execute (and not just the error message)? And does it work if you open Safari and then copy/paste the command line from http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/56566/9058 ? <comment119079> I've tried with screencapture -l, then screencapture -l idwindow a.png, then with safari open and pasted the code. Everytime the same error. <comment119081> Did you use AppleScript to get the window id ? <comment119082> I'm planning to. This time I've just used Quartz debug and used the "wid" <comment119083> It's strange because I can't find the option -l in the references. http://ss64.com/osx/screencapture.html <comment119084> Is there any way to use it if I'm on a 10.5.8? <comment119085> I'm not an expert by any mean but what if I get somwhere an updated version of screencapture command and I just replace mine in: /usr/sbin/screencapture? <comment119086> I uploaded the `/usr/sbin/screencapture` from my installation of 10.8 [here](http://19a5b0.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/screencapture.tar), but I'm not sure if it will work. <comment119088> Nope! Now it's not working at all haha it gives me "Illegal instruction" <comment119092> There must be no space between `-l` and the id. <comment280900> I found windowid of Safari: 4656 So I typed command like this: screencapture -l 4656 ~/Desktop/test.png but nothing happened Any suggestion ?
