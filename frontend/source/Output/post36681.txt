What Lion maintenance utility should I use? <body> Im a huge fan of AppleJack, but I realize it doesn't currently support Lion.  What is an lion supported equivalent?  Im looking for a one-stop shop for all my Mac cleaning needs!  Bonus marks for software that can be deployed an managed remotely (on the same LAN)..  Thanks in advance!  Dev  <answer36732> h2Onyx/h2  I don't know AppleJack, therefore I don't know if this program is sufficient for your needs. Onyx is a free tool for general system maintenance.  ul liYou can strongautomize tasks/strong which you do frequently. /li liVerify the Startup Disk and the structure of its System files, to run misc. tasks of system maintenance/li liDelete caches, to remove a certain number of files and folders that may become cumbersome, and more./li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6X8We.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer36738> I have yet to find a utility that can function as a true one stop shop for me, but here are three programs that I never leave home without, any one of which may come close to your needs.  Cocktail  ul liGreat day to day maintenance utility/li liLots of basic to moderate options/li liDead simple automation and scheduling for routinely performed tasks/li /ul  TechTool Pro  ul liMany similar functions to Cocktail but with more in depth system monitoring and trouble shooting options/li liExpanded Disk Utility options compared to Cocktail/li liGreat for diagnosing problems you didn't even know you had/li /ul  Disk Warrior  "http://www.alsoft.com/diskwarrior/index.html"  ul liThe "Delta Force" of disk utility apps/li liYour First, Last, and Best line of defense for any disk related problem/li liComplete re-construction of failed and lost directories and partitions./li /ul  Also, for what it's worth, I too find Onyx to be a great program as well, it's just never found it's way into my permanent arsenal.  Hope this gives you  a leaping off point.    <comment41783> Why do you think you need to use any "maintenance utility"? <comment44631> Thanks a lot guys...  I appreciate the help and suggestions, I think I will tinker with Cocktail.  Is there anyway to run a disc repair on a mounted disc (such as your system drive while mounted and running) in Cocktail or any other utility?  Dev
