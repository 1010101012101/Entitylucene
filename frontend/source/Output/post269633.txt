Customise mailboxes shortcuts <body> Is there a way to change the shortcuts to mailboxes?   Since I don't care usually about VIPs/drafts (see attached fig.), it would be more helpful to have rather emtrash/em and emarchive/em, for instance.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8I2ei.png" alt=""  <answer269661> The shortcuts correspond to the order in which they appear on the Favourites Bar, underneath the toolbar. If you add, remove or rearrange mailboxes there, the shortcuts will change accordingly.  If your Favourites Bar isn't currently visible, you can show it using the codeView &gt; Show Favourites Bar/code menu.  http://www.cultofmac.com/202280/go-to-favorite-mailboxes-with-keyboard-shortcuts-os-x-tips/  <comment338715> great, thanks! I never realised I could actually move those objects - coming from linux, where this is usually not the case...
