Why did changing from gmail to inbox.com delete contacts from an iPhone4s? Can I retrieve the contacts? <body> I changed my email from gmail to inbox.com on an iPhone4s and discovered most of my contacts are gone. Only recent contacts and Facebook contacts remain. Of course I did not backup the contacts.  <answer91861> Try checking here - https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#contacts  If you contacts still exists, you can export them and then import them to where ever you like.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NXzTT.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment107895> Are the contacts still available if you log into your your Gmail account directly on the web site? <comment107909> I will try that and see. The only other solution I can findThanks for your help :)
