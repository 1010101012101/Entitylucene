Can't login to MacBook Pro because keystrokes are repeated! <body> Every key I type in the login screen is repeated, so I can't type my correct password! (unfortunately my password is not comprised of pairs of characters)  I recently tried to speed up my key repeat rate via this post but after reverting that change the problem is still happening. It only happens on the main login screen after boot; if I go to switch users the keyboard works normally. Fortunately I've found a workaround through the guest account, but I would really like to know how to get my main login keyboard back to normal!   Any ideas?  <answer267177> Try looking at the codeInitialKeyRepeat/code default for the codesudo/code account. I had the same problem, and noticed this that for my user account codedefaults read -g InitialKeyRepeat/code returned a value of 25. But codesudo defaults read -g InitialKeyRepeat/code returned a value of 5, which is much faster. I changed the value for sudo using this command:  precodesudo defaults write -g InitialKeyRepeat -int 25 /code/pre  and I no longer have a problem typing my password at the logon screen. This page is helpful for more details.  <comment247691> I've never seen this before, but something in this article might help: http://www.macissues.com/2015/04/16/fix-an-incorrect-default-keyboard-layout-at-the-os-x-login-prompt/ as with anything, make sure important data is backed-up before trying anything. <comment247729> Thanks for the link @jcm. Unfortunately the first tip didn't work. (Doesn't seem like the rest is related but I may try it later anyway.) <comment295470> Did you ever figure this out? I'm suffering from the same thing. <comment297090> Unfortunately no @Alex. But I've been working around it by enabling automatic login on boot, and the keyboard works properly on screen lock. Pretty strange bug! If you ever find a real solution please post an answer. <comment335208> THANK YOU. My sudo value was at 0 somehow! I've waited 16 months for this solution :) <comment335246> You're welcome! It was nearly the same amount of time for me, so I was very happy to stumble upon this. <comment335357> @Alex the answer below worked for me
