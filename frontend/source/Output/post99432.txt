System event key codes not working on thunderbolt display <body> My AppleScript works when I am just using my MacBook Pro Retina, however if i have my Thunderbolt Display attached the script does not work.  Here is the script which works perfectly on just the laptop:  precode######## turn screen bright repeat 25 times     tell application "System Events"         key code 113     end tell end repeat /code/pre  Terminal will display this if i am running on the Thunderbolt Display:  code^[[28~^[[28~^{{/code (repeats)  Does any one know the key code to adjust brightness on the Thunderbolt Display or where I may find it?  Thanks in advance  <answer99474> Did you try codekey code 113 using control down/code? Pressing the brightness keys while holding control normally changes the brightness of a Thunderbolt Display, but I don't know if it works with keys like F15.  You can also use brightness.c to change the brightness of different displays:  precodedo shell script "~/bin/brightness -d 1 0.0" /code/pre  <comment116982> What version of Mac OS X are you using? Are you using this with the MBP closed or open? <comment116983> Im using 10.8.4 and i have the MBP open with it being its own display. the script does not effect either of the monitors when the display is plugged in. thanks in advance <comment117066> Using the brightness.c was something i have not thought of and probably makes more sense than a loop of system event key codes - thanks
