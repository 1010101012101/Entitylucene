Change Siri's default search engine on macOS <body> I recently upgraded my MacBook Pro to macOS Sierra and now have access to Siri. Whenever Siri searches the internet, it uses Bing, although I would prefer to use Google.  I changed Safari's default search engine to Google, but that did not affect Siri's searches.  How can I change Siri's default search engine?  <answer267155> At this time, there's no way to change the default macOS Siri search engine.  I would recommend letting Apple know you'd like the ability to change the search engine using the macOS Feedback page.  <answer280604> You can't change the default, but if you ask Siri to 'Google x' Siri will do just that.
