Do any Amazon S3 clients allow automation for setting expiration headers? <body> I am using Transmit and the Firefox extension S3 Organiser.   Neither completely satisfies my requirements  as both tools lack the ability to set an expiration header.    This makes me cry, as I need to manually run a script to download files to a local machine, use an S3 API to set the expiration header, then upload the files back to the S3 server.  This is time consuming.  Does anyone know of a tool or client for Mac that allows the user to specify an expiration header?  <answer41604> I'm not 100% sure if it meets your needs, but Cyberduck allows you to set the Cache-Control header. See this link for more information (see the section on strongCache Control Setting/strong).   <answer59418> Transmit can do this.  Preferences  Cloud allows you to set custom headers on upload for all files or by extension.  Set codeExpires/code HTTP 1.0 and codeCache-Control/code for HTTP 1.1.   <comment47172> For outbound links Cyberduck can 100% do this. For any object in a bucket you right click and you can generate that has a signed policy embedded in it. You can customize the available time outs. See: http://trac.cyberduck.ch/wiki/help/en/howto/s3#SignedtemporaryURLs for the details. <comment47180> Have you shot off a support email to the very fine folks at Panic? Perhaps linking to your query here if you feel the discussion will add to your request. I have been delighted with the support I get from them whenever Transmit causes me to scratch my head. <comment47181> As to your question, have you tried mounting the S3 files using Transmit and just running your script as if the filesystem were local? <comment47194> mounting does not help as the expiration header is purely for HTTP request header only (which you can't set in normal file system) <comment47205> 3q, I quite happy with the software, despite the connection handling is quite slow (bearable) <comment68451> See this tweet from Panic - Transmit can do this: https://twitter.com/willco007/statuses/231744013009555456 <comment68479> thanks, at the end ... s3cmd (learning curve!)
