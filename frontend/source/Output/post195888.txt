How to display artist's Alphabetic scroller in Music from iOS 8.4 <body> Before iOS 8.4 I had an Alphabet scroller to find artists quickly. How to make it appear again?  <answer195894> You can still use the alphabetic scroller! Simply go in Music screen, select artist img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/x1Jx2.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  then scroll down to make "Most Recent" disappear and the scroller will appear again! img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/AhGlb.png" alt="enter image description here"
