How to update applications that were moved from Application folder <body> All my applications in the code/Applications/code folder are sorted in different subfolders, so that I can find them easily. I know, this is not recommended (see this question), since the Software Update looks for the app in the code/Applications/code folder only when doing the updates, and problems may occur in that case.  That's what happen to me today with the 10.9.3 update: for example, Mail.app has been updated by this update, but in my case, Mail.app were in code/Applications/Internet/code (instead of code/Applications/code), so now, after the update I've got:  ul lia non-working Mail.app application in the code/Applications/code folder (non-working because it only contains the new updated items of Mail.app)/li lithe old (working) version of Mail.app in code/Applications/Internet/code/li /ul  I tried to copy (with the codecp -R /Applications/Mail.app /Applications/Internet/Mail.app/code command in the terminal) the updated items in the old folder (of course, I made a backup of the Mail.app folder before), but it did not work (it's impossible to run the "new" Mail.app application, it crashes immediately)  So my question is: how could I manually update the Mail.app application (and the other) ? (and please, don't blame me, like "emit's your fault, you must follow the Apple's rules/em" :-) )  Thanks  <comment153819> I leave the Apps where Apple thinks they should be, and make aliases to them in the spots where they Actually should be. That leaves the App folder in sort of a 'junk drawer' state, but that's how Apple wants it, and they'll make you suffer if you try to neaten it up. <comment153844> @Wayfaring Stranger: you're right, that's I will probably do. BUT I do not want to have a 'junk' app folder, I just want a 'clean' app folder...
