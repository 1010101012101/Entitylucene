Is there any alternative to MacPorts? <body> MacPorts became really a pain because it does compile the packages on your machine, like the infamous gentoo and I would like something with a smaller footprint on your machine.  I know that Fink and other solutions exists but from what I remember form few years ago they are less maintained than macports.  I would like to read a more informed opinion regarding which solution would be optimal and why.   <answer11465> Yes, you can try Homebrew   <answer11475> h1Alternatives for MacPorts/h1  h2Homebrew/h2  ul liUses OS X binary versions when available/li liCompiles OS X optimized versions ul liCompiling usually faster than with MacPorts/li /ul/li liEasy to use, e.g. to install wget: code$ brew install wget/code/li liTries to separate already installed software from what is installed through codebrew/code …/li li… while taking advantage of already installed software and libraries (e.g. doesn't install a working version of Perl twice)/li liInstalling software doesn't need root access/li liActively developed on github/li /ul  h2Fink/h2  ul liUses Debian tools like codedpkg/code and codeapt-get/code/li liEasy to use, e.g. to install wget: code$ fink install wget/code/li liCan be used to install precompiled packages or to compile everything from the source/li liHas a separate directory tree to avoid interference with the system/li /ul  h2Rudix/h2  ul liLast version 2010-04-10/li /ul  h2MacLibre/h2  ul liHas GUI/li liNothing new on the website since 2008/li /ul  <answer55112> Macports now provides compiled binaries for Snow Leopard and Lion for normal options.   <comment11982> Can you provide more information regarding your experience, and why this should be better than MacPorts? <comment11986> If *(when)* you decide to switch to Homebrew, there might be useful info in: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/2294/migrating-from-macports-to-homebrew-is-there-any-specific-advice-in-how-to-minim <comment11987> @Sorin There's some good points in http://tech.nopho.be/mac-software/homebrew-is-like-macports-or-fink-except-that-it-actually-works I switched from MacPorts to Homebrew after the first long compile (which hasn't been so much of a problem since), so I really can't provide truthful comparison, but I share all the views pointed in the blog post. There's no `sudo`ing with `brew`. <comment11996> Sorry, but my impression is that brew does compile each package on my machine and this is exactly what I was trying not to do. <comment11998> @Sorin Homebrew uses binaries whenever available, hence many installs are reasonable in length. Also installing and compiling `mkvtoolnix` (which doesn't have OSX binaries) was noticeably faster (in human and in CPU time) with brew than with ports (this is the only comparison I can provide, and YMMV with other programs). <comment11999> @Sorin: Koiyu is right on use of binaries <comment12004> I know these are alternatives, but I cannot produce a good comparison without usage experiences. In its current form the answer is biased, but I made it as a CW so whoever knows better, can add/correct the list. <comment63471> Thanks, but I dropped using MacPorts and Fink long time ago. Both projects where not agile enough to add support for new OS X versions. Brew was able, and it keeps being this way. <comment63472> Macports does support Mountain Lion <comment63474> Sorry, I cannot update the comment: they were not able to add support IN TIME. Brew had support on the day Apple released it and I got support even while the Lion or ML was in developer preview. <comment89509> Just pick `homebrew` and forget about the others. <comment223541> Note that MacPorts does not always compile on your machine now If you have a common setup it will have precompiled packages
