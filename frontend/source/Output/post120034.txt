Automator application needs to ignore all files that aren't EPS <body> I've made an application that I drop EPS files on and it makes two copies and renames them and transfers them to SMB shares.  But sometimes when I have more than one file selected in other windows, Finder passes multiple files onto Automator. All I really need it to use are EPS files, ignoring others and passing the EPS files on to automator for renaming.  I pass variables onto an applescript for if statements. My first attempt:  precodeon run {input, parameters}      if (input as text) does not contain ".eps" then         tell application "Auto 45" to quit     else      end if      return input  end run /code/pre  Then I realized that this doesn't do anything about multiple files. If it finds .eps anywhere in all files combined into a single variable, it simply passes all kinds of junk files through.  I tried to use this if statement instead:  precodetell application finder     if name extension of (input) is "eps" then         #if (input as text) is equal to type "eps" then         return input     else         nothing     end if  end tell /code/pre  This code doesn't work even though it compiles, nor does this solve the problem of checking multiple inputs. I'm using the Mavericks version of Automator.  <answer120061> The solution for your problem is the strongFilter Finder Items/strong action.   Just add it to your workflow before your strongAppleScript/strong Action.   <comment140075> That line compiles but I can't get it to pass the correct information back to Automator:   `on run {input, parameters}  global myEPS    set myEPS to every item of input whose name contains ".eps"    return myEPS   end run` <comment140079> I found a better way to do this, see my edit ! <comment140081> BAM! That does it. Don't even need the applescript anymore. I may include it to shut down if the input is blank or to give a warning.
