Mac becomes periodically unpingable after upgrade <body> We have have a Mac-mini that is used for remote compilation via ssh. Recently we have upgraded OS from El Capitan to Sierra. After this we have faced with a problem, that ssh commands periodically fail with "Connection timeout" message. I found that Mac ocassionaly becomes unpingable at all. codeping &lt;MacMini_ip&gt; -t/code gives next message  precodePinging &lt;MacMini_ip&gt; with 32 bytes of data: Request timed out.

I thought that this is a problem with network cable or switch, but after replacing the problem still occurs, though the loss percentage is smaller.  <comment343206> Is the Mac set to go to sleep for any reason? <comment343210> I'm a bit curious about why the name of the Mac changes from `my_ip` to `MacMini_ip`. Can you check to make sure only one net interface is active in `System Preferences  Network`? Perhaps Wifi has been turned on by accident? Also, what is the Computer name in `System Preferences   Sharing`?
