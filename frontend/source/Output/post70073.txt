Import and create iPhoto Event from folder name <body> I would like to automatically import a folder to iPhoto (eg. with Automator). The Event Name should be the name of the folder with the images.  Is this possible with automator?  <answer83829> Yes it is.   See below workflow that I did.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rTx67.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  You may need to get the additional automator actions. You can get them here:   http://www.automatedworkflows.com  <answer83882> In addition, this is the default behavior if you simply drop the folder onto the iPhoto icon. There is no direct need to make an Automator action unless you are doing this for many many folders.  <comment81409> Hello, and welcome to Ask Different!

Can you think of alternative ways for these actions? <comment96501> The first action "Get Information for Finder Items". Unfortunately it is only sold as a package. The only other suggestion is using applescript. But after I got the whole Finder Action Pack, I was able to do handle at least 10 different workflows that I wanted to set up.
