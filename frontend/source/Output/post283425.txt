Menu bar shows that macOS Sierra very frequently uses location services to check the time zone even though Setting Time Zone is disabled <body> Ever since upgrading to macOS Sierra, I have been able to keep track of when programs use my location because the menu bar displays an icon whenever an app requests this information. I have noticed that about once per hour, the location services icon appears for a few seconds, and when I click on it it says "Apps requesting location: Setting Time Zone"  I've tried disabling automatic time zone detection in System Preferences (Under the Privacy  Location Services options), and this does not prevent this from happening. Here is what this setting looks like on my computer, note that the "Time Zone" box is already unchecked:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/an2X7.png" alt="enter image description here"  I looked at the list of other programs that have recently requested my location, and nothing unusual appears:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/b4xUF.png" alt="enter image description here"  What is causing this, and is there any way to disable it? If this cannot be turned off, then is there a way to prevent it from appearing in the menu bar?  <comment357337> Possible duplicate of [Location icon randomly appearing in status bar every hour](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/280164/location-icon-randomly-appearing-in-status-bar-every-hour) <comment357368> @Mateusz OP of this question has already disabled the Setting Time Zone option unlike that link, hence my solution over there won't work here â€” this isn't a duplicate? <comment357372> @Mateusz My second screenshot in my answer shows what happens if you try to enable Night Shift's Sunset to Sunrise option when the Setting Time Zone option is disabled: it won't let you. It may be there's a bug that OP has stumbled across here, but that doesn't make it a duplicate either?
