How to make voice recordings from Quicktime louder without re-rendering the whole video? <body> I have tried 2 mics. I am doing screen recordings with audio. The volume is relatively quiet.  How can I record the sound louder, or inflate the sound after, without having to use iMovie to re-render the whole video?  <comment317332> What version(s) of QuickTime do you have installed? <comment317348> @Monomeeth 10.4
