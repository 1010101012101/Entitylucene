Why aren't pictures in imessages showing up on my macbook messages? <body> I setup my macbook to show messages from my iphone conversations and they show up now but none of the pictures show up.  I see a reference to a picture but i can't view it or download it.    strongNOTE/strong: I am able to send pictures from my macbook messages directly and those work fine.  I have plenty of storage available on my computer so not sure what the reason could be.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4X9TC.png" alt="enter image description here"  if I click on download arrow or double click on the image this is all I see  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YaMxG.png" alt="enter image description here"  Can anyone else determine why I can't see pictures on my macbook within messages when it was sent from my iphone.  <comment363480> best guess, the down arrow to the right is saying it's not downloaded yet. Try clicking it. <comment363508> @Tetsujin - clicking on the down arrow doesn't seem to do anything <comment372154> Any solution? Having the same issue!
