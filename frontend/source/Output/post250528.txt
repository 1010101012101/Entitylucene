Macbook Pro 15" mid 2012, external display @ 2560 x 1600 on 4K screen via DisplayPort? <body> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/VnEfq.png" alt="about this mac"  I have a Macbook Pro 15" mid 2012, and I want to add an external display running at 2560 x 1600. Given that I want a future proof display, I purchased a 4K monitor. (LG27UD88)  Of course I know it will not run 4K resolution, but I was hoping to would at least allow me to run 2560 x 1600 as supported by the NVIDIA GT650M. Turns out I only achieve 1920 x 1080 :(  I connected with a purchased mini-DisplayPort to DisplayPort cable. Could it be a limitation of the cable? Will connecting via a mini-DP to HDMI cable change anything?  The 1920 x 1080 resolution is really superb and crispy, but it's a bit an expensive HD monitor...  Anyone any tips ?  <answer250622> Well looks like I found the answer to my problem. All I had to do was strongpress the Option button when selecting "Scaled"/strong from the Displays setting; this allowed me to select 3840 x 2160 (30Hz) and 2560 x 1440 (60Hz)  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lkpyL.png" alt="display settings"  Well, to be more precise, the 2560x1440 resolution is not 60Hz but strongfor a weird reason it shows 59Hz/strong in System Information. Does anyone know how come?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/06S9X.png" alt="system information"  <comment311149> I'm looking at 2 pages on Everymac to try decide, but it's not clear. The [mid 2012](http://www.everymac.com/systems/apple/macbook_pro/specs/macbook-pro-core-i7-2.3-15-mid-2012-unibody-usb3-specs.html) page just says up to 2560x1600 but gives no details. The [retina 2012](http://www.everymac.com/systems/apple/macbook_pro/specs/macbook-pro-core-i7-2.3-15-mid-2012-retina-display-specs.html) page says it can only achieve that resolution over thunderbolt, not HDMI. Neither mentions DP at all.
