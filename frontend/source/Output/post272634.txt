Outlook on Ipad - how can I set from address to an alias <body> I just installed Outlook on my Ipad and configured the account as IMAP.  My primary email address has the form: x1272978546653@organisation.com and I have to use this as user name when I login to the servers.  Since that email address is difficult to remember (i.e. the x1272978546653 part), I have an alias like myname@organisation.com  When I send emails, I like the from address to be displayed as myname@organisation.com but I can't make it work on the Ipad.  For outlook on my PC I have just typed:     Mail address: myname@organisation.com      User name (for servers): x1272978546653@organisation.com   and it works great - all mails I send from the PC has from-address set to myname@organisation.com and server-login is fine.  But on the Ipad I can't make it work.  When I type:      Mail address: myname@organisation.com      User name (for servers): x1272978546653@organisation.com   the login fails.  In order to get a succesful login I have to do:     Mail address: x1272978546653@organisation.com      User name (for servers): x1272978546653@organisation.com   but then the from-address in the email I send is x1272978546653@organisation.com which isn't what I want.  So my question is:  How can I setup the email-alias in outlook on an Ipad.
