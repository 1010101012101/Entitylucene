diskutil resizeVolume noob <body> ul liBack story :/li /ul  After I installed Windows with Bootcamp, I wanted to make stronganother/strong partition where I'll install Linux, but couldn't do that from codeDisk Utility/code because I found on the internet that emYosemite/em can't partition Logical Volumes (or something like that). So I had to use the command line.  ul liThe problem :/li /ul  I resized a volume codedisk0s2/code from 400G to 350G to make room for Linux with this command :  precodediskutil resizeVolume disk0s2 350g /code/pre  And forgot to make a new partition with the new free space. How do I access and format it (It has to be Linux compatible) ?  strongNB :/strong When installing Linux it doesn't detect the free unformatted space  strongLogs :/strong  precode$ diskutil list /dev/disk0    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *500.1 GB   disk0    1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1    2:          Apple_CoreStorage                         399.2 GB   disk0s2    3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s3    4:       Microsoft Basic Data BOOTCAMP                100.0 GB   disk0s4 /dev/disk1    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:                  Apple_HFS Macintosh HD           *340.0 GB   disk1                                  Logical Volume on disk0s2                                  AC56F919-322B-49D0-9AFF-4718DFBC9021                                  Unencrypted   $ diskutil cs list CoreStorage logical volume groups (1 found) | +-- Logical Volume Group CCAF5997-E705-494E-9ADB-A0C76B62D3ED     =========================================================     Name:         Macintosh HD     Status:       Online     Size:         399248105472 B (399.2 GB)     Free Space:   58895785984 B (58.9 GB)     |     +-&lt; Physical Volume 0E48CCED-435C-4FBA-949C-C28DAA859CA6     |   ----------------------------------------------------     |   Index:    0     |   Disk:     disk0s2     |   Status:   Online     |   Size:     399248105472 B (399.2 GB)     |     +-&gt; Logical Volume Family D4956F33-E196-460B-8E9E-CB7365BB4275         ----------------------------------------------------------         Encryption Status:       Unlocked         Encryption Type:         None         Conversion Status:       NoConversion         Conversion Direction:    -none-         Has Encrypted Extents:   No         Fully Secure:            No         Passphrase Required:     No         |         +-&gt; Logical Volume AC56F919-322B-49D0-9AFF-4718DFBC9021             ---------------------------------------------------             Disk:                  disk1             Status:                Online             Size (Total):          339999997952 B (340.0 GB)             Conversion Progress:   -none-             Revertible:            Yes (no decryption required)             LV Name:               Macintosh HD             Volume Name:           Macintosh HD             Content Hint:          Apple_HFS /code/pre  <comment236334> Could you run `diskutil list` on your Mac and update your question with the output? <comment236338> It would also be useful to include the model of your Mac and which linux distribution (fedora, ubuntu, etc) you are going to install. <comment236346> Please see edit <comment236347> Have you considered running Linux in a virtual machine? It's easier to deal with and can be run along side OS X. <comment236348> If you are going to do this, the first thing I would do is get rid of core storage. You do not need it unless you want to encrypt your OS X partition.  What you have done so far is create empty space in your core storage partition. This is why linux can not find it during installation. <comment236355> Not a big fan of virtual machines.   @DavidAnderson Should I revert back to HFS+ ? Knowing that CoreStorage contains files for the actual Mac OS + Free space I'm gonna use for Linux <comment236361> Yes, if you can, revert back to a hfs+ volume. If you install linux between OS  X and Windows, then the partition indices with not be sequential. This means the Disk Utility application will not display the partitions properly. You can use a free third party tool to fix this, but if this can cause a BIOS/MBR install of Windows to not boot. Most Boot Camp Assistant installs are done this way, unless you have a fairly new Mac. Also, certain linux's installers can become confused if Windows uses BIOS/MBR while OS X is using EFI/GPT. You may have to install Windows after installing Linux.
