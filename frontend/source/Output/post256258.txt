2013 iMac 27' Display Issue (data cable damaged?) <body> I replaced HDD with SSD and reassembled the iMac. On booting, I found black lines on display (looks partly not broken).  I searched online, and found that the issue might be due to some graphic card problem, but I didn't touch anything related to the graphic card, only the cable to lift up. (took off the cables, and put them back)  Could the damaged display data cable cause this situation?  <comment319726> There is no need to repost a question after it has been migrated.
