Mac book: Is battery cycle low means mac book still can be used at long time ? <body> I try to buy an old mac book pro mid 2012. Old user of this mac uses mac by electric all the time, so the life cycle till now just 3 cycles, but this computer has been used for 1.5 years.  My question is: if this mac is only 3 cycles, does this mean the battery still as good as new mac ?   Thanks :)  <answer147022> I can speak from experience that the battery from by 2011 MBP 13' died (like only 10% of designed capacity left) after 56 cycles. It met a precipitous decline after a certain point. You may want you weigh your risk on the cost of replacing the battery.   <answer147037> There are 3 main factors that age a battery.  One is of course the constant charging and discharging.- the more the faster.  Second one is less know and it is the shelf life. Even if you do not use a battery it will eventually die due to the internal currents / shelf life.  Third and worse is Charging at all times in a elevated temperature environment.  In your case based on standards the battery is about 1/3 of its life based on age.

After doing this for a few months most batteries seem to become useless, sometimes not even keeping a charge for 5 minutes.  <comment173340> You forgot to mention heat. <comment173349> @BillK you are right, I was assuming room temp. <comment173350> How come that is a problem? <comment173451> I honestly don't know, but that's been my personal experience.  an otherwise good battery a year or so old, leave it plugged in for a few months and it becomes next to useless. <comment173515> @Buscar웃 and I have tested as you said, battery might go about 1/3 of its life. now it just works for about 5 hours if simply browse web :) <comment173516> @Buscar웃 can you tell me. I read some links. here for example, wired.com/2013/09/laptop-battery so, do we always try to put battery from 40% to 80% ? (so, when battery is down under 40$, i will charge until 80%, and unplug and continue to use) Thanks :) <comment173520> If you have OS 10.9 and above open the Activity monitor then the Energy tab, there is a lots of information of interest. My battery on a MacBook Air last about 4-5 hours max, mainly using the Browser, no movies ect (sound off), Brightness (the biggest consumer) to lowest acceptable levels.
