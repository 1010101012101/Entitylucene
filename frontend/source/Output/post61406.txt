How to make TextEdit open with a blank file by default? <body> In Lion, TextEdit used to open with a blank file by default. On Mountain Lion, it launches  with a file picker by default â€” either for choosing to store the file in iCloud or for opening a local file.  How can I make TextEdit launch with a blank file by default in Mountain Lion?  <answer61407> Go to System Preferences  iCloud  uncheck "Documents &amp; Data" from the sync list.   <answer111755> If you don't want to disable syncing documents and data, run  precodedefaults write -g NSShowAppCentricOpenPanelInsteadOfUntitledFile -bool false /code/pre  and quit and reopen TextEdit to apply the changes.  To restore (thanks to comments run)  precodedefaults delete -g NSShowAppCentricOpenPanelInsteadOfUntitledFile /code/pre  <answer169738> System Prefrences  iCloud  iCloud Drive ( Options )  uncheck textEdit  <comment70892> Doing this will remove the possibility to save and sync documents and data from any application in OS X. <comment70893> It's the only way - otherwise, it'll prompt whether you want to save a document to iCloud or locally. Remove iCloud from the mix, you get a blank document locally. <comment111144> Thanks, that was annnnoooyyying as hell! <comment135622> This is the right answer. <comment138716> And, to reverse this if necessary, I think the necessary incantation is `defaults delete -g NSShowAppCentricOpenPanelInsteadOfUntitledFile` <comment168323> Man this was bugging me.  Glad you asked this question. <comment181068> Awesome answer. I salute you. <comment181919> Also works on Yosemite 10.10. <comment266403> On OS X El Capitan, I had to also follow these steps:  Open Text Edit, Create New Document, Exit, Completely Quit TextEdit. After that, a new blank page came by default (at least for now) <comment328427> does this have any side effects? (does it affect other apps?) <comment332079> @user3684424 merely quitting and restarting is sufficient to get this command to take effect. (you can skip the "create new document" step) <comment340384> AWESOME... Thank you so much!
