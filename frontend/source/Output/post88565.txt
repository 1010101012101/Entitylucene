Reload driver for USB card reader without restart? <body> I have a USB card reader that I use for online banking (Handelsbanken, Sweden) purposes. Ever so often the driver to this card reader stops working and forces me to restart the computer. The broken connection between the driver and the card readers is indicated in several ways:  ol liWhen I connect the card reader to my computer some graphics should appear on the card readers display after a succesful initialization. These graphics are never displayed/li liWhen I launch the administative application it says the card reader is not connected/li /ol  I have looked at the files the driver installs in Installer. It installs the following files:   /private/var/db/receipts/com.todos.shbecr.shbecr.pkg.bom /private/var/db/receipts/com.todos.shbecr.shbecr.pkg.plist /usr/libexec/SmartCardServices/drivers/shbecr.bundle /usr/libexec/SmartCardServices/drivers/shbecr.bundle/Contents /usr/libexec/SmartCardServices/drivers/shbecr.bundle/Contents/Info.plist /usr/libexec/SmartCardServices/drivers/shbecr.bundle/Contents/MacOS /usr/libexec/SmartCardServices/drivers/shbecr.bundle/Contents/MacOS/shbecr /usr/libexec/SmartCardServices/drivers/shbecr.bundle/Contents/Resources /usr/libexec/SmartCardServices/drivers/shbecr.bundle/Contents/Resources/English.lproj /usr/libexec/SmartCardServices/drivers/shbecr.bundle/Contents/Resources/English.lproj/InfoPlist.strings  Trying to execute the only binary file above, /usr/libexec/SmartCardServices/drivers/shbecr.bundle/Contents/MacOS/shbecr returns the following error message:  -bash: /usr/libexec/SmartCardServices/drivers/shbecr.bundle/Contents/MacOS/shbecr: cannot execute binary file  file on this binary file returns  /usr/libexec/SmartCardServices/drivers/shbecr.bundle/Contents/MacOS/shbecr: Mach-O fat file with 2 architectures: [ : Mach-O ppc_7400 bundle ] [ I386: Mach-O i386 bundle ]  I can see the card reader in USB Prober  precode------------------------------------------- Full Speed device @ 4 (0xFD120000): .............................................

I am sick of it and wonder if there is a way to restart the driver for the card reader/reset USB ports or similar I can do without restarting the computer every time?  <answer127404> I have made some progress and a partial answer to my question is that it is not the driver that fails but Apple's smart card daemon. Restarting it  precodesudo killall pcscd sudo /usr/sbin/pcscd -fda /code/pre  has so far solved my problem everytime.  <comment103707> Refer to https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man8/kextunload.8.html &  https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man8/kextload.8.html â€” now you only have to find the right kext, if it is a kernel extension. Everything else would only require the device to be disconnected and reconnected. AFAIK as a developer.. :) <comment103914> Thanks for you answer. I know about kext(un)load but as I wrote in the question, the installer does not install a kext, just some kind of binary in /usr/libexec. Maybe there is a smartcard reader subsystem in Mac OS X that triggers when something that identifies itself as a cardreader is connected to the USB port?  Would appreciate further comments and ideas. <comment301714> How did you find the process "pcscd". My USB mouse stops working and I guess its the same reason. <comment303019> pcscd seems to have been replaced by something else in newer versions of the OS. There is something called com.apple.ctkpcscd that might interesting. Google it!
