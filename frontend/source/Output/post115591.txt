How do I get rid of the Appstore's update notification? <body> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/PaRXb.png" alt="enter image description here"  How can I get rid of that type of notification without actually opening the Appstore? The fact that it will stay there until I actually open it is pretty annoying.  OSX Mountain Lion.  <answer115603> You can disable the automatic check for updates in System Preferences → App Store.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gvsPk.png" width="500"  When it does not check for updates, it won't make notifications. :)  <answer115609> You can swipe to the right to dismiss the notification.  From emMac Basics: Notifications keep you informed/em     To dismiss an alert notification without interacting with it, use your pointer to swipe the banner to the right.   <comment135327> This only works for banners, not alerts. <comment135362> @grgarside are you sure. Apple explicitly mentions "alert notification" <comment135365> Well, I can only swipe banners — the alerts don't move… <comment138245> I managed to swipe it. Thanks.
