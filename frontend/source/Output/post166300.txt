Sorting text with diacritics on OS X gives wrong results <body> Using postgresql I've noticed strange ordering issues. While investigating further, I've found a very informative post. I've inspected further and it is true that LC_LOCALE files are the same for sl_SI.UTF-8, de_DE.UTF-8 and en_US.UTF-8 locales (and probably all others as well!).  A simple test-case on OSX: create a file named codede/code with contents:  precodeu ü ö a b c f g x /code/pre  and from the Terminal, run codeLANG="de_DE.UTF-8" LC_ALL="de_DE.UTF-8" sort de/code. The output is:  precodea b c f g u x ö ü /code/pre  where expected output (for instance, if I run this on Ubuntu linux) is:  precodea b c f g ö u ü x /code/pre  My system has local files for those languages and I see differences between en_US.UTF-8 and de_DE.UTF-8, just not in LC_COLLATE. Is there some reason OS X does not use LC_COLLATE settings? A related question: Case-insensitive ls sorting in Mac OSX   <comment263165> Any luck solving this? I have the same problem! <comment263287> @Proghero No, unfortunately not. OS X is just for development, so not a deal breaker, but strange nontheless.
