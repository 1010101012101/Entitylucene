automount: Another automount is running <body> I'm trying to reload NFS mounts on my machine. What has worked in the past is:  precodesudo dscl . delete Mounts/ exit sudo autmount -vc /code/pre  But now I get the error:  precodeautomount: Another automount is running /code/pre  Doing a   precodesudo ps -ax | grep automount /code/pre  shows there's only one process (besides the grep command itself) that contains "automount":  precodeadmin% sudo ps -ax | grep -i automount 59770 ??         0:00.01 /usr/sbin/automount 60201 ttys018    0:00.00 grep -i automount /code/pre  I've tried killing it and rerunning codesudo automount -vc/code and codesudo automount -vcu/code, but no luck.   Has anyone else encountered this error message, or have any ideas on how to fix it?  I'm running Mac OS X 10.10.1 (Yosemite) on my local machine. If it's useful at all, the remote file server is running Mac OS X 10.7.5.   <answer295169> I see a process autofsd, which is performing the auto mount, but I run Mac OS X 10.12.6 so maybe that is different.  When I run automount it updates the mounts (from the auto_master file)  <comment306490> Should the title of this question be: "How can I fix automount: Another automount is running?"
