Applescript remote control volume <body> Wondering how to turn up the volume on my computer from another computer.  precodeset volume 4 of machine remMachine /code/pre  doesn't work Any suggestions?  <answer238684> In order to remotely control a Mac, say your desktop machine, you must first set it up for commands to be sent to it. To do this, launch strongSystem Preferences/strong  strongSharing/strong on the Mac you want to control. Click the box next to strongRemote Apple Events/strong, and set user restrictions if you need to.  Next, you will need the IP address. In strongSystem Preferences/strong, switch to strongNetwork/strong and locate your machine’s strongIP address/strong. It should be something like, strong192.168.0.3/strong. Copy that address to proceed to the next step. You can also use the machine’s Bonjour name which can be found at the top of the strongSharing/strong pane in System Preferences. Its address will be spelled similar to this one: "strongsmith-nancy-computer.local/strong"  Now from another Mac, create your applescript like this:  precodetell application "Finder" of machine "eppc://192.163.0.3" set volume 4 end tell /code/pre  hr  h3Sidenote:/h3  emUnfortunately I don't have a second Mac to test this on, so if anyone can improve this answer if it doesn't work, please feel free to make changes or add comments./em  <answer238812> Thanks guys! :) I have figured out the solution. Turns out my original script was  code     set remMachine to "eppc://user@1.2.3.4.local" using terms from application "Finder"      set volume 10 of machine remMachine end using terms from   /code  Thank you for all the help :) The solved script was: code       set remMachine to "eppc://user@1.2.3.4.local"     tell application "Finder" of machine remMachine         set volume 10     end tell /code  <comment292777> Well, its address won't be **"smith-nancy-computer.local"**, but it'll be the name of your computer, spaces replaced with dashes (and other symbols removed/replaced) and end with _.local_. (This is for @Shrey Somaiya) <comment292820> IPv4 addresses have **4** octets, **not 5** as you've shown! <comment292853> @Brick of course that won't be the name of the computer, but it's an ideal example just like the IP address is not going to be exact, its an example. I never said "It will be", instead I opted for suggestive language "...similar to this one" <comment292854> @user3439894 good catch ! <comment292904> Yes @Danijel-JamesW I'm just helping you further explain... <comment292923> I think i should delete this post, the reason it didnt work int he first time is because i had the syntax wrong. Thank you for all the help guys! <comment292954> Please leave the question here on Stackexchange. It's good for historical reference and then other users might find a use from this information too.
