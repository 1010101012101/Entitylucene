Mac recovery problem <body> So I was running Yosemite and I wanted to try to install the windows 10 tech preview. I backed up all of my files and downloaded windows tech preview. I tested it in a virtual machine and it worked just fine.  I then used boot camp to make a bootable flash drive and partition. I then tried to install windows. I got to the select a partition screen and had it format the boot camp partition. After a minute it said it couldn't install to the partition because it wasn't formatted correctly.  After this I shutdown I wanted to boot into my Mac partition to get rid of the windows side. When it rebooted neither side showed up to boot into.  Next I tried an Internet recovery and time machine restore but neither can find my had drive. In disk utility it appears to show up but it is called media, has 0 bytes of memory, and won't let me do anything.  I was wondering if you had any idea of what to do next.  The text that comes from entering diskutil list into command prompt is:  precode-bash-3.2# diskutil list /dev/disk0    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:                                                   *0 B        disk0 /dev/disk1    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:     Apple_partition_scheme                        *1.2 GB     disk1    1:        Apple_partition_map                         30.7 KB    disk1s1    2:                  Apple_HFS Mac OS X Base System    1.2 GB     disk1s2 /dev/disk2    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:                            untitled               *524.3 KB   disk2 /dev/disk3    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:                            untitled               *524.3 KB   disk3 /dev/disk4    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:                            untitled               *524.3 KB   disk4 /dev/disk5    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:                            untitled               *524.3 KB   disk5 /dev/disk6    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:                            untitled               *524.3 KB   disk6 /dev/disk7    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:                            untitled               *6.3 MB     disk7 /dev/disk8    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:                            untitled               *2.1 MB     disk8 /dev/disk9    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:                            untitled               *1.0 MB     disk9 /dev/disk10    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:                            untitled               *524.3 KB   disk10 /dev/disk11    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:                            untitled               *524.3 KB   disk11 /dev/disk12    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:                            untitled               *1.0 MB     disk12 /code/pre  Here are the other commands  precode-bash-3.2# diskutil cs list No CoreStorage logical volume groups found  -bash-3.2# fdisk -d /dev/rdisk0 0,0,0x00,-,0,0,0,0,0,0 0,0,0x00,-,0,0,0,0,0,0 0,0,0x00,-,0,0,0,0,0,0 0,0,0x00,-,0,0,0,0,0,0  -bash-3.2# gpt show /dev/rdisk0 gpt show: unable to open device '/dev/rdisk0': Operation not supported by device -bash-3.2#  /code/pre  <comment191535> please start to recovery mode, open terminal from utilities in the menubar, enter 'diskutil list' and 'diskutilcs list' and add the output to your question <comment191556> I think that second command should be `diskutil cs list`. Also, please include the output from `fdisk -d /dev/rdisk0` and `gpt show /dev/rdisk0`. BTW, this sounds like a failed disk, but I woudn't assume that yet. I've seen something like this with a flash disk when its formatting got rather messed up (but I fixed it before I'd learned exactly what was wrong). <comment191665> I don't know if this helps but I'm running Linux from a flash drive and I am able to see both partitions on the hard drive. I the Mac side I can see all the folders but no files (because I don't have permission) and the properties show the proper amount of space being used. The windows side is the right size but completely blank. <comment192071> Until a solution is found i discovered a workaround. I put an Ubuntu installer onto a flash drive and booted into it. When the first window showed up I hit the gear in the top right and chose restart. Hold option when it starts up. You should now see the Mac hard drive and you can boot into it. Everything works until you shutdown/hibernate and then you just repeat
