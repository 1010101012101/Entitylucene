TexMaker, permanent changing of the path <body> I just update my MacBook with the last OS, El Capitan. I follow all the suggestions (link-1 and link-2) in order to make TexMaker work in a proper way, but when I relaunch the application all the changes in the paths are back as the origin so I always have to specify code/Library/Tex/texbin/code instead of code/usr/texbin/code. How I can make this changes permanent?   There is a different setting in the terminal or system settings where I should specify the right path?  <answer212122> I edit the settings opening the program as administrator.  <comment255151> Please help us to help you by providing links to "all the suggestion" - so we know what you have & haven't tried.
