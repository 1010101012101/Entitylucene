OS X Parallels: what are ways to speed up Windows 10 Pro virtualization? <body> We have two OS X laptops running Windows 10 Pro in Parallels where the other laptop is terribly slow, despite allocating 4 "cores" and 8 GB to the virtual machine. Each laptop has 8 "cores" (with Hyper Threading) and 16 GB. We don't know yet why the other laptop is so slow.  strongWhat are ways to speed up Windows 10 Pro virtualisation in OS X's Parallels?/strong  <comment356670> "Terribly slow" in comparison to what?  Are they *identical* laptops in both hardware and software?  It's a bit vague on the details. <comment356676> @Allan yes they are identical, The slower is setup a little bit later than The faster.
