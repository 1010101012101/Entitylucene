It did the trick for my needs and backed up all my work sms messages from my iphone. My girlfriend uses it too however, she is on a mac. The cool thing is that the program also saved my sms images, which I hadn't even expected. Has anyone tried any of the other tools?? Curious about them.  <answer12442> I rely on PhoneView which you correctly note is a Mac OS X only paid solution.  It has always been updated very quickly by the developers each time a new iOS is released. I even received support several times for pre-release / beta versions of iOS and iTunes. Support emails are promptly answered and I have twice received custom builds from them to resolve issues using their product with pre-release iOS versions to assist me in managing the devices I use for iOS development.  I've used PhoneView to save data from a phone that iTunes said was broken and could only be erased and then restored. It's been a reliable swiss army knife for me filling in many gaps that iTunes and Xcode leave for managing iOS devices.   <answer31858> AllYourTexts - free - Windows  emFull disclosure: I'm the author./em  ul liAllows you to view SMS and MMS data from your PC/li liSupports exporting to plaintext or HTML files./li liShows you graph visualizations of your texting behavior over time./li /ul  I was looking for a solution to this myself and I was unhappy with the 3rd party offerings.

Kies is free for Samsung phones.  It was necessary to 'update drivers' from one of the menus in Kies before this worked for me. Kies also prevents me running Android File Transfer on 10.8, so I uninstalled Kies once the import was complete.  Otherwise, I've successfully used DiskAid on the Mac to export my SMSs to a flat text file.  A useful reference, but I'd rather it exported a friendly (ie standard) SQLite database so I could easily use the data elsewhere.  DiskAid is $29.90 at the time of answer, but they also offer free educational licenses to folk with email addresses at tertiary institutions.  <answer81403> I used CopyTrans Contacts for Windows (not sure whether it also operates on Mac) to export my iPhone SMS and iMessage text messages to my PC.

I use it most of the time to bypass iTunes when loading content/backing up in game purchases. <comment78176> After trying out AllYourTexts, i can honestly say that this is the most simple and easy to use software for exporting text messages.
