Creating Calendars on my Mac <body> I would like to be able to take my iCal off iCloud entirely. I've attempted to disable it using both iCloud preferences and iCal account settings- and both times the calendars disappeared. However, that means that every time I attempt to create a new calendar, there is no option for where to do it. Without the FileNew CalendariCloud option, they simply don't exist. Shouldn't there be a FileNew CalendarOn My Mac option? Is it possible that I deleted my "On My Mac" folder?   Thanks! Unsure   <comment135107> Are you trying to create a new calendar or keep your iCloud calendars after iCloud is turned off? <comment135127> What OS do you have?
