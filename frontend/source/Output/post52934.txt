Any app that will automatically size and lock Finder windows? <body> For several years I was Windows-only at work and used a great utility that resized and locked my Explorer windows.  I'm surprised I haven't come across this for the Mac as I am always repositioning, sizing my windows. Does anyone know if such an app exists?  <answer52936> What do you mean "repositioning, sizing" your windows? Are they always appearing in the wrong location, at the wrong size so you have to fuss with them and get them the way you like?  If so, the solution is built-in to the Finder. Close all but one Finder window and put it where you want it. Hit kbdâŒ˜/kbd+kbdJ/kbd to show the view options window (fuss with any settings you want in there), and hit "Use as Defaults". Then close the options window and the Finder window and your settings should stick.  One caveat: any folder window for which you've set a position/size will open at that preset size and ignore your defaults. Just move it to the right position and it should stay there. If it doesn't, close it, delete the code.DS_Store/code file from the Terminal, and reopen - it should then obey your defaults.  <answer52937> If what you are looking for is a way of arranging a window to fill any of the sides of the screen, ShiftIt is the most popular choice.  You can find here a lot more.   <answer52945> FinderMinder resizes Finder windows when they are opened. There is a small delay before windows are resized and you have to keep it running on the background though.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/I4nGw.png" alt=""  I use this script to reset the properties of windows manually:  precodetell application "Finder"     if number of windows is 0 then return     tell Finder window 1         set toolbar visible to false         set sidebar width to 0         set statusbar visible to false         set current view to column view         set bounds to {474, 250, 1318, 750}         tell its column view options             set shows icon to false         end tell     end tell end tell /code/pre  When you move or resize a window, Finder saves its dimensions to a .DS_Store file. You can make all folders use the default dimensions by deleting .DS_Store files:  precodesudo find / -name .DS_Store -delete &amp;&amp; killall Finder /code/pre  It also removes Spotlight comments, resets the positions of icons in icon view, and removes folder-specific sorting modes and view options.  <answer82139> strongFinder Window Manager/strong "FWM" is an excellent app that saves window setups (snapshots). Go here.  <answer86161> It seems like Moom should be mentioned in this context. Very capable little app. Save window layout snapshots, move windows, resize them etc. It's $10, well worth the price.  <comment60534> Search on the [tag:window-manager] tag to get a sense of the options available. One is specifically on Windows 7 similarity and others are just decent window managers to help with tiling. There are well over 20 available and reviewed here. <comment104607> This is close - http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/16217/window-management-app-on-mac-os-x
