OpenGL 2.0 on Windows 10 on VirtualBox on El Capitan <body> Some software running on Windows 10 requires me to have OpenGL 2.0. I'm running Windows 10 in VirtualBox, which is on El Capitan.  How do I install OpenGL 2.0?  emPlease explain as if speaking to a layman./em code:)/code  Error message given by the software:     Required OpenGL extensions: GL_VERSION_2_0, GL_ARB_framebuffer_object, GL_ARB_texture_compression, are unsupported. Please update your computer's graphics drivers or verify that your graphics card supports the listed features. If this error persists after updating the drivers, you will most likely need to upgrade your graphics card.   <answer251906> You need to install a VNC client so you can connect from any android tablet or phone. Once you do this, you should then install MESS and run the BIOS package installer for PS4. From your android tablet, run the VNC viewer to go into Windows 10 and start ePSXe. From the configuration settings in ePSX, you should be able to select OpenGL as your video drivers. Select any game, and you're all set!  The graphics are incredibly smooth on the tablet. It's like holding a PS4 in your hands!  <answer271452> VirtualBox Guest Additions for Windows 8 or later no longer add the necessary registry entries to enable OpenGL support.  Based on comments in No OpenGL Support for Windows 8 and related links I was able to craft the following Registry file to add the missing OpenGL keys...  precodeWindows Registry Editor Version 5.00  [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Class\{4d36e968-e325-11ce-bfc1-08002be10318}\0000] "OpenGLDriverName"="VBoxOGL.dll" "OpenGLDriverNameWow"="VBoxOGL-x86.dll" "OpenGLFlags"=dword:00000001 "OpenGLFlagsWow"=dword:00000001 "OpenGLVersion"=dword:00000001 "OpenGLVersionWow"=dword:00000001  [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\OpenGLDrivers\MSOGL] "DriverVersion"=dword:00000001 "Flags"=dword:00000001 "Version"=dword:00000001 "DLL"="VBoxOGL.dll" /code/pre  Due to hardware detection that happens at various points there is proper order of doing this as well:  ol liEnable 3D acceleration on your guest embefore/em powering it up to install Windows./li liInstall Windows 10./li liInstall VirtualBox guest additions and reboot./li liImport the above Registry file and reboot./li /ol  Note that this is emlimited/em OpenGL support - it only enables things up to API Level OpenGL 2.1. Some things work fine, others not so much. e.g.: Blender 2.78 refused to start before this change, citing lack of OpenGL support, but afterwards it starts... and just displays a white window.  strongUpdate 2017-03-04:/strong  Blender's all-white window issues were fixed by downloading their software-based OpenGL driver, ftp://ftp.blender.org/sergey/softwaregl/win64/opengl32.dll, and copying it into the folder codeC:\Program Files\Blender Foundation\Blender/code  It obviously won't be performant like this but at least it's usable... which is important because a lot of Blender add-ons only work on Windows (e.g.: Bos FBX Importer/Exporter only works on win64 systems).  <comment303570> OGL 'base spec' is OGL 2.1, which pretty much every Mac [& Boot Camp] since OS X is capable of running... so, could you be more specific? See [Apple KB: Mac computers that use OpenCL and OpenGL graphics](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT202823) <comment303572> What do you mean by more specific? What info do you want? I'll post the error message given by the software right now, in case it give the specifics you are looking for. <comment303573> error messages are good - they give clues... <comment303574> OK, I've added it. Also, regarding your link, my computer is: MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Mid 2014). <comment303598> I'd see if you can get updated graphics drivers direct from [Intel](http://downloadcenter.intel.com/default.aspx?) for the Iris 5100 & see if those will install. As you aren't in Boot camp I can't think of another way. <comment303667> Could such a method potentially seriously harm my computer? <comment303674> I doubt it, really
