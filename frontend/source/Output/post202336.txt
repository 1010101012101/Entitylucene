Can I move Mobile Sync folder to another HD <body> Can I move my MobileSync folder to another HD on my iMac to free up space on my startup HD?  <answer202358> You can move the folder to another drive, then use a symbolic link back to the original location, so iTunes can still find it.  A symbolic link is a bit like a shortcut or alias, that the system can use to target a file or folder in another location.br Because of the rather arcane method you'd need to employ in Terminal to generate them, I've always used a little freeware app that sets itself up as a Service in OS X, meaning you can access it through the right-click menu - SymbolicLinker  After Installing this [reboot may be required if it doesn't immediately show in the right-click menu], the procedure would be    ul liMove your MobileSync folder to your new drive, Cmd/drag will move rather than copy.  /li liRight-click the folder in its new location, go to Services at the bottom of the menu, then Make Symbolic Link  /li liCmd/drag the created link back to the original location in ~Library/Application Support/  /li liChange its name to remove the 'symlink' at the end, so it has the original name MobilSync  /li liDone./li /ul  <comment244070> possible duplicate of [What is Mobile Sync - Backup and why is it taking so much space?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/63207/what-is-mobile-sync-backup-and-why-is-it-taking-so-much-space) <comment244071> Which folder/path are you referring to here? <comment244073> This question is a possible duplicate of http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/63207/what-is-mobile-sync-backup-and-why-is-it-taking-so-much-space. While you should not move the folder, you can follow the advice of the accepted answer to free up space from this folder. <comment244078> I see no reason this is a dupe - connected, sure, but not a dupe as such. The linked question is 'what is it & why is it so big'. This is 'can I move it', to which the answer is yes. I suppose one may question *why* it needs to be moved, as in 'is this an XY question?', but it can be, if needed, so I see no reason it can't stand on its own. <comment263277> Tetsujin is right, I follow his instructions & freed up 60Gb of space!, but his link to SymbolicLinker is broken; use this one [http://download.cnet.com/SymbolicLinker/3000-18487_4-33926.html](http://download.cnet.com/SymbolicLinker/3000-18487_4-33926.html) <comment371291> Even better place would be the official Github repo https://github.com/nickzman/symboliclinker/releases
