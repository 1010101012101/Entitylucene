cmd-z switches active monitor <body> So a couple days ago I hooked up an HP monitor to my MB Pro 15". As I was editing code on the external monitor, I pressed cmd-z to undo something I had just done (like everybody in this world does..). But instead of undoing, it jumped back to my MB monitor to make it "active". So whenever I press kbdCmd/kbd+kbdz/kbd, it jumps to the other monitor.  Does anybody have any idea what this is from? I've never experienced this before. I didn't see anything in my keyboard shortcuts that would seem to indicate that it switched.   EDIT: depending on the full screen app that it's in, it may switch to a different app first, then go to the other monitor. So it's actually like it's cycling through apps until it hit's the "home" app/screen on each monitor, then just switches back and forth between them..if that makes any sense..
