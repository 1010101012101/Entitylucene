Finder does not show Xcode project icon properly after upgrade to Xcode 7 <body> I upgraded to Xcode 7, and in Finder project icon become white icons, why? Pressing i.e. ClangFormat.xcodeproj will open Xcode, but still it is annoying. Earlier it was a blue like icon.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ItXZG.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment257718> delete these cache folders and reboot :  `/Library/Caches`  |  `/System/Library/Caches`  |  `/Users/{YOUR_USERNAME}/Library/Caches` <comment257719> deleted them rebooted, but did not help <comment257720> are you on Yosemite ? <comment257721> yes I am on Yosemite 10.10.5 <comment257723> download the cache cleaner from http://www.northernsoftworks.com/download.html  open it go to Demo - maintenance and clear all cache - reboot, if this still doesn't work reinstall Xcode <comment257789> You may also be able to do a Get Info on one of the files, change Open With to something else, then change it back to Xcode. I've had that fix this very issue (although with a different file type).
