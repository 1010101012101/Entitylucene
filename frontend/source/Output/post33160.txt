What is the best handwriting recognition app for a college student to take notes with on an iPad 1? <body> What is the best app on an iPad 1 for basic note taking using handwriting recognition using a stylus? Iâ€™m looking for a no frills app that will enable exporting notes into formats viewable on other devices. Features such as facebook integration, twitter integration, etc are not necessary.
