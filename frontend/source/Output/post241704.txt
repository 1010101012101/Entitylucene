iPhone Acting Sporadically After Screen Replacement <body> I typically do not deal with smartphones. I've always had the tools for the ability to fix them, as I am a technician, but they have hardly been used.  A few days ago, my good friend called me up and asked if I could come fix her iPhone 5C. Said it was cracked and had some slight screen distortion.  I bought an OEM screen off Amazon (Bad idea, I know) and thought it was going to work.  It was very difficult for me to get the screen working after many different issues arose.  First, there was no display on the new digitizer/LCD screen. I had to reseat the connector multiple times before that worked.  Next, it was the touchscreen not working. That eventually got working the same way the display did.  After we had everything working, I booted up the phone, and it working. The screen was on, slight touch issues, but thought it was nothing, and the camera was working. I had it on for hours before eventually handing it back over to my friend.  Less than an hour later, I got a call from her again. She said that after she did a restart in hopes of fixing the lagging of the phone, white lines appeared all down the screen.   I've been on a video call for the past few hours but have had no luck.   What should my next plan of action be? Try to restore the phone in hopes its some sort of software glitch? Try to clean the connectors again with Isopropyl Alcohol?  I'm trying my hardest to avoid the need for Apple's help or getting a new screen. Though, both seem very probable options at this moment.  Thank you!
