How to continue running Apple TV preview movies or songs <body> I like to continuous viewing  Apple TV preview movies or songs. Don't know how to set? Help Thanks  <comment208854> By "continuous" you mean what exactly? Just play all available movie previews one after the other? <comment208912> Yes, for example in restaurant like to have music video preview one after the others.
