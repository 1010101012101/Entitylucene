How to prevent TextEdit from commandline to cause Developer Unknown warning? <body> Is there any way (other than disabling Gatekeeper through preferences) to allow TextEdit to open my shell-script from a command-line? I'm more than ok with a dialog warning me, but the current dialog lacks the required "I know what I'm doing" option :(  I'm using something similar to Can I open files in TextEdit from the Terminal in Mac OS X? but when it pertains to an file with the executable flag, Gatekeeper throws an 'unknown developer' warning...
