Mac Terminal (+bash +tmux +set-o vi) missing characters at end of line <body> Often when editing a historical bash command in vi mode (after pressing code↑/code), and then moving backwards in the text using codeb/code. When I begin editing the text after pressing codei/code or codea/code, the extra text I insert pushes the following characters to the right. However, the line length appears fixed, and as characters move right, the line is truncated to the original length of the historical item I am trying to edit.  However, despite these characters being invisible, they are still "there" in the sense that they are executed along with the rest of the command.  Has anyone else ever seen this behaviour or know of a fix?  Note: I am on codeMac OS X 10.10.4/code using codeGNU bash, version 3.2.57(1)-release (x86_64-apple-darwin14)/code inside codetmux 2.0/code. Bash is in vi mode using codeset -o vi/code.  <comment238139> Does it work in bash outside of tmux? <comment238398> Have you customized your prompt to contain terminal commands?
