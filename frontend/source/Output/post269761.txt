Call/SMS through iPhone not working in MacBook Pro when connected to my home WiFi <body> I am not able to call or send/receive SMS from my MacBook Pro using my iPhone7, only when I am connected through my home WiFi. If I connect both of them to a different hotspot (wifi shared from another mobile), it works well. Also, I am not able to locate my Mac through Find My iPhone app also (also through the web portal). This also works fine if I am connected to another network.  All these stopped working just recently. I had been using all these features in the same network around a week back.  <comment342662> I am having the exact same problem. Everything was working fine until just recently (late-Jan 2017). At work, no issues, but at home, I can't make a call from my Mac, text messages don't come through, and I can't unlock my Mac with my Apple Watch. What happened?
