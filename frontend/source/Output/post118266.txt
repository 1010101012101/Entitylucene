How can I stop music from continuing to play after i answer a call? <body> Whenever I listen to music on my Iphone 4s and recieve a call the music stops to allow the phone to ring however when i answer it the music continues to play in the background making it difficult to hear the person on the other end. While im mid call its hard to turn off and usually have to hang up and ring the person back. Any idea how to fix this?  <comment138020> Just to clarify, is this using the built-in music app or another app?
