How to save a file to specific folder on a ipad <body> How can I simply store a file from gmail on iPad to a specific folder on iPad.  Is this possible ? I am able to do this on every other system (Android, Windows), but I am not able to do on this iPad.  Background:  I have an app called "Home Concert Xtreme" and this app can load .midi files. I have already tried the following: I stored the file to google drive. I can open the file in google drive, but it says it can't open. Then there is an option to open the file in a different app "OPEN IN". So I choose, but there is only Gmail, Reminders, Mail. In the more are the same apps for choice. So probably the general question is :How can I open a file a specific app ?  <comment271214> Basically you can't. But there might be other options: what kind of file is it, what do you want to do with it once it's saved? <comment271215> Thanks for helping. I updated the question with more details. <comment271217> Generally, the app itself needs to announce to the OS that it can accept that file-type, then it gets included in the 'open with' choices. You cannot 'store a file to a folder' in iOS, it simply doesn't work that way. Android & Windows have a very open architecture, iOS does not - which is partly why it's such a 'safe' OS to use - no antivirus needed. <comment271220> So in the end what does it means for my case. Can I forget it ? Or how to announce the filetype ? <comment271507> If the app doesn't provide the functionality, you can't override it. Either use a different means of transferring content to the app (e.g. iTunes or whatever the app itself offers) or contact the developer.
