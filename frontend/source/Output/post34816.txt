trouble deleting files from an external drive <body> When I try to delete folders/files from my External drive I get the below error after being asked to enter my admin password:  codeThe operation can’t be completed because you don’t have permission to access some of the items./code  This volume is codeMac OS X Extended (Journaled)/code and I am running code10.7.2/code  Permissions seem correct coderead/write/code and everything else is working fine.  <answer34820> ol liOpen Terminal/li liDrag folder you want to delete onto the Terminal icon in the dock/li liType codecd ../code in the new Terminal window in order to move to the parent directory./li liType codels/code to find out the exact name of the files/folders in the directory./li liType codesudo rm -r filename/code to delete the file/folder 'filename'.

You will need to drag the parent directory onto the icon.  <answer58080> Being lazy, and this is (I think), a slight improvement on GentMatt's great answer...  Before his step 5, you can highlight and copy the filename in terminal.  Then sudo rm -r , then paste.  This assures you are in fact, deleting the correct file.. Sometimes, there are two files with very close names..  It's probably a good idea to copy/paste as much as possible, in order to a) be lazy, and b) be more accurate...  Hope this helps.
