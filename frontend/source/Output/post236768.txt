Boot Camp Assistant: "This Mac does not support Boot Camp" <body> I have a 2009 Mac Pro (MacPro4,1) which, until recently, had both OS X Yosemite and a Boot Camp install of Windows 10 on it.  Shortly after I upgraded to El Capitan, I found that Boot Camp Assistant refused to run, reporting "This Mac does not support Boot Camp".  Furthermore, I am unable to use BootChamp to reboot into Windows, as it reports a cryptic message "Bless failed".  Any ideas what would cause Boot Camp to stop working?  <answer236769> The solution for fixing Boot Camp Assistant was the same as with previous versions of the OS: reset the NVRAM.  I found a discussion mentioning a similar problem with an upgrade to Yosemite here that I intiially disregarded as it referenced repairing permissions and running a Disk Verify, neither of which Disk Utility appears to support anymore.  As for BootChamp, it is no longer supported as of El Capitan.  System Integrity Protection prevents it from running.  <comment289833> Are you trying to install Windows? Or, is it that you can not boot to Windows? <comment290854> @DavidAnderson: The latter.  Updated question to reflect this. <comment290860> You can disable SIP if you want.
