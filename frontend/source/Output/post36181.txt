pmset standby is missing <body> I have two Macbook Pros (10.7.2) and both are missing the standby option in pmset:  precode$ pmset -g Active Profiles: Battery Power       -1 AC Power        -1* Currently in use:  womp       1  halfdim    1  sms        1  panicrestart   157680000  gpuswitch  2  hibernatefile  /var/vm/sleepimage  networkoversleep   0  disksleep  10  sleep      180  hibernatemode  3  ttyskeepawake  1  displaysleep   10  acwake     0  lidwake    1  $ pmset -g cap Capabilities for AC Power:  displaysleep  disksleep  sleep  womp  acwake  lidwake  halfdim  sms  gpuswitch /code/pre  I've seen this guy has this option:lion pmset standby Any ideas?  <answer36290> From the pmset man page:     STANDBY ARGUMENTS      emstandby/em causes kernel power management to automatically hibernate a   machine after it has slept for a specified time period. This saves power   while asleep. This setting defaults to ON for supported hardware. strongThe   setting standby will be visible in pmset -g if the feature is supported   on this machine./strong      standby only works if hibernation is turned on to hibernatemode 3 or 25.      emstandbydelay/em specifies the delay, in seconds, before writing the hiberna-   tion image to disk and powering off memory for Standby."   The bold text is my highlight.  This would indicate that the two Macbook Pros you're using do not support the standby arguments.  For a list of machines that support standby mode, see HT4392.  I hope this is helpful.
