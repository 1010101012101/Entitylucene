Spotlight search bar doesn't show up in middle of screen <body> For some reason, when I activate Spotlight, the bar shows up in the top right part of the screen instead of the middle. I've tried restarting and connecting to an external monitor, to no avail. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZROoM.jpg" alt="Screenshot of desktop"  <answer237511> The Spotlight window remembers its last location. You can drag it back to the original location â€” it snaps to the X and Y coordinates of the initial position, so you can ensure it is back where it started.  If the Spotlight bar does not remember its last location, make sure code~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.Spotlight.plist/code is writeable, as this plist file is where the coordinates are stored.  <answer238517> Click and hold the Spotlight icon on the menu bar, until the Spotlight window has returned to its original location.
