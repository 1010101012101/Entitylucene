Why does OS X Mavericks block the purge command in Terminal? <body> When I try the codepurge/code command on my terminal, OS X Mavericks gives me the following message:   pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"codeUnable to purge disk buffers: Operation not permitted /code/pre  This hasn't been the default behavior until now. I wonder why Apple changed that. Is there a reason behind this decision? What are the advantages/disadvantages of this?  <answer106626> You need to run this command with root privileges. Try:  precode&gt; sudo purge  WARNING: Improper use of the sudo command could lead to data loss or the deletion of important system files. Please double-check your typing when using sudo. Type "man sudo" for more information.  To proceed, enter your password, or type Ctrl-C to abort.  Password: /code/pre  Enter your account's password and it should run the purge command.  Apple probably made the decision for security purposes. The only disadvantage is you have to type in your admin password. The advantage is, for non-admin users, they can not run this command and potentially harm their OS.  Usually commands that require codesudo/code in order to run at all are potentially destructive or invasive. Two other commands with this requirement are codedtrace/code and codexcode-select/code.  <answer108412> I'm no expert, but it may have something to do with the compressed memory thingy in OS X 10.9     h2Doing more/h2      The more memory your Mac has at its disposal, the faster it works. But when you have multiple apps running, your Mac uses more memory. With OS X Mavericks, Compressed Memory allows your Mac to free up memory space when you need it most. As your Mac approaches maximum memory capacity, OS X automatically compresses data from inactive apps, making more memory available      h2Exrta Fast/h2      Once the memory is compressed, your Mac doesn’t have to waste time continually transferring data back and forth between memory and storage. So it’s able to get more done in less time. And since compressing and decompressing happens almost instantly, the only thing you’ll notice is how responsive everything feels. Especially when you’re doing everything at once.   supSource: codehttp://www.apple.com/osx/advanced-technologies//code (non-existing)/sup  See also: OS X Mavericks is more than Powerful: It’s Power Smart (PDF)  They emmay/em have done that do avoid the older program from interfeering with the new way of doing things. But I have no idea.  <answer117945> 'purge' does not release enough RAM. I am using SystemPal: https://itunes.apple.com/app/systempal/id453164367?mt=12 It works very well!  <answer138930> Using the codepurge/code command can have serious negative effects on the performance of the system (since you are essentially telling the kernel to forget all of its accumulated knowledge about your recent usage, walk through the inactive list and toss everything -- even if some process/driver was about to make use of it -- and then fault/recreate it all again from scratch).  Thus, it makes sense that it would require some level of privilege to execute it.  <answer233165> http://computers.tutsplus.com/tutorials/how-to-give-your-mac-a-performance-boost--mac-46271     strongCreating a Terminal Script to Purge the Memory/strong      ol   liStart by opening Terminal./li   liEnter the following line:  precodecd Desktop/ /code/pre      and press enter.

[This answer](http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/67048/60395) helped me to understand why it's not a good idea. <comment127533> I can not close a question as a duplicate across SE sites, so I blatantly copied your answer [here](http://superuser.com/questions/671328/purge-command-not-authorized/671440#671440). Feel free to post your own copy so I can delete my copy of your answer. <comment127535> @Hennes Thanks, I reposted this answer. <comment155292> What differences in behaviour make you believe a third party app from the Mac App Store can purge more memory than an OS X included tool from Apple? <comment163897> Or that any app/casual-user could make better decisions about memory management than the kernel? <comment284992> This does not solve the problem described in the question. Also, please fix the formatting of your post. <comment285004> Always source copied content (cc @patrix). <comment302057> Can you elaborate on "Apple probably made the decision for security purposes"? What kind of security issues do you believe the command purge creates?
