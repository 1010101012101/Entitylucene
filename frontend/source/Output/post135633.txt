Take a screenshot of the top-most window <body> I want to have an AppleScript that takes a screenshot of the front most application. I have used this AppleScript:  precodetell application "System Events" -- get frontmost process    set frontmostProcess to first process where it is frontmost -- this will be the script process    set visible of frontmostProcess to false -- hide the script process    repeat while (frontmostProcess is frontmost) -- wait until the script is hided        delay 0.2    end repeat    set secondFrontmost to name of first process where it is frontmost -- get name of frontmost process (ignoring the script process)    set frontmost of frontmostProcess to true -- unhide the script process end tell tell application secondFrontmost to set winID to id of window 1 -- get WindowID of frontmost window of frontmost process do shell script "screencapture -c -x -l " &amp; winID -- -c is used to store it in the clipboard. -x is used to mute the sound. -l is used to refer to the prefered windowid. /code/pre  but it doesn't work for Snow Leopard. If anybody could give me some guidance as to what is the unsupported section of the code, I'd be happy to go and research myself.  I think Snow Leopard doesn't support the codefrontmost/code part but I can't get any information to back this assumption up...  hr  kbdCmd/kbd+kbdShift/kbd+kbd4/kbd and kbdSpace/kbd and kbdClick Window/kbd does work but I want an Applescript so I could replace the shortcut to open the Applescript - which will automatically take a picture of the active window.   This is so I don't have to click space and then click the windows I want.   I take screenshots a lot and constantly clicking space and clicking is getting annoying now.   The applescript, essentially, skips the kbdspace/kbd+kbdclick window/kbd  <answer135643> Taking a screenshot of the front-most window (via shift-command-4 spacebar click) won't suit?   <answer136887> I just hacked together this little tool.   https://github.com/vorgos/QuickGrab  It is a command line tool that will capture the top most active window or any window you specify just like the code-l/code option in the newer version of codescreencapture/code.  Hope that helped.  <comment160788> Yes it does, but I was wanting an Applescript so I could replace the shortcut to open the Applescript so it automatically takes a picture of the active window - so I don't have to click `space` and then click the windows I want. I take screenshots a lot and constantly clicking space and clicking is getting annoying now. <comment160818> Are you sure that the '-l' option to screencapture is supported in 10.6 ?   It doesn't show up in the man page, or `screencapture -h`. <comment160825> @Kent I'm very new to Applescript so I was naive enough to use the outputs posted online for screencapture -h thinking they were 10.6.8. Thanks, I just checked it on my Terminal as well. DO you know of any way to select windowid in 10.6.8? Because that's what the script is based around :) <comment219104> This is excellent -- works well in scripts.
