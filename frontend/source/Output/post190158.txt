How can I get the raw text of an email in iOS Mail? <body> Does Apple Mail under iOS support the ability to get the raw as-sent text of an email? Alternatively, is there a way to forward an email strongas an attachment/strong?  I'd like to be able to report spam email to Spamcop.net, but I need all the headers and the raw source of the email, not just a copy of the rendered results.  <answer190198> OK. I think I've got this figured out.  First, you need to have access to a gmail account. Great if the original email is already address to one. Otherwise you'll need to forward to a gmail address (or an account that's accessible via Gmail).  Next, open Gmail in a browser on your iOS device. I used Chrome, but that may not matter. Go to gmail.google.com and sign in to your account. It will likely take you to the mobile version. Scroll down the page and you should see strongMobile/strong | Older version | Desktop. You want strongDesktop/strong.  Once there, open the email in question. Just under the address info for the email, you should see Reply, Reply all, Forward.... strongShow original/strong. Click Show original and you should be golden.  <answer190211> There is no way to do so directly from iOS Mail app, but you can forward it to another address which the corresponding client supports strongShow Original/strong option.  You can always do this sort of things with strongCydia tweaks/strong, but if your did not jailbreak your device, the way we said before is the only possible way.  strongNOTE:/strong The best way is always waiting for the new versions. WWDC 2015 takes place in San Francisco in June 8-12, and they will introduce new versions of iOS and OS X.
