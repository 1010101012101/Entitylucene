How to open a specific port in Firewall OS X 10.9.4 <body> How do I open a specific port in the firewall? I can not use the "allow connections from application" as I want to open the port for Jenkins, that is not on the list...  <answer142783> Apple's OS X Mavericks contains three firewalls. First of all, the Application Level Firewall which can be configured using the system settings. But there is also ipfw, a packet filtering firewall like netfilter/iptables on GNU/Linux and pf (FreeBSD/OpenBSD).  You can either configure emipfw/em using the command line, or using a graphical front-end like the free/libre WaterRoof.  You could start with an ipfw command like:  precodesudo ipfw add 31010 allow tcp from any to any dst-port 8080 /code/pre  <answer142788> ipfw is deprecated by Apple. Mountain Lion and later use pfctl.   http://support.apple.com/kb/ht5413  <answer180636> I had the same issue under OS X Yosemite (10.10.3).  Found this blog post that provides clear instructions.  We can't use ipfw any more, as it's deprecated.  Instead, use pfctl, which unfortunately lacks a nice command line way to tell it to open a port.  Instead, you need to:  ol liOpen /etc/pf.conf in a text editor./li liAdd a line like this: /li /ol     # Open port 8080 for TCP on all interfaces      pass in proto tcp from any to any port 8080   ol start="3" liSave the file./li liLoad the changes with:/li /ol     sudo pfctl -f /etc/pf.conf   If you need to open a udp port, change codetcp/code to codeudp/code, if you need both, add a second line.  Additional detail can be found in codeman pf.conf/code.  Also make sure your server is listening on the actual interface you want it accessible over (or all interfaces, using code0.0.0.0/code or code::0/code), not localhost (code127.0.0.1/code or code::1/code).  <answer260495> Here's a one liner rather than requiring the user to mess around with Vim. Useful for automation.  precodesed -i '' -e '$a\pass in proto tcp from any to any port 8080' /etc/pf.conf; pfctl -vnf /etc/pf.conf /code/pre  Or an alternative for Linux users  precodesed -i -e '$a\pass in proto tcp from any to any port 8080' /etc/pf.conf; pfctl -vnf /etc/pf.conf /code/pre  Just make sure you change code8080/code in the example to whatever you have in mind. Swap tcp with udp if you like.  <comment168195> What port(s) and protocols do you want Jenkins to be able to listen on? This post will help you see what ports it's configured on... http://stackoverflow.com/a/10106086/475228 <comment168197> On proto Tcp port 8080 <comment168199> Would this post covering `ipfw` be relevant? http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/33871/how-can-i-open-a-port-not-application-in-the-os-x-10-6-firewall <comment168850> can you post the specific command to open a port? <comment169009> If you want to add a specific port, then I think you need to edit the configuration file ( see http://krypted.com/mac-security/a-cheat-sheet-for-using-pf-in-os-x-lion-and-up/ and search for the part with 192.168).  On the other hand, if you want to ensure an application is not blocked, https://jamfnation.jamfsoftware.com/discussion.html?id=6566 has a pretty good summary in the final comment.  I still mostly use 10.6, so I haven't worked with pfctl much. <comment243311> Whoa, reboot? Do you really have to reboot to open a port? <comment258895> passing `-n` to pfctl verifies the rules, and pointedly does not load them.  Use just  `-f /etc/pf.conf` to load the rules.  Verify they are loaded with `pfctl -sr`.  However, while pfctl rules is necessary it does not appear by itself to be sufficient to allow access to a El Capitan on a given port. <comment258896> ... One must also make sure the application is bound to the host name (not `localhost`); one gets the hostname with `$ hostname` on the command line.  Also, one can restart the firewall, instead of rebooting, by going to System Preferences - Security & Privacy - Firewall - Turn Off Firewall and then Turn On Firewall. <comment306003> ipfw is deprecated and gone in El Capitan <comment367019> @Keen fantastic avatar - great memories!
