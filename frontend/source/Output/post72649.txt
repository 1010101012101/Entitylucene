Applications in the Menu Bar & The Ability to choose which are Active upon startup? <body> Are the applications located towards the right side of the menu bar next to system icons automatically active upon boot up of an apple mac. What decides which apps sit there &amp; is there a way to choose which apps are active and sit in the menu bar by default at startup ?  Indeed if one is using a 13" Macbook Pro (like myself) or even an 11" Macbook Air, what happens when the number of apps gets to the extent where they begin to close the gap towards what I believe is usually stronghelp/strong located towards the left of the menu bar. If your using a 27" display I guess this scenario doesnt occur.  Is there a way to minimise those apps in the menu bar whilst keeping them active if required ?  Thankyou  <answer72650> You can use Bartender to hide status menu items and menu extras.  Many applications have options to disable opening them at login or to hide the status menu items. You can also remove login items from System Preferences.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZJR3F.png" alt=""  <comment84344> Oh Lauri, you answered so quickly :), i'll chackout Bartender.
