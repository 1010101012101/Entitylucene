Problem with "csrutil enable --without debug" on Sierra <body> I am using a Mac on Sierra 10.12.5.  I want to run the app XtraFinder which opens some additional features in Finder. I used to have it on different computer, but when I download it on this one I got this error:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nPNi7.png" alt="enter image description here"  So I followed the link.  When I run the "csrutil enable --without debug" command I got the error: "unknown command emwithout/em".  Is it something that I do wrong?  <answer295248> You need to partially disable System Integrity Protection. I do not encourage you to disable System Integrity Protection. It makes your computer less safe.  strongHow to partially disable System Integrity Protection/strong  ol liBoot to Recovery OS by restarting your machine and holding down the kbdcmd/kbd and kbdr/kbd keys at startup/li liLaunch Terminal from the Utilities menu/li liEnter the following command: codecsrutil enable --without debug/code/li liReboot your computer/li /ol  <comment372740> Well, I did those steps as I said in my OP. The problem is in the error: "unknown command without" (as I also said in my OP). <comment372744> Donâ€™t you need to first `csrutil -disable` to turn off all SIP and then selectively re-enable? Been a while since I have run without full sip..... <comment372745> Did you make sure to type the entire command as it is shown? Remember to include "csrutil enable" and two dashes before "without debug" <comment372746> Can you `csrutil` to show status before you enable it? Can you disable entirely and then check status? (All while still booted to the recovery OS)
