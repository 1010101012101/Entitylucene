MacBook Pro Retina Boot Camp GeForce 337.88 Driver <body> I have a 15" MacBook Pro Retina, Late 2013 (GeForce GT 750M) and while running Boot Camp 5.1 in Windows 7. The NVIDIA GeForce Experience taskbar icon asked me to download and install:  GeForce 337.88 Driver  Is it OK to install this driver, or should I just stick with what's installed in the Boot Camp 5.1 drivers?  <comment155766> the decision is based on WHO asked you to install a driver? <comment156946> It was the NVIDIA GeForce Experience taskbar icon. I updated my answer to make that clearer. Thanks.
