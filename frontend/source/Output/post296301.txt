Homebrew install package which then won't run <body> I've installed homebrew and used it successfully for installing and using packages before. But when I installed a packaged called "shpotify" that can be used to control spotify from the command line, Homebrew installs it successfully, but then when I try to run it, I get an error "zsh: command not found: shpotify" Do you know what could be causing this?  <answer296319> Most probable answer:  The project is called shpotify.  The installed binary is called codespotify/code  Use that as your command.  <comment374233> Homebrew installs packages within their own containers then symlinks those files to the appropriate hierarchy within /usr/local or requires you too.
