How to recover an Excel spreadsheet after it disappears due to locking up the iPad? <body> I had a data sheet open on my iPad on Excel. I did not save nor close the program. I locked my iPad and when I unlocked it the data sheet was gone.  How can I get it back?  <comment311927> What might be is that your device memory was used up which caused Excel to shut thru the OS level and in such case unfortunately its irreversible.
