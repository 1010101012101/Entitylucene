Any way to know what wakes an Mac up? <body> Regularly while sleeping my Mac wakes up and i'd like to know if there is some kind of log of what trigged the waking. (Mouse click ? Keyboard ? WOL Magic Packet ? Something else ?)  I'm on late 2012 iMac with 10.8.3   PS: "Wake for network access" is enabled.   <answer91009> In System Preferences under Energy Saver, is there a check in the checkbox for emEnable Power Nap while plugged into a power adapter/em?  If so, then this is possibly why your iMac is waking up.  The description of Power Nap in System Preferences says: "While sleeping, your Mac can back up using Time Machine and periodically check for new email, calendar, and other iCloud updates".  <answer98614> I'll answer to myself  precodesyslog |grep -i "Wake reason" /code/pre  gives the wake reason from the syslog for example : RTC, GiGE, Bonjour etc.   <comment106880> It's not a MacBook therefore I haven't PowerNap <comment106881> Yikes!  You are correct, Power Nap is a laptop-only feature - my apologies!  Source: http://support.apple.com/kb/ht5394 <comment106889> How about the bluetooth mouse and keyboard. My guess is there's a setting that allows them to wake the computer and that setting is adjustable. <comment106908> I only use the Bluetooth Keyboard, the mouse is Wired. FYI it's on the mouse's LED that I see that the Mac is on. (Screen stays off). But I'l try disabling the option you mentioned. <comment106925> Do you have a wireless or wired LAN? <comment106936> I use only my Ethernet connection. <comment107007> Then disable "Wake for network access". See if you still have the issue. I can not use this option because probably my WRT54GL wakes my iMac from sleep. <comment107038> Well it seems that it was my problem. My Mac gets woken up by a network access... <comment107059> If you want WOL, you can go wireless with airport express (I think it supports wake up over wireless). If wake up is a must.
