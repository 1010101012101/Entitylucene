Detach a tab in a fullscreen window in Chrome <body> Is there a way to detach a tab in a fullscreen Chrome window? I find no way. When I need to do this, I have to un-maximize the window, drag to detach the tab, and then restore the window in fullscreen again. This is burdensome.  <answer145444> I'd been idly wondering about this for a month or two as well. The answer is no, but there is an extension that can enable a keyboard shortcut that does the same thing. Here's a link to the Google Product Forums topic that helped me, too. I haven't tested this extension myself, but the user who posted on Google Forums did.  <answer237486> It seems like the extension suggested by Matthew had stopped working for a while, so I'll put in my own solution. I personally use the Mac Fullscreen Tab Mover and binded the commands with option+left/right (so convenient!), but I also found others like Tab Mover which seem to do the same thing.  <answer244070> We have a Fix for this!  In Chrome Version 52 beta we can now enable a new Flag to detach a Tab in a Fullscreen Window on Mac. Without Workarounds or extensions!  The Flag: chrome://flags/#enable-fullscreen-in-tab-detaching  And here the Bug-Report with Status Fixed: https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=507942  <comment166406> When you detach it you want to put it in the back or to make it front alone ? <comment166407> I hope it is moved to a new virtual desktop or to an existing non-fullscreen virtual desktop. <comment166421> Hold cmd, type LCWNV and press enter? ;) (focuses on the location bar, copies the address, closes the tab, opens a new fullscreen window, pastes the address) <comment166525> @onik, this seems legitimate. <comment171585> I tried the extension and it works. Thank you. It use Ctrl-Shift-;, but Cmd-Shift-; also works. <comment300737> Welcome to Ask Different! We're looking for complete answers â€“ could you elaborate a bit? <comment301283> Apparently, this user prefers to keep an air of mystery about them. But this is a valid bug fix. Looks like Chrome 52 has solved this! <comment308897> Cheers dude.. This works great. I've made Shift+Option+X to detach as new window. And configured Shift+option+Up to maximize a window in next monitor using BTT (BetterTOuchTool). Saves huge time :D
