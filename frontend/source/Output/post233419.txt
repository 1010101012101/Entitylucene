Terminal command to change Keyboard preferences on Mac? <body> I'm trying to configure new Mac accounts to have certain languages added to their keyboard preferences. Is there a terminal command to add languages to a particular user's keyboard preferences or perhaps a command to manipulate a user's specific plist?  Any help is greatly appreciated!  <comment285287> Why not use `System Preferences  keyboard  input sources` in the account(s)?
