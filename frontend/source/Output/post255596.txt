Sync contacts from iphone to icloud with iOS 10.0.02 <body> After yesterday's iOS update, I'm no longer able to get contacts on my phone to appear in my icloud account.  Am I the only one?    I went through several trouble-shooting steps with Apple tech support, concluding with backing up my phone and restoring it to factory settings.  Still my most recent contact on my phone is not updating the cloud.  Any ideas?
