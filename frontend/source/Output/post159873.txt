Console log flooded with "discoveryd: Basic Warn DD_Warn: Bad count; corrupt NSEC RDATA" <body> My console log is flooded with the message  precodediscoveryd[51]: Basic Warn DD_Warn: Bad count; corrupt NSEC RDATA /code/pre  They appear in bunches of many identical messages within only a few seconds, separated by short pauses (some seconds to some ten seconds).
