Why is Yosemite showing me a dragonfly? <body> I plugged in my external monitor and keyboard to my closed MacBook Retina. Instead of the usual password unlock box, the external monitor lit up with a faint blue background with a picture of a dragonfly in the center.  Opening up the laptop got things into a reasonable state.  What is is trying to tell me?  <comment181217> What's the make and model of the monitor? <comment181218> Do you have any screen dump? <comment181220> No, the keyboard was unresponsive until I opened the laptop, and then the dragonfly flew. The monitor is a Dell U3011. <comment181233> Is your user picture the Dragonfly? <comment181356> Yes, it is a dragonfly.
