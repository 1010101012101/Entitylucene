iPad app to convert multiple photos to a single pdf <body> Does anyone know an app to convert multiple photos from the iPad Camera Roll into a single PDF?  Alternatively, an app that lets you take photos with the iPad camera and saves them into a single PDF would be good - ability to rotate photos is important as this is mostly for 'scanning' document pages using the iPad.  <answer87577> You can use Apple's Pages app to do this. Use the "+" button to add files from the image library. There is a pinch gesture to rotate/resize the images. The files can be emailed or exported to another app as a PDF from the "Wrench" popup menu in the top right corner of the screen.  <answer241945> Site audit pro  Use it daily for work...
