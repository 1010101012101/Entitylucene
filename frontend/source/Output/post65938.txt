How to restrict changing desktop wallpaper? <body> We have Macbook Airs running 10.8.1. These are exposed to students in a k-12 setting. I'd like to restrict their ability to change the wallpaper of the desktop.  Is there a setting to configure?  <answer65939> In Terminal, the following:  precodechown (USER) /Users/(USER)/Library/Preferences/com.apple.desktop.plist /code/pre  Where code(USER)/code is the short user name.  Then, lock that file:  precodechflags uchg /Users/(USER)/Library/Preferences/com.apple.desktop.plist /code/pre  <answer65942> I didn't find any way to prevent changing the desktop picture, but you could just change it back to the default every few seconds.  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt; &lt;!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC -//Apple Computer//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd&gt; &lt;plist version="1.0"&gt; &lt;dict&gt;     &lt;key&gt;Label&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;string&gt;com.stackexchange.apple.65938&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;key&gt;ProgramArguments&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;array&gt;         &lt;string&gt;osascript&lt;/string&gt;         &lt;string&gt;-e&lt;/string&gt;         &lt;string&gt;tell application "Finder" set f to POSIX file "/Library/Desktop Pictures/Galaxy.jpg" if desktop picture is not file f then set desktop picture to f end tell&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;/array&gt;     &lt;key&gt;StartInterval&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;integer&gt;10&lt;/integer&gt; &lt;/dict&gt; &lt;/plist&gt; /code/pre  Save the file above as code/Library/LaunchAgents/com.stackexchange.apple.65938.plist/code, change the owner, and load the plist:  precodesudo chown root /Library/LaunchAgents/com.stackexchange.apple.65938.plist sudo launchctl load /Library/LaunchAgents/com.stackexchange.apple.65938.plist /code/pre  The property list is loaded automatically when users log in.  <comment77561> Can you specify which shortname to use for the (USER) variables?  I have an admin account and a student. When I enter:     chown admin /Users/student/Library/Preferences/com.apple.desktop.plist  It says permission denied. <comment77563> Isn't it owned by the user by default? Anyway `chflags uchg` didn't work for me. The desktop picture is changed before the plist is modified. <comment121746> This doesn't work with Safari option "set image as background" <comment182627> I have just started getting an error when I type in `sudo launchctl load /Library/LaunchAgents/com.stackexchange.apple.65938.plist` I get `launchctl: Dubious permissions on file (skipping): /Library/LaunchAgents/com.stackexchange.apple.65938.plist nothing found to load` Any suggestion on where to start looking for for a solution?
