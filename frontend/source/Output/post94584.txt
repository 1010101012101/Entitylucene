Redirect all logs to a network share - local HDD "disappears" <body> How do I tell OS X to not write logs to the local volume, but in stead to write them to a remote share?  I'm troubleshooting a intermittent issue on a late 2012 Mac Mini server where the internal RAID appears to just "goes away."  <answer94620> I don't believe to you can tell OS X to write the logs to a different location BUT you can move the location to which it writes!  Not sure what logs you are interested in, but lets say it's /var/log.  1 Copy the /var/log directory to your remote share.   2 Rename original /var/log to something else   3 Create a symbolic link from /var/log to the remote share.  Now when the system tries to write to /var/log it will really be writing to /yourshare/whatever/var/log  Have not tried this myself but should work.
