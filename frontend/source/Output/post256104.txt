How to select "Press and Hold" characters over 10 characters <body> When I have more than 10 characters in my "Press and Hold" set, I am unable to type 10 or 11 or 12 to select a character. It registers the second keypress. If I type "12", it registers "2" and inserts the character corresponding to "2". This is El Capitan.  Note that I've modified my English options to include Vietnamese characters than I occasionally wish to type, but I assume this would also be a problem if I changed my locale to Vietnam.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/E6Mbd.png" alt="Example of selecting from many characters."  <comment319271> Click the one you need. <comment319575> Yes, also I can use my arrow keys. The UX suggests a faster way though!
