AppleScript editor cannot save .scpt file <body> I've created a simple AppleScript .scpt file, using TextEdit.  If I now open it with AppleScript editor, I can run it. But when I try to modify and save it, I get the following error:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fxqVn.png" alt="enter image description here"  It's frustrating that such a basic operation has got me completely stuck.  What is going wrong?  <comment154543> To which folder/directory are you trying to save it to? <comment154544> to ~/Desktop/Foo/ <comment154545> I assume the folder exists and you have write access. Did you try another folder? Or creating a simple text file and store it there? <comment154546> Thanks, I got it to work by creating a new file, pasting the contents in, saving. Still not sure why it won't save a document created by another editor. <comment154547> Was the document still open in the other editor as well? <comment178011> I was facing the same problem. Essentially, both you and me are creating **non-compiled** `.scpt` files by hand when this **is** a compiled file format (contrary to `.applescript`).
