How to fix my headphones <body> An earpiece of my iPhone headphones felt into a glass of water for 10 seconds last week.  Now the sound volume form both earpieces is lower and it seems the basses are not that strong anymore.  Is there something I can do to fix my headphones or I can only throw them away ? Also, why both headpieces are now damaged if only one ended up in the water ?  Thanks  <answer51292> I'd rather throw them away. There are a few Youtube videos that could help, though.  The one which felt into the glass of water was, perhaps, the right one? I don't know why, or if it is just mine (and my mother's, actually) but it seems that the left one sounds a lot lower than the right one.   It seems, too, that Apple is quite nice about replacing the headphones while under warranty. It's worth trying, too.  <answer258933> There is no saving them. I would definitely suggest just buying a new pair.   <comment323809> This is not a very good answer and doesn't help the OP (who posted this 3 years ago) or others with a similar issue.
