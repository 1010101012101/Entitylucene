esc button OS X needs to be released on every command <body> In terminal I use kbdesc/kbdkbdB/kbd  or kbdesc/kbdkbdF/kbd  to jump through the words.  If I want 2x back I've to do kbdesc/kbdkbdB/kbd twice. Otherwise I just start typing F or B in Terminal.  The modifier keys kbdctrl/kbd / kbdalt/kbd /kbdcmd/kbd work differently e.g. I can hit control and than hit AAA EEEE multiple times without a need to release control button. So go to end of line twice would be kbdctrl/kbdkbdE/kbdkbdE/kbd and this would work (don't mind the fact that this is pointless end of line is end of line)  Is there a way to achieve same with kbdesc/kbd modifier?  <answer242365> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gCgQz.png" alt="enter image description here"  selecting codeUse option as meta key/code allows alt/option to be used instead of esc.  <comment298023> esc is not a modifier but an actual key so you are doing esc then b not esc and b at the same time. alt + b is alt and b at the same time <comment298032> @Mark so how do I make it work like a modifier? :) <comment298040> You can't it is a key sending a character just like the key X <comment298103> @Mark never mind I found solution, terminal `esc` can be remapped to `alt` <comment298114> @SandroDzneladze In my opinion you can modify every key to behave like a modifier key (with Karabiner). Which editor do you use? E.g. in nano esc-b/f don't allow you to jump to the previous or the next word. <comment298258> @klanomath question was about terminal, as for editor I use vim.
