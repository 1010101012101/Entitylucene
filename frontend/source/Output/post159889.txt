Where are the installation directories for homebrew? <body> Where does Homebrew install it's software?  I've installed Maven with Homebrew and searching for the Maven installation directory, so that I can set codeMAVEN_HOME/code.  <answer159891> strongbrew/strong installs binary in separate directories inside code/usr/local/code dir. Then makes symlink inside code/usr/local/bin/code. To get real path to binary type for example this (for codetree/code command):  precodels -l /usr/local/bin/ | grep tree /code/pre  Output:  precodelrwxr-xr-x  1 slozo  admin    29 23 lip 15:06 tree -&gt; ../Cellar/tree/1.7.0/bin/tree /code/pre  So my codetree/code command is located in code/usr/local/Cellar/tree/1.7.0/bin/tree/code
