iMovie stills turn out blurry in mp4 <body> I have high quality pngs and/or pdfs imported into iMovie. They look great on their own. However, when I share to file (using all the highest quality settings), the final result looks blurry. Any suggestions?  <comment341848> Welcome to Ask Different.

What version of macOS? ~~ Have you tried importing .jpg formatted files? Preview should be able to open .png and .pdf files and Export in .jpg format. Give that try and report back <comment341984> Are you considering the potential difference in input & output resolution? No good having an input of 6000x4000 & an output of 1920x1080 if you're trying to display 2 pages of A4 legibly <comment342057> thanks all. To elaborate, the images are a time series of detailed maps (rasters) which I am animating. I have a mac 10.12.3; iMovie 10.1.4. I've tried all combinations of pdf, tif, png, and pdf at between 200-800dpi. I am writing them as . mp4 and .mov. All results are blurry, especially text, though I prefer the sharpness/file size ratio of the pngs. Funny enough the animations made with pngs at 200 dpi (1.2mb) aren't that much worse the those made at 800 dpi. <comment342059> sorry, meant to say: pdf, tif, png, and jpg <comment342097> DPI has absolutely no bearing on image quality or size other that if you print it on paper. You need to be looking at the *actual pixel dimensions*. Screen dpi depends entirely on 'how big the TV is' but could nominally be considered to be 72 for a regular computer monitor. For a standard TV picture [HD] your output is entirely dependant on that. At full resolution, you have an image 1920x1080. <comment342339> regardless of dpi or actual pixel dimensions, image resolution becomes blurred. If I use an online converter (i.e. from png stills to an mp4), it looks a lot better - but this gives me little control. I tried to take two of these sharp mp4s from the online converter and combine them sequentially with Quicktime but the final result was blurry again - just as blurry as the original iMovie <comment343045> By the way, @Tetsujin changing dpi directly changes actual pixel dimensions. In any case, does anyone out there know how to get a sharper resolution closer to that of the actual pngs used to create the animation? Maybe iMovie just stinks and I need to move to another compiler? Thanks! <comment343048> I haven't used iMovie in years, so I don't know specifically what it does. However, changing dpi absolutely does not change pixel dimensions, only document 'print' sizes; unless there is some active process trying to match that up to a 'screen size'
