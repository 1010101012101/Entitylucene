Increase swap size limit past 59GB <body> I'm running some very memory intensive code on Mountain Lion (16GB Memory + 0.5TB of SSD). I've noticed that once the swap file reaches 59GB, it stops increasing, and my code is basically dead in the water. Is there any way to change this hard limit?  <comment107998> How much free space on your SSD? <comment108016> Mostly free (~400GB). The fact that it's stopping at precisely 59.00 GB is making me suspicious that it's a software limit. <comment108307> You could try specifying a very large, fixed swap file size in `/System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.dynamic_pager.plist` with option `-S` of `dynamic_pager`. See `man dynamic_pager` for details. Reboot and check the virtual memory file size in `/private/var/vm/`.
