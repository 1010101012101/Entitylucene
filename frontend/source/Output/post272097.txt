Prevent Chrome from Jumping to Front When Hidden (FB Message) <body> I started using Chrome just to manage a business FB account and now stronganytime I receive a message the app comes to the front of my desktop/strong - even when it's hidden.  strongHow can I stop this tiresome &amp; disruptive behaviour?/strong I looked under settings / advanced settings and saw nothing FB-specific and so do not know whether this is a general feature for Chrome or a site-specific thing.
