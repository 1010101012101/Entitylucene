some files show extensions while others don't (OS X El Capitan) <body> The issue is very minor but I'm OCD with these things. I love consistency.  The first screenshot was taken from an ls output. As you can see all the files have an .xlsx extension.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uUYM4.jpg" alt="ls output"  The second screenshot was taken using finder. As you can see, one file shows the extension while the rest don't.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Xn6ep.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  I don't want to change the finder setting where all extensions are shown.  Any ideas what could be the issue? thanks  <comment295399> When you Get Info on the file, is hide extension checked on? <comment295404> Maybe Excel is set to hide file extensions when saving files.  If you want to have all the `.xlsx` extensions show for those files, then in Terminal, change directory to the location of the `.xlsx` files and use the following command to have all the `.xlsx` extensions for those files show in Finder: `for f in *.xlsx; do xattr -d com.apple.FinderInfo "$f"; done` <comment295408> both suggestions work. thanks! :)
