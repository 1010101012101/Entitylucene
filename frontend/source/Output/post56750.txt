Gmail & Dragon Dictate for Mac <body> I'm trying to create commands for a specific website context (Gmail). However, the commands aren't being recognized. I have tried the following URLs for the website context:   precode https://mail.google.com/  https://mail.google.com/*  *mail.google.com* /code/pre  I watched this video for instruction, and I don't see where I'm going wrong.  I'm testing it with just a simple command: saying "New tab" should issue the key-combo kbdCommand âŒ˜/kbd+kbdT/kbd. However, with the cursor in a text box in Gmail, the words "New tab" simply get written out like standard Dictation mode; they aren't recognized as a command.
