How to deal with a non responsive app/process? <body> Firefox does not respond. How can I quit it other than by Force Quit?   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6dsTg.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  I can kill it by using the left upper button (X). Is there a better method other than to Force Quit?  <comment367171> What don't you like about sing force quit?

I am just looking for if there is a better solution. <comment367184> @aircraft Killing the application will delete what you wrote - quit, force quit, or whatever. There is no way around this. I recommend blogging in Word, Pages, TextEdit, etc - then copying and pasting into your site. <comment367189> okay. i kown that now.
