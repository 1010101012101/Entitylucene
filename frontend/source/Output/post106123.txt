iBooks on Mavericks Beachballs Whenever Text Styling Occurs <body> Whenever I want to change text styling in iBooks the app becomes unresponsive. I kill it in the terminal (codekillall iBooks/code), and then the system reports that codeCoreText.FontDownloadHelper/code has crashed. My current theory is that if I'm to sort out codeCoreText.FontDownloadHelper/code, then the crash in iBooks won't occur any more. Am I right?  Here's the crash report, with the UUID removed.  precodeProcess:         CoreText.FontDownloadHelper [2865] Path:            /System/Library/Frameworks/ApplicationServices.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/ATS.framework/Versions/A/XPCServices/CoreText.FontDownloadHelper.xpc/Contents/MacOS/CoreText.FontDownloadHelper Identifier:      CoreText.FontDownloadHelper Version:         1.1 (1) Code Type:       X86-64 (Native) Parent Process:  launchd [398] Responsible:     CoreText.FontDownloadHelper [2865] User ID:         501  Date/Time:       2013-10-22 20:17:31.634 -0400 OS Version:      Mac OS X 10.9 (13A603) Report Version:  11   Crashed Thread:  0  Dispatch queue: com.apple.main-thread  Exception Type:  EXC_BAD_INSTRUCTION (SIGILL) Exception Codes: 0x0000000000000001, 0x0000000000000000  Application Specific Information: Configuration error: Could not create listener. xpc_main() was probably called from a process that is not an XPC service bundle.

So I suppose the problem is caused by one (or more) of the manually installed fonts.  <comment131276> I'm having the same issue. Some people have been able to solve it by [activating disabled fonts](https://discussions.apple.com/message/23496158#23496158), but that doesn't work for me.
