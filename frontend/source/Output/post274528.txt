How to add a AppleScript file to the Finder toolbar to execute the AppleScript? <body> I have written an AppleScript to do a little task in the current folder of Finder. I added it to the Finder toolbar by dragging it while holding CMD-ALT. But when I click it, it opens the AppleScript in the Script Editor instead of executing it.  The AppleScript file has following rights: -rwxr-xr-x@   The owner is the same user which is using it.  Of course, it's my intention to execute the file, not to open it on button click. What do I need to do to execute it?  <answer274529> If you want an strongAppleScript/strong to emrun/em on its own, not in strongScript Editor/strong, you need to change it from strongFile Format: Script/strong to strongFile Format: Application/strong in the strongSave As/strong emsheet/em when saving it.  <comment345267> Thanks for the hint! Is it the same for JavaScript .scpt files as well? <comment345287> @andreas, yes it's the same for JavaScript in ScriptEditor, save it as an Application.
