Dragging an email with attachment to another mailbox looses attachment <body> I was dragging an email message in Mail.app and intended to drag it to another folder.  I accidentally went too far and then I was dragging an icon around the Dashboard.  when I went back to Mail.app, the message was still there but missing the attachment.  Where did it go?  It happened to me a second time, but this time the Dashboard wasn't involved.  Is this a bug in Mail.app?  The attachments were photos that were being displayed in-line.  I am using IMAP.  So I can access the photo on my iPhone but it is not accessible on mail.app.  I guess I need to file a RDAR.  <answer82989> The file may be in strong/Users/emuname/em/Library/Containers/com.apple.mail/Data/Library/Mail Downloads/strong  (This is where Mail stores emunsaved/em attachments)  <comment95687> The attachments were not in this folder (but there were other previous attachments).
