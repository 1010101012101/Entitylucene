Only the spinning beachball when I try to open anything from spotlight <body> I can't start any programs or open any document from the spotlight since yesterday.   It finds the right program / document, but when I press enter I only get the spinning beachball for about 40 seconds and then spotlight closes without opening anything.  Any ideas?  <answer175321> I have experienced the exact same issue since few days as well (AFAIR about 2 days ago), and am trying to find a solution.  This is what my OSX Console log (Apps  Utilities  Console) looks like, just after selecting a program / document in spotlight results:  precode04/03/2015 14:29:27,288 WindowServer[202]: disable_update_timeout: UI updates were forcibly disabled by application "Spotlight" for over 1.00 seconds.

However, there's one thing that can be done to isolate spotlight issues and that's to run the command codesudo /usr/bin/mddiagnose/code and either dig into the collected error logs or forward them to your support chain (Apple Support if you don't have a support team/IT department).  So:  ol liOpen terminal.app (by navigating to /Applications/Utilities in Finder if needed)/li liRun the command codemddiagnose/code/li liReboot/li liCheck to see if spotlight is still hung: repeat the codemddiagnose/code each time it hangs to get a sense of how often this happens/li lirepeat as needed/li /ol  That tool will package all the system logs surrounding the event as well as check for crashes and specific error messages that might point to the cause of spotlight hanging.  <answer186095> For future reference.

This seems to work until I find a solution for the problem with Spotlight. <comment206692> I've edited in a bit about `mddiagnose` - if anyone has a repeatable case, hit me up in the chat room and I'll see if I can guide you through the output of that tool. Anyone that's really interested could ask how to parse the logfiles that the tool generates... (hint hint) <comment206846> After following everything explained in that thread (https://discussions.apple.com/thread/6757500), and having the same issue with a guest account, in safe mode, etc., I ended up reinstalling OSX: https://support.apple.com/kb/PH18872?locale=en_US  This solved my issue with spotlight, and I kept everything else (apps, prefs, etc.). Just keep in mind this'll take a long night... <comment207238> I "solved" the problem with reinstalling from Time Machine. This seems to have reseted whatever caused the spinning beachball.  Should I close the question now? I mean for me the problem no longer exists, but I still have no Idea what really the problem was.
