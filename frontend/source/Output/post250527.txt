Shift+3 returns £ sign instead of # sign <body> When I press Shift+3 on my Mac, it returns £ sign instead of # sign. How can I fix it? Any ideas? Input source - British - PC  <answer250971> Press kbdAlt/kbd+kbd3/kbd to get #. Likewise should you ever need the Euro sign, press kbdAlt/kbd+kbd2/kbd to get €.  <answer250973> The keyboard is working as designed for Apple.  If you want to use the keyboard as normal the # is given by kbdAlt/kbd-kbd3/kbd  I found this annoying as well and the way I get round it is to change the input source to Australian the only difference is that kbdShift/kbdkbd3/kbd is now # and kbdAlt/kbdkbd3/kbd is £   Input Source setting is System Preferences-Keyboard-Input Source By default this will just show the UK keyboard to see more hit the + at the bottom of the list and add Australian  This is the answer I gave in Stack Overflow and I think is a duplicate here as well but I could not find the original.  <answer250977> If you use the British PC layout, the # sign is found over at the right edge of the keyboard on the \ key.  <comment311142> I'm really not sure what you mean by "fix it". It's not broken, shift/3 is £ on a UK keyboard. opt/3 is #. US keyboards are the other way round. <comment311885> @Tetsujin British PC does NOT have # at opt/3.  It’s over at the right edge of the keyboard. <comment311886> He said he has a British PC layout.  On that # is NOT at alt-3.  It is over at the right edge of the keyboard.  It is the British layout which has # at alt-3. <comment311887> No, on the British PC layout, # is over at the right edge of the keyboard. And € is at alt + 4, not alt + 2. <comment311894> @TomGewecke  A good point but OP as also accepted answer so might just be confused <comment311895> @Ilya as Tom has pointed out you said British PC keyboard - I answered assuming Apple British keyboard - Is it an Apple or a PC/Windows keyboard ? <comment311901> Oh, for some reason I never spotted 'PC' :( <comment311928> Yes, perhaps he was mistaken about British-PC being his “input source”, and it was really British.  Some users think their active keyboard is what they happen to have selected in system prefs/keyboard/input sources, when in fact it is the “flag” menu that determines this.
