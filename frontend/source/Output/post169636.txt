How can I create a folder in the current directory? <body> I browse to a folder, then expand through a directory tree to find the file I'm looking for.  Now I want to create a folder at the current location within that tree.  ol li"New Folder" from the menu creates the menu in the top-level directory instead of the current directory./li liRight-clicking doesn't give any way to create a folder "in-place" - ie with reference to the file or directory I currently have clicked/highlighted./li /ol  Simplified example (thanks soulshined):  precode/Users/user/Downloads/ /Users/user/Downloads/Pictures /Users/user/Downloads/Pictures/pic1.jpg /Users/user/Downloads/Pictures/pic2.jpg /Users/user/Downloads/Pictures/pic3.jpg /Users/user/Downloads/Pictures/pic4.jpg /Users/user/Downloads/Pictures/pic5.jpg /code/pre  The finder window is opened on the code/Users/user/Downloads/code directory, but I have used the tree-expanders to be looking at the files in code.../Downloads/Pictures/code.  I want to add a folder under codePictures/code, but irrespective of how I invoke it, the new directory will always be created under codeDownloads/code.  (Obviously in this example it would be trivial to move it, but imagine the folder is a byzantine corporate shared directory tree,...)  <answer169647> Open the folder that you want to create a new folder in, then File  New Folder or Shift-Command-N.   OR   You have first to double-click the directory within which you want to create the new folder. Once you are inside, right-click and select "new directory".  <comment199310> This question is confusing me because I can do this without any problems. Can you elaborate a little bit more so I can make sure we're talking about the same thing?   Say your in 'Downloads' and Downloads has 4 different folders, you click on one of them [Pictures] and it has a list of pictures and you want to add a Folder to Pictures, say to name [2015] or add a folder to Downloads while viewing the contents of Pictures?
