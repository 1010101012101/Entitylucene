Avoid 173% file size increase from Preview Quartz color to black and white? <body> I naively expected the color space reduction from 16 bits per pixel to one bit per pixel to result in a large file size reduction.  Instead the file size was more than doubled.    I scanned a book in color at 600 dpi (with OCR), which resulted in a 186.9MB PDF. Using Apple Preview's "Black and white" Quartz filter to export the PDF, I saved a black and white version, which turns out to be 509.6 MB. This was done on 10.10.5 using Preview 8.0 (859.21).  Is there a better way? I want to preserve some highlighting I did in Xodo. I know there are Quartz filters that do some compression at the expense of image quality. I don't want to reduce the image quality, and don't see why lossy compression should be necessary.   <comment363289> Best guess is you turned it from text to picture, which is going to be much bigger. <comment363390> The result of the color scan was images with a separate text layer, and so is the black and white conversion.  I can tell by highlighting text. The highlight snaps to where the tool thinks the text is, which is slightly offset from the image of the text.
