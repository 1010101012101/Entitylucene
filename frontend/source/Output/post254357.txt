I want to count the number of songs in each of my itunes playlists from the command line <body> I want to count the number of songs in each of my iTunes playlists from the command line. What is the best way to do this? Pytunes or just some XML parsing type thing?  I lost many songs in my playlists after an update so I want to compare number of tunes in each playlists in my current iTunes library with the number of tunes in each playlist of my older iTunes library.   The simplest way would be to open each library and click on each playlist one by one and note the number of songs, but there must be a better and less labor intensive way to do this. (I have 308 playlists!!)
