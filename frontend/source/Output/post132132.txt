Resource is busy, but lsof doesn't think so <body> Occasionally, I get file (typically after they are edited by Microsoft Word) that I can not delete:  precode&gt; rm -rf foo.docx rm: M_AI_SO.docx: Resource busy /code/pre  However, codelsof/code doesn't report anything, even I run it as root:  precode&gt; lsof | grep docx &gt; /code/pre  How can I determine who is locking the file. And even more important: how can I delete it without a reboot?  <answer132144> codelsof/code does not show all the processes when run as a emnormal/em user. Try with  precodesudo lsof | grep docx /code/pre  See the codeSECURITY/code section of the man page  <comment155377> Sorry, I forgot to say, but I did so. I'll edit the question.
