bash prinf goes to log but output= not <body> The first line of this snipet goes to the logfile, but the second doesn't. I need the second be executed and loged.   precode#!/bin/bash printf '%s %s (%s) running...\n' 2&gt;&amp;1 | tee -a $logfile output=$(restic -r ${backupdir} snapshots ) 2&gt;&amp;1 | tee -a $logfile /code/pre  How can i log the output= line as well?  <answer274249> In the second line, there should be no output! You're assigning the result of coderestic -r ${backupdir} snapshots/code to codeoutput/code, and that won't produce any output, either to codestdout/code or to codestderr/code (it's equivalent to codeoutput="Value stored for later"/code - when this command executes, there's no output).  Try something like...  precodeoutput=$(restic -r ${backupdir} snapshots ) echo $output | tee -a $logfile /code/pre  Or you could simplify it by just doing...  precoderestic -r ${backupdir} snapshots 2&gt;&amp;1 | tee -a $logfile /code/pre  <comment344778> The second line basically tries to add the output of an assignment statement to the log file. As this statement doesn't produce any output there is nothing to add :-)
