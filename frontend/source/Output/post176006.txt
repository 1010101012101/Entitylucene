Set file metadata attribute values <body> I'm trying to set the values of some file metadata attributes in OS X Yosemite - codekMDItemDateAdded/code and codekMDItemLastUsedDate/code - the values of which can be shown using codemdls &lt;filename&gt;/code.  I'm trying to set their values using codexattr/code.  I've tried this:  precodexattr -w com.apple.metadata:kMDItemDateAdded "2001-01-01 12:34:56 +0000" some_file.txt xattr -w com.apple.metadata:kMDItemLastUsedDate "2001-01-01 12:34:56 +0000" some_file.txt /code/pre  I've tried this:  precodexattr -w kMDItemDateAdded "2011-01-01 12:34:56 +0000" some_file.txt xattr -w kMDItemLastUsedDate "2011-01-01 12:34:56 +0000" some_file.txt /code/pre  ...but have had no success.  codexattr/code reports no errors, but the file metadata attribute values are left unchanged.  Do you know if what I'm trying to do is possible, and if it is, where I'm going wrong?  <comment207707> Did you try `xattr -l some_file.txt` to look at the values after changing them? And no, I don't have an explanation for this. <comment208110> Thanks for your response, @patrix.  I've tried ```xattr -l some_file.txt```, **before and after** executing the four commands listed in my question above.  Before executing the commands, the attributes ```com.apple.metadata:kMDItemDateAdded```, ```com.apple.metadata:kMDItemLastUsedDate```, ```kMDItemDateAdded```, ```kMDItemLastUsedDate``` aren't listed.  After executing the commands, they are. <comment208111> However - the values of ```kMDItemDateAdded``` and ```kMDItemLastUsedDate```, shown using ```mdls filename```, are unchanged.  Could it be, that the four commands listed in my question above create _new_ attributes (shown using ```xattr -l some_file.txt```), and that ```mdls filename``` gets its attribute values from elsewhere? <comment208113> That was my first thought as well, didn't research the topic though.
