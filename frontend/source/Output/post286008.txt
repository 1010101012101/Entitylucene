How to make macbook pro use a 16:9 aspect ratio? <body> How can I force my screen to use a 16:9 aspect ratio? I don't mind seeing black bars above and beneath the screen content.  <answer286009> You can use RDM to set a custom resolution such as 1920Ã—1080.  <comment361213> One thing I've noticed with this is that the ... pixel density? I don't know the right term ... seems lower. E.g. it looks like it is a lower resolution than it used to be.
