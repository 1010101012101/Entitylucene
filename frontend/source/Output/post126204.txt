How to display the location of files with Spotlight? <body> When searching for a file with Spotlight (and with the Finder) I often find many different versions of the correct file name.  But to choose the correct one I want to deal with, I should see its complete location on the file system.  I'm hunting a codeMakefile/code. Spotlight (the Finder too) displays me a list of a lot of them (I'm working with different package managers which install softwares in different directories). How may I quickly display their complete location to choose the one I want? hr With the command line codefind/code or codelocate/code the answer is pretty easy. But in some cases I would like to avoid to start a codeTerminal/code and fire a pretty long codefind/code.  <answer126205> I have a few suggestions:  ol liYou can try hovering over the file, and a preview of the file will pop-up left of the spotlight list./li liYou can kbd⌘/kbd-click on an item to open its location/li liYou can try the free app Alfred. Thought I was hesitant first, Alfred has become a replacement for spotlight for me for most purposes. I find that the calculator function of spotlight has many more features, but Alfred is much more extendable. It lists the file paths of results right under the file names./li /ol  <answer126253> You can press kbd⌘/kbd+kbd⌥ /kbdto see filepath in Quicklook pop-up.  <comment147793> I don't know if this is what you looking for but I have the "Show Path Bar" turned on in Finder, so when I click o a file in the search window it displays the path for it at the bottom of the finder widow. <comment148054> I don't understand why someone downvoted this answer, since this is pretty near of what I'm looking for. <comment148056> In most of the case where I'm searching among many files, I'm not able to recognize these text files from their content. Their location is the only key point which may help me to open the right one. <comment148058> → XAleXOwnZX: is your point 3 meaning that Alfred is able to display a list of complete locations when I'm searching for one among 20 `Makefile`? <comment148059> Pretty near :). <comment148173> Yes @daniel_Azuelos
