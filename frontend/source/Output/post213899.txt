Domain Name Resolution (DNS) stops working randomly <body> While browsing and using the web, DNS stops working. Open web-chats like Google Hangouts keep working, but opening new websites, Skype, and others are stuck to "Resolving host name".  This happens randomly, sometimes when I return from sleep mode, others when I switch from WiFi to ETH, others just while doing nothing in particular. I tried things suggested in DNS not resolving on Mac OS X without any success.  Moreover, I can resolve the problem if I reboot the Mac entirely, but I want to figure out 1) why its happening and 2) how to fix it once and for all!  ul liI'm running 10.11.1 (15B42)/li liI'm on a home network, my ISP is Kabel Deutchland /li liMy router doesn't accept "custom" DNS servers and I can only change them in every client./li liI am using Google DNS servers since sometime while trying to solve the problem. /li /ul  <comment258539> Comments are not for extended discussion; this conversation has been [moved to chat](http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/31078/discussion-on-question-by-george-katsanos-domain-name-resolution-dns-stops-wor).
