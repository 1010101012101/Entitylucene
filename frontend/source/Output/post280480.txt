Keynote does not go in presentation mode anymore <body> I have the following issue:  My Keynote presentation setup used to work like this:  My MacBook and the the projector are set to mirror one another. When I press Play in Keynote, Keynote used to split the presentation with the presenter view on my MacBook and the audience view on the projector. I use AirPlay to connect to an AppleTV.  Now, however, it just stays in mirrored mode.  I have checked the box "Enable Presenter Display.".  Is anybody able to help me?  <comment352826> I checked it out and that is how it seems to work for me as well right now. I don't have a proper solution... especially if you like to mirror displays. Anyways: If you disable display mirroring system wide, the presentation mode works again. You can enable or disable mirroring at: `System Preferences  Displays  Arrangement` - `Mirror Displays (check box)`
