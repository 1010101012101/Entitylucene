Problems regarding transferring songs to my ipod shuffle 2 gb <body> I have an iPod shuffle 2 gb, and as directed, I installed iTunes on my Windows 7 desktop, as I don't have an apple phone. But, the problem is that whenever I open the iTunes and try to load songs in it, I have to wait a long time and then it says, an error occurred as the file could not be found. I am using the iTunes version of 11.1.2.32. Is something wrong with the USB cable that I'm using? Or itunes don't work well in windows? Is there any alternatives to insert songs in my ipod?   <comment250926> Please help us in helping you. Can you describe the steps you are doing in iTunes in more detail? Have you added the songs you want to put on the Shuffle to iTunes? Which format are the songs in? Screenshots of error messages might also give a clue. <comment250927> The songs are in mp3. At first, I insert the ipod with the help of the small cable provided with it. Then as usual, a dialogue box appears and I click continue without scanning. Then, automatically the iTunes opens up. I click on the "ipod" menu on top right corner. Then I open the "on this ipod" option. Leaving it, I go back to my desktop or any other file on my pc and just drag and drop the songs on the respective play lists.
