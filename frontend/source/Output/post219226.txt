Freetype Code Signing Error (Xcode 7.1) App Upload Issue <body> I'm wondering if anyone can fix my problem? I'm trying to upload a project to the App Store. I'm using Xcode 7.1. I'm getting the following error related to code-signing freetype.  precodeCodeSign /Users/me/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/SFML_App -xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx/Build/Products/Debug/SFML_App.app cd /Users/me/Documents/cplusplus/sfml/SFML_App export CODESIGN_ALLOCATE=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain/usr/bin/codesign_allocate  Signing Identity:     "Mac Developer: me (xxxxxxxxxx)"  /usr/bin/codesign --force --sign xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx --timestamp=none /Users/me/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/SFML_App-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx/Build/Products/Debug/SFML_App.app  /Users/me/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/SFML_App-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx/Build/Products/Debug/SFML_App.app: code object is not signed at all In subcomponent: /Users/me/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/SFML_App-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx/Build/Products/Debug/SFML_App.app/Contents/Frameworks/freetype.framework Command /usr/bin/codesign failed with exit code 1 /code/pre  Any Ideas on how to fix this?  <answer219258> The error suggests a subcomponent is not signed. Use the code--deep/code flag with codecodesign/code:     code--deep/code      When signing a bundle, specifies that nested code content such as helpers, frameworks, and   plug-ins, should be recursively signed in turn. Beware that all signing options you specify   will apply, in turn, to such nested content.   When verifying a bundle, specifies that any nested code content will be recursively verified as   to its full content. By default, verification of nested content is limited to a shallow inves-tigation investigation   tigation that may not detect changes to the nested code.   When displaying a signature, specifies that a list of directly nested code should be written to   the display output. This lists only code directly nested within the subject; anything nested   indirectly will require recursive application of the codesign command.   Apple's Technical Note 2206: OS X Code Signing in Depth provides more insight.  <comment265177> This question would attract more answers on [StackOverflow](https://www.StackOverflow.com]) because it involves software development. <comment265178> Build Succeeded! Thanks! <comment265185> Good to hear. Please could you [mark this question as accepted](http://stackoverflow.com/help/someone-answers). <comment265225> I still can't upload to the App Store. whenever i try i get the following error:  An error occurred during validation      Couldn't find platform family in Info.plist CFBundleSupportedPlatforms or Mach-O LC_VERSION_MIN for A.   is this still related to freetype? <comment265262> Please can you ask a new question for this. Feel free to mention the question's link in the comments to help others link the two questions. <comment265272> new question: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/219349/mac-app-store-upload-fail-validation-error-cfbundlesupportedplatforms-or-mach
