Play the Guitar Amp within Garageband (Mac and iOS versions) <body> Garageband has a cool Guitar Amp simulator, but as far as I can tell, you have to either:  ol liConnect a physical electric guitar to your Mac or iOS./li liOn iOS you can use another app to be the source (Inter-App Audio)./li /ol  Is there a way to have Garageband's own electric guitar sound be the input source to the Guitar Amp, so that no external instruments or apps are needed?
