Infinite download start on iCloud drive MacBook Pro <body> I just started making a backup through Time Machine, and the iCloud drive has started numerous files in my iCloud drive, which is decreasing both my iCloud drive storage and my system storage.  the files are like 100 MB in size each, and I am not sure when would that stop which is freaking me out. Is this normal?  Also, how would I see what the files that are being downloaded on my iCloud drive and from where? I am sure nothing is being uploaded from one of my devices, unless its a backup from my iPhone?  OS: Sierra  Please provide any suggestions.  Thank you.
