Does the Macbook (Early 2016) support Wake up from standby through an alarm or at a scheduled time? <body> I am looking for an option to wake the Macbook at a given time or even date (if possible). Is there such an option?  <answer262225> System Prefs  Energy Saver  Schedule...  You can set sleep/reboot/shutdown or wake times.br There's no default option for a specific date, but there are options for day, weekdays, weekend etc.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/n9IYt.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment328523> Thanks. Is there something that combines this option with an alarm ? <comment328525> That would be a separate question really, but you can do it with Calendar <comment328683> thank you. It was part of the question though. <comment328686> Calendar can't wake it, only provide your alarm after it's awake.
