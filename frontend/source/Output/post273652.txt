How to access data of deleted accounts <body> I recently cleaned out my Mac and transferred everything onto a hard drive - or what I thought was everything. After I did this I restored my computer back to it original setting - so not it has nothing on it.   I now realized that when I backed up my computer onto the external hard drive it only backed up one of the accounts, and not all of them. (I had three different accounts on the desktop)  But now it is too late because I already deleted everything off my desktop.   I know its my fault because I deleted everything, but I thought it was okay because when I was backing it up it said it was transferring everything from the desktop onto the external hard drive. I didn't think it would only transfer stuff from that one account, and not the other two.  Is there any way I can access the two deleted accounts to recover what I had on them like pictures?  <comment344032> How did you "transfer"/backup everything to an external drive? Time Machine? <comment344036> Also, what do you mean by "account on the desktop"? The content of your desktop folder or something else? <comment344081> Yes I used time machine to back up the desktop. <comment344082> And by "account in desktop" I am referring to how you have have multiple accounts for a desktop, so when you go into the computer you can sign into your own account. The backup only saved everything from one of the accounts and not all
