Launchd to terminate what it starts <body> I have a launchd plist that uses StartCalendarInterval to start my python script at the desired time and day of the week.  Now I want to create a launchd plist that both starts and terminates a different python script at selected times.    Where is the "KillCalender" command or equivalent?  Essentially, I want the program the controls my Christmas lights come on at 1800 and go off at 2200.  I suppose I could write the main loop in my python program so it terminates at 2200 but I was hoping launchd could do this for me.  <answer160153> I would look into the ExitTimeOut value for codelaunchd.plist/code:     strongTimeOut /strong      The recommended idle time out (in seconds) to pass to the job. If no value is specified, a default time out will be supplied by launchd for use by the job at check in time.      strongExitTimeOut /strong      The amount of time launchd waits before sending a SIGKILL signal. The default value is 20 seconds. The value zero is interpreted as infinity.   <comment188310> Does python need to run whilst the lights are on or just to turn them on and off <comment188471> Yes, python would be running the whole time to blink things, switch colors etc. <comment188526> I would write an app to message your app - launchd would run the new app at 2200 <comment263540> FWIW, the man page description of `TimeOut` now includes the note "This key never did anything interesting and is no longer implemented".
