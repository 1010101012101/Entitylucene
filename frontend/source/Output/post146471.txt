A few applications are automatically opened when I first turn on the mac <body> I have a few applications that are automatically opened when I start the computer, for example TextWrangler or Activity Monitor. Is it possible to start the computer without this stupid behaviour?  <answer146473> Either these apps were running when you turned off the Mac and you are have selected to 'Reopen windows when logging back in' on the log off or shutdown dialog, or you have these apps listed in the Login Items list available from System Preferences â†’ Users &amp; Groups.  <answer268708> I'm not using TextWrangler so much, but assuming this old one picture, I can deduct that it had got strongemstartup action/em/strong, which was removed in future versions. emBut value in property list is still remains/em. So you can try this codedefaults write com.barebones.textwrangler StartupAndResumeAction 0/code.

I have not found a way to stop it of running every startup, and that's a little bit annoying. Is there another way to do it? <comment337438> Checking this last checkbox would cause open-at-startup _only_ if documents were open at the time textWrangler was quit - not any time the computer is started up. <comment337744> Thank you, @IconDaemon, I didn't get this. Otherwise, eventually I disable launch at startup searching in launch folders. And hope that this could help
