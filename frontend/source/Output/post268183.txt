macOS Sierra Archive Utility compress popping up new windows <body> After updating my macOS to Sierra I've started experiencing a strange bug. When trying to compress some stuff to a zip (via the Archive Utility) it pops up a new Finder window after each compression.  Here are my Archive Utility settings:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pVRig.png" alt="enter image description here"  As you can see "Reveal archive in Finder" is turned off. I've also tried turning it on and off a few times, but result was always the same.  It started to happen after upgrading to Sierra.  My current macOS version is 10.12.2.  Is there any fix to this?  <answer270289> Enabling and then disabling this option solves the issue for me on macOS 10.12.2.  <comment339858> Doesn't work. Try archiving a directory. It'll open new finder window.
