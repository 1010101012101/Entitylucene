Running filemaker pro 6 on an Intel-based Macbook Pro? <body> Recently moved my wife's content and settings from a white Macbook to an Intel-based Macbook pro.br So when I went to open her contacts database created in Filemaker Pro 6, no dice, since that is a PowerPC-based program.br And if I try using the later-version trial I got from Filemaker, it's Catch 22 time all over again, since I cannot import the file without having a working version of Filemaker Pro 6.  <answer83293> According to this article in the Filemaker support database, you should be able to recover your data by converting the v6 database with FileMaker Pro 11 first.   <answer259264> Filemaker 6 version files will only work on 6.  Filemaker 7 would convert the file forward (but it wouldn't be reverse-compatible to a version 6 app) (fmp7)  additionally, the next format is version 12 (.fp12)  You'll need to either have a Mac running 10.6, or a version 7 of Filemaker (which will run on any OSX from 10.4 up to 10.11), OR a version 12, on (10.9-10.11)  <comment95908> I assume that the primary goal is recovery of data, not necessarily getting v6 to run. Correct?
