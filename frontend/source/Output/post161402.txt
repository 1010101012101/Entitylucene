Scroll lock on USB keyboard does not enable scroll lock <body> I have a Windows keyboard that attaches to a KVM that I use to control my Macbook Pro and my desktop. Pressing scroll lock twice on the KVM switches between the two computers. On the Macbook scroll lock is mapped to the decrease brightness button, and pause/break is mapped to increase brightness. I can switch between the two machines, but the screen changing brightness is a bit of an annoyance.  Is there a way to map the scroll lock button to using scroll lock on just the USB keyboard?  <answer161403> Simplest might be to unmap the 'special functions' &amp; go back to having standard F-Keys for the Macâ€¦  System Prefs  Keyboard  Keyboard  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/73FFx.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer162214> A great solution (which I use) is USBOverdrive (http://www.usboverdrive.com/USBOverdrive/News.html) You simply install it, mash all the special functions on your keyboard and it should automatically assign the key the right function but you can change it manually. Hope this helps!  <answer162472> Take a look at Karabiner.  It isn't very user friendly for this level of customization but it has amazing power and flexibility.  The PrintScreen, Scroll Lock, and PauseBreak buttons are actually F13, F14, and F15.  You would have to configure the custom private.xml with something like this.  In this example, it will remap F14 (the Scroll Lock key) to nothing but only on a Microsoft Sculpt keyboard.  It will continue to be the same on the MacBook's keyboard.  precode&lt;deviceproductdef&gt;   &lt;productname&gt;SCULPT_ERGONOMIC_DESKTOP&lt;/productname&gt;   &lt;productid&gt;0x07a5&lt;/productid&gt; &lt;/deviceproductdef&gt; &lt;item&gt;   &lt;device_only&gt;DeviceVendor::MICROSOFT,DeviceProduct::SCULPT_ERGONOMIC_DESKTOP&lt;/device_only&gt;   &lt;name&gt;Disable F14 on external keyboard&lt;/name&gt;   &lt;identifier&gt;private.external.disable.f14&lt;/identifier&gt;   &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::F14, KeyCode::VK_NONE&lt;/autogen&gt; &lt;/item&gt; /code/pre  Read thru the docs regarding the device definitions and how to add your own if it isn't in the predefined list, as I've done in the example above.  The KVM switch will still detect the double Scroll Lock keypress and switch between systems.  <comment188628> The setting seems to only change the function keys on the macbook pro keys, and not on the USB keyboard. I need the USB keyboard keys to change (keeping the mac book keys the same would be ideal, but not required). <comment188629> Maybe try [Key Codes](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/key-codes/id414568915?mt=12) to try figure out what Key is actually being sent & see if you can map it. I'm assuming the KVM itself is listening only for that one specific code & cannot be remapped itself, so I'm not sure how successful you might be <comment188636> Correct, the KVM can with no software for updating the key. I've tried Key Codes just now and it doesn't catch either of those keys.
