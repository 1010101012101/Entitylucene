When attempting to open some MS Word Docs I'm asked to download - STHeiti and other fonts <body> When opening one of my documents in Word 2011 on MacOS 10.12.3, I'm asked to download a series of fonts including: STHeiti and Osaka.   I assume this means the document was opened on a computer with those fonts installed and now the file is convinced they need to exist.  I've tried accepting the downloads but the problem just returns the next time I reboot my mac.  So where should these fonts be installed and where is Office installing them?  <answer272375> The solution was hinted at in the comments.  ol liOpen FontBook/li liFind the Fonts in question - they should be greyed out/li liDownload either via the "Download" button or the context menu/li liSmile now that MS Office doesn't ask you skip/download whenever you open that doc again./li /ol  <comment341992> Do they show up in Font Book? <comment341997> Interesting, the two I could immediately think of were not. I went to FontBook - their names were present but greyed out. I download the fonts and now I just need to wait and see if that's cured the problem for at least these two fonts. <comment342000> If they're greyed out, you'll need to right click them and enable them. <comment342013> Sorry - yes and to enable I had to download via fontbook. Now the question is - did that have any more effect than MS-Office's download. I suspect I will only know when the other person edits and resaves the shared document.
