MacBook Pro suddenly started spinning fans at 100% while lid was closed for a couple of hours <body> I've been noticing some issues with my MacBook for a while now. Firstly, kernel_task sometimes takes over extreme amounts of CPU and the whole computer starts acting slow even when I'm not using it for any heavy tasks.  Note that this is a 15" MBPro 2015, all specs maxed out.  Fans are also often at full speed for seemingly no reason (just browsing the net) but that has been going on forever since I bought it, and I heard that is relatively normal for those MBPros.  But last night the weirdest thing happened. I closed the lid and went to sleep. Several hours later in the morning, I was awoken to my MacBook fans going on at 100%.  I got up to check it out and the bottom plate was pretty hot and fans still going at 100%. I opened the lid and I couldn't get it to turn on. The screen would not show anything no matter how long I waited and how many keys I pressed.   I ended up force shutting it down (holding down the power button).  Any idea what could be causing this? Is there any way I can try to figure out the problem, or is taking it to Apple for repair the only option?  <answer287000> The first thing I'd do is a NVRAM and SMC reset (in that order). Before following the steps below, ensure you have no external hardware connected and that you're using the strongbuilt-in keyboard/strong.  strongReset the NVRAM/strong  Reset the NVRAM on your MBP as follows:  ol listrongShut down your machine./strong Yes, a full shut down, not just logging out./li liPress the kbdpower button/kbd emand then/em press the kbdcommand/kbdkbdoption/kbdkbdp/kbdkbdr/kbd keys. You have to make sure you press these keys strongbefore/strong the gray screen appears or it wonâ€™t work./li listrongHold those keys down/strong until your MBP reboots again and you here the startup chime./li liLet go of the keys and let your MBP reboot normally./li /ol  strongNote:/strong When you log back in you strongemmay/em/strong need to readjust some of your system preferences (e.g. speaker volume, screen resolution, startup disk selection, time zone information, etc).  strongReset the SMC/strong  There's a couple of ways you can reset the SMC on your MBP, however I prefer the following steps:  ol liShut down your MBP/li liKeep the power cable strongplugged in/strong/li liPress at the same time kbdshift/kbdkbdoption/kbdkbdcontrol/kbd (on the strongleft/strong side of the keyboard) strongemand/em/strong the kbdpower button/kbd/li liLet go/li liTurn your computer back on with the power button/li /ol  After resetting both the NVRAM and SMC, use your computer to determine if the issues still persist.   If you're still having problems, the it's time to test your hardware with Apple Diagnostics.  strongRun Apple Diagnostics/strong  Follow the steps below to run Apple Diagnostics:  ol liFully shut down your Mac/li liRestart your Mac/li liImmediately press the kbdD/kbd key and strongkeep it down/strong until you see the Diagnostics screen appear/li liWait for Diagnostics to finish (this typically only takes a few minutes)/li liOnce complete, one of two things will appear on the screen:  ul lia emNo issues found/em message/li lia brief description of any errors found plus further instructions/li /ul/li liIf the diagnostics test does find errors, take a note of what they are/li /ol  strongNote:/strong If pressing and holding the kbdD/kbd key at Step 3 doesn't work, start again at Step 1 and, at Step 3 press and hold both the kbdOption/kbdkbdD/kbd keys instead. This will try and run diagnostics from the internet instead, so you will need to allow more time for it to complete.   Regardless, take a note of what happens and let me know how you went.
