SSH to device via USB <body> When I try to SSH over USB to my device running linux, I get "ssh: connect to host 10.90.1.2 port 22: Network is unreachable"  Mind you, I can run the same command "ssh root@10.90.1.2" on my linux machine and another mac, but on my boss's brand new machine OSX, no dice.  If I type "ifconfig" on the working mac, I get an entry like  precodeen2: flags=...   ether 5a:...   inet 10.90.1.1  /code/pre  On the non working machine, running if config shows a similar block except the part where I have "inet 10.90.1.1..." is missing.   On both machines I have gone to Network and set my RNDIS/Etho Gadget to configure IPv4 manually and have an IP address of 10.90.1.1.  Can anybody point me to a setting that might cause the ifconfig outputs to be different? I'm just not proficient with Macs.  Thanks.
