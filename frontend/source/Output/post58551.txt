How to disable animation while 3 finger swiping to desktop? <body> If I use kbdCtrl/kbd + kbd2/kbd to get into Desktop 2 it's much faster than swiping three fingers to that desktop.  Is it possible to disable the animation with 3 finger swipe?  <answer58581> The animation speed is proportional to the speed of the swipe. If you swipe fast enough, the animation will be even faster than the one used with Ctrl+2.
