Using OSX 10.7.3 with last updates.  <answer46394> I think you have a corrupted System Preferences .plist file  You can remove the current .plist file in em~/library/preferences/com.apple.systempreferences.plist/em drag that .plist to the desktop (as a backup) and try System Preferences again. It will automatically create a new, working .plist file.  <answer46395> Solution from here. Or you can use Michiel's. They are similar,except that the method below doesn't back up your plist.   ol liQuit the System Preferences application, if it is running./li liLaunch the Terminal application (found in /Applications/Utilities/)./li liType sudo -s and press Return/li liEnter the password for the current user profile (NOT the root password)./li liType cd /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration and press Return (note case sensitivity)./li liType mv preferences.plist preferences.plist.old and press Return./li /ol  <comment53008> uhm.... and if i don't have this file?? I searched entire disk, but nothing. <comment53009> Try it in here ~/Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/preferences.plist <comment53019> Nothing appened.
