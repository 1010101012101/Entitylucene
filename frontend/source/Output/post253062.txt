iOS10 Text to Emoji <body> As you (might) know, iOS 10 automatically suggests emojis to use based on text input. Some are obvious, such as love being ❤️, cool being , sad being , and happy being , however emoji like and  are not clearly represented.  So my question is: Is there a comprehensive chart or guide to what phrases pair with certain emoji, covering all current emoji? If there isn't would it be possible for you, the people of Ask Different, to create such a guide?
