Receive Apple Push Notifications behind a VPN <body> Hey guys I tried to search google for this particular question but couldn't find a solution which fits my question.  I'm trying to build an app which works only when VPN is configured properly. (The system-wide VPN toggle should be on because it's an internal network.)  Since VPN is a system-configuration I don't really worry about configure my App to make VPN work (should I?). However since the VPN is in an internal network, it can't receive any message from the outside world (eg. mails et cetera).   Is it possible to receive Push Notifications? Does Apple has any fallback for devices behind a VPN? I know from my own experience that I can receive Push Notifications even if the device is not connected to the Internet.  Does the device use 3G to receive push notifications while using WiFi to connect to the VPN?  TLDR; Is it possible to receive push notifications if the device is using a VPN connection to connect to an internal business network with no possibilities to connect to the Internet.  <comment164595> Short answer: nope. The notifications you receive when offline were already scheduled previously by the concerned app.
