Dual 4K Displays + Thunderbolt Gigabit on Late-2013 Retina Macbook Pro <body> I currently have two Dell P2715Q 4K displays connected to my MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Late 2013) using two mDP to DisplayPort cables.   I would also like to use a Thunderbolt to Gigabit Ethernet adapter. Besides the obvious physical limitation of only two mDP ports on the laptop, is there any way I can accommodate all three of these devices?  <comment330598> If you don't already have the Ethernet adapter, I'd get a Gigabit Ethernet - USB adapter. That way you won't have to worry about lack of ports
