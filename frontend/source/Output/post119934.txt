iOS 7 / iPhone 4S Headphone Jack Doesn't Work <body> My iPhone 4S that has iOS 7, the headphone jack won't work. In iOS 6 it did usually work but the sound was very low. After updating to iOS 7 the jack won't work at all. Can someone please help me out?  I use the original Apple iPhone Headphones I once bought from a Apple Store. I tested it on my iPhone 4 using iOS 6 and when i looked at the Headphone Jack it looked kinda damaged / had a crack! I listened to a quick song and the volume was very low!

Wasted money :l <comment325300> the simplest way to stop wasting money is to stop buying apple tech. :)
