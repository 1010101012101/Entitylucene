Can't move files to trash <body> Lately, my computer will not let me move my files to the trash. It doesn't give me an error or anything, it'll just give me the usual 'moving file to trash' message and it gets stuck right there. I can't stop the process and the process of moving the file into the trash never finishes. I have to force reload finder to get rid of that message and even then, the file is not in the trash. I'm honestly not sure why it's doing this.  <answer176058> I would suggest you reset your Finder by deleting its property file. As you can't delete it via Finder, you'll have to use Terminal for that  ul liOpen Terminal/li litype codecd ~/Library/Preferences/code followed by kbdEnter/kbd/li litype coderm com.apple.finder.plist/code followed by kbdEnter/kbd/li /ul  Then restart your computer.  <comment207762> I'd run a repair from disk utility after booting & holding Cmd/r <comment207764> do you have any message in the Console ? <comment207769> Have you tried restarting your computer or leaving it off fir a little bit because it may help to give your computer a break if it is at constant use <comment207890> @DannyHutchinson - my Mac has been running 24/7 since 2008, restarting only for OS updates & the occasional dust & clean; no problems yet.
