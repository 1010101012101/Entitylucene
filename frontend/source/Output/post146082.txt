Can't get the app icons to stop displaying "waiting" <body> I tried to update multiple apps at once. On the available updates screen, I pressed all. Now the icons are black and if I press them nothing happens. They have been downloading for hours, so I tried to cancel the download by going to Settings, however, that wasn't successful. How can I fix this?  <answer146086> I've had this happen before too. Usually restarting the iPhone/iPad fixes the issue. There's a great set of instructions on how to fix this located here..  http://www.iphonefaq.org/archives/971489     ol   liReboot your iPhone normally. See this link for instructions on how to restart your iPhone./li   liIf the apps are still stuck on the home screen, try logging out of the App Store temporarily. Navigate to Settings - Store - Apple ID   - Sign Out. Now open the App Store and Navigate to the Featured section. Scroll to the bottom of the page and touch the Sign In - Use   Existing Apple ID. Log in and the stuck apps should reset./li   liStill have strange icons on the screen or frozen downloading apps? Connect your iPhone to the computer and open iTunes. Navigate to the   app store. Install the apps you are having a problem with on the   computer then sync your iPhone./li   /ol   <comment215340> Matches my experience mostly, but before restarting you can also pause the downloads by tapping them, and start one at a time after the restart. Sometimes that has avoided needing to sign in and out, a big time saver when helping some slow-typing users.
