AppleScript version <body> I've tried to figure out my AppleScript version, and arrived at a contradiction.  According to Wikipedia, the latest AppleScript version is 2.7. According to this Ask Different answer, if I run the latest version of OS X, then I have the latest AppleScript version. I run macOS Sierra version 10.12.4. According to Wikipedia, the latest version of OS X is macOS 10.12 Sierra. Therefore I run the latest version of macOS. Therefore I run the latest AppleScript version. Therefore my AppleScript version is 2.7.  However, according to this Ask Different answer, my current AppleScript version is specified in the 'About Script Editor' dialog of the Script Editor application, and the 'About Script Editor' dialog of my Script Editor application says     AppleScript 2.5   We have arrived at a contradiction!  How can this be explained? How can I install the latest AppleScript version?  <answer281135> Wikipedia is incorrect.

Nevertheless, the accepted answer in the original question is still true: the most recent version of AplleScript is part of the most recent version of macOS <comment353713> Wikipedia is not an authoritative source!
