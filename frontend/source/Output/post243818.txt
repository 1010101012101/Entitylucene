How to bypass the activation screen iPhone 5s (a1530) without sim? <body> How can i bypass the activation screen of iPhone 5s (a1530) without sim card in india. The emergency call method is not working.  <answer243834> There is no way to activate it without a SIM card, but one shouldn't be that hard to get ahold of. Even borrowing one from a friend's phone for one minute or just buying a deactivated "dummy" SIM card on eBay will work fine.   <comment300364> @Tetsujin I think he's talking about SIM activation, not iCloud activation. <comment300365> Ahhh...ok... :/
