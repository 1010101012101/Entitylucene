How hard can it be to add a "rotate" action? <body> Can you guys teach me how to rotate an image so that when sent by email we actually send it in the right rotation?  <answer2481> Edit: As of 2016 this functionality is now part of iOS's native photo app  emThe following information pertains an iPhone, but I assume the iPad is identical in terms of features./em  Short Answer: You can’t rotate photos in the default iOS’s Camera Software; you need to install a third party utility, like PS Express (recommended and free):  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hALB6.jpg" alt="ps express rotate"  <answer275509> You can do this in the iOS photos app by tapping on the edit button on the toolbar at the bottom when viewing a photo, then choosing crop/rotate, then rotate.  <comment2178> weird that we need to go to 3rd party apps for such trivial action. <comment2181> The iOS is full of /facepalm things… ;) <comment346598> you do understand that this question was made in **2010 right**?... when iOS was on [version 4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS_version_history#iOS_4) :P <comment346600> @balexandre Yes which is precisely why I provided an up to date answer with the latest information. This question appeared on the front page from an edit to the question, and I noticed that the current answer was insufficient.
