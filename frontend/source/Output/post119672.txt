Can't open a file in sublime text using bash_rc <body> My bash_profile function looks like:  precodefunction st() { /Applications/Sublime\ Text.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/subl /Users/ishan/workspace/nltk_engine/index.py;} /code/pre  However, when I do st in terminal, it just opens up a sublime text window without opening the file. I copied the line in terminal and it is working. Its not working through bash_profile.  <answer119677> Since your command is a static command, you could try an alias:  precodealias st="/Applications/Sublime\ Text.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/subl /Users/ishan/workspace/nltk_engine/index.py" /code/pre  <answer119687> The codest/code function which is working when you type codest/code is an old one which you defined interactively within codeTerminal/code. If you enter:  precodetype st /code/pre  you will see that this definition is not the one you entered within your code.bash_profile/code.  To execute the definition entered within your code.bash_profile/code, you have to load it within your actual shell:  precode. ~/.bash_profile /code/pre  or  precodesource ~/.bash_profile /code/pre  And you will be able to check that from now on your definition of your codest/code function is correct with:  precodetype st /code/pre  <comment139583> This won't be static. I was just trying out using a static example. <comment139586> Which version of Sublime Text do you use? I tried with version 2.0.2 and it worked as expected: I could open a python file using a function like yours sourced from `.bash_profile`. Which is the output of `type st`? As a side comment, add functions to `.bashrc` instead, since functions not are exported to the environment. <comment139595> I finally got it to work. The mistake was that there was an alias "st" in my .bashrc also. This was creating the problem. I found it by issuing the "type" command. Thanks :). Also could you tell me what things should I put in my bash_profile and what things should I put in bashrc? <comment139603> @ishanJain Comments should be used to ask for clarifications on the given answer and similar stuff. Asking follow-up questions in comments doesn't work so well, it's better to [ask a new question](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/ask) in these cases. In your case it might also help to search through old questions here, on http://stackoverflow.com and on http://unix.stackexchange.com because it is highly likely that this topic has come up before. <comment139663> → Ishan: good question, but please follow the Patrix comment.
