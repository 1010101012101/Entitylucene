What do these dashed-box symbols mean on Japanese keyboard? <body> What do these dashed boxes mean and how to use them? img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jecfo.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer8023> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Y7srM.png" alt="Japanese keyboard layout"    Your image seems to have disappeared so I added one myself.  The dashed boxes represent the space that a normal character would occupy so you can see how the characters you're typing will be positioned.  On the middle row shown, the first key puts a mark in the lower-left position, the second key has the same position, the third shows that the dot will be in the middle of the character space and the last one shows the line will be beneath the normal character space, almost like an underscore  <answer12214> The Japanese characters on the depicted white keys are hiragana, these are what is used during direct input. So, the strongK/strong key will produce strongの/strong. The characters are arranged slightly differently on my keys; emsee my image/em. Using strongshift/strong (or strongcaps/strong) as a modifier inputs the character in the right position. For instance, strongShift &lt;/strong produces strong、/strong and strongShift /strong produces strong。/strong. Also, using strongoption/strong as a modifier will input dotted boxed characters in the upper position (only strong＿/strong exist for me).  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yacf8.jpg" alt="Macbook JIS keyboard"  If you are using Mac OS X 10.6, you should have an IME menu on your menubar. In this OS X Japanese writing tutorial reference the steps to reach the utilitiy in Fig. 4 Kotoeri to change strongInput style/strong to emKana typing/em.  I hope this helps.  Cheers!  <comment8711> Thanks! That's Cool! And do you know what the Japanese characters stand for? Does the way they are put on keys mean I can input them directly? How can I input these characters then?
