This Mac can't connect to iCloud because of a problem with myEmail popup <body> I just restarted my mac. The internet here is spotty. I saw the popup below. I really could not care less if I can connect to iCloud at the moment of a particular startup or not. I just don't want popups. Is there any way I can get rid of it, permanently? Hopefully not by disabling iCloud; I'm sure there was a reason I enabled it; likely to get rid of some other popup somewhere.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/83O9R.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer246340> I've been dealing with this same problem for a few days now (pretty annoying). Last thing I tried was to un-check every iCloud services that I had enabled, log out iCloud and just sign back in. So far it seems to be OK, I'll just try it a bit more to see if the message popup again.  To do so, just go to your iCloud settings in the System Preferences. this will open a setting windows much like this one.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/XXael.png" alt="iCloud Settings Services"  Once there you have to deselect every services selected and then proceed to codeSign Out/code   You may be ask to save a copy of your iCloud data such as Contacts, Calendars, Pictures, etc. You may uncheck the services you dont want to save a copy and then just click codeContinue/code or codeKeep/code if you have selected any of the data to keep.  If you want to re-connect with your iCloud user account (or a new one) you'll have to select codeSign In/code and then just proceed as requested.  <comment303720> Please fix this typo: Sing - Sign
