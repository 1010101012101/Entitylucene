Why won't my MacBook work with my Raspberry Pi WiFi? <body> I have my Raspberry Pi setup as a WiFi router, which works great! Except for one problem, my MacBook.  Connecting through my Galaxy Tab 3 Note? A-OK. Alcatel cellphone? A-OK. Chromebook? Sure thing.  Even my Roku 2, no problem.  But my MacBook? It connects to the WiFi no problem. I can even run a codepython -m SimpleHTTPServer/code on it and connect to the server via http://172.16.1.1:8000 and that works just fine. But if I try to codeping 8.8.8.8/code? Well, that's where we start running into issues.  I actually tried running tcpdump on my Raspberry when I started pinging code8.8.8.8/code from my MacBook, but none of the ping packets showed up. I just tried pinging from a different device and packets definitely showed up.  There definitely was traffic from the Mac - a lot of UDP traffic, some TCP. Most of the TCP packets from my MacBook were retransmissions. There were emsome/em packets that were routed back to the IP. Here are a couple of the IPs:  strongUDP:/strong  ul licode65.55.223.48,21,17/code/li licode64.4.23.170,148,142/code/li licode50.242.151.22/code/li licode37.59.40.88/code/li licode208.64.201.169/code/li licode162.254.199.136/code/li /ul  strongTCP:/strong (only these two IPs sent any TCP packets back)  ul licode65.55.223.37/code/li licode208.64.201.169/code/li /ul  So for some reason it appears that my Mac, and only my Mac, isn't doing emsomething/em right. Any clue what could be causing the connection to fail?  strongUpdate/strong:  It definitely looks like a DNS issue - Google Chrome provides an error codeDNS_PROBE_FINISHED_NO_INTERNET/code. Also, I can do codetelnet 216.58.218.206 80/code, and then interestingly enough it waits and waits and waits, but then it connects. After which  precodeGET / HTTP/1.1 Host: google.com Content-Accept: */* /code/pre  Returns with the Google 301 redirect to http://www.google.com  <answer261987> It looks like something was horked up with my routing table. Flushing my routes with  precode$ sudo route -n flush /code/pre  at the terminal several times, clearing my custom DNS entries, and turning my wifi off and then on again allows me to connect properly.  <comment328109> It isn't necessarily the Mac doing something wrong, you cannot conclude that yet. It sounds like the default gateway wasn't set on the Mac. Can you check to see if a default gateway is set, and if so, to which IP? If the default gateway is not set, it could indicate a problem with your dhcpd configuration on the Raspberry Pi. <comment328133> @jksoegaard according to the instructions I found on some other site, I went to system prefs  network  advanced  tcp/ip and I found `Router: 172.16.1.1`, so I believe it's set properly. I'm updating the question with some more information that I've discovered <comment328146> Looks like this is definitely a DNS issue - when I add `68.105.28.11`, which I'm *guessing* is my ISPs DNS it seems to work fine? <comment328192> Sounds like your dhcpd configuration is set to send out wrong DNS-servers? what is listed for DNS in the configuration file on the rPi? <comment328212> @jksoegaard see my answer - the DNS is actually fine, I guess it had something to do with the routes on the macbook.
