Which office software to choose for university and day to day tasks? <body> My daughter currently uses a Microsoft laptop for university and other day to day tasks. I'm about to buy her a Macbook Air for her 21st.  What Microsoft Office software for Mac does she need or would be best purchase?  <answer166355> Your Microsoft choices are listed here.  Main differences are, the online version and the fully installed on your hard drive.  Microsoft Office 365 (it is a online app), lower cost and 4 Years access.  Microsoft Office 2011 (on you hard drive)- no need to go to Internet.  Free app: Open Office, does almost everything Microsoft Office does.  I have the Office 2011 on my MacBook Air, it works like a charm (PowerPoint, Excel, Word), but stay away from the Outlook Email, and use the build in Apple Mail instead.  <comment194885> http://www.microsoft.com/mac/office-university <comment194888> And do not let someone at the Apple store tell you that iWork can substitute.  It cannot at that level. <comment194893> [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org) may work as a substitute, but iWork certainly won't. <comment194982> Office 365 is not an online application - it is much the same as Office 2011, with the exception that it includes updates over the lifetime of the subscription.
