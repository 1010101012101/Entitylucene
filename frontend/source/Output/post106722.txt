Applescript for deleting desktop files upon logout <body> I'm completely new to Applescript and currently very busy at work. I don't have time to learn it, I will once I find some free time, so I decided to ask you, the experts, for help.  I need an Applescript that will delete all desktop files upon log out. I'm currently running a Mac Lab with 40 iMacs and our students constantly save filed to Desktop, which creates a lot of clutter.  <answer106746> Is there any specific reason why you wouldn't want to have your students use a Guest Account on the system instead? That would allow you to provide them restricted access to the system while deleting all their files on logout automatically.  To enable a guest user:  ul liGo to strongSystem Preferences  Users &amp; Groups/strong/li liClick the lock icon to unlock it if necessary and type an administrator name and password/li liSelect the strongGuest User/strong in the list of accounts from the left sidebar/li liCheck the option strongAllow guests to log in to this computer/strong/li liYou can also setup restrictions through Parental Controls by checking the option strongEnable parental controls/strong and then clicking on strongOpen Parental Controls.../strong/li /ul  See:br Using the Guest Account in OS Xbr OS X Mountain Lion: Set up guest usersbr OS X Lion: Set up a guest account    <answer106750> You could use a shell script like this instead:  precode#!/bin/bash  rm -r ~/Desktop/* /code/pre  Or if you want to move the files to trash:  precode#!/usr/bin/osascript  tell app "Finder" to move items of desktop to trash /code/pre  Then run:  precodechmod +x /path/to/script sudo defaults write com.apple.loginwindow LogoutHook /path/to/script /code/pre  Logout hooks were deprecated in 10.4, but I haven't found any way to reliably run a program at logout using launchd.  The logout hook can only be an executable script and not a shell command.  The defaults command modifies code/var/root/Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow.plist/code. Run codesudo defaults delete com.apple.loginwindow LogoutHook/code to delete the LogoutHook key.  <answer108254> Your basic requirement is to clear files between login sessions. If you cannot use Guest Accounts, since you would be doing some custom setup for the user accounts anyway, a simple solution that is easy to manage is to strongemuse a Startup Item script that runs on login/strong instead of a logout hook (which is deprecated and may not remain a long term solution)./em  Whenever another user logs in, the files created by the previous user on the desktop would be cleared.  ul liCreate a script with the name emcleardesktop.command/em (the code.command/code extension makes it run in codeTerminal/code by default) containing the line  precoderm -rf ~/Desktop/* /code/pre/li liMake it executable by using the command  precodechmod +x cleardesktop.command /code/pre/li liAdd it to the user account's emStartup Items/em list  ul ligo to strongSystem Preferences  Users &amp; Groups/strong/li liselect the user account and go to strongLogin Items/strong/li liclick the (+) below the list on the right./li liselect the emcleardesktop.command/em script and click strongAdd/strong/li licheck the strongHide/strong checkbox next to it so that the codeTerminal/code window does not show up on login./li /ul/li liAdditionally, you can prevent users from removing this emStartup Item/em with the following steps  ul ligo to strongSystem Preferences  Parental Controls/strong/li lithen to the strongApps/strong tab/li lichecking the strongLimit Applications/strong checkbox/li liin the strongAllowed Apps:/strong list, uncheck strongSystem Preferences - Applications/strong/li /ul/li /ul  If you wish to make this solution a bit more robust, you can place the emcleardesktop.command/em file in code/usr/bin//code and set restricted permissions with codechmod 755 cleardesktop.command/code from the administrator account.  <comment126891> Thanks a lot but there are several reasons why I don't want to use Guest Account. First, you can only use one guest account and I need to set up several accounts for different groups of students (I know it sounds strange but these are the school's requirements) each allowing access to different applications. Secondly, I'm having problems with the dock. Every time I change it in Guest Account (leaving only the apps I want my students to use) it changes when I log out. Standard accounts, on the other hand, save the dock preferences so it looks the same every time you log in. <comment126892> Ok, my friend cracked it and this works (the command lines are separated by commas):                                         echo '#!/bin/bash,  rm -rf ~/Desktop/*'  ~/.clean_desktop.sh,  chmod +x ~/.clean_desktop.sh, sudo defaults write com.apple.loginwindow LogoutHook ~/.clean_desktop.sh,                                      To uninstall:                                                            rm ~/.clean_desktop.sh, sudo defaults delete com.apple.loginwindow LogoutHook <comment126908> I see that you have adopted a different approach, but I'm leaving this answer here for others who may have a similar question. <comment126909> I've also added another solution that is easier to manage as a separate answer.
