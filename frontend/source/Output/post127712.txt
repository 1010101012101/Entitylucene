Can't download over MacPorts <body> So I'm trying to install the PDO drivers for PHP via Macports. I am using codeinstall php5-mysql/code, but when I hit enter I get   precodeusage: install [-bCcpSsv] [-B suffix] [-f flags] [-g group] [-m mode]            [-o owner] file1 file2    install [-bCcpSsv] [-B suffix] [-f flags] [-g group] [-m mode]            [-o owner] file1 ... fileN directory    install -d [-v] [-g group] [-m mode] [-o owner] directory ... /code/pre  Not sure what to do now....  <answer127713> If using Macports all commands start with port - port is the origami you run - install here looks like a totally different program /usr/bin/install  So try  precodesudo port install php5-mysql /code/pre  The sudo is required as you will install into /opt/local which you will not have permission to write to.
