How can I hide the onscreen keyboard in the iOS messaging app? <body> When I enter the text message / SMS "app" and tap on the input field a keyboard pops up. When I'm done writing and have sent the message I would like to dismiss the keyboard again. I haven't found out how to so this.  The best work around I have found is to leave and enter the conversation.  But surely there must be a better way. How can you do this or is it even possible at all? I have tried almost everything.   <answer1939> This is not possible at all right now. Like you said, you can back out and go in again to dismiss keyboard. Other option is to tap the 'edit' button on top right. That will dismiss keyboard but it will go in edit mode. When you cancel out of edit mode keyboard will come back.  Apple should do something to easily bring up and dismiss keyboard...  strongUpdate/strong: With iOS 5, you can swipe messages down all the way pushing the keyboard downwards. Initially I thought, "why not just swipe down the keyboard itself to dismiss?" But now it makes sense because you start scrolling down to see previous messages and keyboard naturally goes away when you do that.  <answer6973> 'backspace' then all sms's then back to conversation and the keyboard appears minimized.   <answer12177> If you have an apple bluetooth keyboard you can hit the eject button on it to close/open it, other than that I don't think you can.  <answer12607> This gets on my nerves too but if you tap edit in the top right, the keyboard minimises until you press cancel . Although it doesn't let you load earlier conversations, it's useful if you want to read over a long text that you're replying to or something.  <answer28911> I just play around with it trying to hide it and I found out how to hide the keyboard. Pull down the conversation in a fast motion. Like swiping down the page to earlier messages quickly. The keyboard will go away. I hope it helps! :)  <answer51909> You can touch a spot right between the message text field and where the messages display and drag (not swipe) down to hide it. It's a little tricky to get the right spot, you'll have to find it through trial and error. Good luck!  <answer96379> Tap the area where the messages are with 2 fingers, this minimises the keyboard.   <answer100503> Double-tapping the message area with one finger minimizes the keyboard.  <answer138864> all you have to do is toggle the keyboard downward to dismiss it and it will go away just gently motion the keyboard down with your index finger and it will go away   <answer159888> When you want to dismiss the keybord you type "Return".  <answer218018> If you turn your phone sideways, the keyboard is slightly different and has a few different command keys on the sides. The one next to "return" will hide the keyboard. Then simply turn your phone back up and the keyboard stays hidden until you click for it to come back. I found scrolling up in the message will hide the keyboard. But this only works in the SMS screen, it does not work in apps like Google Docs, whereas turning it sideways does.img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DISMb.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer247482> Rather than swiping downward, take your index finger and drag downward on the left side of the message area.  <answer277046> My friend simply had to reset my settings...and the keyboard panel went away  <comment1656> `Apple should do something to easily bring up and dismiss keyboard...`  Yup.  It's downright annoying when you need to read a long text message. <comment4548> Yeah. Whatsapp does it fine for example. <comment33232> This works now in iOS 5, the original question was related to iOS 4. <comment33248> in iOS5 you able to hide this with swipe messages down <comment64381> Even in IOS5 it is not possible to hide the keyboard swiping if the message you are typing grows big enough to hide the conversation list. <comment113156> This doesn't work. <comment263544> Requires iPhone 6/6s Plus <comment348743> This question is from 6.5 years ago and already has an accepted answer.  Are you sure you're answering the correct question? <comment348761> Welcome to Ask Different and thank you for your answer. :) Assuming you did mean to answer this question, short answers such as this don't really provide enough detail or context to help many users. For example, your answer doesn't explain _what_ settings were reset, nor _how_ they were reset. So, as it stands, it's not very useful. Could you edit your answer (there's an _edit_ link below it) to provide the additional detail? If you're unsure of the details, then it may be best to just delete the answer.
