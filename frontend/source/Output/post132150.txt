How to set up dragging on trackpad? <body> All fine, then suddenly I'm not able to drag with my trackpad.  I can not find an option about how to change settings and I have no idea what happened?! Any idea someone how to make it back to normal?  <answer132151> Go to System Preferences â†’ Trackpad and make sure Three finger drag is enabled.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/30go8.jpg" width="668"
