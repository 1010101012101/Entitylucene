Updating bootcamp without re-installing <body> Now that the 10.8.3 update is out for Mountain Lion with Windows 8 support, I would like to update my existing Windows 8 installation (upgrade from 7) to have the new drivers without re-installing Windows.  Does the Apple tools in Windows handle the update or is there a process that I must follow?  The reason for wanting to update the drivers to get newer graphics drivers specifically.  <answer85492> Run boot camp on your Mac and download the updated Windows Support files. Once downloaded, install them on your Windows PC as you normally would.
