How do hide iPod icon with SBSettings? <body> On my Jailbroken iPad, I have SBSettings installed. I chose to hide all my application icons, but iPod will not go away, no matter what the switch setting is. I was thinking about just going into the file system and manually deleting the icon, but I don't know where it's stored.     Any suggestions?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uwohA.png" alt=""  <answer78> Are you running OS 3.1.x or 4.0.x? I've had some inconsistencies with hiding certain icons on my jailbroken 4.0.1 phone. It may be that SBSettings isn't fully compatible with OS 4.x yet.  edit: Fail on my behalf. Somehow I missed "iPad" in both your question AND tag. /facepalm  <answer1017> I just used Saurik's guide on theming and made my own iPod icon, a transparent 57 x 57 PNG. Kinda rudimentary, but it works for now. I then used iBlank to hide the shadow. Works for now lol....even though, the iPod is still selectable, kinda gotta be lucky to spot it.  <comment34> I'm on iPad (3.2.1). Now that you mention it, I have heard that there are some compatibility issues with certain jailbroken apps in 3.2....I think I'll just delete the iPod application and see what happens lol
