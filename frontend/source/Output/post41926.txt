iOS 6 SMS message delivery reports <body> Is there a way to enable delivery reports on the iPhone on the Vodafone network in Western Europe? This is a feature I sorely miss on my iPhone, being able to tell whether a message is delivered.  The functionality is available on my carrier network as I've enjoyed this functionality on my N900. Thanks.  <answer234615> strongSMS delivery reports are a network feature, not a phone feature/strong, so theoretically you might need to contact your carrier, to get more information and to check with them. Separately from it, confirmation has to be enabled/sent by recipient, I remember my old phone had this setting set to emoff/em.  strongiMessages/strong, have separate notifications and format, as they are not real SMS, but are working between iPhones, iPads, iPods and Macs. If Wi-Fi is unavailable, iMessages will be sent over cellular data. Carrier cellular data fees might apply.  h3Activate/Enable iPhone SMS and iMessage Delivery Report/h3  ol liTap codeSettings/code on the Home screen and select codeMessages/code./li liTap the codeOff/code button within the codeiMessage/code section of the Messages screen so that the button reads codeOn/code./li liTap the codeOff/code button in the codeSend Read Receipts/code section so that it reads codeOn/code./li liTap codeSettings/code to return to the Settings screen and to save your preferences./li /ol  <comment286845> The cellular network support is in place as my other handsets display the delivery reports. I'm guessing Apple's strategy is to focus on adding value to iMessage rather than SMS.
