Monitoring a file in real time <body> I need a text file monitored in a way that the contents stay updated in a window on my screen - the contents of the text file will keep changing periodically and I want the display to update the changes ASAP.  Are there any programs out there (like codetail/code for win32) that can help me achieve this? If not, could I perhaps write a script to that end?  <answer101744> Use      tail -f   on the file. That will constantly update in the current window.  <comment119862> There is also tail in OS X.
