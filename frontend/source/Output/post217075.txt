Kali Linux Dual Boot - Wifi not working <body> I am struggling to find a detailed guide on how to troubleshoot wifi once Kali Linux 2.0 has been installed.  I dual booted on my MacBook Air (El Capitan) Kali Linux 2.0, and as I have been warned, and seemingly could not avoid, I can't find the wifi interface.   After reading Debian manual, and a bunch of others, and trying them out, I seem to run into problems that are not listed.  Primarily I've narrowed down to this site for the most concise help:     https://wiki.debian.org/wl#Broadcom_BCM4311.2C_BCM4312.2C_BCM4313.2C_BCM4321.2C_BCM4322.2C_BCM43224.2C_BCM43225.2C_BCM43227.2C_BCM43228.2C_BCM43142.2C_BCM4331.2C_BCM4352.2C_BCM4360_devices_.28wl.29   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/t9uu8.jpg" alt="Module Wl not found" Can't make Module wl to work, and not sure what else to do, I've done all other steps, don't know where to go form here. My specs are:  ul liMacBook Air 15/li liInstalled Kali Linux 2.0  64 bit - Dual-Booted on an OS X Extended Journaled Partition/li liMy Wifi card chip is: BCM4360 14E4:43A0/li /ul  <answer217077> ol liI don't know what do you mean by where to find code/etc/apt/sources.list/code . It's in code/etc/apt//code as the path indicates. You can edit this from your terminal, I prefer using vim. codesudo vim /etc/apt/sources.list/code, hit Shift-G to jump to the end of the file, followed by 'o' to go into insert mode on a new line and write codedeb http://http.debian.net/debian/ wheezy main contrib non-free/code. Then hit the escape key followed by  ':' then 'wq' and hit enter to save and quit. (you're free to use any editor you want just remember to run it as root with codesudo/code)/li liKali is based on Debian Wheezy: http://docs.kali.org/policy/kali-linux-relationship-with-debian/li liWhen the first step is done correctly you should be able to do what the debian wiki says./li /ol  <comment262476> Okay, thanks, I'm moving somewhere, the first 2 steps I pass, but on the 4th step, when I input command modprobe wl, I get FATAL  "root@KaliDark:~# modprobe -r b44 b43 b43legacy ssb brcmsmac bcma  root@KaliDark:~# modprobe wl  modprobe: FATAL: Module wl not found." <comment262538> can you make a screenshot or edit your post, I can't read clearly what's in the comment. Are you sure there wasn't a  typo error in `apt-get install linux-headers-$(uname -r|sed 's,[^-]*-[^-]*-,,') broadcom-sta-dkms` ? did this command output a success ? <comment263169> Hey so do you know what to do next? @maetsoh <comment263170> Sorry can't help you I've looked around, I found many drivers but none for BCM4360
