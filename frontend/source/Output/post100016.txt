Disable ALL password prompts in Finder <body> I FREQUENTLY mess with system/hidden files in code/Library/code, code/System/code, code/bin/code, etc. and I'm tired of constantly being prompted for my (20+ Alphanumeric character) password. I'd like to have my "Administer" user account have all permission like coderoot/code. I know it's a "security" hazard, but my network is locked down, drive is file vault 2 encrypted, and password is crazy complex (good luck dictionary brute-forcers). I can run Finder as root, but how can I make it the default behavior in 10.8/10.9?  <answer100018> h2Do It Yourself: Option 1/h2  Open a Finder window in Column View. Choose codeGo To Folder/code from the codeGo/code menu. In the sheet that comes down, type code/System/Library/CoreServices/code. You'll see two Finders there. Click on one of them (just one click!) and make sure it doesn't say "Classic Application" in the preview pane. If it doesn't, then that's the one you want. Hold kbdOption/kbd and drag it to the desktop (because you want to duplicate it).  Now rename that app to codeRootFinder/code or something. Move it to your code/Applications/code directory. That's all the setup; the only part you have to repeat is from here on in.  Open the terminal. Type:  precode    cd /Applications     sudo open -a RootFinder.app /code/pre  Enter your admin password at the prompt. Note that your desktop picture will change, and a new default Finder window will pop up. Your original Finder windows or other running apps won't be affected, however. Now, you strongcannot/strong move files from one Finder to the other, but as long as you're using only the root finder (opening new windows will open them as root finder, obviously), you have full root access to the bowels of your system and you can browse directories and copy/move files much more easily.  To get back to where you were, open the Terminal again. Type codeps auxc | grep Finder/code and then codesudo kill [PID]/code and enter the PID of the Finder. The Finder will automatically relaunch in your original account, and your desktop picture will change back.  strongSource/strong: Create a GUI Finder with root access   h2Third Party App: Option 2/h2  Would you be interested in LaunchAsRoot?  From their website,  h2How to use/h2  Drag the application (or a document) you wish to launch as root on top of the codeLaunchAsRoot/code application icon in the Finder. You will presented with an authentication dialog. Enter the name and password of an administrator to allow the application to be launched by LaunchAsRoot. LaunchAsRoot quits after launching the application.  h2How to use Service:/h2  Control-click on the application (or a document) in the Finder and select "Launch As Root" from the Services contextual submenu. You will presented with an authentication dialog. Enter the name and password of an administrator to allow the application to be launched by LaunchAsRoot. LaunchAsRoot quits after launching the application.  <comment117694> Not as automatic as I would have liked s i'll keep looking. I might settle for this soon though
