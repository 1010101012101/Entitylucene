.app bundle displaying low resolution Tkinter window <body> I asked this question already on stackoverflow but since I didn't got yet an answer and this may be Mac specific I'm asking here again:   I'm using Pyinstaller to package a Python app into a Mac App. This is working fine. Recently I have added a GUI window using Tkinter to check for updates, start/stop the app, etc.   There's something strange happening which I don't understand. After running successfully PyInstaller and creating a codeonefile/code standing app I get the following outcome after running codels -al/code:  precode-rwxr-xr-x   1 karold  staff  62756614  8 lis 11:08 mac drwxr-xr-x   3 karold  staff       102  8 lis 11:09 mac.app /code/pre  Here's the outcome while running the codemac/code file (upper image) and the codemac.app/code (lower image):  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/BLMCH.png" alt="enter image description here"  Notice the difference in the window resolution, although the codemac.app/code package contains exactly the same codemac/code program ...  Is there something I'm missing to get the same solution in both cases?    <answer261534> Found the answer by carefully reading the docs.  I was missing High Resolution retina settings in the app part of my spec file, as mentioned in the above mentioned docs:   emFor example, when you use PyQt5, you can set NSHighResolutionCapable to True to let your app also work in retina screen/em  Once I added the codeinfo_plist/code parameter as provided below the problem was gone:)   precodeapp = BUNDLE(exe,      name='myscript.app',      icon=None,      bundle_identifier=None      info_plist={         'NSHighResolutionCapable': 'True'         },      ) /code/pre
