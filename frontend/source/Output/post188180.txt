Ignore bluetooth volume control in OS X <body> Is there a way to ignore incoming Bluetooth sound-volume control in OS X? And is there a way to disable outgoing volume control via Bluetooth?  Here's my situation:br I have a bluetooth speaker that has its own volume control. Every time I increase its volume, it sends a command to my Mac to increase its volume too. This is really annoying since both volumes add and volume feels like it increases exponentially.    When I connect my speaker by wire there is no problem, as I can control each volume separately.
