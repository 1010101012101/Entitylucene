Final Cut Pro, read/write via External Hard Disk <body> Please forgive my silly question but can videos be edited on FCP via external HDD? My MBP is running out of storage and I want to emstart learning/em video editing where all everything is to be done through external HDD, no SSD involved. Possible? Thanks!   <answer243208> The short answer is strongyes/strong.  However, I would definitely suggest using at minimum, a USB 3 drive, but for best performance you will want a Thunderbolt drive.  To give you an idea of what the performance metrics of different interfaces are, I've compiled a quick summary:  ul liSATA III (Internal Hard Drive) - 6Gpbs/li liUSB 3.0 - 5Gbps/li liUSB 2.0 - 480Mbps (or 0.48Gbps)/li liThunderbolt - 10Gbps/li /ul  So, while you can use pretty much any external drive, how well it performs is completely dependent on what architecture you use to connect it.  My recommendation is go with Thunderbolt.  <comment299497> You're awesome, thank you! :) <comment299561> You're most welcome and welcome to Ask Different!  If you liked the answer, please upvote.
