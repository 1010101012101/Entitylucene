Adding a comment to Facebook post acts weird when using Safari <body> I'm having this weird issue when commenting on a emFacebook/em post on emSafari/em.   It mostly happens when I try to add a kbdspace/kbd after adding empunctuation/em like comma kbd,/kbd.  What happens is that the cursor is thrown back to the starting point of comment and erases almost all the text I have entered before the empunctuation/em.  This only happens when trying from emSafari/em while it works normally on browsers like emChrome/em, emFirefox/em etc.  Did any of you run into the same issue? Is there any workaround to overcome that?  emSafari/em - emVersion 9.0.1 (11601.2.7.2)/embr emOS X/em   - em(El Capitan) Version 10.11.1 (15B42)/em  <answer218015> I had this same problem as well a few weeks ago, I believe I hit kbdtab/kbd and it fixed itself never to glitch out again. I should note though that it was a different website, I'm running Yosemite, and my memory is always not the greatest.  <answer219232> Found out this issue was resolved when I disabled the codeGrammarly/code extension which I used with codeSafari/code Thanks Agentroadkill for suggestions.  <comment263611> Thanks for the suggestion :) I'm afraid my issue wasn't fixed when I try using the  `tab` <comment263677> Huh. I definitely had this issue, I just wish I remember what made it go away. I'll keep this in min and see if it comes to me <comment263715> Sure. Btw I just figured out that when I disable the Grammarly plugin it seems working fine. I'll confirm if I didn't get that issue for the next day :)
