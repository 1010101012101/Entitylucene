Can iMac 5k be set up to change screen resolution at log in depending on user <body> I have 2 users on iMac 5k and need each user to login at a different screen resolution (Default for one,  Looks like 2048 x 1152 for the other). Is this possible / can a script be set to run on login to set the resolution?   <answer221446> Yes, the display resolution can be different for each user. This is specified in System Preferences  Displays and the computer should remember these settings at login.
