iMessage Security / Video Conferencing <body> Remember how on iChat you could block certain people or just allow certain people? Is there a way to do that on iMessage?   <answer96987> Why not try CUMeeting video conferencing software which allows multiple people in the same conference.  <comment89601> Are you asking about iMessage as a service for iOS and OS X, or the Messages app on OS X? <comment120425> I edited this to have one question. Feel free to ask the second question as a new stand-alone query.
