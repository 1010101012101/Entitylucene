Trouble installing OS X Yosemite (using bootable USB) onto MBP'12 w/ wiped HD <body> I erased the disk on a MBP ’12 running Mountain Lion before upgrading to Yosemite. So I erased the “Macintosh HD” using Disk Utility and now I’m at the “OS X Utilities” front-window in recovery mode. I have a bootable USB w/ Yosemite on it, but I'm forced to reinstall Mountain Lion.  There is no “Install OS X” menu option but rather a “Reinstall OS X” option which takes me to the process of reinstalling Mountain Lion. That would be fine if I could reinstall Mountain Lion then upgrade to Yosemite from the App Store, but there’s an error that says "This item is temporarily unavailable" when trying to reinstall Mountain Lion. Apparently the error appears for older MB's and requires a firmware update.  Any ideas what to do?
