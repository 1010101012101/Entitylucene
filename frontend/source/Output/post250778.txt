Closing an application in full screen leaves a black box in Mission Control <body> I have a MacBook Air with OS X EL Capitan 10.11.6, when I use an app like Safari or email and so on, in fullscreen mode the app work very well. But when I close the app and restart the mac I see this: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/sRFYM.png" alt="enter image description here"  or  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/cGJIF.png" alt="enter image description here"  Thank you for your help.  <answer250779> I read this and it seems to be a problem occurring when codeCMD+Q/code is brutally pushed to close a not Apple App.  Substantially, I suppose it should be a bug of the program that you are closing and so – maybe – you have to wait a bug fix update from the developer of the App in question.
