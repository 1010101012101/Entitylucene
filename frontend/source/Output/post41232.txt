Broadcast Message from root@ <body> I'm running Lion (10.7.1) and the other day I started getting these Broadcast Message notices in my Terminal.  I've google'd the crap out of it and the few threads i've found where someone actually offered a way to fix it haven't solved my problem.  I'm at a loss as to how to fix this and I use the Terminal daily and it is very annoying.  precodeBroadcast Message from root@Gregg-Bolingers-iMac.local                                  (no tty) at 18:31 CST...

This 'write all' program will send a message to all users logged into the system at one point.   I am assuming no one else has access to your machine, so perhaps there is a program you use that makes an errant (or perhaps malicious) call to /usr/bin/wall?  By changing the permissions of /usr/bin/wall to 0, no internal or external source should be able to read, write or execute the program.  Hope this explanation helps!  One more thought: Have you updated your OS to the most recent version? I have come across other instances of this where users traced the issue back to a security update released by Apple.  <comment47344> And now it has stopped.  No idea what has changed.  Frustrating. <comment47565> And now it is happening again. <comment55831> `sudo chmod 0 /usr/bin/wall` :-) <comment55862> What does that do? <comment55915> See @emb's description. But don't do it - that'd be like smashing your TV because you don't agree with something it shows to you. Better to find and fix the actual cause :)
