How to use custom font in iMovie on OSX <body> I've been trying to use a custom code.TTF/code font on OSX to watermark videos edited in iMovie. But there doesn't seem to be any option at all.  Does anyone know how to achieve this?  <answer99104> strongFirst: Install the font:/strong  ol liOpen application strongFont Book/strong/li liCopy your .TFF font and paste it into the application (or drag and drop)/li /ol  strongSecond: Change font in iMovie:/strong  If you're in iMovie and you have a textbox, select the text you want its font to change and hit strongCommand + T/strong. The font selection popup opens and you should be able to select your installed font.  <comment116461> Have you installed the font properly (e.g. is it available in the font collection)?
