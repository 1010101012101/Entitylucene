How can I automate this sequence of three keystrokes? <body> I'd like to automate this sequence:  kbd→/kbdkbd;/kbdkbd←/kbd (right arrow, code;/code, left arrow)  ...and bind it to a shortcut like mabye kbdctrl/kbdkbdshift/kbdkbdJ/kbd.  I'd like the binding to apply globally across the entire system.  I'd prefer not to install a utility like Keyboard Maestro.  Maybe Automator? Or AppleScript?  <comment314932> Can you please share your system details, such as Mac model and version of OS X? <comment314933> You could create a [DefaultKeyBinding.dict](http://xahlee.info/kbd/osx_keybinding.html) but it will only work in certain applications, and you cannot do a multiple keystrokes in response to a single command as you're looking for. Your best bet is to use a third-party utility such as Keyboard Maestro or Karabiner. Using AppleScript or Automator for a task like this, while technically possible, is like walking down to the corner store every time you want a glass of water. It's incredibly inefficient and will not happen at anywhere near the speed of using a utility designed for the task.
