Automator Combine PDF Application <body> I have created almost an exact automator application as those who have posted before me and it goes as follows;  1) Get Selected Finder Items  2) Combine PDF pages  3) Move Finder Items (+show this action when the workflow runs)  yet when I drop in pdf files into the application icon I get double the pages I initially input. Is there anyone else running into this problem and is there a way around this?  And a related question concerning the naming of output file; what function do I need to add in order to custom name each pdf binder output? As I have read sequential naming doesn't work without a shell script, are there any other solutions which do not involve external scripts other than provided by the automator?  Thank you.   <answer275036> If you want to emcustom name/em the combined strongPDF/strong emfiles/em, then add a strongRename Finder Items/strong emaction/em between the strongCombine PDF Pages/strong emaction/em and the strongMove Finder Items/strong emaction/em, with the strongOptions/strong set to checking the strongShow this action when the workflow runs/strong emcheck box/em. Set the strongRename Finder Items/strong emaction/em to strongName Single Item/strong and strongName: Basename only to: []/strong, where strong[]/strong is and empty emtext box/em.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WpwEf.jpg" alt="Automator Workflow"  Note: When first added, the strongRename Finder Items/strong emaction/em shows as strongRename Finder Items/strong however, once you select strongName Single Item/strong in the first empop-up list box/em it changes the emname/em of the emaction/em to strongName Single Item/strong.  The reason I suggest setting strongName: Basename only to: []/strong is the strong.pdf/strong extension is added automatically when the document is saved, so there is no need to type it.  hr  That said, I was able to reproduce the issue of double pages when using the above emworkflow/em as an emapplication/em See mu Update: note below for the explanation. Another way to do it, without running as a emworkflow/em from within strongAutomator/strong, is to create it as an strongAutomator Service/strong emworkflow/em as show below:  This is then available in strongFinder/strong from the strongFinder/strong  strongServices/strong emmenu/em or the strongServices/strong emcontext menu/em when selecting strongPDF/strong emfiles/em and emright-click/em or emcontrol-click/em the selected files.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DqLjV.png" alt="Automator Service Workflow"  strongUpdate:/strong The cause of the double pages when used as an emapplication/em with your original emactions/em is because of strongApplication receives files and folders as input/strong, which already receives the selected files and by adding a strongGet Selected Finder Items/strong emaction/em it is passing the selected files again and hence double the number of pages. If you want to use it as an application just remove the strongGet Selected Finder Items/strong emaction/em from your original emworkflow/em.  <comment345924> well thanks, this takes care all of my problems and I don't have a preference over being an application or a service, matter of fact a service is more attractive. Yet this duplication of pages in an application is an automator problem/bug right? <comment345932> @sle7en, It is not a bug. See the Update:, at the end of my answer.
