macOS does not resolve against local hosts file - only DNS switch helps <body> We are experiencing this issues since Sierra (we = several machines): Everytime we enter a certain network with assigned DNS via router hosts file is ignored.   Simple solution: Switch DNS provider on router. But this is necessary every morning :-( WTF? After this it resolves again against local hosts file.   Any ideas (besides configuring DNS provider in OS) or analysis recommendations?  Example from hosts: 10.12.142.185 our-infra-host  Router is a LTE fritz box with standard DNS from provider (Telekom) as well as Google DNS 8.8.8.8  <comment341938> Please add an example including (a) DNS server configuration of a router (and its model). You may obfuscate your real configs of course.
