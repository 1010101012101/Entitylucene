Higher kernel_task CPU usage when playing audio through Thunderbolt Display <body> I noticed today a higher codekernel_task/code CPU usage when playing audio through Thunderbolt Display from my Macbook Pro (early 2011) on OS X Yosemite. Although the CPU usage is not very high (15 - 20%), it certainly gets the fans spinning fast enough to get my attention. I would not expect this as a normal behaviour.  I've tried Spotify, iTunes and playing a YouTube video in Safari and got the same results. Here is an example when playing a song from iTunes through the internal speakers (I get the same values with headphones):  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pi9lP.png" alt="enter image description here"  And here is the codekernel_task/code usage when playing the same song through my Thunderbolt Display:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LSs8h.png" alt="enter image description here"  I have tried both SMC and PRAM resets, but to no avail. What could be causing this? Does anyone else experience this behaviour?  <comment274300> Same here, as soon as I select "Display Audio", kernel_task jumps to a steady 30% <comment288850> I have this problem as well. I suspect it's related to the Thunderbolt display malfunctioning. Does anyone have a pair of MacBooks and a pair of Thunderbolt Displays the can use to test this?  Running 10.11.3 (15D21) a MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Late 2013).
