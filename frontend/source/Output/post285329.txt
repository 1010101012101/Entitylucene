Valgrind for macOS SIerra on i7 MacBook Air <body> How can I get Valgrind working on my mac? Mac specs: mid-2012 11" 2GHz i7 MacBook Air with macOS Sierra 10.12.5. FWIW, codebrew install valgrind/code fails to build, as well as these steps from Zed Shaw's "Learn C The Hard Way" ex4:    precode# 1) Download it (use wget if you dont have curl) curl -O http://valgrind.org/downloads/valgrind-3.12.0.tar.bz2  # use md5sum to make sure it matches the one on the site md5sum valgrind-3.12.0.tar.bz2  # 2) Unpack it. tar -xjvf valgrind-3.12.0.tar.bz2  # cd into the newly created directory cd valgrind-3.12.0  # 3) configure it ./configure  # 4) make it make  # 5) install it (need root) sudo make install /code/pre  Valgrind also fails after modifying the file valgrind-3.12.0/coregrind/m_main.c line 4061 from:br code#if defined(VGO_darwin) &amp;&amp; DARWIN_VERS == DARWIN_10_10/codebr to:br code#if defined(VGO_darwin)/codebr (per http://valgrind.10908.n7.nabble.com/Unable-to-compile-on-Mac-OS-X-10-11-td57237.html)br ...I was able to complete an installation of Valgrind (prior to changing m_main.c the codemake/code error'd out) but unfortunately, now the simple test recommended in the README file for verifying the install is failing:       See if it works.  Try "valgrind ls -l".  Either this works, or it bombs out with some complaint.     The complaint:    precode$  valgrind ls -l valgrind: mmap-FIXED(0x0, 253952) failed in UME (load_segment1) with error 12 (Cannot allocate memory). /code/pre  I'm not sure what exactly this means, so it would be great if someone could help parse the "complaint" and suggest a means to get a successful install of or alternative to Valgrind on macOS Sierra.  FWIW: per Valgrind's website announcement:     20 October 2016: valgrind-3.12.0 is available. This release supports: X86/Linux, AMD64/Linux, ARM32/Linux, ARM64/Linux, PPC32/Linux, PPC64BE/Linux, PPC64LE/Linux, S390X/Linux, MIPS32/Linux, MIPS64/Linux, ARM/Android, ARM64/Android, MIPS32/Android, X86/Android, X86/Solaris, AMD64/Solaris, X86/MacOSX 10.10 and AMD64/MacOSX 10.10. strongThere is also preliminary support for X86/MacOSX 10.11/12, and AMD64/MacOSX 10.11/12./strong For more details see the release notes.   ...and release notes:     Preliminary support for MacOS 10.12 (Sierra) has been added.   hr  Per this solution: https://stackoverflow.com/a/43431715/5225057 I have also tried the following,  precodesvn checkout -r 16297 svn://svn.valgrind.org/valgrind/trunk cd trunk curl https://bugsfiles.kde.org/attachment.cgi?id=105218 &gt; patch.txt svn patch patch.txt ./autogen.sh ./configure make make install /code/pre  and am left with:  codevalgrind: mmap-FIXED(0x0, 253952) failed in UME (load_segment1) with error 12 (Cannot allocate memory)./code  hr  UPDATE per thiagoveloso's answer:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NziHB.png" alt="MacPorts Install Success"  precode$  man port $  port version Version: 2.4.1 $  sudo port install valgrind Password: ---&gt;  Computing dependencies for valgrind ---&gt;  Fetching archive for valgrind ---&gt;  Attempting to fetch valgrind-3.12.0_0.darwin_16.x86_64.tbz2 from http://mse.uk.packages.macports.org/sites/packages.macports.org/valgrind ---&gt;  Attempting to fetch valgrind-3.12.0_0.darwin_16.x86_64.tbz2 from http://lil.fr.packages.macports.org/valgrind ---&gt;  Attempting to fetch valgrind-3.12.0_0.darwin_16.x86_64.tbz2 from https://packages.macports.org/valgrind ---&gt;  Fetching distfiles for valgrind ---&gt;  Attempting to fetch valgrind-3.12.0.tar.bz2 from http://ykf.ca.distfiles.macports.org/MacPorts/mpdistfiles/valgrind ---&gt;  Attempting to fetch valgrind-3.12.0.tar.bz2 from https://distfiles.macports.org/valgrind ---&gt;  Verifying checksums for valgrind                                                ---&gt;  Extracting valgrind ---&gt;  Applying patches to valgrind ---&gt;  Configuring valgrind ---&gt;  Building valgrind ---&gt;  Staging valgrind into destroot ---&gt;  Installing valgrind @3.12.0_0 ---&gt;  Activating valgrind @3.12.0_0 ---&gt;  Cleaning valgrind ---&gt;  Updating database of binaries ---&gt;  Scanning binaries for linking errors ---&gt;  No broken files found. $  valgrind --version valgrind-3.12.0 $  valgrind ls -l valgrind: mmap-FIXED(0x0, 253952) failed in UME (load_segment1) with error 12 (Cannot allocate memory). /code/pre  hr  UPDATE:br per http://valgrind.org/docs/manual/dist.news.html valgrind 3.13.0 has improved support for macOS 10.12... hopefully this will be a workable solution.  <answer286132> Are you stuck to Homebrew? Otherwise you can install Macports and just type:     $ sudo port install valgrind   "Preliminary" support for macOS 10.12 has been added in version 3.12.0: Valgrind.org  <answer287046> With the June 15, 2017 release of valgrind 3.13.0, I am able to install and make use of valgrind on macOS Sierra (10.12.5). As a base case, I can successfully evaluate a very basic codevalgrind ls -l/code. I will be continuing to evaluate this build of valgrind as I complete the exercises in ZS's LCTHW.  Of note, I installed with Homebrew and have not (yet) tested installation with MacPorts or per a codecurl/code download, codemd5/code checksum, codetar/code unpacking, code./configure/code, codemake/code and codemake install/code.  per http://valgrind.org/docs/manual/dist.news.html:     Release 3.13.0 (15 June 2017)   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~      3.13.0 is a feature release with many improvements and the usual collection of bug fixes.      This release supports X86/Linux, AMD64/Linux, ARM32/Linux, ARM64/Linux,   PPC32/Linux, PPC64BE/Linux, PPC64LE/Linux, S390X/Linux, MIPS32/Linux,   MIPS64/Linux, ARM/Android, ARM64/Android, MIPS32/Android, X86/Android,   X86/Solaris, AMD64/Solaris and strongAMD64/MacOSX 10.12./strong   <comment360939> Thanks for the suggestion, have never used Macports. Do u have a working Macports install of `valgrind` on Sierra? <comment360942> Yes I do. It installs and works just fine on my 2012 13" Macbook Pro under Sierra 10.12.5. <comment360959> swEEt - thanks! Will give it a go when I am back in front of my lappy :) <comment360987> Please see my edit, the installation was successful but valgrind is non-functional. <comment361007> Yeah, I can reproduce your issue. Apparently I was very luck to use Valgrind on Sierra to debug a GIMP error, because it seems to be on the the very few applications that are currently supported -- see this comment by Valgrind's author Louis Brunner: https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=365327#c12. So I guess you'll have either to wait a little bit more until Valgrind works ok for Sierra or find an alternative - perhaps Instruments? <comment361014> Thanks... so far Ubuntu 16.04.2 LTS on a persistent boot USB or in Oracle's Virtual Box make for an environment where I can use valgrind.
