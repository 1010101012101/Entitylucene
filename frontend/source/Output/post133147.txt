How to install command line developer tools in Yosemite? <body> I am trying to install xcode developer tools via this command:  codexcode-select --install/code  and I have this error:   "Can't install this software because it is not currently available from the Software Update Server"  I am trying to install developer tools so I can use the Pillow python module. Any ideas? Thanks.   <comment157819> Just install them manually from Apple developer resource:  https://developer.apple.com/downloads/index.action?=command%20line%20tools# <comment159771> @IlyaIlin it's actually not there =/ and i'm in ios enroll program. <comment165467> This is a roundabout way but go to Terminal and type in "gcc". This will prompt you to install developer tools <comment173147> @Chip this did not work for me. I get 'gcc: no input files' <comment178004> Running `xcode-select --install` worked for me after opening xcode and accepting the license agreement.
