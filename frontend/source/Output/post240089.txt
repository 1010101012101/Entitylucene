iPhone 3G - Uninstall the jailbreak from within the phone <body> When I used to connect my iPhone 3G with the computer (via a non-original USB cable), it used to work and iTunes could read the phone. I decided to revamp the phone and jailbreak it since it was on stock OS (iOS 4.2.1), so I send it to someone to do the work.  The phone came with Cydia installed (with a couple of games), however, since then, my computer cannot read the iPhone at all, even as a hardwared connected to the USB port.  My guess is that the jailbroken iOS caused the problem. So, by uninstalling the jailbreak, I may get it to connect. Currently, the phone is completely paralyzed even with a Wi-Fi network and Cydia. I have tried (after some research) operating on the phone on both Recovery and DFU mode with no luck.  Any suggestions to help uninstall the jailbreak or repair the phone are welcomed.  <answer240232> Put your iPhone in DFU mode and that should help you restart your iPhone once again.

(though I will try DFU again since I am not completely sure how it should be done correctly). <comment295171> Here's the link on the apple support page: https://support.apple.com/en-in/HT201263
