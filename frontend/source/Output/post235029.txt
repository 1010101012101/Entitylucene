In Terminal, how to exit the two fingers history scrolling mode? <body> With Terminal 2.6.1, when I ssh a linux box, sometimes I don't know why, the two fingers scroll change behavior. Instead of scrolling the command output, it scrolls the command history.   How to exit this mode?  <answer235031> If you want to exit the history scrolling mode and switch to the command output scrolling mode go to the menu codeView -&gt; Hide Alternate Screen/code.  If you want to exit the command output scrolling mode and switch to the history output scrolling mode go to the menu codeView -&gt; Show Alternate Screen/code.  When you are in history scrolling mode holding codeShift/code allows you to scroll the command output. The reverse is not true.  This whole behavior can be disabled in   codeTerminal -&gt; Preferences... -&gt; Profiles -&gt; Keyboard/code  by unchecking codeScroll alternate screen/code  Under the checkbox, it's indicated:     When the alternate screen is displayed, send input instead of scrolling the terminal view. Press Shift to temporarily reverse this setting.   I still don't know how the history scrolling mode is sometimes accidentally activated.
