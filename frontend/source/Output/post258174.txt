How can I trace (isolate) a system freeze caused when I use mini display port (thunderbolt)? <body> mDP = mini DisplayPort = Thunderbolt (for the context of this question)  I (and presumably many others according to this: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/5478231 ) experience crippling freezes whenever I connect my OSX based macbook Air to an external HDMI display via the mDP (to HDMI) connector. This problem is applicable to ALL versions of OSX/macOS where mDP ports exist (10.8-10.12). This problem can appear on any MAC device with mDP ports. This problem manifests on seemingly ALL mDP to HDMI adaptors (that I and others have tried), irrespective of manufacturer.   My platform: macOS 10.12, macbook Air 2015 w/mDP - mDP-HDMI - 27" HDMI LED panel.  When the device is not connected to an external display, all input sources respond continuously. Once the external display is connected, the random freezes of my inputs start. This includes emany/em mouse (external, USB, BT, internal trackpad), and keyboard. The freezes appear anywhere from 2 or more seconds apart. They appear random. Sometimes frequent, sometimes infrequent, so possibly some different aggravating factors.  ul liNone of the suggested fixes at the above link work. (Have tried toggling many system settings as at the link)/li liI have no extra mDP ports available to try other ports, nor do I wish to invest in a thunderbolt hub. /li liNo wait indicators appear, /li liAll inputs just freeze, and any input which has occurred under the time-window of any freeze for a mouse is lost, but for a keyboard is caught up, making this a frustrating problem for productivity. /li /ul  br  ol limy goal is to ID the source of these freezes, and ideally get them fixed or worked around (myself or have Apple do it). /li liHow do I trace and find the root of these pauses/hangs?/li /ol  Ultimately, I suspect the Intel graphics drivers, since they are responsible for the thunderbolt connector.   <comment322680> Syslog. Should tell you <comment323150> Unfortunately, it doesn't. No message in syslog corresponds to timing of the input freezes. <comment323152> Hmm, have you checked for a regarding update. <comment323341> Check the discussions link included (Apple knows about the problem... but no update fixes it) <comment323348> Maybe because they are working on it. They won't leave something like this unfixed <comment323349> For many whole OS iterations? <comment323351> I am yet to experience this issue.
