Connecting to password protected AFP server from terminal? <body> I have one Mac set up with file sharing on the desktop, and I am trying to connect to it from my other Mac from the Terminal.  I made a folder emmount/em in em/Volumes//em, then I used the following command.  precodesudo mount -t afp afp://user:pass@ipaddress/Desktop /Volumes/mount /code/pre  (obviously I changed the user/pass/ip to the correct information)  Though whenever I try to access it, it says I do not have permission.  When I access it through Finder with the same username and password, it works perfectly fine.  delIs there any reason this is not working?/del  strongEdit/strong - If I run the codels/code command with codesudo/code I can access the files.  So update to the question:  Is there a way to change the ownership of the Volume? codechown/code is throwing the error codeOperation not permitted/code, even with codesudo/code.  <answer230180> To mount a share in Terminal use the following commands:  precodemkdir /Volumes/mount mount -t afp afp://user:pass@ipaddress/Desktop /Volumes/mount /code/pre  This works because the folder /Volumes is world read &amp; writable.  If you use codesudo mkdir /Volumes/mount/code emmount/em has the following permissions:  precodedrwxr-xr-x+ 2 root  admin  -       68  8 Mär 02:40 . &lt;- mount drwxrwxrwt@ 5 root  admin  hidden 170  8 Mär 02:40 .. &lt;- /Volumes /code/pre  and the only possible command to mount a share is:  precodesudo mount -t afp afp://user:pass@ipaddress/Desktop /Volumes/mount /code/pre  because you are not allowed to "write" (=mount) to the folder emmount/em as non-root user.  with the following result:  precodedrwx------  1 root  wheel  -        264  8 Mär 02:38 . &lt;- mount (the share "Desktop") drwxrwxrwt@ 5 root  admin  hidden   170  8 Mär 02:42 .. &lt;- /Volumes /code/pre  and you can't even open (=read) the folder with your user.  If you create the mount folder with codemkdir /Volumes/mount/code the permissions looks like this:  precodedrwxr-xr-x+ 2 user  admin  -       68  8 Mär 02:42 . &lt;- mount drwxrwxrwt@ 5 root  admin  hidden 170  8 Mär 02:42 .. &lt;- /Volumes /code/pre  After mounting the share with:   precodemount -t afp afp://user:pass@ipaddress/Desktop /Volumes/mount /code/pre  the permissions look like this:  precodedrwx------  1 user  staff  -        264  8 Mär 02:38 . &lt;- mount (the share "Desktop") drwxrwxrwt@ 5 root  admin  hidden   170  8 Mär 02:42 .. &lt;- /Volumes /code/pre  <comment280882> Clarification requested- if you can access the remote share using Finder, can you not drag the mounted volume into a terminal window after typing in "cd " instead of trying to mount it directly? <comment280892> @KarlC When I get bored, I try various things.  For example this time I was going to make a web-based file explorer on my local computer to access file shares on my network.  This can easily be done with PHP and the right permissions, but to do that I need to be able to mount the Volume via the Terminal.  I Googled it and only found the above code.  It mounts the Volume properly, but when I go to open the Volume it just says that I do not have permission to view the contents of the Volume. <comment280903> @klanomath if I use the `sudo` it mounts (unreadable but it mounts).  If I remove it I get the following error: `mount_afp: AFPMountURL returned error 1, errno is 1`. <comment280905> @klanomath The "server" mac is 10.10.5, the mac I am using is 10.11.3.
