iTunes download all songs at once <body> I can't find any way to download all my purchased songs at once.   I have a list of 100+ albums, so clicking on Downlod for each album is not viable.  I was hoping to show Account - Purchased - Not in my library. and select all albums and then download all at once, but I'm out of ideas.  Is this possible?  <answer229926> You can download an entire playlist with one click.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HfsFv.png" alt="enter image description here"  I just noticed that In your library: You can sort your music by "in the cloud" (the cloud logo). When you add the music which is only in the cloud to a playlist, iTunes will automatically download your added songs :-)  <comment280563> Even nicer is a smart playlist that updates. If you have a lot of music, you might need to come back and kick off a few downloads until it all arrives to the local storage. <comment301681> Can you clarify exactly how you get to the above location?
