Whole disk encryption with a Windows only Bootcamp <body> I've purchased myself a Mac Book Pro Retina (Haswell) and after giving Mac OS a fair shake have decided to go full Windows 7 and Bootcamp. There is no Mac OS install left on this system.  I am now looking for a way to encrypt my entire hard drive. My requirements are simple:  ul liAES based whole disk encryption (to take advantage of AES-NI)/li liAbility to boot by just entering a password/li /ul  I've looked at the following:  ul listrongTruecrypt/strong is a no-go because it is not recommended for use with SSDs/li listrongBitlocker/strong is a no-go because there is no TPM in this system and I don't want to haul around a USB thumb drive with me every time I have to boot./li listrongSymantec Whole Disk Encryption/strong appears to meet all of my requirements/li /ul  Before I drop $100 on Symantec I figured I'd ask the exerts if there is any other software out there I can use. I prefer Open Source but understand that might not be possible.  <answer119940> h2GNU Privacy Guard/h2  As a long time user of both TrueCrypt and Symantec I cannot recommend both highly enough.  I have not had any issues with either.  I have also used GPG which is OpenSource and it works well.  And here is an article from a google search which provides two other solutions I have not used.   <answer124905> It's worth noting that BitLocker can be run without needing a USB key. More information can be found here, scroll down to "Use BitLocker on a Drive Without TPM."  <answer182462> TrueCrypt works perfectly fine with SSD, I'm not sure where you got the idea that it does not.  There are more options, VeraCrypt (the new truecrypt) and DiskCryptor which is a bit faster than most for OS encryption  <comment139904> I'd love to use Truecrypt but their documentation doesn't seem to recommend it's use for whole disk encryption of a SSD because of TRIM.  Symantec says they fully support SSDs but their price tag is a bit high.  GPG doesn't do whole disk encryption I don't believe <comment139905> I know, you said so much in your question - hence I would go with Symantec.  But if you want opensource go with GNU. <comment139906> So you are looking for a decryption password at boot time? In that case yes, GPG does not do what you want it to. <comment139909> What I want is basically Truecrypts whole disk encryption. It encrypts the entire drive and at boot asks me for a password to unlock it. <comment139910> After re-reading the following:  http://www.truecrypt.org/docs/wear-leveling  and  http://www.truecrypt.org/docs/trim-operation  I've decided that I'm willing to take the small(ish) risks involved with using Truecrypt on a SSD.  My goal is to prevent the average chud from throwing a LiveCD into my system and access the files on the hard drive and I believe I can achieve that with Truecrypt.
