How to receive Google Calendar invites in my iCloud Calendar <body> When a Google Calendar user sends me an invite to my iCloud address, I only get an email with .ics files attached. I get no invite in iCloud Calendar so there is no way to respond to the invite using iCloud Calendar.  I was expecting the invite to show up on my calendar app so that I could accept or decline it there, just like it works between Google accounts.
