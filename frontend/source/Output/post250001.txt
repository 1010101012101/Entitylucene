Keyboard goes blank when trying to type special character on iPhone <body> I type Polish a lot on my iPhone, requiring special characters.  At some point, this started happening: when I try to type a special character, press and hold brings up the menu, but before I can get to the character, the keyboard goes blank, and I have to give up.  I think the phone vibrates once, and it seems like it happens when my finger slips a little off the row of characters.  A screenshot looks like this:img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/RHhNB.jpg" alt="enter image description here" What the hell is the phone trying to do, and how do I stop it?  strongEDIT:/strong This is purely intuition, but I think this is supposed to be a feature, not a bug, though I admit, I cannot figure out what the feature is.  <answer250003> Try a reset:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QZmNV.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  If that doesn't work, I think you will have to seek help from an Apple service facility.  <answer272441> iOS thinks you have touched the keyboard with two fingers to enable the virtual trackpad. It allows you to use the keyboard like a laptop trackpad and select type in a URL field with it, similar to using the magnifier in the URL field.   <comment310259> No, this has lasted through many restarts.  I did another just to be sure. <comment310284> The idea that this could be a feature is nonsense.
