xcodebuild firing after every terminal command <body> After every terminal command, the prompt becomes unresponsive for 2-3 seconds. During this time codexcodebuild/code seems to be running:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0pLu8.png" alt="xcodebuild is here"  Where would this hook be that's causing the codexcodebuild/code to be fired? I couldn't find anything in my code.zshrc/code.  <answer130422> According to this blog codezsh/code reads a whole bunch of files on startup (including code.profile/code):  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/k1TTd.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  So make sure to check all of them (and also any additional files sourced/called from there).  <answer148711> In my case, the problem had something to do with Apple's version of Git. I'm using zsh and include the current git branch in my command line, so git runs every time a new command prompt is generated. When I switched over to using Homebrew's version of Git  precodebrew install git /code/pre  and opened a new terminal, the problem went away. I'm not sure why Apple's version of git was causing xcodebuild to run every time. This was the bug that helped me figure it out: https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/issues/2189  <comment152891> @patrix : much obliged... that is **much nicer**. Thx :)
