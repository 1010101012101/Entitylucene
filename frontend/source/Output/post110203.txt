Transfering a Bluetooth keyboard & mouse from one iMac to an iMac that has never used Bluetooth <body> Is there any way to do this? I tried putting iMac 1 to sleep and waiting for the 2supnd/sup one to pick up the keyboard and mouse, but still "No keyboards have been found."  The 2supnd/sup one is, of course, the one I need to use with a few hours. I tried downloading certain programs listed in other answers, but they did not pick up iMac 2.  <answer110227> You'll also likely need to turn your keyboard off/back on and make it discoverable.  See:  http://support.apple.com/kb/ht1809  for a complete walk-through, but to be safe, turn off first mac, off keyboard, then back on while searching on the second Mac (using bluetooth control panel)  <comment129848> In the first Mac look in the BlueTooth preference panel.  Does it list your keyboard there?  With a little X on the right?  What if you click that X?  Can you then pair with the other Mac? <comment129856> No, when I disconnect it, it pairs with the same Mac. If I put the first Mac to sleep, I can't get the 2nd one to notice the keyboard, as I've never configured a wireless keyboard with it before.
