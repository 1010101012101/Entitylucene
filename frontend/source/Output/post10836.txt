Forcing bluetooth for iPhone incoming calls <body> Is there anyway to force the iPhone to always use Bluetooth for incoming calls? - I'm on a motorcycle and have my iPhone set to auto answer calls, problem is it answers with the built in iPhone headphone/microphone instead of the paired and connected bluetooth headset.  I also cannot answer with the button on the bluetooth headset as it is inside my helmet.  Any ideas? - My iPhone is jailbroken if that helps.  <answer10837> There's no way to do this via the iPhone itself, but there are voice-controlled Bluetooth headsets (such as the BlueAnt Q2) that would allow you to take the call on the headset without pushing a button.  <answer74743> Don't know if you still want a solution for this, but Cardo makes in-helmet bluetooth receivers that are awesome. The send/receive button is on the outside of the helmet then you install the mic/speaker inside (simple process).  <answer199735> You can set the phone to use the headset or speaker by default under the accessibility options.  ul liSettings/li liGeneral/li liAccessibility/li liScroll down to interaction section/li liCall Audio Routing/li liChoose headset/li /ul  <answer243733> ol liBring "Bluetooth headset with multiple pairing version",/li liIphone's sim insert in to other mobile like "Nokia" etc.,/li liNow set call divert "if not answered" with 20 to 30 seconds mode,/li liThen replace your sim in to iphone./li liNow Pair Bluetooth with Nokia &amp; Iphone also,/li liWhile riding bike if you get any call on Iphone, call will be ringing for your particular time &amp; then divert to Nokia which have already auto call answer mode is enable, that's it ! /li /ol  <comment11318> how do you set to auto answer on the iPhone ? <comment11328> Using CallController - an app you have in Cydia after jailbreaking your iPhone. I also spoke to it's developer and he says he cannot find a way to switch to bluetooth on call answer either :/ <comment11329> Interesting, I will check that out, thanks
