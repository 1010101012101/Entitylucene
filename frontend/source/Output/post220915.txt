How to force OS X to recognize Kinect power supply cable as a USB 3 device? <body> I have a Microsoft Kinect that I want to use with Open Kinect on my mid-2012 13 inch Macbook Pro. I have the correct power supply/usb cable which needs to be connected to a USB 3 port on the computer. While the computer supports USB 3, when I connect the USB cable it shows up in System Information under the USB 2.0 bus and is not recognized by the libfreenect2 driver. How do I force the computer to recognize it as a USB 3 device?
