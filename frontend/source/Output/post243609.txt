Event from my Gmail address appeared in my calendar (without sharing it) <body> I stumbled into something rather strangeâ€¦  A few weeks ago, I booked a flight, with Expedia &amp; Lufthansa, using my Gmail address. (Which is not my iCloud address!) I noticed that the event appeared in my Calendar (oh nice!).  Anyway, today, I booked another flight, using Transavia (and without any intermediary). I received the confirmation mail on the same mail address, but nothing appeared in my calendar.  That's pretty strange. I checked in codeSystem Preferences &gt; Internet accounts/code and saw that Gmail does not share the Calendar with my iCloud account. If I make a coderight click &gt; Calendar/code on the event it says that it comes from the iCloud category. How?!  I tried to enable sharing between iCloud and my Gmail account, and the flight I just booked appeared. (coderight click &gt; Calendar/code shows it comes from my Gmail account while the other still appears as from the iCloud one.)  My iCloud account is not a code@icloud.com/code address. It's a special mail address that I use solely for iCloud. I did not forward any mail from Gmail to it. There is not trace of that reservation with that mail address.  strongHow comes this flight appeared?/strong  PS: I have an iPhone. I reinstalled it a few days ago so I don't know if I was sharing my Calendar between Gmail and iCloud on that device. Even though, it should not appear as an event from iCloud, right?  PPS: After adding my Gmail address again on my iPhone, and enabling Calendar sharing, it did the same thing as on my mac: an event from my Gmail account and not from iCloud. So it doesn't seem to be the root of it.  <comment300106> The calendar event appeared because of Google, not because of Apple. Google's servers saw this confirmation email in your inbox, so the event, and added it to your Google Calendar, which syncs to your iOS/macOS calendar app.
