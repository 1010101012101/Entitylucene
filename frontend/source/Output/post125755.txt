Why does traceroute from the command line work, but traceroute via Network Utility not work? <body> I am diagnosing some mysterious network latency that comes and goes with my wife's MacBook Pro.  As part of this diagnostic work, I fired up Network Utility and used its interface to codetraceroute/code to trace the route to codewww.google.com/code.  Somewhat oddly, all of the results were of the code* * */code variety.  Suspicious, I opened up codetraceroute/code directly from Terminal and issued codetraceroute www.google.com/code.  There was a code* * */code from the second hop (right after my code10.0.0.1/code entry) but then everything flowed normally.  I then eliminated DNS issues by using traceroute against the IP address directly.  This behavior happens on all Macs in our house, so it's not computer-specific.  Here is the output from the command line (which worked):  precodetraceroute to 173.194.33.116 (173.194.33.116), 64 hops max, 52 byte packets  1  10.0.0.1 (10.0.0.1)  115.994 ms  1.265 ms  1.816 ms  2  * * *  3  te-5-2-ur02.bremerton.wa.seattle.comcast.net (68.87.205.57)  14.209 ms  12.736 ms  11.514 ms  4  ae-22-0-ar03.seattle.wa.seattle.comcast.net (69.139.164.153)  18.753 ms  14.804 ms  15.076 ms  5  he-1-4-0-0-10-cr01.seattle.wa.ibone.comcast.net (68.86.94.237)  19.233 ms     he-1-7-0-0-10-cr01.seattle.wa.ibone.comcast.net (68.86.91.165)  18.523 ms     he-1-12-0-0-10-cr01.seattle.wa.ibone.comcast.net (68.86.93.173)  16.625 ms  6  he-0-11-0-1-pe04.seattle.wa.ibone.comcast.net (68.86.85.38)  15.435 ms  21.009 ms  14.535 ms  7  23.30.207.2 (23.30.207.2)  16.739 ms  14.500 ms  15.909 ms  8  209.85.249.34 (209.85.249.34)  16.002 ms  17.200 ms  16.781 ms  9  209.85.244.63 (209.85.244.63)  15.472 ms  17.927 ms  15.836 ms 10  sea09s16-in-f20.1e100.net (173.194.33.116)  15.860 ms  27.057 ms  16.399 ms /code/pre  And here is the output from Network Utility:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/H5Y3F.png" alt="Failed Network Utility traceroute"  Leaving aside the &amp;)$(*^#&amp; problem that I'm actually trying to solve, strongwhat would account for why the two codetraceroute/code invocations would produce different output/strong?  If it matters, codetraceroute/code-via-Network-Utility never works; the command line always does.  <comment147179> Hmm, it does work for me. Does it happen for different users on the same Mac (create new one if needed)? Do you have any web proxy/firewall/parental control enabled? <comment147180> I also tried it on another mac in the house and get the same issue.  The only difference I note above (that I can see) is the packet size.  Regarding firewalls, both computers have the stock Mac firewall enabled, and the router is a stock Comcast turd that does whatever it does. <comment147181> You can change the packet size when running from shell: `traceroute 173.194.33.116 72` <comment147182> Works fine with 72 byte packets.  So much for that theory.  Any way to see what the Network Utility invocation of `traceroute` is actually doing?
