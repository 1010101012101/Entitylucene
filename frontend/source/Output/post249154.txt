Cannot log into Messages <body> I can no longer log into Messages. It normally logs me in automatically, but now it didn't log me in and the entry in the menu is greyed out. I am connecting to the internet from a different network than usual. How do I fix this?   I run OS X 10.9.5 and Messages Version 8.0 (4226)  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LOGby.png" alt="login entry in menu"  <answer249156> Look at your preferences and make sure that the account is properly enabled.  If it is, try signing out and signing back in to see if that solves the problem.  <comment308972> Dang, that worked. No, idea how the account was disabled! Thanks :)
