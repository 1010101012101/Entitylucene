iTunes Keeps Re-authorising Every Time I Open it - Windows 7 <body> Every time I shut down my computer, upon re-opening I need to go through the process as if I've just installed it - agreeing to terms and conditions, etc.  In addition, it won't actually even do that unless I go into the task manager and kill the process "APS Daemon" first.  I've checked that iTunes is up-to-date, and I've tried uninstalling it and re-installing.
