Mousing over to external display <body> When I have my external monitor hooked up, I access it by mousing off the left hand side of my Macbook display. Can I switch this so that I can access the external by mousing off to the right of My Macbook display?   The reason I ask, is my monitor is on the right side of my macbook, and it's unintuitive to mouse left to get to a screen on the right.   <answer141426> You can drag the screens into the arrangement you wish in the Displays Control Panel, just click, hold, drag. The screen you are moving will show a red surround on both the panel &amp; the display itself, so you know which is which.  The secondary display must, of course, be connected at this time. It will only appear in the panel when active.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/33oJa.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment166802> OK thanks. I didn't see "arrangement" at the time because I had unplugged the display..
