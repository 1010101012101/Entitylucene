OS X 10.9 Screen Sharing: disable file transfer <body>    On OS X 10.7 or newer (10.8, 10.9) simply drag'n'drop files between   your desktop and remote desktop to transfer the files between   computers   How can I disable this? I have made restricted account just for Screen Sharing, and I don't want remote user to be able to copy files from my machine without any serious effort.  <answer136038> You can just remove Screen Sharing server's helper tools from here:  precode/System/Library/CoreServices/RemoteManagement/screensharingd.bundle/Contents/Support/* /code/pre  Quick check didn't show anything bad for the rest of server functions.  Please note that after an OS X update these helpers might be resurrected.  <comment161206> When you say "I have restricted account just for Screen Sharing" do you mean you set up a separate account that you use for screen sharing only? And: are you aware that someone else controlling the session with screen sharing can copy files over the remote system anyway, even if not with drag&drop (since they are *controlling* the computer)? <comment161210> I've set up a restricted account (OS X call this "managed account"). This user can't run/install any app or access any site except those that I whitelisted for him. He can't copy files out of this system easily <comment161211> Well if you go through that much hassle anyway you might as well run your own VNC server or TeamViewer which allows more control. Seems like a curious use-case anyway ;-) <comment161252> This is not how SSharing works. But you can disable access to specific folders.
