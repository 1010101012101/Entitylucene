Total screen freeze in El Capitan, but audio keeps playing <body> Lately I've been having lots of issues with my Mac randomly freezing. As in, multiple times per week. These are the symptoms:  ul liMy screen freezes completely. The picture stays on screen and my computer doesn't respond to mouse or keyboard input./li liIf I have audio playing in the background, sometimes it will keep playing./li liThe Force Quit hotkey doesn't seem to do anything./li liThe only way out I've found so far is to force my computer off by holding Power./li /ul  How do I diagnose and fix the underlying issue?  h1Additional info/h1  ul liMacBook Air (13-inch, Early 2015)/li li4 GB 1600 MHz DDR3/li li27.34 GB free disk space (SSD)/li liRunning apps when I notice this: Safari, Mail (there are others, but I'm not sure if they're running every time it happens so I didn't include them)/li liActivity Monitor screenshot: I can't, because I never know when the system is about to freeze up/li /ul  As advised in the comments, I've disabled 'Allow WebGL' for now and I'll continue monitoring the situation.  <comment294487> Can you provide us with more specs? How much RAM, free hard drive space, HDD or SSD for the hard drive, which model of the Mac, a screenshot of Activity Monitor, what apps are running in the background when you notice this, if there's anything in particular that seems to trigger this. <comment294494> Check logs for events prior to powering off. See [Workaround for Freezing Macs with OS X 10.11.5 and OS X 10.11.4?](http://osxdaily.com/2016/05/19/workaround-freezing-mac-osx-10-11-5-10-11-4/]). It would appear from the comments the underlying cause can be varied. Verify disks after powering off. A repaired file system can have content errors requiring OS X reinstallation to cure. Rebooting in safe mode can clear caches, solving some causes. There will be an OS X 10.11.6 release, with any luck addressing cures for the most common cause(s). <comment294530> @user1155120 Broken link. <comment294536> [Workaround for Freezing Macs with OS X 10.11.5 and OS X 10.11.4?](http://osxdaily.com/2016/05/19/workaround-freezing-mac-osx-10-11-5-10-11-4/) (Had an extra character on the end of the broken link). <comment294551> Updated my original post. I will run First Aid on the disk. I will reboot into safe mode later today. <comment294552> Running First Aid didn't bring up any errors.
