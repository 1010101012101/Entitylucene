How do I fix "An email message can’t be created because Safari can’t find an email application."? <body> I have both Safari and Mail installed - ever since a fresh OSX Lion install. Also, I have never removed or reinstalled them or messed around with them. So this "error" message is quite a surprise to me.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WZqwb.png" alt="An email message can’t be created because Safari can’t find an email application."  How do I fix this?   <answer55396> You should use the Mail.app codePreferences &gt; General &gt; Default email reader/code pop-up menu:   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/XYGif.jpg" alt="ScreenShot of Mail.app Preferences"  If this doesn't work:  ul liSelect a different mail client/li liClose Preferences/li liReopen Preferences and re-select Mail.app/li /ul  <comment63584> In Terminal, does `open -a Mail` work? <comment63594> @lhf Yes. `Mail.app` opens. <comment63595> Thanks for the reply. I have set `Mail.app` 5.2 as the default Email reader already. <comment63602> But you didn't indicate that in your original posting, gentmatt, or I wouldn't have suggest this solution! <comment63603> Have you gone back to Preferences, selected any another client, closed & reopened Preferences, then re-reset it to Mail.app? <comment63604> Buya! That's it! Thank you and please add this info to your answer. ;)
