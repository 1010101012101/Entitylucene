How to make Terminal windows persistent <body> How can I make it so Terminal will remember the currently open windows on Quit, and reopen those windows, with all the existing text intact?  I have two machines:  ul liBoth on El Cap/li liBoth with identical Terminal preferences, including:  ul liProfiles  Window  Restore text when reopening windows strong[checked]/strong/li liProfiles  Shell  When the shell exits strong[Don't close the window]/strong br/br//li /ul/li liBoth with identical .bash_profiles (just for LSCOLORS)/li /ul  br/ On the first machine, Terminal reopens windows exactly as I left them before Quit.  On the second machine, Terminal always starts with an empty bash window.  I can still press up to get previous commands.  (And the scrollbar is different on the second machine, FWIW).  I can't figure out what's responsible for the (desired) behavior on the first machine, so I haven't been able to port it to the second machine.  Any suggestions?  <answer229508> You have "Close windows when quitting an app" checked on the machine that does not restore the terminal windows (your second machine).  This setting is in strongSystem Preferences - General/strong  emnot/em in your Terminal preferences.  Uncheck this box to get the desired behavior.  Understand however that this behavior can extend to other applications as well - it is not restricted to Terminal.app  As for the scroll bars, I suspect you will find that the strongShow Scroll Bars/strong radio button in strongSystem Preferences - General/strong is not set the same on your two machines.  <comment280030> Solved, thank you! <comment290987> Is there a way to enable this behavior only for Terminal app?
