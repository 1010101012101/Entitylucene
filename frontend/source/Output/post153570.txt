How to identify apps requesting to control the computer under Accessibility <body> I currently have this "applet" listed as being able to control my computer. Is there a way to identify exactly what this is?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/XM1Kt.png" alt="screenshot of Accessibility section"  <comment180756> I would guess a Java applet that is not properly named? <comment180757> @tubedogg that was my guess as well. I have this Java applet installed for printing on my university's network called "PaperCut NG", and I suspected that was it, but I'd like to be certain.
