Mac OS X never shuts down <body> When trying to shutdown or restart my Mac it just keep on showing the spinning wheel with the white background. I have waited for at least 15 minutes but nothing happens.  When safe booting I can successfully shutdown OS X so I guess it is probably caused by a kernel extension.  How can I find out what is hanging the shutdown process?  hr  Result of doing codekextstat -kl | awk ' !/apple/ { print $6 } '/code:  precodecom.rogueamoeba.InstantOn com.globaldelight.driver.BoomDevice com.intel.kext.intelhaxm com.rogueamoeba.InstantOnCore com.Cycling74.driver.Soundflower org.pqrs.driver.KeyRemap4MacBook foo.tun foo.tap org.virtualbox.kext.VBoxDrv org.virtualbox.kext.VBoxUSB org.virtualbox.kext.VBoxNetFlt org.virtualbox.kext.VBoxNetAdp /code/pre  <answer102631> Does it also happen when you log out? Did you already check codesystem.log/code?  Is there a logout hook (codesudo defaults read com.apple.loginwindow LogoutHook/code)? I guess not though, because normally when a logout hook does not terminate, there is a solid light gray screen without any process indicator.  You could try unloading the kernel extensions with codesudo kextunload -b $bundleid/code before restarting. Or just move the kext bundles outside code/System/Library/Extensions//code and restart once so the kernel extensions won't be loaded.  You could also try terminating different processes before logging out, or for example run codefor f in {~,}/Library/Launch{Agents,Daemons}/*.plist; do launchctl unload $f; done/code.  <comment120656> @Buscar웃 how do I "use the wake reason"? I don't understand what you mean. Yes I'm using Parallels. <comment120666> @Buscar웃 Nope. I have removed it from the menubar. <comment120667> ok, you can go true the shutdown logs and see who is making problems, also look in the /private/var/log/shutdown_monitor.log (it should be empty) <comment120668> The spotlight was the problem yesterday, not today. <comment120672> This is the file I am looking at launchd-shutdown.Tyilo.log you started the shutdown on Job manager shutdown begun at: Fri Sep 20 07:46:02 2013 <comment120679> OK, your problem starts here 1211934  com.apple.launchd.peruser.501  249      com.apple.imagent 270  Job was sent SIGTERM.  There is no clean shutdown after that. <comment120697> Try starting up in [verbose mode](https://support.apple.com/kb/ht1492) -- as far as I remember, this prints diagnostic information on shutdown as well as boot.
