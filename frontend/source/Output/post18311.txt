Double click to open documents and folders <body> Before I installed Lion I was able to open folders and documents by using double click/tap on the trackpad. Now it doesn't work anymore. Did this happen to anyone else?  How do I resolve this problem?  <answer18317> Are you unable to select things with a single tap on the trackpad? Does physically clicking still work?   When I installed Lion on my MacBook, it disabled the "tap-to-click" feature and I had to re-enable it in System Preferences  Trackpad.  <answer18319> Make sure tap to click is enabled:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ipiHq.png" alt="enter image description here"  If it still doesn't work more information is necessary.  <comment20008> Does tap to click work in other places? <comment20088> Nathan, Ross, Nano: Tap to click is enabled, I did reset, switch off--turn on, but nothing. Everything else works fine, all other functions from track pad works, I can use click/tap in browsers, 3 fingers drag, etc... Could it be bug? Should I re-install everything once again, or there could be some other solution. appreciate <comment21166> The only other thing I can think of is that Lion may have reset double-click speed to a faster setting; it could be registering your double-clicks as two single-clicks separated by a pause. Does it help to change the double-click speed (in System Preferences  Mouse) to a slower setting?
