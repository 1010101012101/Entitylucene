External HD with a Filevault 1 home directory, readable from Lion? <body> I have the HD from my old Snow Leopard Mac containing my old home directory encrypted with Filevault 1.  Can I mount this HD in a USB enclosure as an external volume on a new Mac running Lion, and read the contents of my old Filevault 1 protected home directory?  Do I need a Keychain item, or anything other than my old login password or admin password?  <answer43047> Yes you can. I've used this to recover data from an old Macbook Pro hard disk when I couldn't boot the computer itself using a SATA-to-USB caddy.  Once the old drive is attached, first you need to locate the code.sparsebundle/code file containing your encrypted home directory on your old hard disk. This lives in a hidden folder  code/Users/.&lt;username&gt;/&lt;username&gt;.sparsebundle/code   in my case this would be   code/Users/.binarybob/binarybob.sparsebundle/code  Once you've found this, you can mount it using the terminal with  codehdiutil attach binarybob.sparsebundle/code  You will be prompted for your password. Once you've entered it correctly, your home directory will be mounted and visible as a drive from the Finder (and rooted  at code/Volumes/binarybob/code)
