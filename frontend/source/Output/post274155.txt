Cant get iOS 10.2.1 and OSX 10.10.5 devices to allow phone calls from OSX <body> I'm having trouble getting my iPhone 6s (running iOS 10.2.1) to be able to make calls and SMS texts from my Mac, running OS X Yosemite 10.10.5.   I've followed this guide online: https://support.apple.com/kb/ph18756?locale=en_US  And setup computer as per the following screenshots. (Both the iPhone and Mac only have 1 iCloud account on them which is the same on both devices)   In Facetime on OSX I get the following in preferences, which would seem to show that it's enabled.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KZz18.png" alt="screenshot from facetime app on osx"  However, when I go to make a call I get the following error:   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/tMtI6.png" alt="screenshot of error"  I've double checked the settings on the iPhone under strongSettings  Phone  Calls on Other Devices/strong, but when I click enable I get this error:   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3qKIp.png" width="280"   Any ideas where I'm going wrong?  <answer274788> First, register your phone number with iMessage. It appears that it is not registered from the screenshot you provided.  brSee how here: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201349  Next, ensure your Apple ID is signed in on both devices. brGo to strongSettings  iCloud on your phone/strong and check your Apple ID here: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zwYWJ.png" alt="enter image description here" emSorry, picture looks different on 10.3 beta/em  Now, check it on your Mac. Go to strongFaceTime  Preferences/strong and check that it looks similar to the screenshot below: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WT6Cp.png" alt="enter image description here"  OK. Now let's try enabling WiFi calling again. Go to strongSettings  Phone  Calls on Other Devices/strong on you iPhone, and strongFaceTime  Preferences/strong on your Mac. Enable their respective allow calls options.  That should be it! Have a friend try calling you and see if a notification appears on your Mac while your phone is within its range.  If this doesn't work, comment and I'll try to help.  <comment345225> What's your iCloud account email address on the iPhone? Might your issue be that the Apple IDs signing you into iCloud and FaceTime on your iPhone and Mac aren't the same (as that prompt says)?
