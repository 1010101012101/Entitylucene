Auto Adjust Brightness Secondary External Non-Apple Monitor <body> I have recently purchased a Dell S2340l monitor to extend my MBPr late 2013 screen. So far I can say it's a great monitor, colors are great, but still in the test phase...  Whatsoever, I really love that the MBP auto-adjusts the screen brightness depending on the light in the room. Therefore, my question: is there any possibility that this feature can be extend to the secondary monitor as well?   <answer220142> I don't know about auto adjustment but the way around is you can creat a sort cut or using this app you can change it if there no hard button or program available for you monitor. Use this app. You can adjust brightness and also set shortcut for it  https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/brightness-slider/id456624497?mt=12  Enjoy!  <comment266408> This app that you've linked really doesn't address the OP's question / need, which is to have the external monitor AUTOMATICALLY adjust brightness based on the light in the room...   just like the built in screen does.
