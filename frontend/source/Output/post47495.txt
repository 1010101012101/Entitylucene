Automatically move old music tracks on iTunes to external HDD <body> My media are taking most of my internal hard disk drive. I wanted to know if there is a way to automatically transfer music that I do not listen to regularly on my iTunes folder to an external hard disk.  <answer47504> Steps to perform this:  ol liNavigate to the location you want to copy the files to and leave the window open in the codeFinder/code./li liCreate a smart playlist in iTunes by Option-Clicking the new playlist button in the bottom left of the main window./li liConfigure the playlist with the appropriate criteria, such as: code{Last Played} {is before} {1/1/2008}/code or whatever you consider "Old."  Click codeOk/code /li liSelect codeEdit, Select All/code and drag the items to the folder you opened in step 1.  Wait for the copy to finish and you'll have all your old music in that folder./li liTo automate the process, use Automator and configure a new workflow similar to the following image:img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Fhn3i.png" alt="Automator Workflow Configuration"/li liRig up the workflow you just created to run.  Put it in the dock, use Crontab or run it at login./li /ol  <comment54411> interesting. thanks for that, however, I dont see how this would be done automatically. If a smart playlist could be able to store all its contents in a particular directory - my problem would probably be solved <comment54501> @Newton, the answer refers to use of Crontab, which is a system job-scheduler that is set through the command line. You can set a job to run at any interval(s) you'd like (once a day, week, whenever). This sets you up to have automatic transfer.
