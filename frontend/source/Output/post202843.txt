How do I switch between Finder tabs with a keyboard shortcuts? <body> Ideally, I'd like to be able to cmd+1 == first tab, cmd+2 == 2nd tab, so on and so forth.  How can I do this?  Thanks!  <answer202844> To move forward (Show Next Tab) through the tabs use the keyboard shortcut kbdControl/kbdkbdTab/kbd, to move in the reverse direction (Show Previous Tab), use kbdControl/kbdkbdShift/kbdkbdTab/kbd instead.  <answer274465> The first answer is quite excellent. I want to add some more.  If you split different tabs into different windows, than you can use the shortcut codeCommand-`(the button on the left of 1)/codeand codeCommand-Shift-`/code to switch between windows you’ve got open in your current application.   <answer274470> I'm not sure what you mean with "Finder Tabs".   If you mean to switch between a number of tabs in your Finder Window you can do this with kbdCMD/kbd+kbdShift/kbd and strongLeft/strong or strongRight/strong Arrow.   If you mean to switch between opened Finder Windows on your Desktop you can do it with kbdSTRG/kbd+kbdF4/kbd or kbdCTRL/kbd+kbdF4/kbd  You can change this Shortcuts in your Keyboard System Settings under the strongkeyboard shortcuts/strong Tab  <comment345115> The shortcut is ⌘`, not ⌘~, and as you mention, this is for switching windows, not tabs. <comment345116> @grgarside yeah, they are the same button and I said this to disambiguate. I personally find it really handy <comment345137> I think @grgarside is saying your answer is wrong and you should edit it to be correct.
