How to disable macOS catching CTRL-A when running screen <body> I am connecting to a Linux computer through the serial port using emscreen/em on my Mac.  I ran emminicom/em on my Linux computer and minicom uses CTRL-A for commands.  But if I enter CTRL-A, the macOS catches this and tries to interpret the command.  Is there a way to temporarily disable the macOS from interpreting the CTRL-A?  <answer287370> kbdCTRL-A/kbd is used by codescreen/code to initiate a command sequence. You can either press kbdCTRL-A/kbdkbda/kbd  to send CTRL-A to the other computer or redefine it with the code-e/code option (see codeman screen/code for details).   <comment363553> I did not have time earlier to try your suggestion.  Just testing this today.  CTRL-A a does not work for me.  It did not pass to minicom.  And for the screen -e command, looks like I have to do this for each command, is this correct?  Or can I change all CTRL-A commands to say CTRL-B commands? <comment363573> You can change the prefix with the -e option, see the man page for details
