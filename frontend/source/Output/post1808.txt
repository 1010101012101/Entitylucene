Is there a backquote on the iPhone keyboard? <body> Is there a backquote (backtick kbd`/kbd) on the iPhone keyboard, and if so, where is it?  When I'm writing a post on a site in the SE family (especially SO), I want to use the backquote for inline code blocks. Under the single quote key, I've found two curly/angled quotes, but those (kbd’/kbd and kbd‘/kbd) don't seem to do the trick...  <answer1809> It seems like you have to resort to a hack to use the character:  ol liGo to an email address field (e.g. open up Mail and compose a new message)./li liGo to the symbols keyboard (3rd one)./li liType the kbd`/kbd character located on the top left./li liCopy and paste the character wherever you want./li /ol  <answer13377> The backtick/backquote was added to the iOS keyboard in 4.1. You need to switch to the numbers keypad and then press &amp; hold apostrophe to access it. Once the variations show up - slide your finger without removing it from the screen. Remove your finger when it's over the correct kbd`/kbd key.  <comment1570> Another name for the character is [grave accent](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grave_accent). <comment1571> Ouch. Especially in the iPhone world where opening up Mail means closing whatever app I'm in, which may or may not save its state... I'm pretty sure this answer is correct though. <comment14130> This is far from the best solution - see the other answer that you simply hold the normal apostrophe until the menu of many variations of the character pops up and select the backtick by sliding your finger and releasing when it's over the ` character on iOS.
