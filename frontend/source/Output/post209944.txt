Bash add Symbolic Link to Finder sidebar <body> Can I programmatically add a symbolic link to the Finder sidebar. Manually dragging is not an option.  Bash is preferred, but other options that can be invoked from bash (i.e. application with parameters) will do.  I can find lots about manually accomplishing the task, nothing about automating. I'm aware that the the sidebar appears to be PLIST format, can I just emdefaults write/em to it?
