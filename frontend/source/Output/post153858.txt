Copy and move with Ultracopier without doing it through tray icon <body> So when you start Ultracopier this warning message shows up.      The replacement of default copy/move system is not supported and blocked by finder of Mac OS X. You need do the copy/move manually by right clicking on the system tray icon near the clock (not the dock icon).   Is there a way of unblocking the default copy/move system and let ultracopier use it?  <comment181077> UltraCopier is considered [malware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultracopier). Is there a special reason for you to use it? <comment181079> wow, I did not know that. Well I'm looking for a software that can copy a huge amount of files and continue even if there is an error. The regular copy in osx doesn't do that. So essentially an osx alternative to TeraCopy. <comment181083> please check [apple.stackexchange](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/39504/best-way-to-copy-all-files-ignoring-errors)
