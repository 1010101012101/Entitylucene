'The certificate is invalid' error for multiple websites on Safari 10 <body> I keep getting error when I try to access some websites(xkcd, Soundcloud, Guardian). I've attached a picture for reference. This problem has been posted before, but there doesn't seem to be a solution yet. I'm running macOS Sierra on a MacBook Air. The weird thing is I don't get this error when I try to access the same websites safari on my iPhone(running iOS 10).  img src="https://i.imgur.com/QKKKKzY.png" alt="picture"  <comment327732> Is the time and date on your Mac ok? Certificates tend to fail when the system time is wrong. <comment327733> Questions don't get answered faster if posted again. Instead please edit the original question to add relevant details
