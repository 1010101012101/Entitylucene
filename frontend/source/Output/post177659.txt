To install Shotwell in OSX <body> I install the first dependencies of Shotwell  successfully  precodebrew install libGphoto2 vala libgee  /code/pre  Some discussion about this issue in this thread but the accepted answer is misleading, since it is about how to install codepyexiv2/code, not codegexiv2/code.   I run code./configure/code and get  precodeDetected libGPhoto 2.5.x - using 2.5-aware code path. Configured.  Type 'make' to build, 'make install' to install. /code/pre  I run codemake/code and get  precodePackage gexiv2 was not found in the pkg-config search path. Perhaps you should add the directory containing `gexiv2.pc' to the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable No package 'gexiv2' found ... /code/pre  My .bash_profile  precodeif [ -f ~/.bashrc ]; then     source ~/.bashrc fi  # http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/53058/15504 export PATH=/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin:/opt/local/sbin:$PATH /code/pre  Echoing $PATH  precode/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin:/opt/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/opt/X11/bin:/usr/local/git/bin:/usr/texbin /code/pre  strongHow can you install Shotwell in OSX Yosemite?/strong   strongHow can you install the dependency emgexiv2/em in OSX Yosemite?/strong  <answer177758> As of right now there is no codegexiv2/code brew formula but I've created and submitted one which will hopefully get accepted soon. You can follow here: https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/pull/37944  Beyond that there are various dependencies of shotwell that aren't easily available through brew, for example coderest/code and codegudev/code which don't appear to exist anywhere for OS X. I'll have a go at creating formulas for them depending on how the first one goes.  <comment210234> The linked answer only shows how to install `pyxeiv2`, *not* `gexiv2`. <comment210271> @patrix Thank you! You are right! I corrected it. <comment210384> Excellent! Let's hope that will be soon. <comment265270> How is this going? Is there perhaps a brew formula for installing Shotwell now? :) <comment265302> @Hubro Please, let us know when you know something is going to work. I have not noticed anything that works yet. You can of course try Alistair's package.
