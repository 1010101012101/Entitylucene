Multiple mouse clicks to wake iMac running macOS Sierra <body> Why do I have to click my Magic Mouse 2 separate times to wake up my iMac?  To go from screen saver, black screen to my home screen.  Happens on both my iMacs, just upgraded to macOS Sierra.  <comment321214> Odd, seen a couple of questions saying this. Mine hasn't responded to mouse clicks if it's 'nodded off' since about Mavericks. Must be Space Bar to wake mine, mouse does nothing any more & hasn't done for years
