SSH on Mac to fresh install of Firefox on 64-bit CentOS 6.4 runs but generates errors: RANDR and GLib-GIO-WARNING <body> I just installed (64 bit) Firefox 18 browser on my Linux CentOS 6.4 server (64 bit). I SSH into the server from my Mac OSX Snow Leopard from X11 application using code# ssh -Y mydomain.com/code. Now that the Mac is connected to the server, I run firefox on the server by typing in the X11 terminal on my Mac, code# firefox&amp;/code.   While firefox is forwarded to my Mac, and appears to run OK, the following errors are reported in the X11 terminal it was opened with:  precodeXlib:  extension "RANDR" missing on display "localhost:10.0". (firefox:14774): GLib-GIO-WARNING **: Failed to execute child process "update-mime-database" (No such file or directory) [the last error repeats 4 more times] /code/pre  I installed firefox in the server's code/opt/code directory as root user. I simply extracted Mozilla's .tar.bz2 file, and did no other setup other than ensure X11 forwarding works (ssh_config file on server). The browser opened to Mozilla's default webpage.  I was not able to find anything applicable to this after a google search. Wondering if anyone knows what these errors mean, what effect they will have, and finally how to remove them.  <answer97547> For the first warning on RANDR, try installing a newer version of xquartz  Searching there just now, it looks like randr was added. I can confirm that on my system which is running xquartz 2.7.4 on OS-X 10.7.5:  precode$ xrandr -v xrandr program version       1.3.5 Server reports RandR version 1.3 $ sw_vers | grep 'ProductVersion:' | grep -o '[0-9]*\.[0-9]*\.[0-9]*' 10.7.5 /code/pre  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/aa0bJ.png" alt="enter image description here"  For the last warning, does "update-mime-database" exist on the system in the user's $PATH?  <comment114456> Can you please clarify the question to explain better how OS X is involved in the problem you are facing? <comment114463> The question was originally posted on ServerFault, which was downvoted and closed and referred to post here because of X11 terminal interfacing with a Mac OS. If it's not server related (e.g. ServerFault) and not Mac related (e.g. here), perhaps you can recommend where I might post next. The question is how to eliminate the error messages I observe when SSH into server from Mac OS. <comment114482> I don't say it doesn't belong here. But as it is written it's quite difficult to understand what you are doing, what part happens on Linux and OS X and which error/warning get's thrown when. Can you try to improve the question to make this more easy to understand and request a reopen? <comment114491> Modified posting above to make clearer. <comment114509> The second error message (`update-mime-database`) looks like something which should be run on the Linux side (as the Mac only provides the display). Did you try to locate the command on your Linux system? <comment114581> It is Mac related because the firefox process running on Linux (which in X11 terminology is the x11 _client_) is trying to use an X11 extension (RANDR) which is not present in the version of quartz (which in X11 terminology is the "X11 _server_") that is running on the Mac. As I state in my answer below, later versions have that extension.(edited below to show that) And to be clear, that is a _warning_, not an error. That extension's presence is not mandatory for the x11 client process. That is one artifact of the flexibility of X11: it will sometimes _warn_ you about stuff that is not fatal. <comment114600> Thanks @Tim B, installing and running xquartz on the Mac did remove the RANDR warning observed on the server. When I SSH into server as user and type `echo $PATH` I do not see `update-mime-database` in it. Do you know what this does (I wonder if it's important)? As an aside, any idea why X11 forwarding of Firefox results in Firefox being sooooo very slow? <comment114604> As root on server, I searched `find / -iname update-mime-database` and it returned nothing. <comment114674> So you don't have that package installed. You can install it or ignore the warning. (it is common to redirect stderr to /dev/null to ignore x11 client warnings like this)
