iPhone 4S won't sync with iTunes <body> My iPhone 4S doesn't show in the left column in iTunes. I'm running iTunes 10.6.  Any ideas on how to troubleshoot this?  <answer43989> 1 - Restart.  2 - Hard reset (home and power buttons).  3 - If you have it, the XCode device manager sometimes detects devices that iTunes does not.  One of those three should solve the problem entirely, and if not - jailbroken? also any error messages?  <comment49980> Are you plugged in via USB or syncing wirelessly? <comment50043> Thanks for the tips :) Tried 1 and 2 to no luck. The iPhone doesn't show up under Devices in XCode. The phone is not jailbroken, and I don't see any error messages. <comment50044> I also tried this on another Mac, I won't show up in iTunes there either. <comment50045> I've erased all media and settings, no success :(
