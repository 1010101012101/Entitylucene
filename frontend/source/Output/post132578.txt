Opening apps in same desktop <body> I have 10.8.5.  I have a laptop with a larger monitor on an A/B switch.  I want to open AutoCAD on desktop 1 on on the main monitor.  I want to open Safari on desktop 1 on the laptop screen so I can take a class on Safari, and immediately do the work in AutoCAD.  I cannot get them to be on the same desktop.  How do I do that?  <answer132598> On 10.8.5     After you connect the displays to your computer, you can choose   whether to use the displays as an extended desktop or for video   mirroring. If you choose video mirroring, the displays each show the   same image. If you choose an extended desktop, the displays form one   large continuous desktop.      If you are playing a DVD on a television connected to your computer,   click the Arrangement button in Displays preferences and move the menu   bar to the television. If you donâ€™t see an Arrangement button, your   computer is only capable of mirroring (showing the same image on all   screens). For more information, see the manual that came with your   computer.   On 10.9.3 (Mavericks)     With an external display connected to your Mac, you can work the way   you want. Each display has its own menu bar, and apps can run in full   screen mode on each display. Want to use your HDTV as another display?   You can easily do that with AirPlay and an Apple TV.      Each display connected to your Mac can have its own windows and   full-screen apps. You can spread out your work however you like.   <comment157018> Do you mean you want them both in full screen? You'll need Mavericks for that.
