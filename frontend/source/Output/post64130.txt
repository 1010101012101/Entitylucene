Using a MacBook Pro as an external monitor <body> I would like to use my MacBook Pro (2010, with mini DisplayPort) as an external monitor for my Windows 7 PC. Before I buy an adapter, I want to know if it's even possible.  <answer64131> It is not possible. You can only use an iMac as a target display.  <answer64160> What I would suggest trying out is using a tool called Synergy. It doesn't share monitors, but it allows you to share one pair of keyboard and mice between multiple computers. Thus allowing you to have a similar set up to an external monitor. Here's a link to their website.   http://synergy-foss.org/  <comment325444> Any explanation on how/why this is the case? What does the iMac have that the MBP doesn't? Is there documentation to support his?
