Where can I get formail for OS X El Capitan (10.11)? <body> I was using formail in a utility script, but it disappeared when I upgraded to OS X El Capitan (10.11)? Apparently, it and procmail are gone.  What's a good way to get formail? Build it from source? It's not in homebrew (yet).  <answer211416> Itâ€™s included with the procmail formula:  precodebrew update &amp;&amp; brew install procmail /code/pre  <comment255085> It should be in the [homebrew](http://brew.sh/)  `procmail` package
