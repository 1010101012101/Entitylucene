Screen Recording apps for the iphone 5 (iOS6)? <body> Apart from iRecorder and Display recorder (with extremely bad reviews) I have not been able to find any other app with the ability to screencast on an iPhone.   I have already looked at this post and have been able to do it as well, but what I am looking for is an "app".  Has anybody found a decent alternate app?
