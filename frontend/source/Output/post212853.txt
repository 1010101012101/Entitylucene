Messages app stuck on blank screen on iPhone <body> After upgrading from iOS 9.0.x to 9.1 the Messages app no longer works. When I open the app all I see is a blank screen.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8plr9.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  I tried force-quitting an app by double-tapping the physical belly button, and from the list of apps flicking the Messages app upward. No help.  I tried rebooting the iPhone, doing a power off and then back on. No help.   Any ideas about what causes and fixes?
