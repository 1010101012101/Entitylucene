How do I deauthorize all computers on iTunes? <body> In older versions of iTunes (for Windows at least), there used to be a way to Deauthorize all computers associated with an account.   Now it appears the only option in 10 (10.1.2.17) is to emDeauthorize this computer.../em and removes only the one I'm on. Has the option to Deauthorize All disappeared or has it been moved somewhere else?  My reason behind needing this: One of the authorized computers had a hard drive failure and I just wanted to clean up the computers I have authorized.  <answer9146> From this Apple Support article you can do it from your account.     If you find you have reached 5 authorizations, you can reset your authorization count by clicking Deauthorize All in the Account Information screen.   The process works as follows     ul   liClick iTunes Store in the menu on the left side of iTunes./li   liIf you're not signed in to the store, click the Account button, then enter your account name and password./li   liClick the Account button again (your ID appears on the button), enter your password, and then click View Account./li   liIn the Account Information window, click Deauthorize All./li   /ul   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Tjg3q.png" alt="iTunes De-Authorize"  Also note the following:     You may only use this feature once per year. The Deauthorize All button will not appear if you have fewer than 5 authorized computers, or if you have used this option within the last 12 months. If you need assistance on using this feature please contact iTunes Store support via email.   <comment9677> Thank you! Strange that they limit it to only show when you have reached 5 authorizations. I could see that being a problem if a computer were stolen, etc. <comment134720> @DoozerBlake it's a nice feature in my opinion. Why show everyone a control when there is no problem. Only when you are blocked, do you even need to be offered the switch to remedy the situation. This prevents premature clearing.
