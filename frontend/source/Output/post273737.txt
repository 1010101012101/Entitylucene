Sierra reboot & wifi issues <body> I have a 2013 11 inch Mac Air.  Since updating to Sierra, I have noticed the following problems:  ol liWifi often slows drastically, this can be resolved for a temporary amount of time by rebooting, but usually reboot is required again at some point/li liWhen initially booting, the login screen box is surrounded with ??? symbols instead of text/li liOnce booted, the Siri, Maps, iBook and iPhoto apps reappear in Dock, even if I have previously selected Remove From Dock/li /ol  If anyone has suggestions on how to resolve these problems I'd be grateful to hear them.  Regarding point 2, I have also already tried deleting the wifi settings and forcing refresh of them that way.  Thank you for any help!
