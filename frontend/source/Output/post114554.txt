./ vs normal execution <body> This is probably a question more for unix systems but because i have it on my Mac Pro i hope i will find an answer here :  When i browse to code/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.7.0_11.jdk/Contents/Home/db/bin/code  with a cd I can't execute the command startNetworkServer present in bin , instead i can run it via code./startNetworkServer/code.  However from code~/code  precodeMacCris:~ cris$ /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.7.0_11.jdk/Contents/Home/db/bin/startNetworkServer /code/pre  it works without ./  Any idea why ? (rights related ?)  Thanks  <answer114557> ul licode~/code = home folder nothing else./li licode./something/code will execute that something (be it script or binary)br Writing the full path is the same as executing with code.//code/li licodecd/code is change directory, so it will strongnot/strong execute/li /ul  These are all standard unix/linux command line commands  strongReferences:/strongbr http://linuxcommand.org/learning_the_shell.php http://www.arachnoid.com/linux/shell_programming.html  <answer114558> This is due to the behaviour of your shell that is running in there Terminal.app. It is probably the bash shell  When you ask the shell to run a command if you provide an absolute path (that is beginning with code//code as your second one does) it will try to execute that program at that path. If you provide a relative path (i.e. one not starting with code//code) it will try to create an absolute path by prepending the directories that are in your PATH environment variable to what you typed. As your current directory or code./code is not on your PATH it cannot find  a file to execute. If the path begins with a code./code the it will repave that by the absolute path of your current directory and thus get a path that can be executed.  <comment134217> Thanks...but is not that i do not know those commands (basic ones) is that the behaviour is different when i try to execute   via full path or when i am in that directory
