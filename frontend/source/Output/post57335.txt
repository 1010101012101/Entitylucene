iMessages sending to old phone <body> I gave my old iphone 3 to my friend and have realised he is receiving my imessages that i receive on my new iphone 4S. Please can you tell me how i stop this so he stops received my messages?  thanks  Caroline  <answer57337> Try doing this on the iPhone 3:  ol liGo to strongSettings / Messages / Receive at.../strong /li liTap on your Apple ID and Log Out./li /ol  <answer57342> You should have reset your phone before passing it to someone else. I'd suggest asking your friend to reset your phone by going to:  strongSettings  General  Reset  Erase All Content and Settings/strong  This will erase all your personal content and settings from the device.
