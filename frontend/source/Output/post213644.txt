Which one is the delete button on an Apple keyboard? <body> I use the kbdcmd/kbdkbdbackspace/kbd shortcut but in some applications kbdfn/kbdkbdbackspace/kbd seems to work as well. So which one it the delete hotkey in OS X El Capitan?  <answer213645> A detailed description on this is available on this post https://superuser.com/questions/482771/difference-between-cmdbackspace-and-fnbackspace-keyboard-shortcuts-in-osx  h3To summarize:/h3  ul liThe most commonly used key for deleting elements that can be selected in the user interface is strongemBackward Delete/em kbd⌫/kbd/strong since it's available without a modifier on all Apple keyboards. This applies to songs on a playlist, graphics in an image editor, deleting text boxes in Pages, etc./li liThe strongemForward Delete/em kbdfn/kbdkbd⌫/kbd/strong is mostly used for the same actions, so you can actually use both in an interchangable way for most applications, be it Numbers, Excel, iTunes, Photoshop, etc. /li liThe strongemcombination/em/strong kbd⌘/kbdkbd⌫/kbd is intended for actions that might have an immediate (unwanted) effect. One could indeed map trashing files and folders to a simple kbd⌫/kbd, but this could lead to accidental deletions. Finder uses the modifier as a safeguard. This also explains why iTunes will only delete a song emwithout/em confirmation if you press the kbd⌘/kbd modifier./li /ul  <answer213647> In a text editor…  kbd Fn /kbd kbd Backspace ← /kbd is the equivalent of kbd Delete ⌦/kbd for short keyboards without that key  ul likbd Backspace ← /kbd deletes the character before the cursor.  /li likbd Delete ⌦/kbd deletes the character after the cursor.  /li likbd Cmd ⌘ /kbd kbd Backspace ← /kbd deletes the entire line before the cursor./li likbd Opt ⌥ /kbd kbd Backspace ← /kbd deletes the word before the cursor./li likbd Opt ⌥ /kbd kbd Delete ⌦/kbd deletes the word after the cursor./li /ul  In the Finder…  ul likbd Cmd ⌘ /kbd kbd Backspace ← /kbd deletes the selected file(s)./li likbd Cmd ⌘ /kbd kbd Delete ⌦/kbd has no function./li /ul  <comment257922> You need to clarify **where** in El Capitan, fn/backspace & cmd/backspace perform totally different functions. <comment257923> Do you want to know the key combo for file deletion or the "forward delete key" on the keyboard? <comment257925> This answer is as confused as the question. <comment257929> @Tetsujin, thanks, added more details. <comment257984> Much better - removed downvote :)
