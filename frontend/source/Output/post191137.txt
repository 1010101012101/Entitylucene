itunes keeps prompting authorization on a new account <body> I had a new iPad Air 2 (it's second-handed actually), I created a new apple id and I downloaded an app on this id, but iTunes keeps telling me that I should authorize my PC, I go to store-authorize this computer and then I enter my ID and password, nothing happens, and the PC (the iTunes on PC) keeps telling me to authorize every time I try to install an app, I'm using windows 7 the iPad is IoS 8.1.2 I had an iPad 3 before with a different ID, does that affect anything?  <comment227061> Is your problem on the PC? If so, version of OS and iTunes will help. If it's on the iPad - be sure to explain when it pops up. (i.e. only when USB connected or some other time) <comment227067> @bmik I've just edited the question <comment227088> I suspect you have apps that were purchased/free that were downloaded via the original owners apple id?   If so you need to delete those and re-download them under the new appleid.  Really what should have happaned when you bought this second hand was an "Erase all content and Settings" so that you could set it up like it was a new iPad with your appleid.  If you haven't done much with the iPad and that wasn't done you might want to now.
