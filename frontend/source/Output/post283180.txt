Possible to check Photos database for missing photos? <body> While debugging a Google Photos upload problem I realized that there are some photos in my Masters folder that aren't in my library. Is there some automated way to find all of these? I'd like to look at what's missing before adding them in wholesale, just in case there was a reason I pulled them out in the first place. With over 15,000 images this isn't something I can do manually.
