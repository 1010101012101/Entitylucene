Connecct 3 External Displays to iMac (Retina 5K, 27-inch, 2017) <body> Is it possible to connect 3 external displays (for a total of 4, including the built-in 5K display) to an iMac Retina 5K, 27-inch, 2017? I have the Radeon Pro 580 with 8GB of VRAM.  I do strongnot/strong need the external displays to be high resolution. In fact, all three of them need to connect via VGA using the following resolutions:  ul liExternal displays 1 &amp; 2: 1920x1080/li liExternal display 3: 1280x720/li /ul  If necessary the 3rd display could be a different connection type (e.g. DVI) and/or resolution. The specs for external displays 1 &amp; 2 are not negotiable.  I've reviewed this iMac's specs which seem to say only 2 external displays are supported via the two ThunderBolt 3 (USB-C) ports. However in my research about ThunderBolt it seems like it should be possible to run two simple displays off of one port.  <answer293101> I have attached 3 external displays to my MacBook circa late 2011. I stumbled across this nifty product:br Diamond USB Multi-Display Adapter  1 monitor is via the MiniDisplay port and 2 are attached to a USB hub (at USB 2.0 speed).  emHowever/em, on some forum (that I can't even find anymore) someone mentioned this could possibly cause my CPU to overheat. I have used this 3 monitor config for a few days with no problems and I just started monitoring CPU temp.  I suspect that the performance on those USB monitors is awful? I've no idea. I know so little about graphics, I don't even know how to test them for performance...  <comment369963> Sorry to trouble but could you please let me know if you went with the Diamond USB Adapter? There is so much talk about needing Thunderbolt to add more than 1 external monitor. Now, I'm low on the food chain of Apple knowledge, and I bet that I could (and for just $51 might) add a 4th monitor with that product. <comment369964> btw: With so much screen real estate, I can't function without 2 magic trackpads. And, there is a way to assign the monitor into which each app opens its files. anyway, sorry to trouble. <comment370024> I have not tried your solution yet but I may end up doing so. I have some hoops to jump through on my end first so it will be a while before I can post back.
