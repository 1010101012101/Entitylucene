What are next steps when fsck reports "could not be repaired after 3 attempts"? <body> My Mac Book Pro 13.-" doesn´t get past the grey booting screen with the apple and the spinning wheel (The loading bar appears but when it´s done nothing happens)   I have 220 GB in one single Partition (Macintosh HD) and there is all my work my music and the only copy of ALL MY PHOTOS. I´m so stupid I don´t have a backup of anything but know I have an external HD with 300GB space. I would like to repair my HDD but more important I need to save my files but I don´t know how to do it in Disk Utility Mode. I read there is a Diskwarrior but I don´t know how to install it without booting the mac. Please help!!!  When I start on Single User mode and enter /sbin/fsck -fs this appears  precodeExecuting fsck_hfs (version diskdev_cmds-557-393)  Checking Journaled HFS Plus volume.

Of the many commercial products, Disk Warrior is what most use, but Data Rescue might work as well./li liErase the HD - losing all data, and see if this was simply a catalog corruption that Disk Utility was unable / unwilling to repair (pretty fair chances)/li liReplace the HD - postponing whether the data can be saved, but getting a good drive in the Mac so you can test if it's the drive / particular data on that drive or the Mac needs repair./li liPay for a repair tech to do the repair./li /ol  Unless you have data that's valuable (in that you might pay between $100 and $1000 dollars to have professional recovery help), I would pick one of the inner two options which means buy a new drive (benefits are fixed sunk cost and limited investment of time to troubleshoot) or look extended troubleshooting like Disk Warrior or erasing the drive if you have a backup, don't really need one.  <answer121968> You can try this but please make sure you backup first:   Boot to single-user mode, hold down the command (i.e. cloverleaf or Apple) and "s" keys as the system begins to boot.  To Debug, Repair, Force (and fix errors automatically)  precode/sbin/fsck_hfs -drfy /dev/disk0s2 /code/pre  To scan for bad blocks:  precode/sbin/fsck_hfs -S /dev/disk0s2 /code/pre  Assuming disk0s2 is the one you are looking to repair. (Usually the default "Macintosh HD" drive.)  This should get you back inside your OS.

Do you think the genius in the apple store will be able to help? and 2. How do I install Diskwarrior if I can´t boot my mac? Thank you for your answer <comment93532> Yes - the Genius Bar sees this problem and helps people understand options tens of times each day/week. Optical media, recovery HD or external drive would all boot your Mac in most cases. <comment93543> DiskWarrior comes on a bootable DVD, from which you then run the utilities. <comment93588> Thank you very much. On Saturday I have an appointment at the Genius Bar. <comment229803> I ran the command a 2nd time and second time around it worked <comment279484> The 2ND part of the solution to scan for bad blocks doesn't work. Says that S is invalid. Is that a typo? <comment355182> @user173292 it works just fine in my end. <comment359733> Had to run the `fck_hfs -drfy` command twice until it was successful.
