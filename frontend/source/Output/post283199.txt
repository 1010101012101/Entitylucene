Disabling Default-Browser check in Chrome on macOS <body> On OSX El Capitan, when I start up Chrome while having set OSX's default browser to another app, Chrome complains that it is not the default browser. How can I switch this message for ever off?  I read that I can do this with Group Policies by setting the codeDefaultBrowserSettingEnabled/code policy, and I can even see the policy in Chrome via codechrome://policy//code (as not set).  However in the browser I cannot change the policy and my computer is a single machine which I administer directly, so how can I push the policy to Chrome just from my local machine?/
