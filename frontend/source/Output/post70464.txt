How to compile gcc-4.0 on Mountain Lion? <body> So far I've successfully launched the configure, but when I type make, I get the following error, after some time (there's a lot which compile successfully):  pre ld: unknown/unsupported architecture name for: -arch i686 /usr/bin/libtool: internal link edit command failed make[2]: *** [libgcc_s.dylib] Error 1 make[1]: *** [libgcc.a] Error 2 make: *** [all-gcc] Error 2 /pre  Is there a way to tell gcc not to compile itself for the i686 architecture?  Here's my codeuname -a/code if it can help:  pre Darwin Frizlabs-Computer.local 12.2.0 Darwin Kernel Version 12.2.0: Sat Aug 25 00:48:52 PDT 2012; root:xnu-2050.18.24~1/RELEASE_X86_64 x86_64 /pre  PS: I know gcc-4.0 is ancient, but I do need it.  <answer70616> Someone on serverfault answered the same question. So here's the way to compile gcc-4.0 on OS X Mountain Lion (copied from serverfault):  First get the old 4.0 package that was included with XCode 3.1 from Apple's Open Source page  Download the gcc-5493 package and build using:  precodemkdir darwin cd darwin ../configure --prefix=/tmp/testplace --enable-languages=objc,c++ make bootstrap make install /code/pre  <answer70667> I just compiled the dev version from a git clone and it compiles with gcc 4.7.2  <comment81775> Wh do you need gcc 4.0, surely better to fix that reason, and perhaps easier <comment81779> I want to compile SheepShaver, which is a complex project and only compiles (AFAIK) with gcc-4.0. Trust me, if I could avoid compiling gcc-4.0, I would! <comment81780> The macports port of sheepshaver seems to use the standard Apple compiler and the [home page](http://sheepshaver.cebix.net/) seems to show no need for gcc 4.0 (+ there are binaries there) <comment81782> Using the default compiler (clang) does not work **at all** (the compiler crashes while compiling! I've submitted a bug report to Apple). I've also tried compiling with gcc-4.2, using the same command lines/patches used in MacPorts. The program compiles but does not work. I read somewhere SheepShaver had to be compiled with gcc-4.0, that's why I'm trying to compile it first as its not available anywhere in binary form on Mountain Lion. <comment81783> re binaries click on the binary links to http://www.emaculation.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=20&t=7360&sid=f901ceca77d7cbf4884f7ef7dee9ffa1 <comment81792> I don't want the binary of SheepShaver, I want to compile it from scratch. I have to compile it to patch it.
