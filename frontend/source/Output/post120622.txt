How to delete a trusted s/mime certificate for a contact in iOS7 <body> How do I remove a s/mime certificate for a contact in iOS7 mail.app?  I'm using s/mime for two-way encrypted emails with several colleagues. A new colleague tried to install s/mime in Outlook for Windows and he sent me a signed email which I opened in iOS and trusted the certificate.   Then he changed his mind and stopped using s/mime (trouble with Outlook). iOS still tries to encrypt the email messages I send to him so he sees blank messages. I can find no way to list the certificates I have trusted for my contacts so I can remove this certificate.   Where do I have to look?  <answer120623> You should be able to view and remove certificates or S/Mime if you go to:  ol liMail, Contacts and Calender/li liGo to your mail account/li liClick advanced /li liUncheck S/Mime or remove the certificate/li /ol  Please also check out this Official Apple Guide By clicking the name in the Mail.App you should be able to revoke the certificate.  Check this image:   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/aAx8t.png" alt="Don&#39;t trust"  <comment140636> that would remove my personal certificate, which would break the encryption to my other colleagues. I just want to remove a single contact's certificate, which I "trusted" by tapping their name in an incoming email and then tapping "Trust" on the certificate. <comment140638> @Steve please check the edit <comment140889> My problem is that I cannot get to there: because he has stopped sending signed emails, when I tap on his name I get his address book contact card (both from an existing email received from him, and when creating a new email to send). Is there another way to get to the place you show in your image? I'm using iOS7. Your image looks to be from an older version? <comment181444> for those who follow: the only solution i found was a clean install of iOS. When I got a new phone, i created it as a new device rather than restoring my old phone to it.
