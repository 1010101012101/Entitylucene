How to backup/export photos/videos from the new Photos app to an external hard disk? <body> I have a huge library in the new Photos app on my Mac OS X Yosemite machine, I want to know the easiest way to export or backup all these photos and videos on an external hard disk (formatted for Mac), giving that, I want to use the photos and videos on a Window 7 machine.  emNote/em: the option codeFile -&gt; Export/code will take forever to export thousands of these items.  <answer193050> If you simply want the entire Masters structure copied to a new drive, then   ul lifirst find your iPhoto or Photos Library file. Default location for both is ~/Pictures//li liRight click the Library file &amp; select Show Package Contents - that will expose the 'file' as the folder it really is./li liThe Masters folder should be just inside. You can copy that to anywhere.br It is sorted into years, then months. Not all contained folders will actually be populated, if old photos were ever deleted, the file structure remains./li /ul  As pointed out in comments, if you need the copied structure to be readable natively on Windows, then you ought to format the target disk as ExFAT.br Windows cannot natively read Mac OS Extended disks &amp; would need 3rd party support.  <answer250815> I know this is old and answered, but I think the script I put together after a day of googling and trying is worth sharing.  Modify your options, and this script either moves or copies your originals to a folder named 'yyyy-mm-dd Your Album Name'. So you keep track of your original album titles, and all photos are sorted by day as well.  Modify to suit your needs.. I do this to be able to have a shared file base of original photos synced by dropbox, and all sharing users can have their own copy of Photos.app use that as a base for referenced photos.   It attempts to avoid overwriting photos with the same name, by first verifying if a non-identical file exists at the same path already.  Also, it sets the timestamp of the newly made folders to the date of the events they have. Nice to sort events by date in finder or whatever, although the folder names already start with the date (because if you copy them elsewhere, timestamps may change anyway).  It is compatible with single quotes in album names. It may be compatible with quotation marks, but I have NOT tested that.  precode#!/bin/bash  #### A few options #### #dryrun=1 dryrun=0  # Choose to duplicate (slow, space eating) or move (space saving, fast if on same drive). #action=cp action=mv  # set your paths # origin: libr="Photos Library.photoslibrary" # destination: destpath="MyProperlyOrganizedFotos"  # no idea why Apple chooses a funny date.

Current edits will require you to export. Masters can be dug out of the Library wholesale. <comment229909> You'll want to have your disk formatted as ExFAT so that the Windows PC can read your drive. <comment260651> This provides essentially the bare minimum export functionality.  You're going to lose all of your library organization and tags this way.  Isn't there a better option? <comment260653> Not to export for anything other than Photos. <comment275718> Or you'll need to use third party software on the PC to enable it to read a Mac disk. <comment311899> While this link may answer the question, it is better to include the essential parts of the answer here and provide the link for reference.  Link-only answers can become invalid if the linked page changes. - [From Review](/review/low-quality-posts/175021) <comment311920> Welcome to Ask Different. That's a great software find that I'm sure a lot of people will be interested in, but as @fbara said, please flesh out your answer with further information about how it will help resolve the user's question. <comment320005> Please add more context than just a link as they often go stale. A quote from the site would suffice. <comment324450> Be aware that this only exports named albums. If a photo is not in a named album (and this does not include shared albums) it will not be exported.
