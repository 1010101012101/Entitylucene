SMS message does not show up on locked screen for one contact <body> A SMS (text) message does not show up on my locked screen for one contact only. What do I do to fix this problem?  <comment332164> Do you have 'Do Not Disturb' on for that particular contact? <comment332177> If you don't know what "do not disturb" is then open. That person messages  and click the blue circled i in the upper right corner of the screen, look for Do not Disturb on the next screen.
