Remove / ignore tags from cloned backup drive <body> I have a backup drive attached to my main computer, which I use to clone my main drive every night via SuperDuper.  My problem is that if I use the new tags feature in OS X 10.9, I get duplicate entries in my tag "folders". One for the main drive, and one for the clone drive.  Any way around this apart from ejecting the drive? SuperDuper is meant to have the ability to mount/dismount the drive before/after the backup runs, but I've never had any luck with this.  <comment145963> Same issue here. I back my laptop up to my desktop with Chronosync. When I search tags, I get those on both computers.
