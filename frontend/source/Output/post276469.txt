Apple MacBook Air stuck in continuous boot loop <body> All of a sudden my MacBook Air has started continuously rebooting. The screen cuts out, it goes back to apple logo then log in prompt. I can log in and then after a few seconds typically it cuts out and process repeats. Sometimes it cuts out before I can even log in.  The time is quite variable before it does cut out and restart.  I booted to safe mode and have run disk diagnostics about three times now, every time it comes back all fine.  I panicked and finally bought a dedicated external hard drive and did a time machine back up which completed successfully.  After this I rebooted normally and things seemed fixed, I was using it for about 30 mins with no reboots until an app which switched to full screen caused it to cut out and the same behaviour to start again.  If it's not the disk- what could it be and where should I go from here?

However, I'd still do a NVRAM and SMC reset (in that order) as there's really no harm in trying that first. Before following the steps below, ensure you have no external hardware connected and that you're using the strongbuilt-in keyboard/strong.  strongReset the NVRAM/strong  Reset the NVRAM on your MBA as follows:  ol listrongShut down your machine./strong Yes, a full shut down, not just logging out./li liPress the kbdpower button/kbd emand then/em press the kbdcommand/kbdkbdoption/kbdkbdp/kbdkbdr/kbd keys.

Let me know how you go.  <comment348010> This seems like a kernel issue, it shouldn't just "reboot" from nowhere (not even showing a message!). I would recommend you to reinstall macOS and see if that fixes the problem. A clean installation would be recommended. <comment348041> I'd try resetting the SMC and NVRAM before installing the OS. However, if the resets don't work, I'd try installing a clean copy of the OS like @AlejandroIván suggested
