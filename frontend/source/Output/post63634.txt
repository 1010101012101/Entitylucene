How can I diagnose or fix the CalendarAgent occupying a whole CPU on Mountain Lion? <body> Since I upgraded to Mountain Lion from Lion I see the CalendarAgent process occupying a large amount of 1 CPU on my late-2008 MacBook Pro. To fix this (as suggested by a Google result) I tried removing all online calendar accounts then re-adding them. This seemed to work for a while, but now the problem has returned (perhaps due to me either deleting some iCloud calendars or adding an additional Google calendar delegate). I don't really want to have to remove all my calendar accounts each time I add or remove a single calendar, so can anyone point me to the root cause of the problem?  In case it's useful, the call graph from the process is pasted here.  UPDATE: I removed one of the delegates from one of my Google calendar accounts, and that prevented this problem occurring. This isn't really a solution though, as I now can't access that calendar.  <answer66716> I am still looking for a solid answer.   In the meantime, I have the following script running in AppleScript Editor.  This script looks for the codeCalendarAgent/code every 15 seconds and kills the process.     This renders calendar syncing unusable, but at least I can use my Mac again.  I will let this run until I find a permanent solution.    The script is:  precoderepeat   set app_name to "Finder"   do shell script "killall -9 CalendarAgent"   delay 15 end repeat /code/pre  <answer115631> May have to kill and rebuild Calendar db:  ol liDisable the Calendar service from your account in System Preferences â†’ Internet Accounts/li liRemove the preferences/database files for Calendar:  precoderm -r ~/Library/Calendars/ ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.iCal.plist /code/pre/li liRe-enable the service./li /ol  supSource: http://robert.accettura.com/blog/2012/08/19/how-to-stop-calendaragent-from-eating-cpu//sup  <answer192766> Using Google delegates definitely caused the high-CPU problem with me.    The simple solution is to:  ol liUncheck the delegation w/in Calendar's Account info window (as indicated by the UPDATE above)/li liChange your Google calendar sharing by selecting the desired calendar(s) within the Google Sync Settings page: https://www.google.com/calendar/syncselect/li /ol  Making this change eliminated the high-CPU problem, without needing to resort to the kill-the-CalendarAgent approach.    <comment85943> Are any of these calendars Microsoft Exchange calendars you have access to through Exchange webmail? If so, login to the Exchange account and dismiss any reminders. If you don't have access to the Exchange calendars, ask the owners to dismiss any reminders. <comment85945> You might want to read through this post for another solution: http://robert.accettura.com/blog/2012/08/19/how-to-stop-calendaragent-from-eating-cpu/ <comment104952> Never really got to the bottom of this, though this was a solution to the symptoms, hence accepting. <comment135306> Welcome to the site.

Remember: when re-enabling it eats CPU for a little while.
