How can one set Electrum as default bitcoin uri handler? <body> Bitcoin links are formatted beginning with codebitcoin:/code followed by a bitcoin address and optionally more information.   On my Mac, the Bitcoin-QT program is the default one to open when I click such links. I wish to change it to the Electrum client.   My question is - where in MacOS are the uri handlers defined? How can I change this to open my program of choice?
