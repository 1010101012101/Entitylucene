Installing Octave with Brew in Lion <body> my first question on AskDifferent! (let me know if I'm doing it wrong.) Anyway, I'm trying to install octave using brew and am getting the following error but unsure how to proceed:      ~/ brew install octavebr   == Installing octave dependency: cmake   == Downloading https://downloads.sf.net/project/machomebrew/Bottles/cmake-2.8.7      ################################################################## 100.0%      Error: SHA1 mismatch   Expected: f218ed64ce6e7a5d3670acdd6a18e5ed95421d1f   Got: 3a57f6f44186e0dba34ef8b8fb4a9047e9e5d8a3   Archive: /Users/Billy/Library/Caches/Homebrew/cmake-2.8.7.bottle.tar.gz   (To retry an incomplete download, remove the file above.)       ~/    Any help would be greatly appreciated.  Best, B  <answer43821> You seemingly have a bad download in the cache. Do this:  precoderm /Users/Billy/Library/Caches/Homebrew/cmake-2.8.7.bottle.tar.gz /code/pre  And then try again. Make sure you're up-to-date first: codebrew update/code.  <comment49807> Tried to tag with octave but it wouldn't let me. <comment49809> I actually already tried that before I posted and just ended up with the same error ... Thanks though edit: missed your note to brew update, had completely overlooked that ... trying again. will get back if it succeeds. <comment49810> ah the sweet taste of success. hat tip to you sir. <comment49811> I think one of our maintainers changed the file keeping its filename the same. So this error can occur. I apologise.
