GUI PGP / GnuPG application <body> I encrypt all of my documents before storing them in the cloud with GnuPG. My wife needs access to the documents, but running codegpg -d foo.pdf.gpg/code at the command line is annoying to her.  Does anyone know of a GUI app for PGP / GnuPG for MacOS X? It would be great to simply drag an encrypted file to it, be prompted for a private key passphrase, and then get the unencrypted file.  If nothing like this exists, I can probably whip one up in Clojure pretty easily, but I figured it was worth looking for one first.  <answer121096> Create a new service with automator so your wife can decrypt the file using the contextual menu in the Finder.  ol liCreate an Automator service/li liService receives selected strongemfiles or folders/em/strong in strongemFinder/em/strong/li liAdd a strongemRun Shell Script/em/strong action. /li liAdd your code: codegpg -d $1/code/li liSave the service./li liIt is now available in the Finder via emRight click  Service  youServiceName/em./li /ol  <answer121097> You can also use gpgtools (https://gpgtools.org) it is got all the possible GPG tools you are probably going to need (they also have a gpg plugin for Apple Mail) and adds  Services for signing/encrypting/decrypting/etc. to the contextual menu (right-click-Services).  <comment141147> This is perfect, thanks! <comment141148> I accepted the GPG Tools answer because it was exactly what I asked, but thanks a lot for this tip! I actually did not know what automator services were, so this is really useful for the next time I need to script something. Very helpful! <comment141151> That's the spirit of this site ;) <comment177063> This tool seems cool. But it doesn't add anything to services automatically. <comment177537> Something must have failed when you installed. I never had to do anything particular after installing the tools and when I right-click on a file or folder I get the full set of Services: validate, sign, encrypt, decrypt, etc. In OS X 10.7 to 10.10.
