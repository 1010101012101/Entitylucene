How do I enable key repeat on iOS? <body> I am working on a project in iOS and would like to enable key repeat. I have done quite a bit of looking around and have failed to come up with any option like that (which surprises me quite a bit, actually).  Is there a way to enable key repeat on an iOS device?   <answer92448> h1No.*/h1  *At least not for the software keyboard. I believe that an external (USB or BlueTooth) keyboard will repeat such keys.   <answer225758> Yes, iOS allows key repeat for Bluetooth keyboards, and you can even change the key repeat rate as follows (quoting LucaMarconato):     If you go in Settings-General-Accessibility-Keyboard-Key Repeat   you can set the Key Repeat Interval to 0,03 seconds (the minumum   allowed).   <answer247585> Yes, sort of. I needed to repeat the * for separation of text. I was able to create a keyboard shortcut to place a line of stars by double tapping the * key. Worked for me, hope this helps.  <answer273528> I wanted to create a single line across the page On iPad. I went to Settings-General-Accessibility-Keyboard-Text Replacement.  There you can add a keyboard shortcut for complete phrase. I created a shortcut consisting of a double tap of the underscore key to create a complete line of underscore keystrokes.  <comment108098> Not possible from the screen keyboard, but maybe from a wireless keyboard?  I can't test it myself... <comment274018> The software keyboard interprets a long press as an attempt to choose an alternate character, i.e. holding down "a" gives you options for: ã å ā à á â ä æ. <comment300384> This doesn't seem to work for "normal" keys, only  for arrow keys, space, and delete <comment343890> Isn't this the same answer as posted by Rob Lawrence a year ago?
