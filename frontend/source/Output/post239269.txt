What's the port left to the audio output? <body> I found a port left to the headphone output (the one plugged in with a cord with a green jack), right to the USB ports, and under the SD card slot. It has the same radius as the headphone output. What is it?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/byb8O.jpg" alt=""  <answer239271> That's the audio in port.     img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mrm5Z.png" alt=""      strongAudio in/optical audio in port/strong      The Audio In port accommodates both digital optical input and analog audio input.      Analog audio line input is accepted through a 3.5mm mini phone jack. The sound input port accepts line-level stereo signals up to 24-bit stereo 44.1-192kHz sampling rate. It also accepts a stereo miniplug-to-RCA cable adapter for connecting stereo equipment to the computer.      Optical audio input is SPDIF format and uses a standard TOSLINK cable with a TOSLINK mini-plug adapter, accepting up to 24-bit stereo and 44.1-96kHz sampling rate.
