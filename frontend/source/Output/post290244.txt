Can't pair JBL Flip 3 to MacBook Pro 13" running macOS 10.12.5 <body> My JBL Flip 3 won't connect to my 13" MacBook Pro running macOS Sierra 10.12.5.   Here's what I do:  I open my Bluetooth preferences on my MBP and power up the Flip 3 into pairing mode (power light changes to flashing blue). My MBP sees the "JBL Flip 3" and displays a kbdPair/kbd button. I click on this and "connecting..." displays.  However, a spinning wheel appears to the right and spins forever and the Flip 3 power light continues to flash.   Nothing else is listed in the MBP Bluetooth list. Nothing else is paired to the Flip 3. I've tried all kinds of combinations with no success.  What else can I try?  <answer290297> First of all I would check with JBL Support for any known issues, updates, compatibility, etc.  On the MBP side of things you could try resetting both the macOS Bluetooth Device List and Bluetooth Controller and pairing your JBL Flip 3 first. However, this will reset strongall/strong connected Bluetooth devices, including a keyboard and mouse.  strongIn other words, this will remove all existing pairing information for Bluetooth devices, so each will need to be reconnected./strong  I have some steps you can follow, but I strongly suggest you read all of the steps first before commencing (or perhaps print out the instructions / view them on another device).  Before starting, ensure you have the Bluetooth icon showing in the menu bar. If it is not there, open System Preferences  Bluetooth and enable the option emShow Bluetooth in Menu Bar/em.  Once done, follow these steps:    ol liHold down both the kbdShift/kbd and kbdOption/kbd keys and at the same time click on the Bluetooth icon in the menu bar.

There might be a problem with your Flip 3.  Have you connected any other BT device to your MBP?
