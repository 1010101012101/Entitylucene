Since I was using the readImage method from ImageMagick class, it required ghostscript to be installed alongside ImageMagick.  However, when you codebrew install imagemagick/code, ghostscript is an optional dependency that is not installed by default.  To resolve my issue, here is what I did (all the steps):  ol licodebrew install php54-imagick/code/li licodebrew install imagemagick --with-ghostscript/code/li /ol  Now I can readImage('test.pdf')!  <answer293845> I had the same issue but when upgrading from PHP 7.0 to PHP 7.1. The error has gone away after reinstalling the strongimagick/strong extension from source:  precodebrew reinstall -s php71-imagick /code/pre  I guess it may work for other PHP versions. Just replace the codephp71/code from the command above by your version. For example: codephp56/code or codephp70/code.  <comment349009> PHP 5.4 isn't really supported anymore (http://php.net/supported-versions.php). Have you tried with a newer version? <comment349090> @wogsland I have tried it with PHP 5.6 already.
