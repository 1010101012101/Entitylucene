How to hang up on incoming call when I am already on a call? <body> How do i hang up on incoming call? there seems to be no option but to hang up on current call also.  If i let it ring it keeps buzzing which is very annoying  <answer143862> You can press the volume down button on the side of the phone to mute the ringing of the incoming call without having to interrupt your current call.
