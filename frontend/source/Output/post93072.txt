how to access system files such as network libraries? <body> I am trying to find some algorithms about the implementation of network stack for Mac OS X, can I access the actual codes from the operating system itself.  Any suggestions are very much appreciated.  Thanks  <answer93073> Apple has published quite a lot of source code  ul liOpen Source: Source code for a lot of frameworks and commands/li liOpen Source Development Resources/li /ul  PS: Any detailled discussion about the code (or even where to find which functionality) is off topic on AskDifferent and should be discussed on StackOverflow.  <comment109205> Thanks for your reply, I was not even sure that I am asking in the right place. Anyway, thanks again.. cheers!
