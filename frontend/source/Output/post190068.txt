How can I update and then restore? <body> I've just been sent a replacement iPhone. I don't have a computer at the moment so I've gone to restore it during the set up. It shows the latest iPhone backup as 08:42 which is the one that I want to restore to but it won't allow me to restore to it as it says iOS 8.3 Required.  How can I update it so that I can restore it? I could set it up as a new iPhone and then update it, but when I wipe it to get back to the restore screen I'll be in the same situation surely.  <answer190070> Just update on the iPhone. Then when you want to restore, connect to iTunes and "restore from backup" (your old phone), this brings back the latest backup data (w/o iOS) from your old phone.  <answer190134> I have realised that wiping the iPhone does not downgrade it, so it was as simple as setting it up as a new iPhone, updating it, wiping it, and then restoring.  This can all be done without a computer (as per my question), unlike the other answers.  <comment225539> I don't have a computer. <comment225576> Borrow a friends computer or to go to your nearest Apple Store would be your best options. <comment225670> That's correct. iOS do no longer require you to plug your device into a computer and iTunes for most tasks. The only time you need to plug it into a computer is to do some low-level restoring (DFU). <comment225740> You can (and should!) accept your own answer if it solved your problem.
