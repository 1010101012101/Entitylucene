Making/Controlling Calls On Phone via Watch <body> So when I want to listen to music, with headphones plugged into my phone, I can select music on the watch and tell the watch to play it through my phone. This is great, and it means I can use my phone without having to take it out of my pocket.  What I was wondering was whether there was similar functionality for the phone? Can I tell my phone to place a call from the watch, using the earbuds as a headset? Similarly can I take a call on my phone through the headset by using the watch to pick up?  All I have been able to do so far is make and take calls on the watch itself, using its on board microphone and speaker. This is not really something I want to do in public, though I'd still like to have the convenience...  Is this possible? Is it perhaps planned for a future update?
