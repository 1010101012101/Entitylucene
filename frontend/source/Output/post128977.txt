I am trying to make an Applescript that launches a different set of apps depending on user input. However, it won't compile. What is wrong with it? <body> I made a simple AppleScript that launches a different set of apps depending on user input. I am new to AppleScript and it is tweaked from a bunch I found on the internet, modified for my usage. It is included below.  What it should do: Buttons 2 and 3 simply launches various sets of apps, while button 1 checks if Spotify is running, and if it is, switches to it. If it isn't, open 3 apps (including Spotify).  However I get an "Expected end of line, etc. but found end of script." error when compiling. Here is the script. What is wrong with it?  precodeset question to display dialog "What do you want to launch?" buttons {"Spotify", "MiniPlayer", "Remote"} default button 1 set answer to button returned of question  if answer is equal to "Spotify" then     set myAppName to "Spotify"     set isRunning to false     tell application "System Events"         if exists process myAppName then             set isRunning to true         end if     end tell     if isRunning is true then         tell application myAppName to activate     else         tell application "Spotify" to activate         tell application "Spotifree" to activate         tell application "Spotify Notifications" to activate     end if end if if answer is equal to "MiniPlayer" then     tell application "MiniPlayer" to activate end if if answer is Equal to "Remote" then     set question to display dialog "What remote do you want to launch?" buttons {"IR Remote", "Android", "Both"} default button 2 set answer to button returned of question     if answer is equal to "IR Remote" then     tell application SpotifyIrRemote to activate         if answer is equal to "Android"         tell application RemotelessHelper to activate        if answer is equal to "Both"         tell application SpotifyIrRemote to activate         tell application RemotelessHelper to activate     end if end if /code/pre  <answer128980> You are missing a bunch of codeend if/codes and 2 codethen/code.   precodeset question to display dialog "What do you want to launch?" buttons {"Spotify", "MiniPlayer", "Remote"} default button 1 set answer to button returned of question  if answer is equal to "Spotify" then     set myAppName to "Spotify"     set isRunning to false     tell application "System Events"         if exists process myAppName then             set isRunning to true         end if     end tell     if isRunning is true then         tell application myAppName to activate     else         tell application "Spotify" to activate         tell application "Spotifree" to activate         tell application "Spotify Notifications" to activate     end if end if  if answer is equal to "MiniPlayer" then     tell application "MiniPlayer" to activate end if  if answer is equal to "Remote" then     set question to display dialog "What remote do you want to launch?" buttons {"IR Remote", "Android", "Both"} default button 2     set answer to button returned of question     if answer is equal to "IR Remote" then         tell application SpotifyIrRemote to activate     end if     if answer is equal to "Android" then         tell application RemotelessHelper to activate     end if     if answer is equal to "Both" then         tell application SpotifyIrRemote to activate         tell application RemotelessHelper to activate     end if end if /code/pre  <comment151000> Which "end if" belongs to the "if answer is equal to Spotify" condition? <comment151001> @patrix I seem to have forgotten the end if. I have edited it, it is the second "end if" above the code "if answer is equal to "MiniPlayer" then" <comment151003> That was kind of rhetorical to get you started with counting if...thens and end ifs, but you got the answer below already :-) <comment154794> @patrix Thanks for that - it was a good way to get me figuring things out on my own. Sometimes errors are hard to spot by myself.
