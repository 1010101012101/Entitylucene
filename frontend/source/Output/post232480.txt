OS X Mail thread filter <body> For years I have used the shortcut key Ctrl-Opt-Cmd-T to open my Evernote "ToDo" note. Recently OS X has hijacked this for some kind of "thread filter", and one has to click "Cancel Thread Filter" in the spotlight area of Mail.  I do not like this for the following reasons:  ol liI have no idea what the thread filter is or how to use it. I cannot find it documented either./li liI don't want a thread filter./li liI don't see how to get rid of this shortcut so as to re-enable my preferred shortcut implementation./li /ol  Can someone explain or point me to the documentation?
