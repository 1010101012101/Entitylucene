Xcode storyboard vibration with the new Trackpad <body> When I drag views around in the storyboard, the trackpad vibrates every time the view snaps to something else. As a result, it vibrates all the time. Is this a normal behavior or is my trackpad broken?  (How do I turn it off?)  <answer194516> You can switch off Force Click &amp; haptic feedback.
