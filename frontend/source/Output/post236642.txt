Can I create a bootable VM from a Mac sparsebundle using symbolic links? <body> I'm trying to find a method for booting the sparsebundle image of my Mac inside VM software (VMWare, VirtualBox, doesn't matter), either by booting the sparesbundle itself or converting it to a VMDK/ISO, but with symbolic links to the original file, rather than copying it.    I create hourly delta's of my Mac as an image (currently through SuperDuper!), and want a way to boot that image should my machine die on me.  Haven't found anything to do this, though I've tired a variety of options, they just all seem to miss a piece of the process.  Would love any advice, thanks!
