MBP frequent crashes from kernel panic caused by memory faults? <body> There are 4 very similar crash reports listed here: http://pastebin.com/y7NUNJt6 The starting lines suggest to me it might be a CRC check failure but what do I know ;-) This tends to happen with the lid closed and the machine not yet in sleep. Do I have bad/overheating memory? A similar report here was not solved.  pre *** Panic Report *** panic(cpu 0 caller 0xffffff801f209f4a): Kernel trap at 0xffffff7fa0dee3d2, type 14=page fault, registers: CR0: 0x000000008001003b, CR2: 0x0000000000000008, CR3: 0x0000000022e0b000, CR4: 0x00000000000226e0 Fault CR2: 0x0000000000000008, Error code: 0x0000000000000002, Fault CPU: 0x0, PL: 1 /pre  <comment339456> First trick for any kernel panics is to eliminate non-apple kexts - in this case com.intel.kext.intelhaxm; com.AmbrosiaSW.AudioSupport; &  com.protech.NoSleep 1.4.0 <comment339459> I removed NoSleep first now because I see it happening with lid closing/sleeping. We'll see if that solved the problem for my MPB. Thanks!
