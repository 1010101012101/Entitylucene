I no longer see a folder for contacts on iMac, only iCloud <body> I can see my contacts on my on my iCloud account but I can not see the folder for "all contacts on Mac".  I always like to keep my contacts both locally and iCloud.  Was this option removed.  How do I store contacts locally only. I am running Sierra 10.12.3
