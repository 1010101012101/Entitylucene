OSX app to paste and save HTML content? <body> In Gmail, I can go to a web page, highlight web content, compose a Gmail message, and paste the HTML content into the email message. It works in Mail.app as well.   But what app can I use to just paste the HTML content and then save it as an HTML file?   Microsoft Word will accept pasted HTML content, but I don't want to save as gross weird Microsoft Word HTML markup. Is there an OSX app where I can easily paste and save copied HTML content from web pages?   <answer120340> Why not just save the page using the browser?  ol liFile → Save As… (⌘S)  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3qjW2.png" height="200"/li liChoose Page Source or Web Archive  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/aTyRt.png" height="60"img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/C2TYA.png" height="60"/li /ol  <comment140391> because web pages are filled with garbage and ads? there's no reason I would want to save all that content. Also I want to aggregate content from many different web pages.
