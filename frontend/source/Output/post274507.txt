Custom labels for phone numbers in contacts disappear immediately after creation <body> I want to create a custom label in contacts to designate GoToMeeting dial in numbers and access codes.  I am able to create the custom label as "GoToMeeting" and save it, but when I get out of contacts go back in, the custom label is gone.  The label reverts back to the generic one "work phone". I am able to create custom labels for addresses, notes, etc, but not phone numbers. iPhone 6+  <comment345153> Are you able to do it on your Mac or using the iCloud website?  That could be a workaround until you get this resolved. <comment345219> Also, what provider are you using for contacts? I used to have problems with custom labels using Google ActiveSync.
