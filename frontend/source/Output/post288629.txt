Can't get keyboard to work and can't log in <body> I am having issues pairing my wireless keyboard with my Mac after I changed the batteries. This screen keeps popping up when I restart that says Mac wants to make changes, enter admin and people. However, I can't type anything. It's as though it's locked up. Sometimes it even says keyboard found but still I can't type anything.  How can I get the Mac to use the keyboard?  <answer288770> Connect any wired keyboard to Mac and login. After that pair your Apple bluetooth keyboard.  <comment364532> Welcome to Ask Different.
