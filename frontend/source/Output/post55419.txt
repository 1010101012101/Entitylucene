Is it possible that some hacker is logged in to my computer? <body> When I type w at the terminal I see myself logged in two times.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4hOll.png" alt="enter image description here"  What are console and s000? Is it possible that one of these neos is actually somebody else?  <answer55421> Nope. Both of those are you.  codeconsole/code is where you've logged in (likely on startup), and the GUI started up.  codes000/code is the first shell you opened, the Terminal window itself. If you look at the codeWHAT/code column, it shows the last command run in that shell (codew/code), which you just did.  So it's the same user (you), logged into two sessions, one for the OS X GUI, and once in that shell in the Terminal window.  <comment63616> If you open more terminal windows, they will show up as s001, s002, s003, etc. <comment63618> $ Wake up, Neo. ;)
