How do I use AppleScript to reveal a file in Finder from its POSIX path? <body> I'm trying to create an AppleScript snippet that locates the current random wallpaper and reveals it in Finder. I have the following snippet which finds the current wallpaper's POSIX path as a string:  precodeset plistFolderPath to path to preferences folder from user domain as string set plistPath to plistFolderPath &amp; "com.apple.desktop.plist" tell application "System Events"     tell property list file plistPath         tell contents             set thePath to value of property list item "NewChangePath" of property list item "default" of property list item "Background" &amp; "/" &amp; value of property list item "LastName" of property list item "default" of property list item "Background"         end tell     end tell end tell /code/pre  codethePath/code is now a string in the form:     /Volumes/Archive/Widescreen wallpaper/12345_Name_2560x1440.jpg   (Note spaces)  I try to reveal this path in FInder, but everything I've tried results in an error:  precodetell application "Finder"     reveal POSIX file of quoted form of thePath (* Error: "Can't get POSIX file of (blah)" *) end tell /code/pre  How do I reveal a pathname in Finder in AppleScript when all I have is its POSIX path?  <answer26536> I think your problem is that codequoted form/code. Try something like this:  precodeset thePath to POSIX file "/Volumes/Lion HD/Users/ngreenst/Desktop/image.jpg" tell application "Finder" to reveal thePath /code/pre  So, just codereveal thePath/code  <answer26579> precodeset p to "/Applications/Utilities/AppleScript Editor.app"  # uses an existing window or makes a new window with your default settings tell application "Finder"     reopen # makes a new window if there are no open windows     activate     set target of window 1 to (POSIX file p as text) end tell  # makes a new window that doesn't use your default bounds or view settings tell application "Finder"     reveal POSIX file p as text     activate # focuses the window end tell /code/pre  <comment30268> This works if I paste a path directly into the script as you did, but if I use `reveal POSIX file thePath` it returns a "Can't get POSIX file path" error. <comment30269> @BrantBobby That means that there's some problem with the path as you're receiving it. Try casting it as a string (`set thePath to ... as string`). If that doesn't work, I'll need to see exactly what the output is to help (I can't test; your script isn't working OMM) <comment30271> Ah, adding `as string` did the trick! I guess my assumption that `thePath` was already a string was wrong.
