Email photos in full resolution from iPhone 6 running iOS 8 <body> iPhone 6 running iOS 8.1.3. How do I email photos with full resolution. I go to Photos, select some photos, pick Mail, then compose the email. No where in "New Message" does it give me an option to pick the resolution. Once I press send the email is sent with the photos at 1280x960.  strongFollow-up/strong - For some reason the photo was less than 500KB thus the email app didn't offer an option to resize it.  <answer175792> Once you hit 'Send' you should then get an option sheet to decide what sizeâ€¦  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0XqZa.png" alt="enter image description here"  Try rebooting the phone.    If no joy, then trybr Sync; backup; restore.  <answer193096> IOS 8.x does not prompt for resolution options when using the front facing camera, only the rear facing camera.  The front facing camera will usually max out resolution with a file size in KB.
