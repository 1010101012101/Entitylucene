Menu bar icons get hidden by long menu bar items <body> Sometimes on my Macbook Pro when I have a lot of icons in the menu bar, if I start an application which has a lot of menu items, some of these icons get automatically obscured by the menu items.  For example, when running iTunes, the Twitter icon gets obscured...  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WmXM6.png" alt="enter image description here"  ...but if I switch to Finder (which has a fewer menu items) the icon then re-appears  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/b4qUH.png" alt="enter image description here"  Is there any way I can show or get to these obscured icons without having to switch to an application with a shorter menu bar?  <answer46684> An app called AccessMenuBarApps allows you to do that by basically providing a keyboard shortcut to an application with no application menu items. It's free, so it wouldn't hurt to give it a try.  <answer121718> I have been using this for a while and it seems to be configurable to do what you need.  http://www.macbartender.com  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DEdZK.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer131464> NoMenuBar is a free app whose only purpose is to have no menus other than it's name so that you can switch to it and see more menu bar icons.    This isn't a direct solution to the question (not have to switch to another app), but it did help me see more icons that even Finder's menus were obscuring.  <answer252155> BetterTouchTool has an action that hides all menu items.  You can assign arbitrary keyboard shortcuts or mouse / touchpad gestures.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6gVDC.png" alt="enter image description here"  subBetterTouchTool is commercial software (pay what you want â€“ $3.99 minimum). During the 45 day trial phase you can use all features of BTT./sub  <comment53381> +1 Good find, thanks! That works pretty well actually, with the minor exception that there doesn't seem to be an option to hide its dock icon! Frankly I'm a little amazed that along with the other slick features and tricks in OS X that theres no option to, say, temporarily slide or swipe the menu bar out the way. Perhaps its just not a problem for most people... <comment53382> Use Dockless (http://homepage.mac.com/fahrenba/programs/dockless/dockless.html) to hide the icon for it. <comment53383> possible duplicate of [Menus overlap/hide Menu Extras. How to access?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/5179/menus-overlap-hide-menu-extras-how-to-access) <comment53388> Unfortunately, that also seems to disable the menu bar completely for the application whose icon is to be hidden. Probably just a GUI wrapper round the [LSUIElement](http://www.macworld.com/article/1153731/hidedockicon.html) trick (EDIT: The dockless readme.rtf confirms this) <comment53389> So it pretty much disables the app then? That's probably an apple ui limitation then. <comment53397> Apologies. How did I not see that when writing the question :-( <comment154438> Note that MacBartender is a paid app.  $15 today. <comment172678> Ridiculous having to pay $15 for something that should've been so basic.
