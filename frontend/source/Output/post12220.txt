White screen on imac <body>    strongPossible Duplicate:/strongbr   Can&#39;t boot Mac, only shows a Folder with a Question Mark?       Can any one tell me what a white screen on an imac means? There is also a folder with a question mark flashing in the center of the screen. Does anyone know how to resolve this problem? Thanks!  <answer12222> It means the volume you're trying to boot from is not bootable - perhaps the /System directory has been deleted, or an OS hasn't been installed at all, or the disk could even be failing.  <answer12224> It means that the computer can't find a usable disk with a usable operating system on it.  Put in the Mac OS X Install DVD that came with your computer. Hold down the c key on the keyboard and keep holding it as you turn on the computer.  Try to reinstall the operating system. If the installer can't find a disk to use it means that there is a problem with the hard drive.  If you can successfully reinstall, that should fix the problem. There's no way to know for sure how much of your data will survive.  Good luck!  <answer12226> According to Apple you should try a few options:  h2Check the mouse and keyboard/h2  ul liThis issue might occur if a mouse or trackpad button is pressed during startup.
