In Keynote '13, A dialog box keeps giving me a warning when I save / autosave <body> The following warning appears:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/EBvGV.png" alt="The document &quot;tagsfiltersprogramandyou.key&quot; could not be autosaved. The file has been changed by another application."  This happens both when I save and the autosave (which happens often). It is a modal box and interrupts workflow.   No other applications are running, and the issue survives program and operating system restarts. What could be causing this?  (This issue is new with Mavericks / Keynote '13).  <answer118469> My thinking is that this is a permissions problem or a server problem.  Do you have any servers mounted?  If you save a file to your Documents folder does the problem occur?  Have you tried deleting and reinstalling Keynote?  Are you "sharing" the document so that Keynote has put it in your iCloud account?  Have you tried running codeDisk Utility/code and got it to verify permissions on your drive?  If you are having a permissions problem then I'd have a close look at ~/Library/Saved Application State/com.apple.iWork.Keynote.savedState and it's contents as well as any server you have mounted.  <answer118586> The file might be being modified by another process. You can see as the file is accessed by various processes by running:  precodesudo opensnoop -f /path/to/file /code/pre  Use the file normally, then attempt to save. If you get the error, check back in Terminal to see if any other processes have accessed the file.  <answer118593> Use the codefs_usage/code (man page) command to monitor, in real time, accesses to your Keynote presentation.  ol liOpen Terminal (or iTerm, et al)./li liCopy/paste the following into your Terminal window, strongreplacing the word FILE with the filename of your Keynote presentation/strong (keep quotes if your filename contains spaces or other non-ASCII characters):  codesudo fs_usage  | egrep "FILE" # e.g. "My Preso.key"/code/li liOpen your Keynote presentation.  In your Terminal screen, you'll see a bunch of output related to opening the file this like so:/li /ol  pre     11:29:55  getattrlist       /path/to/My Preso.key           0.000003   Keynote.app        11:29:55  getattrlist       /path/to/My Preso.key           0.000005   Keynote.app        11:29:55  getattrlist       /path/to/My Preso.key           0.000005   Keynote.app        11:29:55  lstat64           /path/to/My Preso.key           0.000002   Keynote.app        11:29:55  getattrlist       /path/to/My Preso.key           0.000012   Keynote.app        11:29:55  getattrlist       /path/to/My Preso.key           0.000012   Keynote.app        11:29:55  lstat64           /path/to/My Preso.key           0.000006   Keynote.app        11:29:55  access            /path/to/My Preso.key           0.000013   Keynote.app        11:29:55  open              /path/to/My Preso.key           0.000016   Keynote.app        11:29:55  open              /path/to/My Preso.key           0.000007   Keynote.app /pre     Then, do what you normally do in your spreadsheet.  You may want to align your windows so you can see your Terminal window while you work.  Whenever there's new output in your Terminal window, strongcheck the last column/strong.  It should normally say Keynote.app but if there's an access by any other process, you'll see it there and then you'll have your culprit.  <comment126303> Is it possible there is a background script modifying it? If not, I would check the extended attributes and ACL using Terminal. <comment138354> Actually, it looks like you may be right.  See https://discussions.apple.com/message/16145573#16145573 and http://blog.chron.com/techblog/2011/09/want-to-really-repair-permissions-on-your-mac-try-this/ <comment138356> Any chance your system clock is wrong? <comment138357> Oh, I forgot. Have you looked in Console.app for any warning/error messages related to the issue? If you're not the admin user, you may need to do this in Terminal.app: `sudo egrep -i '(keynote|\.key)' /var/log/system.log` <comment138941> If there's a Cloud Sync Client like owncloud, this might changed file attributes which Keynote interprets as a change... With fs_usage that should be easy to see. <comment139069> I've checked for other processes that have it open; there never are any. <comment139175> This one seems to be the most relevant, and provide the most insights. As far as I can tell, it is a combination of Finder + Dropbox that is causing the problem. If I have a Finder window open, I get this error constantly, if I don't, I don't. I'm guessing it is Dropbox updating the synchronized icon decoration. <comment259277> Good idea. You could add `|grep -v Keynote.app` to show only the non-Keynote accesses.
