How to change the image of external background when connected to projector? <body> emOS X El capitan  version 10.11.6 Macbook pro 13-inch/em  Whenever I connect to projector, the projected screen has a old picture of me and it is quite embarrassing when I am presenting in front of professional crowd. I already removed that picture from the Desktop pictures folder but every time I connect projector, it still shows the same.br This is not happening when I connect to external display (monitor) though.How can i change this?   <answer253004> I suggest you plug into a projector and then use the strongDesktop &amp; Screen Saver/strong Control Panel to change the background of the desktop being projected to something else. The new background should then stay the same anytime you plug a monitor/projector in.  <answer253006> As far as I'm aware, the desktop picture is stored separately for each desktop you use &amp; can only be edited from System Prefs  Desktop &amp; Screensaver whilst that desktop is in use.  The file that stores them all is at code~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.desktop.plist/codebr If you edit that you could at least find where that picture is on your machine &amp; either edit to another picture, or move the original so it can't be found.  It's not something I've ever tried editing &amp; my own .plist isn't much help as I have the same picture across 2 monitors &amp; 6 spaces... so there's a lot of repetition - so you might want to make a backup of it before messing.  <comment315302> I checked the preferences folder but could not find `com.apple.desktop.plist` file. I might just try to borrow a projector so I can edit this. thanks for the help :) <comment315315> Sure you checked the right folder? There definitely should be one there. ~/Lib... not /Lib... copy/paste my path into 'Go to Folder..' in Finder. Oops, sorry, just noticed a typo in my original path, missed a / Fixed. <comment315329> Hey, yeah I checked the path you gave. found tons of preference files with `com.apple.something` but there was no `com.apple.desktop.plist` <comment315330> That's very odd... I know Spotlight won't find it but [EasyFind](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/easyfind/id411673888?mt=12) (freeware) will, if set to search for invisibles. Might be worth a shot...
