BootCamp can't partition <body> I had a problem with my Macbook that couldn't read the internal SSD and boot OS X, but I solve it: MacBook does not mount, does not boot, does not read drive .  I used resizeStack method to get the full size of the disk on OS X. The problem I have now is when I press ALT key on startup it shows two bootable disks. emMacintosh HD/em and emWindows/em. emWindows/em was a partitioned disk I had for windows and is empty (maybe).   After using resizeStack it shouldn't be there. When I open Boot Camp Assistant to reinstall Windows, I get the message that there is an "error partitioning the disk".  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/AKFew.png" alt="Results of: sudo gpt -r show /dev/disk0 and sudo fdisk /dev/disk0 "  <answer221162> I recommend the following:  ol liBoot to Recovery HD by pressing kbdcmd/kbdkbdR/kbd while starting your Mac, open Disk Utility and first check the superior disk, then inferior volume for errors and repair them if necessary./li liBoot to single user mode by pressing kbdcmd/kbdkbdS/kbd while starting your Mac and enter codefsck -fy/code. If you get a message stating ""FILE SYSTEM WAS MODIFIED", reenter codefsck -fy/code until you get the message "The volume â€¦ appears to be OK". Then enter codereboot/code./li liIf you still can't reinstall Windows with Boot Camp Assistant consider rebuilding the GUID partition table./li /ol  <comment267754> Before having the problems i mention on the old question, i used VMWare for virtual machine. I don't know if it made something automatically. <comment267756> @klanomath message from boot camp: `**Your disk could not be partitioned** An error occurred while partitioning the disk` <comment267757> @klanomath I did a restart and now Windows doesn't show on startup! Only Macintosh HD .. But what about BootCamp now? <comment267772> Will Disk Utility recognize the partition? If so, try removing the partition then adding it again. <comment267773> No, i forget to mention that. <comment267787> @AlexAndreadis You are welcome ;-) Have fun installing Windows and don't create the same mess as last time :-P <comment267788> this happened because I tried to have three OS on MacBook. 1. OS X 2. Windows and 3. Ubuntu. <comment267791> @AlexAndreadis Are both bootable or only one of them? <comment267792> now it's ok.. i don't know what happens. Also Child Count on Disk Utility is  4.
