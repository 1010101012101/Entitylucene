Creating a keyboard shortcut to pause Youtube video in a Google Chrome tab <body> Here is what I want to do: hook up a keyboard shortcut with an action to play/pause the video that is currently open in a Google Chrome tab. Would it be possible on Mac OS X?   I was thinking about keeping Youtube always in a particular tab (e.g. the first one) and creating Automator script with a keyboard shortcut. I know it would be possible by simulating user actions (switch to particular tab, simulate click, go back to last tab) but I'm looking for more smooth way.  <answer84357> You could assign a shortcut to a script like this:  precodetell application "Google Chrome"     repeat with t in tabs of windows         tell t             if URL starts with "http://www.youtube.com" then                 execute javascript "player = document.querySelectorAll('#watch7-player embed')[0] if (player) {     player.getPlayerState() == 1 ? player.pauseVideo() : player.playVideo() } else { // if youtube.com/html5 is enabled     document.querySelectorAll('.html5-player-chrome &gt; button:first-child')[0].click() }"                 exit repeat             end if         end tell     end repeat end tell /code/pre  For Safari, replace codeexecute javascript/code with codedo JavaScript/code.
