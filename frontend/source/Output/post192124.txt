Missing Mail.app in Finder, but exists in /Applications folder <body> I've not ever wanted to use the Mail app on my Mavericks machine, but recently I decided I'd give it a shot. However when I went to Applications in Finder, I couldn't see it. Nor was it in ~/Applications (which is completely empty anyway).  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/sMO8g.png" alt="Missing Mail Image"  When I did a search from Terminal (codefind . -iname Mail.app/code), I discover that it is in the /Applications folder after all. I checked the permissions, but have never seen the "@" before:  precodedrwxr-xr-x@  3 XXXX   admin    102 21 Feb  2014 MacX Free AVI Video Converter.app/ drwxr-xr-x@  3 root   wheel    102 16 Jul  2014 Mail.app/ drwxr-xr-x   3 root   wheel    102 16 Jul  2014 Maps.app/ /code/pre  The only way I could seem to open it was via Terminal (codeopen /Applications/Mail.app/code).  Does anyone have any idea on why it might not be visible in Finder?   Note: The app itself is running fine after opening from Terminal... &amp; I've since marked it as "Keep in Dock".  Many thanks, Craig.  <answer192184> Thanks to the hint from @Zero, there is a way to Hide and Show individual files, including applications from Finder by using Terminal.   To Show individual files:  precodesudo chflags nohidden Mail.app/ /code/pre  To Hide individual files:  precodesudo chflags hidden Mail.app/ /code/pre  Depending upon the file, you may not need to use codesudo/code, but it won't hurt in any case (other than needing to type in a password).  Disclaimer: I found the key to my answer mentioned in a comment here: https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/65175/84492  <comment228398> If you change the Finder or dock view to list or grid does mail show up - perhaps the icon view has got scrambled up <comment228400> @Mark. No, still not visible. I tried changing sort as well. <comment228433> What Icon is it showing in the Get Info window ? <comment228481> If you show all hidden files is it still not in the Applications folder? <comment228508> @Zero. Nice idea. After hunting around on how to do that I found `defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles YES`, Mail.app does appear. Obviously, I can't leave it this way...
