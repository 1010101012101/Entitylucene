If I lose my Mac, will I lose my Safari history? <body> Last year my MacBook Pro running OS X El Capitan got stolen. I replaced it with a new one but I lost all my safari history (years of browsing). I didn't have a Time Machine Backup at the time, but I thought Internet-related-data was safe because of iCloud. I don't know if I lost it due to an error ow what, so I want to know if it is indeed backed up in iCloud. Thanks!
