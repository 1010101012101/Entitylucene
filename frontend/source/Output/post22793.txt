How do you search a non-indexed folder in Finder? <body> Is there any way to search a folder in Finder that hasn't been indexed? I have an external HDD that I don't need indexed, but when I am search for a file, it brings up no results because it isn't indexed.  <answer22801> You can't do it in Finder as it depends on Spotlight for it's search database, you can do it with one of the Finder replacements like Pathfinder.  <answer22841> h2Find Any File/h2  is a good, inexpensive search utility that does not use Spotlight and will enable you to perform these kinds of searches.
