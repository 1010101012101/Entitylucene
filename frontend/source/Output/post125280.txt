To control default opening software for PDF centrally? <body> I want PDF documents open with Preview, not Adobe Reader. I select Open With  Other  Click the Box Always Open With. However, this does affect all pdf-files in my system.  strongHow can you set the default program for PDF?/strong  <answer125284> In the Get Info window for any PDF, there should be a section called strongOpen With/strong. You can choose an application from the pop-up menu (Mine says Preview, since I've already changed it, but yours will say Adobe Reader).  Once you change that to Preview, you can click on the strongChange All/strong button to make it so all PDF documents open with Preview. Mine is grayed out for the same reason; all PDFs on my account open in Preview by default.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Gc51Z.png" alt="Get Info window"  <comment146589> What do you mean with different? You said you want pdf to open with preview and you described the solution yourself already... <comment146591> @Rob It is not a permanent solution. Although you press it, it will not stay. Adobe reader will continue be the default. <comment146592> I simplified the question so you do not get confused by controlling all programs in your systems, but just one. <comment146616> Thank you for your fast and clear answer!
