XQuartz is not starting from within tmux <body> I'm using the standard apple terminal with codezsh/code as my default shell.  In my code~/.zprofile/code (equivalent of code.profile/code) I have the following line:  precode[[ $TERM != "screen" ]] &amp;&amp; exec tmux /code/pre  This basically makes shure that if I open a new window in codezsh/code a new codetmux/code session is started, but codetmux/code doesn't get started from within codezsh/code sessions running inside codetmux/code subwindows.  This works fine but for one thing: I cannot start XQuartz. Everytime I launch an from the command line that requires X11 (like a codegnuplot/code or codeoctave/code plot) the terminal just hangs and nothing happens.  However, I noticed that when I just disable the auto-launching of codetmux/code by removing the line above so that I can open a new terminal window and launch XQuartz from there, I can also use the launched XQuartz from within codetmux/code windows.  This however gets pretty tiresome.  How could I fix this?  <answer143566> Try moving [[ $TERM != "screen" ]] &amp;&amp; exec tmux to your .zshrc file. That way the command will only be run in interactive shells.  An interactive shell is simply any shell process that you use to type commands, and get back output from those commands. That is, a shell with which you interact.
