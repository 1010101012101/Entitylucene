How can I see how long my computer has been active (as in not idle) <body> I've seen a variety of solutions to check how long my machine has been idle, and I know I can check how long since last reboot with codeuptime/code, but I'm curious if there's a way to see how long since my computer was last idle. Maybe since the last time the power save settings kicked in, or last time since the screensaver turned on / monitor turned off, etc?   I'm fine using an applescript or shell command to determine this, if those are the best solutions.  <answer56744> You can use an applescript.    on idle     display dialog "Hey, your computer wasn't busy so I thought I would higjack it" end idle  Save it as an application and keep it running in the background. Maybe just write a timestamp to a file to read later?  <answer56746> You can also find the idle time in UNIX by running  precodeioreg -c IOHIDSystem /code/pre  And looking for the returned HIDIdleTime  Or you could run a shell script on idle like so, just call it every 30 seconds or so using LaunchD. Make sure to put the launchd xml file in /Library/LaunchDaemons so it runs even when no user is logged in, or /Library/LaunchAgents/ if you only want it to run when someone is logged into the machine.  precode#!/bin/bash idl=$"`ioreg -c IOHIDSystem | awk '/HIDIdleTime/ {print int($NF/1000000000); exit}'`" idletime="600" if [ $idl -gt $idletime ]; then #Your #Code #Here fi /code/pre  <answer56748> Here is an example LaunchD XML file.  http://u.wanttogo.to/I9p4  Either place it in code/Library/LaunchDaemons//code if you want it to run even when nobody is logged in or in code/Library/LaunchAgents//code if you only want it to run when someone is logged into the machine.  Place your script in code/Library/Scripts//code  You need to make sure your LaunchD plist file is owner root, group wheel and permissions 644.  precodechown root /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.my-company.my-name.plist chgrp wheel /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.my-company.my-name.plist chown 644 /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.my-company.my-name.plist /code/pre  <answer170763> You can use the following script to show the idle seconds ticking up, from Inactivity and Idle Time on OS X:  precode#!/usr/bin/env perl my $idle_seconds_command = 'echo $((`ioreg -c IOHIDSystem | sed -e \'/HIDIdleTime/ !{ d\' -e \'t\' -e \'}\' -e \'s/.* = //g\' -e \'q\'` / 1000000000))'; print "Counting seconds of inactivity... Command + Period (.) to quit\n\n"; do {     my $idle_seconds = `$idle_seconds_command`;     chomp($idle_seconds);     print "Idle for $idle_seconds seconds.\n";     sleep(1); } while(1); /code/pre  When run the script prints a line each second showing the current idle time counter.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/sgYny.png" alt="Idle seconds on OS X"  <comment65161> What do you mean with idle? When it went to sleep? <comment65162> @Gerry Sleep, monitor dim, screen saver, anything really. Preferably, I'd like to see "time since user last did not enter input (key or mouse) for 1 minute". <comment65170> You should edit your original answer instead of replying multiple times.
