Is there an application that organizes all the open windows in a desktop and organize them such that they can be viewed simultaneously? <body>    strongPossible Duplicate:/strongbr   What Window Management Options exist for OS X?       I'm on a retina MacBook Pro and usually I want to see several windows together. For now I use BetterTouchTool with gestures to move window to the right and left, but that means I need to focus on both of the windows and on each of them use gesture (left and right).   I would like to customize which windows to show side-by-side.  Is there an application that organizes all the open windows in a desktop and organize them such that they can be viewed simultaneously?  P.S - I only use the rMBP monitor, so when I said desktop I meant Mountain Lion desktops(which can be added/removed and viewed through Mission Control).  <comment67645> Between [moom](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/16217/window-management-app-on-mac-os-x) and this answer you should have some answers. Feel free to edit this to clarify how this is different than the ground already covered and flag/vote for reopening if needed. <comment67654> please don't close this question, because I haven't found a way to simply use a keyboard shortcut/gesture that will allow me to organize all the open windows without actually cycle through the open windows. <comment67655> How is this different than Mission Control that uses gestures to organize all open windows? (and closing is a temporary state to get things cleaned up. Feel free to link to it in the chat room like I'm about to do to get help from the community) <comment67659> It shoud be something samiliar to Mission Control however, Mission Control only shows the windows but you can't actually work with them, just view. I'm looking for an application that resize all the open applications so they can be worked with.
