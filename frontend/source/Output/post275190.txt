2016 MacBook Pro shutdowns when the lid is close with cause 0 <body> My 15-inch 2016 MacBook Pro is now experiencing shutdowns when the lid is closed. Though it is not a crash because I don't get a crash report when I turn the computer back on (unlike the problem I had earlier). I used the following Terminal command to obtain the Previous Shutdown Cause (as the console app can't do it anymore in Sierra):  precodelog show --style syslog --last 48h | egrep shutdown\ cause | awk -F')' '{print substr($0,1,19), $NF}' /code/pre  The code for the shutdown is 0. From this question I found that 0 triggers when you unplugged the battery, or the power cable on desktop Macs. But the battery on the 2016 MacBook Pro is non-removable (obviously). Even more strangely, when this happens, my laptop is plugged into the power adapter and for sure it is charging. This doesn't happen when I am using the computer both on battery and power adapter, only happens when the lid is closed for a while.  I have tried to reset SMC and NVRAM with no luck. Anyone else having this problem?  <comment346136> This and your other [question](http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/262528/119271) points to a logic board failure.  To get a 0 shutdown cause you have disconnect all power and on a laptop that's pretty hard to do.  I suspect there's something wrong with the SMC or related components and not enough power is getting to critical systems like memory so you are seeing the shutdowns/crashes. <comment346137> @Allan yeah, thought of that. Going to get it fixed. <comment346138> Let us know what happens.
