iMac does not boot in windows 7 <body> my iMac (iMac11,2) refuses to boot in win7. Nor from bootcamp partition, neither from win7 installation DVD. It boots without any problem into Mac OS (10.6.8), it as well boots from mac os installation disk.   When i choose windows partition from startup manager it just freezes right there. When i set windows partition as startup disk in startup disk utility i just get white screen and nothing more.  please help :(.
