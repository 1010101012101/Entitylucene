How to display/alter a jailbroken iOS device's route table? <body> I jailbroke my iPhone4 and want to display and alter the route table on my iPhone. There is a coderoute/code command, but I don't know the parameters needs to display/alter the route table.  I've googled a lot but still cannot find a clue. I know how to display/alter route table in Linux, but obviously the coderoute/code command in iOS is not like the same command in Linux. Hope someone can answer this question.  Note: the iOS is the iOS of Apple, not the IOS of Cisco :-)  This command comes from package _network_cmds_ in Cydia.  The default output without any argument:br yeglemato-iPhone:~ root# routebr usage: route [-dnqtv] command [[modifiers] args]  <answer12244> Use codenetstat -r/code to display route table and coderoute/code to alter it.  You can read codenetstat/code and coderoute/code man page on OSX for more information. I think they are the same BSD route version.  <comment12756> I cant remember, does the iphone even have man pages? Was this route command installed as a part of the jailbreak? What happens when you run it with no parameters? Even if it isnt the same command it probably behaves similarly. <comment12758> @hobs This command is installed when you install Cydia on your phone, in package _network_cmds_. There seems no manpages in Cydia. I've updated the info in my question :-) <comment12759> Yeah I think you just have the bsd version of route, I dont know how to use it much, but the man page is http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=route, thats the same route command if you type it into your mac. <comment12760> This looks like a more user friendly intro to route on bsd http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/freebsd-setup-default-routing-with-route-command/ <comment12811> Thank you for your answer. I didn't notice this is a BSD version of route/netstat :-)  Here's the manpage of MacOSX route/netstat command: http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/netstat.1.html http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man8/route.8.html
