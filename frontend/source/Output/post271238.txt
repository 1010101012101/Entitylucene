How to have a Bluetooth mouse automatically connect to MacBook <body> I have a Logitech MX Anywhere 2, and although sometimes it automatically connects to my MacBook, most of the time I have to manually open the Bluetooth menu and connect it. Is there anything I can do to have it connect automatically every time?   <comment341000> Have you tried clicking your mouse, or failing that, toggling the mouse's power switch back and forth? <comment341158> Yeah I have, clicking the mouse doesn't do anything, and sometimes, just sometimes, toggling it on and off does the trick.
