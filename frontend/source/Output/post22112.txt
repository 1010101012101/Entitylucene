How can I combine multiple photos into a single image on my iPhone? <body> I want to combine multiple photos like this  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vO2Hp.jpg" alt="enter image description here" I tried  many apps like diptic, picstich and many more.  But they all combine like this.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ygdBa.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Just a bit of clarification: I don't want to create panorama, don't want to stitch and mix images. I just want to add multiple images horizontally or vertically.  <answer32473> Have you looked at Frame Magic. There's a free version and a 99Â¢ version  <comment24426> I don't want to create panorama, don't want to stitch and mix images.
