Custom Screensaver? <body> In OS X El Capitan Version 10.11.6  I am trying to set my custom Screensaver, i.e. my own picture and not the predefined ones, just like as one would do for the Desktop background.  Is this possible?  <answer250336> Go to codeSystem Preferences &gt; Desktop &amp; Screen Saver &gt; Screen Saver tab/code and click the Snapshots item. Under the Source picker, you can choose any folder you desire using the codeChoose Folder.../code option:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QoPuV.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer261551> I also am on EL C 10.11.6 and was unable to set up my own screensaver. In fact none of the provided screensavers loaded either. Took me a while to figure out that you must select one of the options (eg Ken Burns) from the left hand frame for it to work.  <comment310795> This is a great tip. I've been trying to figure out how to use one static (dark) image as a screensaver. I did this, and I only put one image in the file. Works perfectly. <comment310804> There is no "Snapshots" in my case. However, turns out that if I click to the "Floating", for example, icon, I have the option you mention ("Choose Folder").
