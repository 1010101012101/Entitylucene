kernel_task CPU usage with SIP on a MacBookPro8,2 with no battery <body> Is there any strongevidence or technical documentation/strong to support the notion that System Integrity Protection can cause excessive use of the CPU by codekernel_task/code in some situation?  h2Background/h2  No battery. All Apple operating systems on an external hard disk drive, limited (by the MacBookPro8,2) to USB 2.0.   With Sierra, and with pre-release High Sierra, when not booted in safe mode I nearly always found that codekernel_task/code hogged the CPU.   My usual workaround was safe mode.
