Folders in Finder not showing <body> This may be a total noob question, but this is my first apple product, please bear with me.  I'm not seeing certain folders, like "movies", "music", and "pictures" in finder.  Is there a way to activate these folders?  I'm running osx mavericks on a late 2013 mbp.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qDCDr.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer122789> Pull down the strongFinder/strong menu and select strongPreferences.../strong  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/AhNuG.png" alt="enter image description here"  In the Preferences dialog, along the top row, click on the strongSidebar/strong tab. Check the boxes next to the items you want to see in the sidebar of every Finder window.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qq8Xw.png" alt="enter image description here"  Close the strongFinder Preferences/strong window and you are good to go.  <answer251856> Nothing to these critical stuffs.  Just Try This  for OS X EI CAPITAN 10.11.6  Move the " Cursor" on to the folder Like " Favorite". there will appear " Show" or "Hide" option. Click on " SHOW " option. All the functions will appear.  <comment143309> Welcome to Ask Different.
