Anyone knows how to view the nice value of a process under Mavericks? <body> Used to be able to view the UNIX nice value of a process in the top CLI utility. I think it's gone from the top utility on Mavericks? Any other ways to view it?  <answer123526> Use ps with a lower case L to directly view current nice values:  precodeps -l /code/pre  <answer276958> I am using htop command.img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ahfLi.png" alt="htop image"  It's very nice.
