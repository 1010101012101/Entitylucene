MBP 2011 - BootCamp - Samsung SSD Drive - Windows install fails <body> I have a MBP 2011 Version. I used to have Windows 7 installed on the 500gig native drive via Bootcamp and everything was fine. I recently bought a Samsung 830 256gig SSD (latest firmware).  ol liI used SuperDuper to Clone the 500gig drive to the Samsung 830 via USB dock./li liInstalled Samsung 830 inside the MPB./li liMac boots fine. /li liStarted Bootcamp, downloaded latest bootcamp, put windows 7 install cd in MBP, start install of windows 7, every runs fine up to this point./li /ol  Problem:  ol liDuring Windows 7 install, i reach the page where you select the drives / partions however its empty and Windows now ask for missing drivers. Its not saying "which" missing drive...  /li liI point it to where bootcamp drives are downloaded and click rescan. Nothing found.../li /ol  Any ideas what I am missing here?   Thanks so much in advance,  Dean
