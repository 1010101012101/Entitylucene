OS X Lion Server multiple postgresql installs <body> I am using Homebrew to install PostgreSQL on my Mac mini server (Lion). However, I am unable to run the version I have installed, the only version I see running is the version installed with OS X:  precode216    83     1   0 12:17PM ??         0:00.47 /usr/bin/postgres -D /var/pgsql -c listen_addresses= -c log_connections=on -c log_directory=/Library/Logs -c log_filename=PostgreSQL.log -c log_lock_waits=on -c log_statement=ddl -c log_line_prefix=%t  -c logging_collector=on -c unix_socket_directory=/var/pgsql_socket -c unix_socket_group=_postgres -c unix_socket_permissions=0770 216   266    83   0 12:17PM ??         0:00.27 postgres: logger process                            216   300    83   0 12:17PM ??         0:01.01 postgres: writer process                            216   301    83   0 12:17PM ??         0:00.75 postgres: wal writer process                            216   302    83   0 12:17PM ??         0:00.51 postgres: autovacuum launcher process                            216   303    83   0 12:17PM ??         0:00.91 postgres: stats collector process                            1025  2698   814   0  1:30PM ttys000    0:00.00 grep post /code/pre  How do I go about starting another postgres instance and having it run on startup?  <answer26469> postgres listens on a port - what is happening here is probably a conflict with the two postgreses claiming the same port.  To fix this you will have to stop the Apple supplied postgres from starting. From Server.app you have to stop the Device manager and Wiki from starting.  <answer91056> The Homebrew codepostgresql/code formula tells you exactly how to do this when you install it.  Run codebrew info postgresql/code to have that information shown again.  <comment30201> I would highly recommend you post this at http://superuser.com/. While this website focuses more on the use of Apple products, Superuser focuses more on answering questions regarding such advanced technical knowledge. <comment30208> As this is to do with Apple's install of postgres and how to control it I think this is on topic here (It would also be on topic on superuser we just have a large overlap) <comment75464> No, by default (and here, as evidenced by `-c listen_addresses=`), Apple's Postgres does not listen on a port.  It listens on a Unix socket only. <comment75465> How did you try to run it?  Were there any errors?  Does the log file say anything? <comment92674> What you like to do, replace Apples PostgreSQL, run a developing instance ? All services on server need PostgreSQL to work and launch it if it needs it - also all scripts are designed for the default paths. So, tell us what you had done and what you plan to do ... which for your second postgres binary (I hope you know, that the brew PostgreSQL is launched as admin using a .plist). <comment93797> Should this question have the [postgresql] tag?
