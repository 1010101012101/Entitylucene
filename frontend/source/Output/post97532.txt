Issues with using the Japanese Kotoeri input sources in iTerm 2 <body> When I type text in the middle of a line, the text is inserted over the characters right of it as if overtype mode was enabled. The text is displayed normally (or the characters on the right side are shifted right) when I insert the active phrase by pressing return though.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Hbndq.gif" alt=""  Also keyboard shortcuts for "Select next source in Input menu" (command-space by default) don't work when there is an active phrase. Keyboard shortcuts for "Select the previous input source" (option-command-space by default) do work though.  I haven't had either of these issues in Terminal. I have tried changing TERM and the LC_ variables, setting the non-ASCII font to a Japanese font, and toggling settings like "Treat ambiguous characters as double width", but are there some configuration options I'm missing?
