Safari (6) and HTTPS <body> Is there any method to make Safari (6) trying to connect to a website with HTTPS connection and switch to HTTP if HTTPS is not supported?  (See HTTPS Everywhere for Firefox).  <answer101983> Not at the moment. According to the HTTPS Everywhere FAQ:     Q. Will there be a version of HTTPS Everywhere for IE, Safari, Opera, or some other browser?      A. Some members of our developer community are working on an IE port of HTTPS Everywhere. As of early 2012, the Safari extension API does not offer a way to perform secure rewriting of http requests to https.

Most filter rules are focused on blocking ads, but there is also a set of files which can SSLify sites.  <answer222591> There is https://www.sslenforcer.com, which does the same thing for all Apps.  <comment120135> Even HTTPS everywhere doesn't automatically try HTTPS for every website. See the FAQ "Why use a whitelist of sites that support HTTPS? Why can't you try to use HTTPS for every last site, and only fall back to HTTP if it isn't available?" <comment269767> Answers on Ask Different need to be more than just a link. It's okay to include a link, but please summarize or excerpt it in the answer.
