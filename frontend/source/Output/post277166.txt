Is there any way I could download a iphone app to my mac book pro? <body> I want to be a able to download the amino app to my macbook but it has not been made to be able to do that but I would like to know if I could in some way  <answer277168> I think this has been answered before in this thread.  The general reason is that the code is compiled for an ARM CPU (iPhone, Samsung, Pixel, etc).  Your MacBook has an Intel CPU and the code instructions are different.  As a developer, there is a simulator in Xcode to develop a mobile application with, but the simulator is not really for use to obtain an application from the App store and run it.     <answer277170> You can download the app easily using iTunes. But you can't run it on your Mac, which I suspect is what you really want to do. As far as your Mac is concerned, it's just a binary data file, not an executable program.
