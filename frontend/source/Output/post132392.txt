ubuntu style change workspace in osx mavericks <body> is there any way to make osx (mavericks) change the between workspaces like ubuntu  12.0  i mean the 4 window workspaces and switching by going up/down/right/left  the current change workspace in osx is only left/right  <answer132396> This was actually a feature in Mac OS X Leopard (v10.5) and Snow Leopard (v10.6), but was changed in Lion. The general Mac term is “spaces”.  TotalSpaces2 brings back a grid setup, like in Ubuntu and the older versions of OS X.  <comment156995> its not free ... any alternate?
