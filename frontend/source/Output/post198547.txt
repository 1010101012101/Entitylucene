No Shuffle in iTunes 12.2? <body> Is there any shuffle option in iTunes 12.2 for Mac?br (I haven't found one) and why Apple has deliberately removed the main feature of any music player?br I mean no one listens to music in playlist/A-Z order.   PS: Why downvote. They did remove the shuffle button from most of the interface and made it a bit harder to access.  It used to be here:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/v0byc.png" alt="enter image description here"  There is doesn't seem to be an option to shuffle all.  I selected all songs and there is no option on right click:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YsWx0.png" alt="enter image description here"  The option in the panel menu seems to be there, but it doesn't affect the order in which iTunes plays my queue.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/juN4Y.png" alt="enter image description here"  Yeah they did leave Shuffle on playlists, but who uses playlists in iTunes anyways, right? I mean I usually just shuffle over all my library and my guess is majority does the same. Now I need to create a playlist only to shuffle over all the trucks and update it on every update of the library?  <answer198550> A note after the question update…br Shuffle isn't as random as you think. It's a one-off process that is only re-computed every time you switch shuffle off &amp; on again. Until you do that, the previously generated shuffle can be stepped back &amp; forth in exactly the same pseudo-random order.  Also - if you have manually enqueued songs, it will only shuffle songs emafter/em the manually added tracks…  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/eK7rO.png" alt="enter image description here"  Shuffle &amp; Repeat are always available in the Controls menu… &amp; always searchable...  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LlQaE.png" alt="enter image description here"  If iTunes is actually playing [or has been playing &amp; now paused], it's in the top centre panel, as always…br The only time it doesn't appear here is before you start to play the first song since launch, or after a manual Clear of the Up Next list.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/OTUsQ.png" alt="enter image description here"  In all views except My Music  Song &amp; Album, it's in the top of the main window…  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bWeAl.png" alt="enter image description here"  Anywhere else it's usually on the right-click menu…  <comment237623> But I have a queue and it doesn't get shuffled when I turn the Shuffle on. <comment237625> I've updated the question. <comment237695> I've updated my answer. <comment237733> @VsevolodGlumov the queue was just added to allow iTunes to put up an annoying modal dialog when you want to change the music you're listening to. <comment237747> @WayfaringStranger thanks, now I know I'm not the only one sceptical about certain Apple's decisions on this site.
