Open activity monitor minimized on startup <body> I sometimes like to have Activity Monitor running in the dock (to see CPU usage chart in the icon at a glance).    I didn't use it for some time though, but with a new mac I bought (El Capitan) I thought I'd activate it again.  Now I can have it start automatically but I always have to minimize the Activity Monitor window after login.  I emthink/em in the past6 I had set it with that option (to autostart at login  via right-click on the dock icon) so that it started minimized but I can't seem to remember how.    Am I remembering wrong or missing an option?  <answer256021> Does this not work?  First right-click on Activity Monitor and go strongOptions  Open at Login/strong.  Next, open strongSystem Preferences  Users &amp; Groups  Login Items/strong and tick strongHide/strong.  <comment319205> Yay. That sounds like what I was missing (I thought I knew there was an option somewhere, but was looking inside Activity Monitor).  I'll try tomorrow and am sure it will work (will give you correct answer then). <comment319276> Correct.  This must get a reward for the best hidden option of all times.
