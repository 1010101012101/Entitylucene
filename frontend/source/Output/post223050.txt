Why do I have 2 IPv6 addresses? <body> If I go to codeSystem Preferences &gt; Network &gt; Advanced/code it is shown that I have 2 different IPv6 addresses (both with a 64-bit prefix). Why is so?   If I type codeifconfig | grep inet/code on the terminal, it also shows me those 2 IPv6 addresses (among the other addresses). At the end of one of those 2 IPv6 addresses there's the word codedynamic/code and at the end of the other there's codeautoconf temporary/code. Why wonder why should we need two IPv6 addresses and what is the different between codedynamic/code and codeautoconf temporary/code.  <answer223056> IPv6 used to be derived of the MAC address of your device. This is the Modified EUI-64 format. Such addresses are recognisable by looking at the middle of the last 64 bits. If they contain code..ff:fe../code then it is probably a EUI-64 based address.  Because the algorithm produces the same 64 bits every time some people were afraid that it would become easy to track mobile devices such as laptops and smart phones. Every network would have a different prefix, but the last 64 bits would always be the same.  That is why Privacy Extensions were invented. A device generates new 64 bits every once in a while and uses that in the IPv6 address. Because new addresses are generated regularly the addresses are marked as codetemporary/code. A device can have multiple privacy extension addresses if the system is still using an old address when a new address is being generated. The system will keep the old address for as long as necessary. For new outgoing connections a system will usually use the most recently generated temporary address to maintain a maximum level of privacy.  <comment270349> One is probably for the loopback adapter (lo0) and the other is for your active network connection, whatever your using Wi-Fi, Ethernet, etc. <comment270350> @user3439894 Didn't know about this loopback adapter... <comment270359> And you can have an arbitrary number of static addresses you choose your own, too. <comment270402> Also, correct me if I'm wrong, but don't most devices have two IP addresses anyways (a "link local" version and a public Internet version)? I think I'd expect to see at least two IPs on any device connected to a network. <comment270407> @phyrfox Yes, in fact it's entirely normal to see 3 IPv6 addresses on the same interface: a EUI-64-based number (usually of global scope), a privacy address (same scope, temporary), *and* a link-local address (starting with fe80:). <comment270419> You can read more about [Loopback](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loopback) and [Localhost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Localhost). In [IPv4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4) the loopback is `127.0.0.1`. In [IPv6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6), `::1` (`0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0001`). <comment270423> @GordonDavisson True, I was only talking about global addresses. Including link local then at least three addresses per interface is indeed the most common.
