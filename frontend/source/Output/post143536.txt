eclipse running on mac 32bit <body> i am currently using mac 32 bit.I am unable to open eclipse an error pop up saying that i need to update my JVM from 1.6 to 1.7 and from the java website there are no ver 1.7 for mac 32bit. what am i suppose to do?   <answer143550> Mavericks is a 64-bit OS; it has no 32-bit option... You can run 32-bit apps in it &amp; run 64-bit apps in 32-bit mode, but the OS itself, afaik, is only available in 64-bit.  32-bit Macs cannot run Mavericks.  Edit - 32-bit mode picture...  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/IM2c9.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment169054> what equipment do you have, and what os x? <comment169056> macbook pro running maverick ver 10.9.4 32bit <comment169060> Did you try telling Eclipse to use the JVM 1.6 instead? If a JVM is installed in the eclipse/jre directory, Eclipse will use it. <comment169064> Mavericks *is* 64-bitâ€”what exactly is preventing the installation of JVM? <comment169074> Why do you think you have a 32 bit OS? <comment169091> Nice lecture. How does this answer the question ?
