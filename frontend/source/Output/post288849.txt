Deactivate iCloud reminders <body> I keep getting reminders to subscribe to the iCloud service, but read my words: strongI do not want iCloud/strong! Is it possible to deactivate these annoying reminders? (I'm on Mac OS El Capitan 10.11.6).  <answer288853> Go to Apple ID and unchecking these items (if they were be selected): img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dVJb3.png" alt="Apple ID"  In general, every message from Apple has an unsubscribe link, usually, at the end of a letter. Plesase, check it.  Finally, check out a message sender in your Mail app, perhaps, those messages are not from Apple, and they are just a spam.  <comment365010> Thank you for your answer Andrey. I haven't been clear enough: the messages I get are not mails, they are banner from top right corner, but they often interrupt the task I am in. <comment365014> Oh, sorry. I misunderstood you. In `System Preferences - Notifications` you can set alert style to `None` for System Events. <comment365171> Wow great thank you ! What a relief !
