Why are Yosemite notification center preferences resetting? <body> (At least) twice now since I updated to Yosemite I've noticed I'm suddenly getting notifications from an app I had turned off. Then I go to Notifications in System Preferences and notice that every checkbox is checked again for every app that has an entry in Notification Center.   This isn't happening after a restart. Looking in Console.app reveals some entries about notifications, but nothing jumps out as obviously related to turning everything back on.   emupdate:/em  It just happened again, this time after I updated to 10.10.1
