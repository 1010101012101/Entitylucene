Web mail uses iCloud Keychain, how to get iOS Mail to do the same? <body> Using mobile Safari, I can log into my email using KeyChain. How do I get iOS Mail to connect to the same account using iCloud Keychain?  <comment263499>  iCloud Keychain can also keep the accounts you use in Mail, Contacts, Calendar, and Messages up to date across all of your Mac computers. If you sign in to Facebook, Twitter, Linked In, or any other accounts in Internet Accounts on OS X Mavericks, iCloud can push those accounts to your Mac computers as well.  https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204085 <comment263515> What surprised me is that using Mac keychain, I couldn't  find the keychain entry that my iPhone is using to log Safari into Office365 (webmail). I figured as a work around, I could copy paste the password from Safari's Outlook365 entry into IOS Mail.app. <comment263516> So I don't even know how to look at the keychain iOS Safari uses. <comment263526> You can view iOS Keychain entries thusly:  http://www.imore.com/how-access-icloud-keychain-passwords-credit-cards  NOTE: The point of Keychain on iOS is synchronization.  It is not meant to be manipulated. <comment263528> Agreed. It's a workaround until someone figures out how to link the entries together, living up to the promise at  (your link) https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204085 <comment263529> @Kh√ºrtWilliams thanks for the link, btw. That's very helpful.
