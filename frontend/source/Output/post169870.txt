Xcode GUI adjusting location of Navigator-Menu <body> How can one adjust the view settings, so that the Navigator-Menu (see image) appears on the right or on the bottom, emetc./em?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YCZ6E.png" alt="Xcode"  strongUPDATE:/strong Thanks, emjherran/em, for telling me the name of this menu.  <answer169872> It's called the Navigation Area and you can't change it's position, but you can hide the menu with kbd⌘/kbd+kbd0/kbd.  To unhide it, just type kbd⌘/kbd plus a number from kbd1/kbd to kbd8/kbd depending the tab you want to show.  <comment199575> Hello, thanks. I know, one can hide this. I merely want to know, how to position it, when I have it unhidden. Would you happen to know, what this menu is called? Cheers. <comment199577> Update my answer, it's called the Navigation Area. <comment199580> Thanks! (Sorry, I apparently need to acquire more reputation-points, in order to give you a +1.)
