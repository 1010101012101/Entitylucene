Indexing NAS with "mdutil -i on" with Sierra not working anymore <body> I used to index my NAS with the command line codemdutil -i on/code. Ok, I know it's not perfect, but it worked for me.  But since I updated to macOS Sierra it's not working anymore. If I type codemdutil /Volumes/name -i on/code I just get the feedback codeIndexing disabled./code It doesn't matter if I use SMB or AFP (SMB was always working for me).  Maybe this information is helpful for a solution, if I codemdutil /Volumes/name -E/code I get the feedback: codemdutil disabling Spotlight: /Volumes/archiv -&gt; kMDConfigSearchLevelFSSearchOnly. Indexing disabled./code  Does anyone has any solution?  <comment324463> Presumably `mdutil -s -a -v` shows indexing and searched disabled for the NAS volume? Also does `man mdutil` show any restrictions on enabling using `-i` that might be new to Sierra? (I'm on El Capitan and it doesn't list anything, but it could have changed.) <comment324566> mdutil -s -a -v just shows "indexing disabled" for the  (the share). Before i was on Yosemite and it worked fine. <comment345560> I came here looking for a solution and found your question. It seems to be a problem with Sierra+ itself, since Yosemite was working perfectly fine for me as well. :\ <comment347349> Also looking for a solution to this.. If your NAS is one you've built yourself (a linux box) then you can apparently compile Samba with spotlight support using `tracker` but I haven't tried it. <comment358206> Same here since Sierra.
