What's a good Picasa upload app for iPhone? <body> Android has "Instant Upload" with the Google+ app. I'd like something similar for iPhone: strongan app that takes all my photos and uploads them to a private album on Picasa Web Albums./strong Jailbreak alternatives are fine too.  Searching the App Store for the word "picasa" gives me far too many results. There are some Picasa album-browsing apps, and a few uploading tools (mostly paid; free versions only upload thumbnails). Rather than testing out all 59+ apps myself, perhaps some fellow users here have personal experiences and recommendations?  I'm using Linux on my pc. This means that iTunes is not an option. (Yes, it's a hassle...) I am looking for something that can strongupload straight from iPhone to web, without requiring a computer/strong as a middle step.   Bonus points for operation in the background, but I'll accept an app that requires to be foreground -- as long as it can upload.  <answer28544> I use Web Albums and it works well. It's currently $2.99 on the US store.  <answer28584> strongPhotoforge2/strong is an excellent photo editing app for both iPhone and iPad that uploads to Picasa and just about everything else. It's a real bargain too: Â£0.69 in the UK/$0.99 in the US.  There are plenty of other options too: see my round up of iPad photo apps over on photo.stackexchange.com.  <answer72263> I used PhotoSync (US$1.99) and was impressed by its features. You can not only upload to Picasa but also Flickr, Dropbox and other services, including to your computer or another iphone/iPad.  <answer80278> Seems like the new answer is the Google+ app for iOS.  <comment32809> Can you provide a link to the relevent website, or iTunes App Store link? <comment32812> http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/web-albums-a-picasa-photo/id344997890 for $2.99 <comment32813> Thanks -- I found that the same author also has another app called "[Up](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/up-a-picasa-photo-video-uploader/id399922612)" for $0.99 -- I wonder if Web Albums is 3x better or not. <comment32922> Looking at the iTunes page, it appears that the app can't do bulk upload, but only the one pic it's currently editing? <comment32926> Yes, I think that's the case. Sorry, missed that you specifically wanted bulk uploads. <comment44569> This app is crazy. You need to have location services enabled for bulk upload? Why is that? <comment92670> Times change, apps improve. Google+ for iOS is the tool of choice (even though it only allows 2048x2048 resolution).
