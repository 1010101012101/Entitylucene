Where are the latest drivers for the Intel HD Graphics 4000? <body> Strangely enough, I haven't been able to find any official website or webpage that hosts the official Intel HD Graphics 4000 latest drivers for OS X (10.9, to be specific).  Where are the drivers hiding?  <answer128603> The drivers for Intel GPU HD4000 are modified by apple and the revisions are delivered to you bundled in software updates.  If you want a access to specific driver open the installation package from 10.9 with specific tools for that and get it from there.  <comment150610> HD4000... Intel? Camera? HD4000 what??? If you are looking for the Intel drivers, what do you need them for? Is your system experiencing any issues? <comment150614> The graphics "card/chip/processor". I simply figure that it's good practice to make the latest drivers widely available. I was having problems with VirtualBox and 3D acceleration, but I think I've managed to isolate that problem to VirtualBox's application logic rather than anything actually being broken on my system. <comment150615> I'd still like to know where those drivers are, though, just for reference. <comment150617> The video drivers for Mac OS X are packaged with the OS and not available separately, AFAIK. <comment150626> Drivers on Mac are kernel extensions and can be found in `/System/Library/Extensions` directory. There's for example: `AppleIntelHD4000Graphics.kext` <comment150652> Fascinating. I was worried that this might be the case. This puts a frowny face on my day. XD <comment150653> Would you mind elaborating a little bit on that and listing a couple examples of the "specific tools" for said job? <comment150660> I can do that, but please ask as new question, something like How to extract os x installer package contents. I assume we are done with this one then.
