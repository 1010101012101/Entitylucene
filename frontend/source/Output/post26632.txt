How can you email an address book group to another Mac user? <body> If I have an OS X Address Book group of people I want to email periodic updates to, and I want to send that list to a second person who wants to email updates to this group as well, how can I do that?  If I drag the group to a Mail.app message and send that to my friend, they can open it and import all those contacts into Mail.app... however, it does not import the emgroup/em, just the empeople/em. Since we know some of the same people, my friend will have some of the people from this group already in her address book. If she does and she chooses to not update her cards with my cards, then they won't even show up under "Last Import".  How can you email an address book group to another Mac user so that it shows as a group in their address book?  <answer26634> Without some sort of mailing list software, I'm not sure you'll really get the functionality you want.  As a workaround I would try setting up a custom tag, using an existing unused field, or something in Notes, and then creating a Smart Ground around that.  For example, all the contacts you want in your group, put 'mailing list' into their notes. Then create a SmartGroup to show those contacts.  Send the contacts to your friend, and they can import and merge the data. If they setup the same smart group, you should have the same contacts, with the same info, in that group.  The other option would be to stop her importing anything, and just use a Shared Addressbook, and maintain everything there. Google, Exchange, LDAP etc will let you use a remote address book, that isn't automatically synced to your local address book, but all contacts are accessibly, so you can both use that. In the groups page of the address book you'll see your local contacts, and remote contacts as distinct lists. Then, you'll just know to send to everyone in that shared address book.  <answer74657> I just discovered that this is possible in Mac OS X 10.7 Lion... and after testing further I discovered it's possible in Mac OS X 10.6.8 also. I'm not sure if this works in earlier versions, but here are the steps to make this happen:  h2For the emsender/em:/h2  ol liCreate a new strongGroup/strong in Address Book either using the strongFile  New Group/strong menu item, or by clicking the strongcode+/code/strong button on the Groups panel:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bq5Z1.png" alt="Create a new list in 10.7" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mLogv.png" alt="Create a new list in 10.6"/li liClick on strongAll Contacts/strong to view all your contacts. Find the contacts you want to add to the list and drag and drop them from the list of contacts on the right to the new list you created on the left.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FlEwG.png" alt="Add Contacts in 10.7"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/XcyjS.png" alt="Add Contacts in 10.6"/li liOnce you have added all the contacts to your new group you need to send the list to your friend. You can create a new email message and drag the name of the group from the list in Address Book and drop it on a the email message to send the list. Or, you can select the group and use the strongFile  Export  Export vCard.../strong menu item to export the list, and attach the resulting file to an email./li /ol  h2For the emrecipient/em:/h2  The key to making this work is to strongcreate a new group first/strong and then dropping the vCard on that group.  ol liCreate a new group in the OS X Address book, just like in step #1 for the sender, using either using the strongFile  New Group/strong menu item, or by clicking the strongcode+/code/strong button on the Groups panel:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bq5Z1.png" alt="Create a new list in 10.7" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mLogv.png" alt="Create a new list in 10.6"/li liDrag and drop the vCard file sent to you strongon the new group which you created/strong. Make sure the new list "lights up" as shown below:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mELMX.png" alt="Drop list in 10.7" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dJhwh.png" alt="Drop list in 10.6"/li liYou will be asked if you want to import the new cards. **If you are told there are duplicates, click "Review Duplicates".

Heck I am about to just grab the emails out of the VCF with a regex because I need the list ASAP. But I wanted to know how to do this for future reference.
