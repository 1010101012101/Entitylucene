align widgets in the dashboard? <body> Is it possible to move a dashboard widget to a specific coordinate? I looked in google, and there's no specific answer to it.  I asume that there should be some plist file somewhere with the numeric coordinates of each widget that can be programatically set using automator or something.  <comment109752> Could you be more specific what you actually trying to do. <comment109770> Just grab one of my widgets in the dashboard and center it in the screen... :P
