Disable message / call notifications for one specific contact <body> One of my contacts is annoying me with text messages. I could block them, but then I'd never be able to see the messages they send and I want to have the ability to do that.  So instead the idea I had was to turn off text message notification sounds / badges / etc for just this one specific contact.  Is this possible? It seems like I can turn off notifications for people not in my contacts, but really I just want to turn them off for this one specific person.  <answer158401> Leave them in contacts rather than remove, but set all their ringtones/messages sounds to a silent ringtone.  There's one here linked from this page - How can I get a silent ringtone on my iPhone? on the iPhoneFAQ site.  You'll still get the notifications, but no sounds.  <answer187047> Leave them under your contacts and then click the "do not disturb" when you click on the info of their text message.   <comment186219> but i'll still see the text messages on my home screen even though it won't play a sound, yeah? is there any way to prevent these from appearing on my home screen? <comment186221> Only by removing them from Contacts & setting the notifications pref as you suggested in your question. <comment186223> argh! and there's no way to access the text messages that a blocked caller sends me? (really i want "the same thing as blocking the person but i can see the messages they've sent me if i want to) <comment186226> You can't really block & not block at the same time ;-) <comment347828> This is about two years after the question...but would http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/189972/no-sms-notifications-for-one-contact be a better answer now?
