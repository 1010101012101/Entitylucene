Tile scenes side by side in Windows 7 as virtual machine <body> I am using Windows 7 as virtual machine under Mac OS...  The keyboard shortcuts of Windows become difficult because of the Mac keyboard...  For instance, I am used to tiling scenes in Windows by codeWindows icon key/code + coderight arrow/code or codeWindows icon key/code + codeleft arrow/code, which moves the scene to the right half of the window or the left half...  However, I can't find codeWindows icon key/code now on the Mac keyboard...  So, could anyone tell me what is the keyboard shortcut to move scenes in Windows 7 as virtual machine?  <answer46906> For VMWare the command key acts as the windows key, so command+right and command+left will do what you want.  If this isn't working, you might not have the VMWare guest tools installed on the virtual machine.  There are instructions here:  http://www.vmware.com/support/ws5/doc/new_guest_tools_ws.html  <comment53686> I have seen that on some web pages, but command+right or command+left does not work... <comment53687> @SoftTimur It works for mine.  I know this because it annoys me to no end.  What virtualization software are you using? <comment53688> .. and did you install the guest VM tools for your virtualization software? <comment53694> What is `guest VM tools`? I have installed VMware, so that I can run Windows 7 as a virtual machine under Mac OS... <comment53707> @SoftTimur The VM tools are drivers so Windows can better use the VM program's emulated hardware (like network or graphics). <comment53748> @SoftTimur I've edited my question to add a link to instructions for installing the vmware guest tools.  Once you've installed (or reinstalled) the tools the keyboard shortcuts should work as indicated.
