Change delay and animation time for showing the hidden menu bar <body> In this excellent answer, by user @Jonathan, it's explained how one can modify the delay and animation time for showing the dock if it's hidden. Now, I would like to make the same kind of adjustments to the menu bar, which I also keep hidden.  In an answer by user @dordio, he searched for possible solutions in by typing codedefaults find Menu Bar/code, but he only listed  precodeFound 1 keys in domain 'Apple Global Domain': {     "_HIHideMenuBar" = 0; } /code/pre  and concluded that it wasn't possible to do.  However, when I ran the same commands I found two interesting things:  precodeFound 1 keys in domain 'com.apple.MenuBar': {     "autohide-delay" = 5; } /code/pre  and   precodeFound 1 keys in domain 'com.apple.menu': {     "autohide-delay" = 5; } /code/pre  Not the numbers you would expect for these type of things, but okay. When I modified these using  precodedefaults write com.apple.menu autohide-delay -int 0 defaults write com.apple.MenuBar autohide-delay -int 0 killall SystemUIServer /code/pre  nothing (that I could see) happened with the delay time (I could however confirm that the values had been changed using codedefaults find Menu Bar/code again).  Also, I ran   precodedefaults delete com.apple.menu autohide-delay defaults delete com.apple.MenuBar autohide-delay killall SystemUIServer /code/pre  to reset the values to the defaults, but this removed the lines all together and didn't bring them back.  Is it possible to do what I'm trying to achieve, and if not, what are codecom.apple.menu autohide-delay/code and codecom.apple.MenuBar autohide-delay/code for?
