Why is it that I can no longer access some folders in my old time machine backups and how can I get access? <body> So I recently had IT reformat my Mac OS 10.6 laptop to put a 10.8 image on it. When I first got it back I could still access all folders in my old backups, including the Library folder under my old user account folder. Now when I go into it the system tells me that I don't have permission to access it.  I have tried sudo to get into it from terminal with no luck. I don't remember if this problem started after I enabled backups on my new install of OS X. But this is very irritating. Any ideas as to why this is? I can no longer access "/Users//Library" for example. I just get a red circle icon with a white dash in it.  I tried changing the owner with chown. I tried changing the permissions with chmod to 777. No luck so far.  Why is this happening and are there any solutions for it?  Thanks!  <answer86231> Have you tried repairing the disk permissions via Disk Utility?   If that doesn't work, try enabling the root account, logging in, and attempting to access the files.      ul   liUse the "System Administrator" account to access the files:      ol   linavigate to the folder "strong/System/Library/CoreServices//strong" and open "strongDirectory Utility.app/strong"/li   liClick the padlock/li   liin the "strongEdit/strong" menu, choose "strongEnable root user/strong"/li   lifrom the Apple menu, choose "strongLog out/strong"/li   listronglog in as "System Administrator"/strong (or "root") and you will have access to the files in "/Users/Abby"/li   /ol/li   /ul   <comment99515> I have not tried those things yet. Thanks, I will take a look. <comment99529> Well, unfortunately the "Repair Disk Permissions" option is greyed out. I will try the second option later when I have time for logging out and in. <comment131487> Well I should have gone back and done something with this. But I switched jobs about 2 weeks after this. So I never ended up being able to complete this on that computer. I will just mark this as a good answer for the help.
