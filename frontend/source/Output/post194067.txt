Is there anyway to connect to IRC server via Message app? <body> I'm wondering is there anyway to connect to IRC server via Message default app in OS X. Could I do it over XMPP protocol?  <answer194089> No the Messages app won't work as an IRC client. You have to use another app. Here you can find a list of good apps supporting IRC.  <comment231624> Hi NEO, I already use Adium as my IRC client. This question contains my hope for using default OSX app for IRC because default OSX app is the best for performance... <comment231639> I myself have used Adium for years and it's really good. Yeah I see your point but the Messages app does not support IRC.
