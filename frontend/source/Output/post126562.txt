Fan Direction MacBook <body> I bought a cooler for the bottom of my MacBook because I use it on my bed.  The Instructions say to flip it so it doesn't work against the computer.  I don't want to open it up because it's loaned to me from my school.  All I would like to know is if the fans are pulling air in or pushing air out?  Apple MacBook Mid 2010  <answer126569> The MacBook released in 2010 has intake and output on the back of the computer. There are no vents on the bottom.
