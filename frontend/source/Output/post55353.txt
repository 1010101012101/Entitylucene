How can you sync videos from Youtube to your iPad for offline viewing automatically? <body> I'd like an application like Readability for iPad, that will download and cache videos on the iPad for offline viewing whenever it syncs with the Internet.  A qualifying application would let you do the following:  ol liFlag a video for later viewing with a Google Chrome extension/li liAvoid having to use iTunes at all/li liAutomatically download all new videos wirelessly to the iPad whenever the iPad app syncs (just like Readability)/li /ol  Is there anything out there that's close?  It could be desktop software or a web application, it doesn't matter.  <answer55354> Watchlater does just that. Click a bookmarklet to add a video to the queue, and when you open the app, it will cache the videos in the queue.  <comment63844> This application is amazing. It even syncs video links posted from Twitter automatically.
