Build cask formula from source <body> Is it possible to build cask formula from source instead of installing the corresponding pre-built codeapp/code-file?  <answer266787> No.    Homebrew-cask is for binary distribution.br Downloading binary and place appropriately is all what Homebrew-cask does.    If you look in a cask (package installation script), you'll notice there's no url for source file (.tar.gz) but only for binary file (.dmg, .zip, etc.).  <comment334577> @patrix Can the post notice be removed?
