Is bootcamp 6.0 supporting Target Display mode of an Imac to a Windows 10 OS? <body> I have a 2014 iMac with a Bootcamp version 6.0 installed. I want to use it as a display for a MacBook Pro running windows 10 via thunderbolt to thunderbolt cable. Is that possible? or only works from OS-X to OS-X? Can someone refer me to a official documentation that states that this is supported or has done it themselves?   <answer260459> Nope, this is not possible. Target display mode only works if both machine are in macOS, as mentioned in the Apple KB article Use your iMac as a display with Target Display Mode.     If your iMac is currently started up in Windows, it won't enter Target Display Mode. Target Display Mode isn't supported in Boot Camp.   <comment326103> the iMac will start in OS-X, it's the MacBook Pro the one that is running windows and I want that uses the IMac as a display <comment326106> @FrankS101 I tried that one as well myself, it also doesn't work. You needs both machines to be in macOS for it to work. <comment326120> Did you try with a thunderbolt - thunderbolt connection or what cable did you use to connect them both? <comment326121> @FrankS101 Yes, I used a Thunderbolt cable to join my MacBook Pro (Mid-2012) and iMac (Late 2013). It work when both are in macOS but doesn't when one of them is in Windows.
