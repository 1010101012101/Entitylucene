Macbook Pro locked with find my iPhone, will I get notified if it gets unlocked? <body> My laptop was stolen from my house, and I used the lock feature on find my iPhone app.   I received an email letting me know the day and time my laptop was locked and a sound was played, but I did not receive the last address that occurred in.   Is it possible:  ol liTo find the last address it was online?/li liFor the thief to have unlocked my Mac and without me know and /li liIf they do unlock it will I get a notification or will I notice on the Find My iPhone app?/li /ol
