Bluetooth issue: AirDrop and unlock from watch <body> I have weird behaviour with my iMac (27-inch, Late 2013) 10.12.1 Beta (16B2545a)  AirDrop is only working when system preference is open on the Bluetooth tab, otherwise the Mac is not seen from my iPhone.  If I open the Bluetooth tab, sent the file from my iPhone and close system preference, the transfer is declined.  Also my watch since to unlock my Mac one time every 1000 unlock...  Any idea what's wrong with my Bluetooth and how to fix it?
