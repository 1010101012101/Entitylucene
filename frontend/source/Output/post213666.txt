Unable to change function keys like before <body> In the past versions of Mac OS X, I used to be able to change the function keys behavior.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/p6hUt.png" alt="This is the option that no longer exists"  But now that option is no longer. Does anyone know how to do it now? (Yosemite 10.10.5)br Using a Razer Anansi keyboard.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZYsGj.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer213668> h3It's there under Keyboard Settings (assuming using are using mac keyboard):/h3  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/OV0yg.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment257941> Are you using a separate keyboard? <comment257963> As that section shows different info depending on what keyboard you connect [see @sdayal 's post with the keyboard brightness & turn off, which mine doesn't have] , presumably your Razer isn't correctly telling the Mac about its configuration. New drivers might be the answer - Razers seem to have this type of issue frequently.
