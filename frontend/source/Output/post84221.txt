Can I remotely access my Mac from Linux using screen sharing? <body> I like to access my Mac from work (Linux) and I wonder if it is possible without installing additional software like TeamViewer or ChickenVNC. I also noticed somewhere that it is possible to wake my Mac via WiFi. What is needed for that (Mac has to be plugged in? Do I have to be in the same Network?) and how do I do it?  <answer84228> Part 1 - VNC  This is pretty simple, you'll need to go to emSystem Preferences - Screen Sharing/em and then click on emComputer Settings/em.  From there you can select emVNC Viewers may control this screen with password/em and supply a password  Part 2 - WiFi Wakeup  Still in emSystem Preferences/em go to emEnergy Saver/em.  You can only do this with the Mac running on power (if its a portable), but you should see an option to tick called emWake for Wi-Fi Network Access/em.  strong10.8.2 Problem/strong - if you're running the latest public release of Mountain Lion you may find this doesn't work (detailed here - https://discussions.apple.com/thread/4160837) however if you have access to a developer account, strong10.8.3/strong reports to fix this.  I can confirm this works under 10.8.3 on a MBPr 2012 model.  <comment96878> This should be two questions 1) remote access(VNC is built into Mac) and 2) wake on WiFi <comment96894> Thanks. I'll try that! And no problem for me with a developer account :) Can I also use screen sharing to get access to my Linux workstation? <comment96896> No, you'll need a VNC client for that. <comment96901> I will recommend some other solutions like GoToMyPC or LogMeIn. VNC works like, well, crap over Internet, at least for me. Also, your company **might** block or limit speed of VNC. Solutions like LogMeIn are more stable. Or if you're a pro, SSH. Works like a charm! <comment97207> May I ask another question: How do I wake up my Mac? Do I have to do additional stuff or does it work right away when I try to establish a connection? <comment97230> It think it depends on your router, I know with mine I have to forward WOL requests to a specific client IP using a setting in my router's firmware and also port forwarding. <comment109106> I was wrong in my first comment, you can use the built in screen sharing to access any other OS which has a VNC server.  The easiet way to do this is to issue CMD+K when you're in finder to open the 'Connect to Server' dialog.  Then just typ 'VNC://IP or Name' where IP or Name is either the IP of the machine you want to connect to, or the FQD of the machine.
