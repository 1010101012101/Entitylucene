Sync Google Contact Groups with Apple iOS Contact Groups <body> I am trying to sync my Google Contacts with my iPhone / Apple Contacts. The contacts sync fine, but the groups are not preserved.  In Contacts for Mac, I can create a new group and add contacts to it, but that contact group will not sync across to Google Contacts, and vice versa.   Is there a way to keep these groups in sync?
