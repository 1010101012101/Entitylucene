Apple Mail send only account <body> I have two accounts, a gmail one and a school email address. I want to be able to send emails from my school address and gmail, but receive only from the gmail one (the gmail and school email accounts are synced together so I don't want to get duplicates). is there any way to make only the receive section of an account offline in Mail.app? I'm using OS X 10.9 Mavericks, if that helps. I already turned off automatic receiving for my school email, but if I hit "get mail" all the email from that account gets fetched anyway.  <answer110153> Deleting the password for the IMAP or POP server in the account settings might do it but you'd probably be persistently prompted for that password after doing that.  <answer113481> Set up a new empty email box (perhaps with server side quota or rules to delete all mail immediately upon receipt).  Enter those credentials as a new account in Mail.app and end the sending credentials and server for this shell account.   Now you can send from the account you want and have no emails coming in.   <comment133175> There is a [setting in Gmail itself](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/22370?ctx=mail) that lets you send email from another address. Not sure if it would work from Mail.app but it doesn't hurt to try.
