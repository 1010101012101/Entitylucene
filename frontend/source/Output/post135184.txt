How to disable account on OS X Mavericks <body> I have an account on my OS X Mavericks system that I want to disable so it cannot be used for login. I would not like to delete the account permanently but rather disable it temporarily.  I believe that this was possible in Lion – but maybe my memory plays tricks on me?  <answer135185> You can disable a user account by setting their shell to strong/usr/bin/false/strong.  Either run codechsh -s /usr/bin/false &lt;username&gt;/code, or change it in Users &amp; Groups → Advanced Options. To change it back, run codechsh -s /bin/bash &lt;username&gt;/code.  <answer164442> For the beginners and mac newbies follow this detailed guide  http://www.digitpage.com/temporarily-disable-user-account-mac-os-x/  <answer202697> For Yosemite and newer, you can use  precodesudo dscl . create /Users/UserName IsHidden 1 /code/pre  Source: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT203998  <comment160197> I was aware of this trick, but does it also apply to GUI logins? <comment160198> @mgd Yes it does :) <comment192795> Welcome to Ask Different!

There's still an 'Others' entry there where the hidden user can enter their username and password. <comment295545> I just used this, and now (after re-enabling the account, which was an admin, btw) the account can't use the Terminal: `login: /etc/shells: Permission denied`.  Did I do something wrong?
