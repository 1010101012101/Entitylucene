Can I scrobble Google Music on iPhone? <body> Is there an app for iPhone iOS8 which will scrobble Google Music onto Last.fm?  I came across this question, but it only applies to Android.  <answer199552> I've been working on a way to Scrobble from the official Google Play Music app. It's still a work in progress and it requires a Jailbroken iPhone, but it works!  https://github.com/octalmage/LastGoogle
