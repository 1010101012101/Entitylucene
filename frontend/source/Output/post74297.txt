ipad2 airplay option disappeared, apple tv3, imac as router <body> I have been using my Apple TV3 and iPad2 successfully for over a month with a Wi-Fi network created on my iMac (no external router).  I changed the network name and password so that a visitor could connect (I had forgotten my password) and now my airplay option has disappeared from my iPad.  Both the Apple TV and iPad are connecting via Wi-Fi to the internet, the iMac is still showing the apple TV (audio only through iTunes due to age of iMac) but no matter what I try I cannot get the iPad airplay option back.   Things I have tried:  ul lirestoring/restarting the Apple TV/li lirestarting iPad/li lirestarting iMac/li lirecreating network/internet sharing/li lireinstalling mountain Lion/li /ul  I have read countless complaints about airplay not working with the iPad for people so am not sure that an airport extreme would fix the problem either. I am planning on getting an airport extreme but was hoping to wait a little longer because my setup was working for now.  Does anyone have any ideas short of buying an external router?  <comment86291> I forgot to mention that I also can not get homesharing to work at all, it is turned on in itunes on the imac, turned on on the appletv and turned on with the iPad.
