Calendar events are sometimes deleted <body> I can reproduce my problem by following these steps:  ol liOpen Calendar app on my mac/li liCreate two events using just default settings./li liClose Calendar/li liReopen Calendar /li /ol  I observe that every single time that the first created event is gone but the second event is still present. I also observe that it takes a couple minutes for the Calendar events to by synced with iCloud (even if I manually refresh, Cmd-R); in contrast to if I create the events first in iCloud calendar the events are synced nearly instantaneously with Calendar on my Mac.  I've gone through all the Mac Calendar troubleshooting steps offered by Apple here and here, but my issue was not resolved. I don't have the same problem managing my Calendar on my iPhone or iCloud.  I' am running on a MacBookPro Retina, El Caption (10.11.3).  Edit: I've also tried turning off iCloud Calendar syncing (via System PreferencesiCloud and unchecking Calendar) but get the same issue.
