Hit a key to "move and resize active window" <body> I'd like to bind a key to an action that "takes the active windows and moves it to screen S, coordinates X,Y resizes it W,H". The S,X,Y,W,H variables can be hard-coded.  I don't know where to look for, is this doable? Do I need to mess with ActionScript or create an app or what?  (I'm a programmer but I don't know anything about programming/scripting for OSX)  strongupdate/strong:  I found out SizeUp which happily does exactly that:  ul lia single keystroke, to resize the active window to a pixel specified layout/li /ul  Now, while I'm happy about that, I'd like to know if there was a program which allowed strongmore than one layout/strong (SizeUp allows only one if I'm not mistaken). It would still have to be single-keystroke and possible to insert pixel precise values.  <answer8747> I use a little app called Divvy to do this. You can set up a global hotkey to bring up Divvy. And then within Divvy you can set up hotkeys that will snap the current window to a specific location and a specific size. It's great for quickly doing 2-up Finder windows for copying things back and forth. Or a Finder window on the left and a CyberDuck window on the right for remote copies. One of those apps that, when it's not on a Mac, will make it feel a little bit broken.  <answer10656> precodeset a to path to frontmost application as text tell application "Finder"     set {0, 0, dtw, dth} to bounds of window of desktop end tell try     tell application a to tell window 1         set bounds to {0, 22, dtw / 2, dth}     end tell end try/code/pre  The behavior with multiple displays is pretty confusing: Daring Fireball: Getting the Size of Your Display With AppleScript, the Lazy Way.  You can assign a shortcut for running it with for example FastScripts, Apptivate, Quicksilver or by making a service with Automator.  <comment9292> Thanks. I wasn't able to carve Divvy into what I really wanted (single-key, pixel explicit), but trying to do that I stumbled upon SizeUp, which does exactly that! <comment9293> Edited the question to ask if I can do the same thing but with more than one layout. <comment10096> possible duplicate of [What Window Management Options exist for OS X?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/9659/what-window-management-options-exist-for-os-x)
