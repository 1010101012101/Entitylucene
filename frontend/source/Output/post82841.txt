Ethernet port doesn't work anymore <body> I was using my iMac 27" 2010, doing some work online. From one instant to another, internet stopped to respond. Unable to ping the local router, I initially believed it crashed. However, the rest of my home network was fine.  I'm now forced to use a WiFi connection to connect to the internet. Tried to boot Windows, it dosen't detect the wired network connection too.  A bad way to be forced to change a 1500â‚¬ machine.  What do you suggest?  <answer82852> Have you tried to reset your network settings to default?  ol liTurn off your WiFi and unplug all network connections/li liGo to code/Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/code/li liTake a backup of the codepreferences.plist/code by renaming the file to codepreferences.plist.bak/code (just in case)/li liReboot and a new preferences-file will be automatically recreated/li /ol  ... and by so your network settings will be restored to the default.br Don't worry, it's all about settings, not stored data (like names of networks) will be erased.  <comment95514> Have you tried changing the cable? That's a lot cheaper than a new iMac... <comment95519> Yes, the cable is fine. The port on the router is fine. <comment95521> Did you try to run the network assistant from within Preferences/Network? <comment95525> Ok, i'm gonna try this. However since that i already tried to boot Windows, how exactly could that help? Thank you anyway. <comment95526> Do you use Bootcamp or some kind of virtualisation software? <comment95527> I use vmware but Windows was loaded as a the native OS via bootcamp, naturally. Just tried to reset the network config, without any success. Maybe I will buy an USB Ethernet adapter... I will check some latency specs.
