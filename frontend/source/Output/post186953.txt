One Year Limited Warranty <body> Is the one year limited warranty provided by Apple with a MacBook Pro international?  If I buy the MacBook Pro from US and use it in India, will the limited warranty be applicable in India?  <answer186954> I bought my MacBook Air in Hong Kong and I live in Ireland. The condition for the Warranty and AppleCare was that I had to pay for postage to Hong Kong where they would handle it.  <comment220865> Weren't they ready to fix it in Ireland itself? <comment220867> @AnkitGohel I'm not sure if they could have, Ireland doesn't have many Apple Stores. But the thing was because I bought it in Hong Kong, the warranty was only good in Hong Kong. <comment220868> Did you buy the extended two year AppleCare? Because AppleCare is supposed to be international I think. <comment220869> @AnkitGohel Yes <comment220870> "The AppleCare Protection Plan for Mac and iPod provide global repair coverage." - according to the official Apple site. Do they not do this? <comment220871> @AnkitGohel Just telling you my experience
