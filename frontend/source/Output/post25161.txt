Will Lion install MySQL with it? <body> I had MAMP running on my laptop. I use MySQL a lot. I kinda messed with the user file permission and I fixed it , in that process I changed some password in MySQL config files. So now SQL does not work even though MAMP runs perfectly.  I was planing on installing OS X Lion. I am wondering if upgrading to Lion will install MySQL and all its packages? Will it fix the problem? Or should I have to reinstall MySQL even after I upgrade?  <answer25162> No, I don't believe Lion comes with any sort of SQL server pre-installed.  <answer25185> You probably need to reset the root MySql password, there's a guide on how to it on HowToForge. You only need to have it happen once, back up the config files embefore/em tinkering with them  <comment28382> oh ok. So can you suggest a way to fix this ? when I start MAMP both SQL and APACHE lights turn green ,but cant access SQL or create tables n stuffs. <comment28387> `brew install postgresql` ([Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/)) <comment28390> Try re-installing MAMP.
