Apple keyboard on Windows PC: will CMD buttons work as CTRL? <body> I use mac at home, but at work I have to use Win7 PC. It makes me crazy to switch between mac/win keybard everyday, so I want to buy mac usb keyboard, but, strongwill CMD buttons work as CTRL in windows/strong 'out of the box'? I can use some mapping software, but it would be much better just to plug it in and use.   <answer203237> I am 95% certain the answer is NO, but I do not have a Windows PC to verify.  <answer203245> The answer is no. The difference is not a Mac vs Win keyboard. You can use a Windows keyboard on a Mac and the keys are the same.  The difference in in the OS. Windows treats ctrl-C as copy and OS X cmd-C. They just differ and I know of not way of mapping them  <answer203251> Command button will act as Windows button, Control as Ctrl, Option as Alt. See https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202676 section "How Microsoft Windows Function keys are mapped to Apple keyboards".  <comment245151> It should work as Windows key. ctrl (âŒƒ) should be equivalent of Control on Win. <comment245152> I know it is OS issue, but I thought maybe Win maps cmd as ctrl on apple keyboard. AFAIK it is possible to remap buttons except Win key, can you tell me how Win registers pressing cmd button? <comment245153> The cmd button is alt or alt-gr on a Windows keyboard <comment246201> I would use the mapping software. On the mac. **Karabiner** is the most flexible. <comment246222> i know, but the thing is, I preffer mac keyboard over Windows :)
