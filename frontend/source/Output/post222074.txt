Unwrap Finder Folder <body> I really like the (new-ish) Finder contextual menu option to move selected files into a new folder. I was wondering if the emopposite/em exists too, where a folder is "unwrapped", where the contents are moved back to the parent folder.  Ex:     Select 4 files in strongPhotos/strong folder; Use "Create folder with 4 Items"; new folder created.      Right-click the new folder; "Unwrap Folder"; 4 files returned to strongPhotos/strong folder, empty folder deleted.   <answer222075> The 2 options are not quite the same, so I can't see anything like this existing.  When you use codeNew Folder with Selection (4 items)/code (for example) creation of the folder is a simple task, to create a new folder and request a name for it.  But once a folder is created, there are multiple results from a proposed "unwrap" command, depending on if you select all the files in the folder or not.  Let's say you select all the visible files with the mouse instead of kbdcmd/kbd+kbda/kbd, but you miss one that's scrolled off the bottom:  ul liShould it abandon the attempt to unwrap, because there are unselected files?/li liShould it move the selected files back, and leave the orphan file alone?  /li liShould it move the selected files back a level, and then remove the folder regardless of the fact that it still has contents?/li liWhat if there are further subfolders?/li liWhat if files don't have permission at the next level back, say they were on the users home directory, or the root of the filesystem?/li /ul  The choices in copying stuff back one level and removing their previous location is far far tricker than simply creating a new folder and moving the selected files inside.  I'm sure that custom scripts can be written to provide something similar, but I imagine the use case it pretty unusual, as well as much trickier to implement in a way that won't confuse, as such it doesn't exist by default.  <comment269021> As far as I'm aware of, that doesn't exist, and in my opinion, nor should it. Could cause to much trouble.
