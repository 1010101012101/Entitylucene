Imporing a .vcf only imported contact names, not numbers <body> I have been using an android device for a while. I've got an iPhone 4 today (for nearly free) and tried importing all my contacts into it. I first tried bluetooth, however, apple doesn't support anything other than apple, so I sent the file to my PC. Some contacts looked something like this      =64=6F=76... (this is way longer)   And all the rest had the names imported, however strongNOT THE NUMBERS/strong! I still have the contacts on my android device, so I can redo the process.  I think that I can use some kind of other importing software, not FonePaw, and emmaybe/em I can convert the vCard into something else.     Aditional: I used FonePaw to import them      My android device is Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 (2012, N-8000)   Thank you, John.  <comment359893> There's an Android to iOS app that will help you - see https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/175649/how-to-convert-my-android-contacts-to-iphone
