How can I press escape on a Bluetooth keyboard with my iPhone? <body> I sometimes use a BlueTooth keyboard with my iPhone, which is lovely for writing emails, but I run into difficulties when using terminal on the iPhone - I like to edit files with vi(m), which requires quite a lot of presses of the escape key, but every time I press escape, the iPhone interprets that as a request to go back to the home screen and sends me out of the app.  Any ideas?   <answer37617> Terminal hasn't been updated for nearly a year now, so unfortunately there are some imperfections as things change in iOS.  But for this case, though, I believe the escape key is actually controlled by SpringBoard, not any apps, which means Terminal can't capture and send the escape key to the command-line program.   The iPhone Wiki article on Terminal has information on keyboard shortcuts, and it says that the key shortcut for escape is kbdCtrl/kbd + kbd[/kbd (kbdâ€¢/kbd + kbd[/kbd on the virtual keyboard).  However, if my assumptions above are correct, the only way to use the real escape key would be to write a tweak to redirect the escape command to Terminal.   <comment42154> Is the iPhone jailbroken? <comment42173> Does `ctrl`+`[` work? <comment42176> Yes, sorry, jailbroken :)
