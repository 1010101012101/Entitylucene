iPhone Forever Plan, Theft of Phone <body> This isn't exactly a technical hardware question, but policy and strategy regarding the iPhone Forever Plan.   Recently, I had my iPhone Forever Plan phone stolen, and I'm not sure what to do.   ol liAppleCare+ does not cover or help against theft. /li liAT&amp;T insurance does not cover iPhone Forever Plan phones/li liMy credit card does not cover phones that are paid over a payment plan spanning more than 90 days./li liMy renter's insurance also does not cover subscription payment items. /li liI actually have a few suspects, but the police does not seem to care enough to get warrants to search, claiming stolen phones are very low on their priority. /li /ol  Is my only solution to pay back the iPhone at a loss, and start a new plan?   Is there anything else I can do?   <comment267238> Was find my iPhone turned on?   I actually wondered what happaned to a stolen iPhone forever when these plans were first coming out. <comment267246> Phone either out of batteries or sim card popped <comment267283> Neither would prevent 'Find my iPhone' alerting you next time the device ever sees any connection, on-air or wifi.
