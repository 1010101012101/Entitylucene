Date format for file's "Modified" and "Last opened" is different than other files <body> I have a few files in the same folder and I noticed that the format for the codeModified/code and codeLast opened/code metadata fields are the "short" format for most files and the "medium" format for just a few. Why is this and how is this set for a given file?  Example of "short" format date:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7RlfM.png" alt="enter image description here"  Example of "medium" format date:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Fz5dZ.png" alt="enter image description here"  Just FYI, here's where the date formats are set in System Preferences:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8DGSl.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer265871> The date "presentation" of a file info in column view in the preview column is determined by the column width! The wider the column the more detailed the date!  You can easily check this by either alt-holding and moving the column handle which strongincreases/decreases/strong all columns at once or just moving the "preview" handle. The handles are the two small parallel lines near the bottom of a window.  very short (all examples are german date formats):  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jfe9W.png" alt="enter image description here"  middle:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/VbwLx.png" alt="enter image description here"  full:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Eh0Xg.png" alt="enter image description here"
