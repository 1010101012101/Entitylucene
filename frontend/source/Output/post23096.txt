Which are main technical reasons to switch to Lion? <body> Everywhere I just read posts and questions about how to make lion like snow leopard. So... Why not keeping snow leopard, at least while lion's "young"? Are there any technical / cosmetic reasons for the switch?  <answer23099> There are no "technical reasons" per se. I'll quickly list my pros/cons but they are definitely personal.  strong1. Pros/strongbr  ul liThe uppgrade is pretty smooth and straightforward./li liIt really does have a nicer 'look and feel'/li liMost of the applications you can be using are already Lion Compatible/li liIt's the cheapest OS you can find/li /ul  strong2. Cons/strongbr  ul liIf you use XCode you'll strongHAVE/strong to reinstall a new version (4.1.1) (and that honestly is a big hitch which i didn't know about)/li liThe scrollbars !! : they are switched at first (up is down) but can be reversed and they are now iPhone like which is still annoying when you use a black background app that didn't change the scrollbar color. (basically you don't see them)/li /ul  There could be much more things to say but Ars Technica did the best review you can find on the web.  I personally made the leap and really not regretting it so far.  <answer23104> Lion does have a lot of new Language features for those who need them:  http://m10lmac.blogspot.com/2011/07/os-x-107-lion-adds-major-new-language.html  <answer23107> The principal compelling reason for upgrading to any new operating system version always comes down to the applications you want to run. When you find a new application, or a newer version of an older application, that you want to run, and you learn that this version of the application emrequires/em the newer operating system, that's when you want to consider upgrading.  I upgraded to Lion early because I'm a professional technical support technician, and I have to train myself be familiar with Lion when my clients start calling for help using Lion. If I were not a professional support technician, I would wait a lot longer to make the change.  <answer23112> Lion's improved security is worth a mention. Don't get me wrong, Lion still has its share of security issues (see LDAP and enterprise updates).  But Apple's inclusion of sandboxing, full hard disk encryption, and a better ASLR goes a long way to reducing exposure to a wide variety of attacks.  <comment25775> I'd say that depends a lot on what you use your Mac for. Software developers will have different reasons to switch than graphics designers or casual couch surfers. <comment25777> I'd ignore anything that says "Make x look like previous version!". It's mostly people who don't like change. <comment25786> I second this with a quote: “I generally tell Mac users that if they care about security, they should upgrade to Lion sooner rather than later, and the same goes for Windows users, too.” http://goo.gl/5S2LO <comment25791> Rather than calling for a large discussion about anything/everything that changed, is there a specific problem / requirements you have with this upgrade decision you face? (what criteria will make one answer the _right_ answer to this question.)
