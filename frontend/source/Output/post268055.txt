How do I get rid of "access privileges" popup message? <body> I have Windows 10 and I just upgraded to a new iTunes version. Now, every time a new song starts I get a popup message saying "iTunes could not connect to the iTunes store. You do not have enough access privileges for this operation." ... etc. OK... I do not care about having access to the iTunes store; haven't shopped there in 8 years. How do I make it so that the message stops popping up? There is no "Do not show this again" box on it. Thanks in advance!  <answer268126> Source.  Use strongRestrictions/strong to disable access to the iTunes Store and it shouldn't ask you  anymore.
