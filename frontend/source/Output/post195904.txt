Command line app location? (OSX) <body> I wrote a small tool as a cmd tool. Where should it be placed? Which paths are automatically scanned for searching an app? I want to avoid absolute path, because I have to track it on every system.  <answer195913> In a Terminal type codeecho $PATH/code and press Enter.  It will display your codePATH/code Environment Variable.  Example:  precode $ echo $PATH  $ /usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin  $ /code/pre  While you could place it in any of the locations listed nonetheless it's a good suggestion that you place it in code/usr/local/bin/code as the other locations are used by the OS.  In a Terminal see codeman hier/code for an explanation of the layout of the filesystem in this respect.  On my system I have hundreds of scripts I've written, over the years, and use many on an ongoing basis so I created a directory in the emroot/em "code//code" directory called codescripts/code and place everything there and added code/scripts/code to my codePATH/code by adding codeexport PATH=$PATH:/scripts/code to my code~/.profile/code file.  So my codePATH/code is as follows:  precode $ echo $PATH  $ /usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/scrips  $ /code/pre  <answer195917> The usual Unix way for your scripts is /usr/local/bin for scripts that all users on the system can use and if for only you then in somewhere under your home directory often ~/bin  You need to make sure both of these directories art on your PATH environment variable preferably before system paths do if your write a script with the same one as a system one then your one gets run.  e.g in you shell (usually in ~/.bashrc)  precodeexport PATH=~/bin:/usr/local/bin:$PATH /code/pre
