An app to stop another app (Music Player) after some time <body> A friend of mine asked this question "Do you know of any timer apps for iPhone which will close down a particular app after a set period of time?"  On questioning further - the "particular" app happened to be Music Player.   <answer85024> ol liLaunch strongClock/strong/li liChoose strongTimer/strong/li liTap on strongWhen Timer Ends/strong/li liScroll right to the bottom and pick strongStop Playing/strong/li liSet your time - say, 20 minutes (or whatever time you want) and tap on strongStart/strong/li /ol  Hope this helps.   <comment97904> This is fantastic! <comment97905> @DavidPearce: Glad could be of help!
