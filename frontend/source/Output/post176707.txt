How to troubleshoot Time Machine when backup always halts at some point? <body> Everything starts ok but then it comes to a halt and does not move. Even the HD light stops :(  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/01bfY.png" alt=""  <answer176712> Troubleshooting this is fairly straightforward to start.  When it hangs, open up Applications/Utilities and launch terminal.  Type:  precode sudo tmdiagnose /code/pre  That will gather many logs and statistics and allow you to have a complete picture of what Time Machine was stuck on. After collecting three such instances (reboot the Mac after the script ends), you can start looking for patterns or a specific file that's causing things to hang.  You also can capture very precise details before and after the codetmdiagnose/code command by issuing a codetmutil status/code command.  I've been troubleshooting this on one Mac for a few weeks now, so it's not always clear what or where the issue lies. Hopefully yours will be easier to nail down than mine.  <comment208910> Have you run `verify disk` in Disk Utility? It may be hung up on a file system error. Does it work if you try backing up to a different hard drive?
