Logic Board Part No <body> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GUxXu.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Hi, Any idea what the part number is for this logic board, or where will I find it printed on the board. It has no xxx-xxxx-x number on it and the serial number returns a different board type. So if I can find out what this board is, I will be able to replace it. Thanks John  <comment331822> It might help if you even told us what it's from <comment331823> Is this from an Apple product? <comment331827> Its from a MacBook A1466 <comment331878> Which year is your MacBook Air 13" from? <comment331879> And which processor? <comment331946> The box says i5 (1.3ghz) 4GB, year 2013. I've given my serial number to three suppliers who've all sent me a different logic board. Something is a miss somewhere between the original config and the board now. So if I can just match this board would be great <comment332018> I get this from a search on the internet: MacBook Air 13" 2013 A1466 1.3GHz Core i5-4250U 4GB Logic Board 820-3437-B MD760
