How do I allow new system preferences in profile manager? <body> We're using Profile Manager on our group of Macs.  The System Preferences options are setup as a whitelist.  However, the profile manager doesn't know about certain options, so they get blocked by default when I'd like to be able to enable them (Example: Java Control Panel and Wacom Tablet settings).  Is there a way to tell Profile Manager that those things exist so that I can enable them (and keep the whitelisting model)?  <answer247571> You need to install the 3rd party control panel onto the Mac running the server - then they appear to be allowed or not.
