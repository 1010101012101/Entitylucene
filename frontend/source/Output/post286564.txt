My iPad 2 has become infected with pop-up malware <body> I accidentally opened a malicious pop-up for LinkedIn and now, my iPad 2 is infected with a virus.  How can I delete this virus from my iPad?  How can I clean my iPad 2?  <comment361581> Please indicate more informations for us to help you, your IOS version, a screenshot of the popup you are seeing and whether your ipad is jailbrocken or not. If it's not it's very unlikely that you got a virus browsing on safari, the popup is probably a SCAM asking you money to remove it. There are only a few IOS versions on which such an attack would be technically possible, but I wouldn't worry too much if I were you. <comment361601> Could you explain more about the symptoms you are seeing? Is it only in Safari, or are other Apps affected?
