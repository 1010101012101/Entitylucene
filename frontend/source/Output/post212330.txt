If it is the OSX that was on your system you can do following easier: Restart in the RecoveryPartition, click your language, then choose Install OSX. And OSX will be installed on your system. I assume that it is Yosemite afterwards. Then decide if you want to upgrade, do it from the Appstore, or stay.  If you want to have a bootable stick later on: Download DiskMakerX and make a bootable stick with it.  <comment256384> I tried google of course. My main problem is to obtain dmg file without access to app store. Where i can download a valid dmg?? <comment256385> To get a clean and official dmg, you have to download it from the AppStore or from the Apple Developers center. <comment256395> Use [Internet Recovery](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT201314) No USB key required. <comment256396> I already tried to use internet recovery but during the download, i got an error with the message to download it from app store <comment256426> Great asnwer! Wihout OS, how do you download it from app store? <comment256444> Maybe i had deleted recovery partition when erase all data from my computer. When i start OS holding Alt Key, i dont see the icon of recovery. My last solution is donwload a valid dmg and write into usb pen. <comment256449> Mmmmm, you can't :/ Be careful, if you want to download El Capitan from the web, the most of them are infected. <comment256484> @VítorNóbrega maybe it's time to contact Apple support... Maybe the tech guys at a physical Apple store or service center can reload the machine from a disk image.
