OSX Calendar zoom in on specific date <body> In OSX Calendar (El Capitan) I am on the "Month" view. I browse around and then I see a date that interests me and want to see a full day-view for that date.  My instinct is to double-click on the date, but it creates a new event.  How do I zoom into a specific date?  <answer231948> Just double click exactly on the number of the day, instead of double-clicking in the "body" of the day.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/IUFZO.png" alt="enter image description here"  For example, if you want to have a day view for July 1st, double-click on the "1 Jul".  <comment283330> Click on it on month view and then press `âŒ˜ CMD`+`1` to switch to day view. <comment283331> aha. Yes, I tried that as well but my calendar has 2 numbers (using the alternate calendar feature). And I guess I was clicking on the wrong one. Thanks
