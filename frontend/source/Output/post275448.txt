Move sandboxed app's container to a RAM drive <body> I am trying to move the IO intensive parts of a sandboxed macOS app off of my SSD and put it on a RAM drive.   I followed the advice from this post which points out that you need to copy the entire folder, and not just part of the container, or it will run into sandboxing issues.  Where I am right now, is that I have the app container data copying over from persistent storage to the volatile storage, then the app loads and most of the app is working perfectly. But I'm still running into an issue. I made a symbolic link from code~/Library/Containers/com.vendor.AppName/code to the RAM drive. The app container tree looks like this: br code/Volumes/ramdrive/volatile/com.vendor.AppName/CloudKit/code code/Volumes/ramdrive/volatile/com.vendor.AppName/Library/code  As far as I can tell, the app can read and write data in the Library folder, but it hits up against errors like the following: br codekernel SandboxViolation: cloudd(86159) deny(1) file-write-data /Volumes/ramdrive/volatile/com.vendor.AppName/Data/CloudKit/945anb994hiwfrckun6ifmznfdt4314erh5zpl9p/Records/Records.db-wal/code  By codewatch/codeing codedf/code, I can see the usage of the RAM drive increase when using the app. Also, in previous tests where emall/em filesystem access requests were being denied, the app would cease to function almost entirely. Now, the only thing that doesn't work is seemingly the interaction with CloudKit.   Any ideas about why it works with one part of the sandboxed tree, but not with the CloudKit part?   Thanks!
