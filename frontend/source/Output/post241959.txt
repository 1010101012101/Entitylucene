How can I reinstall gcc? <body> Im new with mac and tried to install gcc / g++ on an MacBook Air with El Captain. I installed Xcode and used   precodexcode-select --install /code/pre  It completed and was successful. However, for some reason I cannot find any version of gcc / g++ in /usr/bin or anywhere else besides the symlinks (cc c++ gcc g++) that point to nothing. I tried  precodegcc -v /code/pre  and received the error  precode-bash: gcc: command not found /code/pre  And when I try to reinstall the command line tools again with code-select I get  precodexcode-select: error: command line tools are already installed, use "Software Update" to install updates /code/pre  Is there any way I can simply start over with the install of the command line developer tools?  <answer241964> Is Xcode installed in the normal location? (i.e. in /Applications?)  What do you get back from,  precode$ xcode-select --print-path /code/pre  Can you see gcc at the following location,  precode$ ls -l /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/usr/bin/gcc -rwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel  18560 16 Mar 00:31 /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/usr/bin/gcc /code/pre  If the path from xcode-select is not pointing to /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer then try forcing to this location,  precodesudo xcode-select --switch /Applications/Xcode.app /code/pre
