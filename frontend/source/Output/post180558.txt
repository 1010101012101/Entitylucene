Why is my Mac slow after the OS X 10.10.3 update? <body> I just installed OS X 10.10.3, and it is noticeably slower than 10.10.2. How can I figure out what's causing the slowness, and then how can I fix it?  <answer180565> Considering the limited information you provided, here are some generic steps.  ol liOpen the Activity Monitor (located in your Applications/Utilities Folder).  ul liSort by CPU and look who is the most active app in there. /li liAlso take a look at your memory and your Disk activity./li /ul/li liNext open your Console log (also in your Applications/Utilities Folder) and look for repeating message./li /ol  Those two steps should give you some idea what is slowing it down.  <answer181253> From Apple support forums: If you kept the 10.10.2 Full installer from the Mac App Store and created a USB thumb drive, you can restart with that and install 10.10.2 on top of 10.10.3. Make sure you back up prior to doing this. Or, you can restore from your back up that you hopefully made prior to upgrading to 10.10.3.  <answer182677> I had this same problem with everything running slow after installing 10.10.3. I read that if you open your preferences in "Photo" and clicking the "Cloud" tab, then unchecking anything that is checked within this tab, it will resolve the problem. That is what I did and so far everything is back to normal. Hope this helps.  <answer188877> strongTRY THIS!/strong  ol liForce Quit all programs except Finder/li liShut Down computer/li liPress and Hold Command+R and then press power/li liClick on Disk Utility and Continue/li liClick on the 2nd Hard drive ex: 'Macintosh HD'/li liClick Verify Disk let it finish and then do Verify Disk Permissions/li liAfter step 6 click Repair Disk Permission and let it finish/li liShut Down Computer/li liHold down Option+Command+P+R and press the power button for 2 seconds and release/li liHold keys down until you hear the startup sound a 2nd time./li /ol  Hope this works!  <comment215774> Yeah it was so unbearable that I did this a few days ago and went through the painful process of reinstalling and restoring a backup through a Time Capsule OTA. <comment223289> Try downloading and installing the OS X 10.10.3 Combo Updater. It includes all updated system files released after the original 10.10.0 release. The combo updater can be installed to repair/replace corrupt system files and can sometimes fix weird issues like you're seeing. <comment261773> What changes this procedure causes the system?
