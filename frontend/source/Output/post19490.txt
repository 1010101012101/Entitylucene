Change keyboard shortcut for {} and [] in German keyboard layout <body> I'm new to Mac and using a Macbook Air with Lion and a German keyboard. From my PC I'm used to other keyboard shortcuts for {} and [].  Currently it's alt + 8,9 for {} and alt + 5,6 for []. Can I change this to the PC ones (cmd + 7,0 and cmd + 8,9)?  <answer19502> Try Ukulele. It's a keyboard layout editor for Mac OS X.  <answer20680> I've managed to create these shortcuts with Spark: http://www.shadowlab.org/softwares/spark.php  <comment22751> Hm ... it's a little bit to complicated for me. <comment23248> I'm just trying to help...
