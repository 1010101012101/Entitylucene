Get latest Time Machine backup when backup disk is unplugged <body> I know i can get the time stamp of the latest Time Machine backup with the command codetmutil latestbackup | grep -E -o "[0-9\-]+$"/code but this only works when my backup disk is plugged in. If not, i get the error message emUnable to locate machine directory for host./em  Is there any emother/em way to figure out (through scripting) when the last backup was made?   I'm running OS X Mavericks and the use case would be to eventually run this as remote monitoring for Macs, say, using collectd.  <comment250765> This might be of some use: `defaults read /Library/Preferences/com.apple.TimeMachine.plist Destinations | grep "BACKUP_COMPLETED_DATE"`
