Unable to mount Time Capsule from a Macbook when backups work <body> I have two Macbooks (codeA/code and codeB/code). codeA/code backs-up to Time Capsule (codeTC/code), while codeB/code does not. I used to mount codeTC/code and move files there, which I don't want to keep on codeA/code or codeB/code.   Few weeks ago it became impossible to mount codeTC/code on codeA/code, while codeB/code is still mounting fine. codeA/code continues to do backups to codeTC/code as usual. codeA/code does not show codeTC/code in left sidebar in Finder (codeB/code does), but one can find it via Networks. Trying to connect to partition takes forever. The partition is showed as mounted, however, code/Volumes//code does not have it so as Disk Utility.   I restarted both codeTC/code and codeA/code, but the problem persists. Is there anything else I can reset to solve this issue?  Buttons to unmount and to "connect as..." do not respond:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xOWdJ.png" alt="hanging"  precode$ df -g Filesystem    1G-blocks Used Available Capacity  iused   ifree %iused  Mounted on /dev/disk1          232  226         5    98% 59416761 1564485   97%   / devfs                 0    0         0   100%      696       0  100%   /dev map -hosts            0    0         0   100%        0       0  100%   /net map auto_home         0    0         0   100%        0       0  100%   /home $ /code/pre  <answer213036> h3Re-adding the Time Capsule to Time Machine may work/h3  I used to face problems with the mount. Removing the Time Capsule (codeTC/code) from codeA/code's Time Machine and re-adding helped.  Otherwise, the obvious ultimate solution would be to remove the codeA/code's backup from TC completely and take a fresh backup.  <comment257237> All these rather risky manipulations should only be attempted within a perfectly working network. And this doesn't seem to be the case here. <comment257379> Hm, I hope I won't loose the old backups removing `TC` from `A`? I'll give it a try tonight. <comment257381> @danielAzuelos Network seems working fine. I have 3 macbooks and 4 phones using it without noticeable issues. All of them are connected to `TC` directly. <comment257396> @Andrei: how do you explain `A` can't access `TC`? Could you check a basic `ping` to check it is really working? <comment257556> @danielAzuelos `B` can mount `TC`. `A` shows `TC` as already mounted. I haven't had a chance to remove `TC` from `A` yet. Maybe today <comment257627> @sdayal I've just tried to remove backup disk from `A` Time Machine and added it again. It asked password and set up fine, but the mounting is still hanging. I've added screenshot showing it. I will try to remove-n-restart to see if it helps. <comment257630> @Andrei: how is your disk secured? Of the 3 options: a) With Accounts, b) With a disk password c) With a device password, I have selected "With a Disk Password". And I have selected "Remember this password in KeyChain" <comment257634> It looks like some comments are deleted, so I've moved this conversation [to chat](http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/30887/discussion-on-question-by-andrei-unable-to-mount-time-capsule-from-a-macbook-whe) so that the clarifications can make sense and not confuse the wording of the question as it stands. <comment257637> @sdayal I have installed El Capitan update and the issue was resolved. I hope it ain't coming back because I ran out of system updates atm :) <comment257639> Awesome! I'm so happy that you could get it working :)
