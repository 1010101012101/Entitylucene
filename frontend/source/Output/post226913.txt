Pandora app won't play on Apple TV (4th Generation) <body> I can't get Pandora to play music on my Apple TV (4th Gen). It just sits there at 0:00.  <answer226914> For some reason Pandora doesn't work with emReduce Loud Sounds/em enabled.  Disable it by going to the Settings app.  strongSettings  Audio and Video  Reduce loud sounds  off/strong  EDIT: I just discovered you can strongask Siri to "Turn Reduce loud sounds off"/strong as well and it is much faster than navigating the settings of course.
