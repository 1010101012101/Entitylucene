iMac shows prohibitory symbol <body> I recently booted up my iMac, but then the Apple logo disappeared and a replaced it. I tried going into Recovery mode but recovery mode just takes LITERALLY hours. No matter how long I let it load, recovery mode doesn't help: I let it load overnight and it still didn't work.  How can I fix this issue and boot into my iMac again?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mjobp.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer269768> This is pretty simple to outline the steps to take. If your internal recovery fails, use an external recovery disk.  ul lihttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202294/li /ul  If that fails or you can't accomplish it, seek hardware service or someone that has the tools to make an external drive with a bootable OS.  <comment337998> What is the "prohibitory" symbol?
