Movie recording on iPad Warning Sign <body> I'm trying to record my screen through quicktime player on mac, however this warning sign appears (with no tooltip or anything) and selecting the iPad screen just leaves a black screen on the recording window. Any advice? Additionally, my Macbook comes up with the error 'the operation can not be completed' when trying the same. Currently on Sierra for the MBP and El Cap for the desktop.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/P1aqM.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment355724> I have the same issue.  Did you solve this problem? <comment355731> @emilyJ Hi, I think it was to do with the Mac I was recording on, that may have been a managed Mac, so some I/O was locked. In addition, my personal Mac was on an out of date Sierra beta so I needed to update on there. If neither of those help, maybe try a PRAM/SMC reset? HTH.
