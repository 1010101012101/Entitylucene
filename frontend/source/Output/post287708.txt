Living / Linked Copy of File without Alias <body> Is it possible to have a linked copy of a file that updates whenever the original is saved?  This is mainly for use with Google Drive and SVN, where I need a file to exist in two locations, but not be aliases.  <answer287711> Use a stronghard link/strong with codeln/code in Terminal. A hard link points to the file inode rather than the file location as with a symlink.  precode$ touch foo.txt $ echo "this is foo" &gt; foo.txt $ ln foo.txt hardlink $ cat hardlink this is foo $ mkdir bar $ mv foo.txt bar $ cat hardlink this is foo /code/pre  More on symbolic links vs hard links: https://askubuntu.com/q/108771/562767  <comment363295> Does it have to be a linked copy?  I do roughly the same thing, but with OneDrive.  I just save directly to the OneDrive directory. <comment363332> Awesome, works perfectly. Good trick to know. Thanks. :D
