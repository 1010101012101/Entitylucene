How long does it take for Apple's AA battery charger to recharge? <body> I'm talking about the charger that comes with their new Bluetooth trackpad and keyboard.  If I put 2 empty batteries in it now, how long till they're full?  <answer29926> Mine usually seems to take about 3 hours for completely drained batteries.  <answer29932> Apple has said that it may take up to ifive hours/i to charge the batteries.  <answer29939> Usually 4 to 5 hours for me to recharge the 2 AA batteries.  Basically I recharge the batteries when its power is lower than 10%.
