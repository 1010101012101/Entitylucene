Determine the Mac’s RSA key fingerprint <body> When starting a codessh/code session to a remote Mac, I get a message like this:     The authenticity of host '201.33.2.107 (201.33.2.107)' can't be established.br /RSA key fingerprint is 5b:dc:2a:b4:cd:bf:e8:e3:8c:cd:c3:37:cf:8b:0c:ab.br /Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?    I know this "RSA key fingerprint" is a way to identify my remote Mac. Through local access or remote access (screen sharing) to that remote Mac I need to do something to determine if that is indeed the remote Mac’s "RSA key fingerprint" to be sure I'm not getting tricked by a man-in-the-middle hacker.  How do I determine a Mac’s RSA key fingerprint?  <comment246926> what is wrong with the command written in you referenced article? `ssh-keygen -lf /path/to/key.pub`
