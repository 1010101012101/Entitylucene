Mail app not retrieving old mail that was forwarded to a Gmail account (macOS Sierra) <body> I forward my university email to my personal Gmail account. I had the Mail app in Yosemite setup with just my Gmail account, and so I was able to access both my personal email messages and my forwarded university messages from one mailbox.  After upgrading to Sierra, my Gmail account is still sending and receiving messages through the Mail app, and all of the old Gmail messages that were sent directly to that account are still visible and searchable in the app. However, the old messages that were forwarded to my Gmail account are not visible or searchable. However, they are still present in Gmail's web client. Importantly, new messages to my university account do appear in the Mail app---it is only previously-forwarded messages that are missing.  I have tried "rebuilding" and "synchronizing" the mailbox, but neither does anything (I find it particularly troubling that I cannot rebuild the mailbox in Sierra).
