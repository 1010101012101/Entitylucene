How to save a .css file from TextEdit or Word? <body> I once read you could force the color of visited links in Safari by adding codea:visited { color: #6611cc !important; }/code in the .css file under emPreferences &lt; Advanced/em. In this way, it will turn every link you've clicked on purple and by so override the actual web design.  I like the idea but I tried to do so, but TextEdit or Word won't allow me to save the file. It wants to add code.rtf/code, code.webdesign/code or other extensions behind the .css.br How can I force to add this to the .css file?   <answer50057> Save the file then select the file in the Finder. With the file selected in Finder, Choose emGet Info/em (kbdCommand/kbd - kbdI/kbd).  In the emName &amp; Extenstion/em section, rename the file to emvisited.css/em. It will likely as if you want to change the extension from something like em.rft/em to em.css/em, click OK and your done. Move the file to wherever you want and select it from within Safari.  <answer50068> Although it doesn't directly answer your question, personally, I would use something like Textwrangler (free) instead, which is much better suited for jobs like this.      A general-purpose text editor for light-duty composition, data-file   editing (where the data files consist of plain [unstyled] text), and   manipulation of text-oriented data.   You won't run into any of the issues you described (including the fact that rtf is formatted text and what you want is plain text - although you can switch to plain text in TextEdit) and you can name the file whatever you wish. You'll also get syntax highlighting which helps too.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/tkK1k.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer50071> First, use TextEdit, don't use Word.  emBefore you save your document/em, select strongMake Plain Text/strong from the strongFormat/strong menu. (If the menu says strongMake Rich Text/strong then you are already in plain text mode.)  If you save the document now, you should be able to give it whatever extension you want. Since the file is plain text, you can be sure that TextEdit won't add any additional formatting instructions that will turn it into an incorrectly-formatted CSS file.  <answer239412> Just found this while searching for an answer myself - not sure if it's any help now - 4 yrs later  But you need to go to 'get info' on the text file And then remove ".txt" from the name &amp; extention Done!  <comment57366> I know this doesn’t directly answer your question, but if you’re familiar with the command line, you could use `nano`, `ed` or `vi` to edit and save the file. These binaries are all bundled with OS X. <comment57369> If the file was saved with an RTF extension, it probably contains RTF formatting codes, and therefore wouldn't work properly as a CSS file, even if you rename it. <comment57437> In TextEdit you should be able to save it as type text (.txt). There shouldn't be any formatting codes in that. Delete any that you find. If you need a free code editor try Text Wrangler from the makers of BBEdit. You can get it from the app store. <comment293798> No because the file will have formatting info in it as well as the text
