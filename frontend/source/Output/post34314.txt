Navigating back after following link in iBooks <body> I was reading a book in iBooks and clicked on a link in the text which took me to the index at the end of the book. Is there any way I can get back to where I was reading before I tapped on the link (without manually flipping through the pages/table of contents)?  There's no obvious back button that I can see.  I'm using iBooks 1.5, which I believe is currently the latest version.  <answer34315> If you touch the middle of the screen to show the buttons and controls, there should be a text link at the bottom left saying "Back to p. ###". It is beneath the dots and the slider to scroll quickly through the book. Touch it and you'll be back where you came from.  <comment39176> how did I miss that?  thanks! <comment39177> Thanks Lizzan, my wife's an avid iBook reader and didn't know this and she's glad to know if now. <comment39181> It *is* fairly hard to discover, took me a while too. Glad I could help! <comment178713> Does this work in the most recent versions of iOS too? I can't see the link to go back. <comment178715> @AlessandroCosentino It does show up for me at least. <comment178716> @Lizzan I can see it on a epub, but not on a pdf <comment178860> @AlessandroCosentino I'd never tried it with a pdf so I don't know if it ever worked, but you're right, it doesn't seem to show up with them.
