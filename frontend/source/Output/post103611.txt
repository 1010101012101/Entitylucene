Is it possible to buy an Apple product in the UK and return it in the US? <body> Is it possible to buy an Apple product, like an iPad mini, in the UK and return it in the US? And vice versa?  <answer103613> More reading on Apple discussions indicates that the warranties are not honored internationally for iPads and iPhones. If you buy somewhere and it breaks, you will likely have to send it back to the country of purchase. Apparently, this is because most countries have their own warranty laws.  <comment121928> This might be a good place to start: http://www.apple.com/legal/warranty/
