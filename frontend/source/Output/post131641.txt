Disk I/O error on a superdrive? <body> The hard disk of my late 2011 MacBook Pro 15" died and I replaced it with an SSD. I wanted to have more space, so I bought a 1 TB hard disk and put connected it instead the superdrive. The problem is that when I try to partition and format it I have tons of errors. Looking at the system.log I could see the kernel complaining of disk I/O errors.  Now, the crazy thing is that I took out the very same disk and put it on a SATA/USB adapter and the disk works just fine. I reconnected the superdrive and tried the dvd and, although it was working, I still could see loads of disk I/O errors. I even bought a new SATA3 cable, but it's still doing the same.  Is there a way to better know the cause of the error? Is there a way to know if it is the motherboard failing or else?  <comment154689> so you system is on SSD and your HDD is failing! how did you format the HDD? <comment154690> " so I bought a 1 TB hard disk and put connected it instead the superdrive" - what did you mean by this? <comment154691> It is possible that you might have damaged the connector end points (on the MB side) while removing or plugging in the connectors. <comment154692> Why dont you try using the 1TB drive in place of the SSD just to confirm whether it is a port issue? <comment154855> @Buscar웃: Yes, my HDD is failing... I couldn't format the HDD while it was on the Superdrive bay <comment154856> @BobbyAlexander: The HDD was installed on a bay adapter to put it instead of the Superdrive. I put it instead of the SSD and it works just fine. So it looks like the problem is either with the motherboard (or the connector, though they don't look damaged) or with the Superdrive bay. <comment154857> try running Apple Hardware test <comment154947> @Buscar웃 How can I do that?
