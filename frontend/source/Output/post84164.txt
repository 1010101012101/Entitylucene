Mail App Restarted Itself <body> I closed mail an hour ago, when I opened mail back again 10 minutes ago the mail app at reseted itself, there are no accounts anymore, no mails, no nothing.   I was wondering if there was any fast and easy way to restore all that ?  Since I know that my mails are still somewhere in   precode~/Library/Mail/V2 /code/pre  And that all the accounts are still in keychain, and I'm not using any TimeMachine at the moment.   I created a new account and interestingly enough my mail seem now to be located at   precode~/Library/Containers/com.apple.mail/data/Library/Mail/V2 /code/pre  By the way, no updates have been done, no modifications what so ever, I just closed Mail.   <answer84167> So basically, it seems that on OSX 10.8 mails are not longer stored in  precode~/Library/Mail /code/pre  but in   precode~/Library/Containers/com.apple.mail/data/Library/Mail/V2 /code/pre  If your mail app restart / restore itself unexpectedly simply copy the folder called "v2" from one location to the other and restart the Mail app.   Everything should be restored.   <comment96817> On my Mac, ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.mail/data/Library/Mail is an alias for ~/Library/Mail   So they are the 'same thing'. <comment96911> That make sense, However I've no idea why Mail restored itself like this.
