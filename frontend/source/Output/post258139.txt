How to recover photos from iPhone 7 deleted via Windows Explorer? <body> My mom deleted some photos from an iPhone 7.br She deleted them via Windows Explorer.br There is no backup as she took them just a few days ago.br Is it possible to recover them?  Thanks.  hr  iPhone spec: iOS 10.0.3  <answer258140> In short, no.  Recovering files deleted from an encrypted hardware device is generally considered emnot possible/em, especially as they didn't go through iOS Photos' own deletion system, which would have kept them for 30 days.
