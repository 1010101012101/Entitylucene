The only way to prevent that is to not give other users admin accounts. <comment317898> i want this disable from my self. i know there is way make something in sudoers file but i realy dont know that realy i need to do <comment317900> Maybe you're looking for something like [SelfControl](https://selfcontrolapp.com) - "SelfControl is a free and open-source application for Mac OS X that lets you block your own access to distracting websites, your mail servers, or anything else on the Internet. Just set a period of time to block for, add sites to your blacklist, and click "Start." Until that timer expires, you will be unable to access those sites--even if you restart your computer or delete the application." <comment317907> thanx for app but there is two problems 1. i can delete it 2. its not a permanent <comment317908> Did you read up about it? Deleting it does not disable its functionality, though yes, it times out. Timeout is adjustable [massively adjustable] - https://github.com/SelfControlApp/selfcontrol/wiki/Tweaking-Max-Block-Length-and-Block-Length-Interval <comment317943> ок i understand, thanx
