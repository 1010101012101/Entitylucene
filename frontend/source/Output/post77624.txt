After syncing laptop to iPad, photo drop down tab no longer visible with iTunes version 11.0.1 <body> After syncing my laptop (Windows XP) with my iPad and selecting my iPad under Devices on the left hand side, there is no photos heading any longer.  I have menu headings (tabs) for "Summary", "Info", "Apps", "Tones", "Music", "Movies" "TV programs", "Podcasts", and "Books" but just a blank where the photos tab used to be. Now I have no way of selecting albums to transfer photos from my laptop to my iPad.  How can I get the Photos tab to appear (again)?  <comment98820> I have the same problem - but with my iphone5. Did you find a resolution for your problem?
