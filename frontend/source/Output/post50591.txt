Can I upgrade MacOS X 10.4 to 10.7 Lion? <body> I want to upgrade my OS to a new level so that I can download Google Chrome. My computer is pretty old and is running Version 10.4.11. The Mac store won't let me download Lion because I need a higher version than I already have. Where can I find that intermediate version so that I can then upgrade to Lion?  <answer50592> You can buy Snow Leopard in the online Apple Store, install it and then upgrade to Lion via the Mac App Store.  <answer51169> Are you a MobileMe user? Then chances are that you get a free upgrade to Snow Leopard...  <comment57984> So you have a PPC machine? Lion is Intel only. <comment57985> Processor says 1.83 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo. <comment57986> Thank you! Do I have to order Snow Leopard by mail or is there a way to download it? <comment57987> Order by mail (or visit an Apple Retail Store if available in your area)
