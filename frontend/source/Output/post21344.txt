Restoring a Snow Leopard time capsule using Leopard DVD boot? possible? <body> So I have a time capsule of a few machines. The one i did last (Snow Leopard) doesn't seem to be showing in the list. I don't have a snow leopard DVD boot handy only Leopard. Is this why this isn't in the list?  <answer21404> Yes - I'm afraid this is the case. You will need to find a Snow Leopard DVD or Lion recovery HD/USB to restore your files.  Since this DVD used to come with all Macs, you should be able to find a friend who has one. Otherwise, try the Apple store or AppleCare to order a replacement Snow Leopard DVD.   <comment23474> Install DVDs that come with machines are machine-specific, down to the build. Make sure that if you borrow a DVD from another machine that it's identical to yours.
