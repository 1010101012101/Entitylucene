Is it possible to see the content of the "Send to Apple" crash report after closing it? <body> My app crashed, and I just took a screenshot before closing the window.br Instead of the screenshot, I really should have copied the whole log...br I can't reproduce the crash, and really want to see the rest of the details.  strongQUESTION:/strong Can I get the full details of the Problem Report, even after I have closed it?  Or is it too late, and it is lost forever?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/XSozh.png" alt="Send to Apple"  <answer182921> Those informations are stored in strongConsole/strong application under emDiagnostic and Usage Information/em.
