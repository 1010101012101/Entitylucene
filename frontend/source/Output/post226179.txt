Prevent Safari from exiting fullscreen? <body> I'm using a Mac mini for a dashboard display, but nearly every day Safari exits fullscreen mode (Well, it it visually appears to do so).  To bring it back into fullscreen I just need to move the mouse.  Any tips on how to fix it ?  <comment274634> Disconnect your mouse. <comment274656> Hi, the mouse and keyboard isn't connected. I have a logitech k400, so when it falls out of fullscreen ... I walk about 50 meters to the screen and turn on the keyboard ... moving the pad slightly to correct the issue and turn the keyboard off again. :-) <comment274680> To me it looks like your nice keyboard or probably some other source send sort of signal which Mac mini takes for slight cursor movement up. As soon as it reaches top line, your menu appears and you have to move it away in order to restore full Full screen mode. Can you check if wired keyboard will do the same with Bluetooth turned off? <comment274755> I can´t rule out some different signal source. But the pointer is not at the top when it happens, I guess I could try pulling out the unified receiver. I noticed a server running in the terminal had terminated with signal 6, not sure if that might have caused some OS-response. I guess I´ll have to experiment a bit :-)
