Adding an IMAP account without saving emails locally in Mail 7.0 <body> I want to add an IMAP-account to Mail.  Since I've used this account for many years, it contains thousands of emails and archive folders, and I really don't want to fill up my SSD with that.  I couldn't find a way to limit synchronization to a certain time frame or specific folders (I guess that's not really the concept of IMAP).  I found out that there used to be a "Don't keep copies of any messages" checkbox in Mail's preferences, so emails would not be stored locally. I would be completely satisfied with this solution, however, in Mail 7.0 this option was removed (which I don't understand, seems like such a basic function to me).   Does anybody have a solution for this?   Suggestions for alternative software are welcome as well (in case there's really no way to use Apple Mail without downloading my entire mail history).  <answer110789> Please check this question.  One way to save space is to exclude attachments from download. I think you have to uncheck: Account-Advanced-Automatically download all attachments  <comment130438> [This should have been one comment, but it won't let me edit the first one anymore]  I already excluded attachments, but still it takes a lot of space.  Permanently deleting older messages (as suggested in your link) is no solution since I want to keep them on the server. Due to IMAP synchronization, every email I delete on my computer is deleted on the server as well.
