Mac App store apps use a different user ID so I can't install updates <body> The OSX Mavericks machine that I use for work has Keynote, Pages, and Numbers installed under the company's Apple ID. (It was purchased in December 2012, pre-Mavericks. It was recently wiped and replaced with an image that I'm guessing already had iWork installed.)  Every day the App store bugs me about installing updates. When I try to do so, I'm prompted for the password, which I don't have. And it won't let me sign in under my personal Apple ID.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/SLGsl.png" alt="&quot;Sign in to download from the Apple Store&quot; prompt. Apple ID field is pre-filled with servicedesk@my-employer.com&quot; and disabled. Password field is empty."  Is there a way for the helpdesk to transfer these apps to my personal account? Or any other way for me to get the updates aside from opening a helpdesk ticket and waiting patiently?  <answer145364> Don't install the downgrade from iWork '09  <answer145372> You have to re-buy it with your own account. I don't think there is any way to transfer purchases.  <comment171314> If this was meant to answer the question, it's missing the important part. <comment171326> Look in your keychain, the password might be there.
