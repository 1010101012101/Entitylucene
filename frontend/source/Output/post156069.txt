Yosemite Calendar 24 hour clock New Event <body> Since upgrading to Yosemite, I can't enter a New Event in Calendar using the 24 hour clock. If I try to enter the start or end time as 14:00, it enters the 1 and then beeps at me.    Calendar does display events in 24 hour format, I just can't create a new event using it. I've check the calendar and Mac settings and they all appear correct.   <answer156077> I do not have Yosemite but on Mavericks you can set it up as follows:  Open system preferences Languages and Regions  Click on the 24 Hour time format.  That should change the time format in Calender.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/p8YiS.jpg" alt="time"  I can enter any time (as 2 digits)  Let me know if it works in Yosemite.  <answer173557> There does seem to be a problem here. My computer was showing a 12 hour clock plus am or pm. Changing this to 24 hour clock in the date and time section of system preferences didn't work. After some digging I found that the language and region section of system preferences also has a 24 hour clock setting option. And this one works. Looks like a little buglet for Apple to fix  <comment183579> 24 h as AM/PM or European stile ? <comment183583> hh:mm, for example 01:23 for 1:23am or 13:23 for 1:23pm <comment183585> *smacks forehead* Thanks. That worked.My clock displayed it correctly and I swore I checked all the settings. It worked in Mavericks and stopped working when I upgraded to Yosemite. I have no idea what changed. <comment183587> Don't smack your self, just accept the answer and move on :)
