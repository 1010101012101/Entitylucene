nfs mount fails from Finder though works from command line <body> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/IDMpw.jpg" alt="NFS mounting from OSX"  Using Finder's Connect to Server... option with codenfs://vers=4;nuc.local/mnt/tb/code I'm unable to mount my nfs server. However from the command line it works just fine.  Ideally I want the MBP to boot and mount the share when at home automatically. However I'm struggling to understand auto mounting on MacOSX 10.10.4. Can someone please additionally illustrate IIUC a code/etc/auto_master/code example?  nuc.local's code/etc/exports/code is:  precode/mnt/tb     *(rw,insecure,async,no_subtree_check,no_root_squash) /code/pre  <answer197545> To properly connect to NFSv4 share with the Finder use codenfs://vers=4,nuc.local/mnt/tb/code instead of codenfs://vers=4;nuc.local/mnt/tb/code.  To mount a share automatically do the following:  ul liCreate a folder (e.g. /Users/youruser/mnt) as the future mount point/li liOpen Terminal and enter codesudo nano /etc/auto_master/code/li liAdd a line with the following content:      /Users/youruser/mnt /etc/auto_nfs     Please check, that the file contains a trailing empty line!br Save the edit with kbdctrl/kbdkbdO/kbd and quit nano with kbdctrl/kbdkbdX/kbd/li lienter codesudo touch /etc/auto_nfs/code to create a new file with the name "auto_nfs"./li liEnter  codesudo nano /etc/auto_nfs/code to edit the file./li liAdd a line with the following content:     DirectoryName -fstype=nfs,other_options... exported_share   Please check, that the file contains a trailing empty line!br Save the edit with kbdctrl/kbdkbdO/kbd and quit nano with kbdctrl/kbdkbdX/kbd/li liEnter codesudo automount -vc/code to mount the new NFS-share immediately./li /ul  Example (mount an external iTunes Media folder to local /Users/someusername/mnt):  auto_master:  precode# # Automounter master map # +auto_master        # Use directory service /net            -hosts      -nobrowse,hidefromfinder,nosuid /home           auto_home   -nobrowse,hidefromfinder /Network/Servers    -fstab /-          -static /Users/someusername/mnt /etc/auto_nfs /code/pre  auto_nfs:  precodeiTunesMedia -fstype=nfs,rw,bg,hard,intr,tcp 192.168.2.11:/volume1/iTunesMedia /code/pre  Tested with 10.7.5 and 10.10.4  hr  After some extended testing with a virtual ArchLinux VM as NFS-server and Mac OS 10.10.4 as the NFS-client I come to the following conclusion:    The Finder probably has a bug connecting to NFSv4-only NFS-servers (ArchLinux). So if you have disabled NFSv2/NFSv3 in /etc/conf.d/nfs-server.conf you won't be able to connect to the NFS-Share with the Finder.    You will be able to connect to it with codemount_nfs options server.local:/share /destination../code or NFS Manager though.  If you enable NFSv2/NFSv3 you will be able to connect to the share with the Finder if you use the full path (as defined in exports) to the share: codenfs://vers=4,server.local/path/to/share/code.  <answer280685> From exports(5) - Linux man page     secure   This option requires that requests originate on an Internet port less than IPPORT_RESERVED (1024). This option is on by default. To turn it off, specify insecure.   so you must use codeinsecure/code to be able to mount a nfs share under non root user.  sample line from /etc/exports file  code/home/bogdan 192.168.1.10(rw,insecure,all_squash,anonuid=501,anongid=1000)/code  <comment236300> I tried your automounter suggestion and I keep just getting: "NFS server nuc.local not responding". I tried replacing it with it's IP address. No dice.

ArchLinux? <comment236478> That's correct, Archlinux. <comment236508> @hendry please cite the relevant parts of /etc/exports and /etc/fstab on your ArchLinux server in your question. <comment236518> I thought I mentioned it in the video earlier. Thanks again for taking a look!
