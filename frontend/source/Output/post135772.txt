Email verification not coming <body> I have signed up with a .edu.pk domain and waiting for email verification, but it's been hours since I haven't gotten it. Is there any issue with .edu.pk and apple?  <answer135774> Apple have no special conditions for .edu.pk, so it should work. Try the usual suspects:  ul liCheck your spam folder/li liCheck your email rules/li liCheck your mail server isn't rejecting the email/li /ul  If all else fails, try resetting your password at iforgot.apple.com.  <comment160961> Can you log in via the [iCloud.com](http://icloud.com) website? <comment160966> @Lukas no, it says you have to login using OSX or iOS device.
