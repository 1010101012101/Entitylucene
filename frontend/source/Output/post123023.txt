Terminal freezes because of corrupt file <body> I wanted to edit the httpd.conf from apache2. I wanted to uncomment the php5 load line so it gets included.  I started the terminal and used codesudo nano /etc/apache2/httpd.conf/code to edit the file and saved with ctrl + o.  At that moment the terminal started to freeze and i could not confirm with pressing enter.  I restarted the terminal and did sudo nano again to see that the file is broken. The terminal freezed again not even opening the file. I could not even use ctrl + c to abort the operation.  After that i tried to remove the file with codesudo rm /etc/apache2/httpd.conf/code which did not work either (freeze again).  My OS is OS X Mavericks 10.9.1 on a mac mini.  edit: Result of codesudo ls -al /etc/apache2/code  precodetestuser:~ testuser$ sudo ls -al /etc/apache2 total 200 drwxr-xr-x   12 root  wheel    408 27 Jan 13:01 . drwxr-xr-x  102 root  wheel   3468  4 Mär 10:22 .. -rw-r--r--@   1 root  wheel   6148  4 Apr  2013 .DS_Store drwxr-xr-x   14 root  wheel    476 27 Jan 13:01 extra -rw-r--r--    1 root  wheel  18121  4 Mär 10:40 httpd.conf -rw-r--r--    1 501   staff  18043 20 Jun  2013 httpd.conf.pre-update -rw-r--r--    1 501   staff  18043 16 Sep 16:04 httpd.conf~previous -rw-r--r--    1 root  wheel  12958 27 Jan 12:41 magic -rw-r--r--    1 root  wheel  53258 27 Jan 12:41 mime.types drwxr-xr-x    4 root  wheel    136 25 Aug  2013 original drwxr-xr-x    4 root  wheel    136 27 Jan 12:58 other drwxr-xr-x    4 root  wheel    136 27 Jan 12:58 users /code/pre  Is there any way i can delete that file?  <comment143610> Did you kill the apache2 process already? <comment143611> i did use `sudo apachectl stop` to close apache. i will try -k now <comment143612> Maybe you should make a backup copy first (`sudo cp /etc/apache2/httpd.conf /etc/apache2/httpd.conf.20140304`). And simply removing a file shouldn't freeze Terminal/bash so I'm wondering whether there is something else wrong here. Can you still `sudo cat /etc/apache2/httpd.conf`? <comment143613> @patrix i already tried using cat and it also freezed ;). i have a default config ´/etc/apache2/httpd.conf~previous´ that i tried cping to ´/etc/apache2/httpd.conf´ without success. <comment143614> Are you sure that the "freeze" is not just the password prompt? Can you add the result of `sudo ls -al /etc/apache2` to the question (just edit the question to add text)? <comment143615> i added the result. additionally i did use the correct password and i do not get any feedback after that. <comment143616> @Robuust nothing changed with `sudo apachectl -k stop`
