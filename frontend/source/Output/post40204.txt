Link displacement <body> I have some links on a page. When I click (tap) one of these links, the gray box which shows where I tap is misplaced. It seems that the link is rendered higher than it should.  Is this a known Mobile Safari issue?  <comment45473> What do you mean by "I have some links on a page"? Is it an HTML file you're displaying in Safari, or have you published it yourself, or is it on a site you have no control over? In any case, in what context are you viewing these links? <comment45556> This sounds like an issue with your web page's CSS and/or how the Webkit rendering engine handles your page's CSS. In either case, I'd recommend this question be on ux.stackexchange.com <comment45853> Can you give an example of a web page? (so that others can test it out as well) <comment46759> Sorry for the delay. <comment46760> (ok don't hit return when commenting). The page is built up using soap as is a site where you have to pay for a subscription. I'm sorry but I cannot spread log in credetials for the site. I was wondering if anyone have have similar problems. You can see a image here: http://img403.imageshack.us/img403/7691/safarilinkoffseterrorwi.png
