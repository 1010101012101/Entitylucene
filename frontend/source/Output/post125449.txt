MiniDisplayPort to HDMI adapter not working <body> OK, so I bought an MiniDisplayPort to HDMI adapter off dx.com and it doesn't work, before I angrily demand a refund I want to know whether there is anything I can do to get this to work.  I have a 2013 13inch MacBook Air   I have heard that I probably should have either got an official apple (sponsored) one (for 40 dollars) or instead of Mini DisplayPort to HDMI get a Mini DisplayPort to DVI and then a DVI to HDMI adapter.  <answer125478> It could be the adapter?  I bought mine at Monoprice for $6.82!  Notice it says with Audio support in the title.     Mini DisplayPort to HDMIÂ® Adapter w/ Audio Support Product Number:   5311   and it works purfectly on my MBA with the Sharp TV.  It is not worth for $4, but if you must, look in your about this mac, or your System Utility display if it shows the monitor/tv you just connected.  <comment146813> There are a number of MiniDP adapters that work out there, including Moshi (close to apple price) and Monoprice (low end) that I've had experience with, and I would trust the reviews of those in between (Kanex, I think). Do you mean it will output neither video nor audio? If it's just an audio issue, go to system preferences  Sound, and make sure **output** is set correctly. Some adapter/mac combos don't auto switch the audio-out on HDMI adapters. <comment146822> have you tried switching hdmi cables? <comment146956> I will ask for a refund on my current cable and purchase this one, thanks for the cheap product recommendation.
