Built-in Ethernet not working <body> I am using a 13" MacBook Pro (mid 2012) and I have upgraded to OS X 10.11 El Capitan a while ago. Last night before going to bed I switched off the computer. Since this working the built-in Ethernet that was working fine does not seem to work anymore. I have deleted the network interfaces and rebooted the system, but still it does not show up in the network preferences. Is there a fix? What should I do?  <answer229698> For a very short window (a few hours) - Apple pushed an update that disabled the ethernet driver for some of the Macs.  If you can connect to WiFi and run this command:  precodesudo softwareupdate --background /code/pre  That would fix the issue if yours failed to operate due to this bug.
