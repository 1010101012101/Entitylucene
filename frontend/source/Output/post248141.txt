Limit iCloud upload to certain times of day? <body> Is there any way to set iCloud backup / photo sync so it only uploads within certain times of day?  We have an up-to-date iPad Pro that periodically saturates our home internet connection (such that we can't surf the web). When it happens, if we put the iPad in Airplane mode, the problem goes away. We've done our best at differential diagnosis, turning off iCloud backup and turning it back on, etc., but since iOS doesn't always resume its uploading when we turn it back on (we haven't worked out the rules yet), it's hard to be sure. But we're fairly certain we've isolated it to iCloud  Backup and/or iCloud  Photos. As opposed to, say, some kind of malware.  The thing is, we don't emwant/em to turn those off&nbsp;&mdash; backups are good!&nbsp;&mdash; but we need them to only happen at night when we're not otherwise using our connection.  Obviously we could just turn them off during the day and turn them on at night, but A)&nbsp;That's a pain, and B)&nbsp;When you turn some things off (like photo sharing), its says it'll delete content from the device, which is less than ideal.  hr  em(We've explored the saturation issue with our ISP, to the extent feasible given ISP call centres, without much success. But fundamentally, we just want these backups at night.)/em  <comment307574> Only plug the iPad in at night? Use iTunes for backups instead?
