Honda Fit's iPod car plug: what cable is this? <body> My car, a Japanese Honda Fit, has a radio with a plug marked strongiPod/strong on the cover but I have no idea what type of cable/plug I must use to connect it with my iPod.  Can anyone tell based on the picture? the right port  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/JrF12.jpg" alt="Car radio, iPod plug"  <answer196642> You are probably looking for this kind of cable/adapter :  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QC5DS.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  on Amazon  hr  Previous answer :   The Left AUX Jack. It's for a "simple" jack 3.5 cable.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QRAgf.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <comment234936> Thank you for your answer but i meant the right port. <comment234938> i tried again and again but its all in Japanese so i couldnt.. <comment234940> i couldnt find one. this cars comes as used cars from Japan so everything is in Japanese. not just the manual <comment234943> Do you have a name of that adapter cable? maybe i can order one <comment234944> As this is an issue with a Honda vehicle not really an Apple issue I'd suggest you go to a Honda Dealership to resolve your Honda vehicle issue. <comment234946> If I were to guess, I would say this is a Honda-specific form of Apple's 30-pin dock connector. Is suggest posting in other forums like [/r/honda]:(reddit.com/r/homda), as you'll be more likely to come across someone who's had similar problems. <comment234953> I updated my answer ! <comment235165> thank you Matthieu. this seams an adapter to be connected to the back ports of the radio. for the frond i only need an adapter. thanks again :)
