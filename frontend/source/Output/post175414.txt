iMessage notifications after wake Yosemite <body> Is there a way to not get old iMessages/SMS notifications that I've already dealt with on my iPhone after I wake up my Mac? It is rather annoying, they are not new messages so why are they behaving as such?  <comment206810> Are you on Yosemite and iOS 8? I don't think they queue for me and when I read a message on one device it disappears (even from the lock screen) from both others as being unread. <comment206811> Yep, iOS 8 and Yosemite... iOS 7 doesn't support continuity <comment206812> Ok. Do they appear when the Mac is locked, or do they roll in, in rapid succession immediately after logging in? <comment206813> Immediately after login - when I open my MacBook. <comment206824> (For the record, iOS 7 doesn't support Continuity but that feature is unrelated to this. Messages on Mac and iMessage on devices have had cross-platform read syncing since at least iOS 7, possibly earlier.) <comment206825> Sms relay requires continuity... <comment206828> Fair enough, but the underlying issue is read syncing, unless this is ONLY occurring with SMS and not iMessage messages. <comment206862> Just curious if you still get have the problem if you go to Sys Prefs - Notifications - Message - *(uncheck)* "Show in Notification Center". In this case, I believe your options are quite limited.
