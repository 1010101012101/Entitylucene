Equivalent of Ubuntu’s write-mime-multipart? <body> I would like to generate a multipart mime-encoded document for use as user data on EC2 instances.  On Ubuntu, one is supposed to use codewrite-mime-multipart/code to do this, as per these instructions.  Does anyone know what would the OSX command-line equivalent be?  Thanks!  <answer125501> I’ve found a simple solution. Ubuntu’s codewrite-mime-multipart/code command is actually a Python script, available here (or on an Ubuntu distro I guess).  I’ve simply downloaded this script to use. Perhaps not ideal with respect to version control, but okay for a simple script I think.  Better approaches welcome!  <comment255091> Thanks! This is great. I changed it to #!/usr/local/bin/python (instead of specifying v2.6) and installed the script to /usr/local/Cellar/write-mime-multipart, chmod +x and symlink it into /usr/local/bin to be more like brew. Worked fine. You can also run a Docker instance of Ubuntu to get it. ;-) <comment255154> Cheers. Sounds like a good approach!
