It drains your battery much faster than using Safari.   Close Firefox then use some Apple products and run them until your battery is very low. Then record that time. If that time is less than advertised then that is when you have a problem with the battery.   There is no issue with your computer if your battery is drained and you are using thrid party apps.  <comment285017> Do you know any other browsers that don't use as much energy?
