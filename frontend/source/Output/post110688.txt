How do you add the resolution icon to the top menu bar on the Macbook Pro (retina) <body> I just got a MacBook pro retina to replace my old Macbook Pro. I no longer see the screen resolution icon at the top icon bar, (where the Wifi, audio, Backup, etc Icons reside)  Do you know how to add that?  <answer110700> There is no method built-in to Mavericks (the OS you are likely using on a new Retina MacBook Pro). However, there are 3rd party utilities to add this functionality.  Try QuickRes. You may want the paid version rather than the free in order to select all the resolutions your machine offers...
