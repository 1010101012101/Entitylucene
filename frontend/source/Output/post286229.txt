How do I use a Saved Search as a Desktop Background Folder? <body> I want to use my movie library's Posters and Artwork as a cycling background. The problem is movie managers place each movie in a folder, and then a subfolder for artwork (jpgs). And choosing a Folder for Backgrounds is not recursive.  In Finder I ran a search for ‘type:image’ then saved that as "Movies.savedSearch".  Then in the Desktop &amp; Screen Saver preference pane, I tried to add that folder, but it won't drag-n-drop, and if I hit the + to select the folder, it is greyed out / not accessible.  Any idea how to get this to work?  <answer286240> This isn't possible. Smart folders are saved as .savedSearch and aren't real folders, so you can't add them to lists requiring folders.  <comment361078> If I had more rep I would have created a "savedSearch" tag. <comment361104> You're looking for the [smart-folders] tag. <comment361106> Hm. Folder aliases work. I figured a Smart Folder would, too. Any workaround for this... short of making an alias of every jpg into a real folder? <comment361107> @Jules Making an alias of each jpg might not be too bad with a script which you could run in the background or run on demand.
