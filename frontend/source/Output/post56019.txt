Configure Router with Mac <body> My router's IP address is code192.168.1.245/code. I tried to access it but without success, because my WIFI address is code10.0.1.10/code and my Ethernet address (via the Thunderbolt port) is code169.254.xxx.xxx/code.  How can I configure my router without having internal IP addresses?  <answer56020> Settings - Network - Thunderbold Ethernet - Configure IPv4: Manually: 192.168.1.20. After this I am able to access the router.   <comment64300> How do you know your router's IP address if you can't connect to it? <comment64301> Because I once configured it so on a Windows PC. <comment64302> Where does your Mac get the IP address from? If the router acts as a DNS server the Mac should pick up a "proper" address automatically. <comment64306> Alternatively, you could have changed the service order to place the Wi-Fi connection (which looks like it would have worked) above the self-assigned address. This sort of thing usually is a temporary issue unless your router has access controls based on MAC addresses which would explain why it wouldn't issue an IP address to a new network endpoint.
