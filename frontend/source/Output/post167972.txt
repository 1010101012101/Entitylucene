Remove Search.strtpoint.com Search Engine <body> I, perhaps unwisely, installed codeiFunBox/code based on an article in a respected Computer Magazine codeAPC/code.  This appears to have installed a Search Engine in my browsers. It was easy to remove from codeFirefox/code, but I can't seem to delete codesearch.strtpoint.com/code from Chrome.  Safari now crashes whenever I run it.  Any ideas on how to fix these problems?  hr  EDIT I have managed to fix Chrome.  <answer167986> I think I have solved my problem.  I got an exception from codeSafari/code which suggested "External Modification Warnings: Thread creation by external task."  I found many references on the web (most for Windows) and some suggesting going to codeSafari\Preferences\Extensions/code and turning off. I wasn't even going to try those which suggested I install yet another app from the web.  Seeing as I could not even start codeSafari/code the above was not useful. I could start codeSafari/code in Safe mode, but there was nothing there - possibly because when it originally wanted access to all my private data I refused.   codeActivity Monitor/code showed an codeInstaller/code and this had code~/Library/Application Support/com.genieoinnovation.Installer/Completer.app/Contents/MacOS/Installer/code open. I deleted this directory. Unfortunately this did not fix the problem.  I tried @Buscar웃 suggestion, but this only found references to old preferences in Firefox and Chrome, which I had already fixed.  I then tried codesudo mdfind com.genieoinnovation/code and found the following.  precode/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.genieoinnovation.macextension.client.plist /Library/PrivilegedHelperTools/com.genieoinnovation.macextension.client /Library/Frameworks/GenieoExtra.framework/Contents/Library/LaunchServices/com.genieoinnovation.macextension.client /Library/Frameworks/GenieoExtra.framework/Contents/Resources/en.lproj/com.genieoinnovation.macextension.plist /Library/LaunchAgents/com.genieoinnovation.macextension.plist  /Users/ian/Library/Application Support/com.genieoinnovation.Installer/Completer.app/Contents/MacOS/Installer /code/pre  Deleting all these seems to have resolved the issue.  <answer168125> Paste "chrome://extensions/" to the Chrome address bar and hit Enter on the keyboard. Scroll down the page, look at Search  Manage search engines. Then you will find search.strtpoint.com.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zuhIm.png" alt="enter image description here"   Then click Show advanced settings link and click Reset browser settings button. The two tips may help you. If search.strtpoint.com comes back again, this means that the browser hijacker makes modifications to registry keys.
