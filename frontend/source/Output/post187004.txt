Run TeamViewer on demand, instead of at startup <body> I installed TeamViewer Host (v. 10.0) for making remote connections back to my Mac. It loads on start up automatically, and there doesn’t seem to be a preference to disable that behavior*. TeamViewer also does not appear in the “Login Items” system preference pane. I only need TeamViewer periodically, so for performance and security, I’d rather run it manually.  I see three related processes in Activity Monitor: codeTeamViewer Host/code, codeTeamViewer_Desktop/code, and codeTeamViewer_Service/code. I don’t just want to stop the UI / menu item from showing on startup, I want to stop all of these from loading.  How can I disable them from running at login, and then how should I run them when I want them?  sub* The “Show Computers &amp; Contacts on startup” preference under Advanced isn’t it./sub  <answer187024> The TeamViewer Host app is :      TeamViewer Host is running as a system service and is used for 24/7   access to remote computers, including login/logout and remote reboot -   optimized for server maintenance or home-office access.   So it is intended to be running 24/7.  But if you want to disable it:  Find it using the codelaunchctl list/code in Terminal  To stop it use codesudo launchctl remove label_of_program_to_remove/code  The label_of_program_to_remove is the one you found in the launchctl list.  That will stop the current session.  To stop it from coming back again next time you reboot, move the com.teamviewer files from either /Library/LaunchAgents/ or your ~/Library/LaunchAgents/ folder. Instead of removing them outright, you just move them out of the LaunchAgents to someplace else.  <answer187203> Building on Buscar’s answer, for OS X 10.10 Yosemite:  ul liTo disable: codesudo launchctl disable system/com.teamviewer.service/code/li liTo re-enable: codesudo launchctl enable system/com.teamviewer.service/code, and restart./li /ul  It seems like codelaunchctl/code is under active development by Apple, and has changed substantially in Yosemite (10.10). See codeman launchctl/code. They still offer ‘legacy' commands like coderemove/code, but caution, “subcommands from the previous implementation of launchd are generally available, though some may be unimplemented.”  <answer192750> It is in Preferences in V 10.0.43320 which I downloaded and installed yesterday.  Go to Preferences  General and there untick 'Start TeamViewer with System'.  <answer243645> A simpler alternative is to install the standard Team Viewer version, not the Host one. The standard version has the options you seek.  <comment220995> Keep in mind that disabling the support applications from running at startup will impact the ability of TeamViewer to run at all. It may not be possible to reverse the changes without reinstalling TeamViewer. (I say this as someone who recently expended significant time getting TeamViewer off my system.) <comment271429> the man page of `launchctl` in 10.10 and even 10.11 is identical with the linked content, which is for 10.9. <comment271443> @Raptor I see substantially different content. The 10.9 page is about 1,400 words and last revised 1 May, 2009, versus the 10.11 page at 3,900 words and last revised 1 October, 2014. <comment370462> Unfortunately this is not working for the current version of TeamViewer host because that is no longer an option in the preferences (the jerks).
