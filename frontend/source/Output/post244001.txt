How to uninstall Git from the command shell? <body> I currently have installed   precodegit --version git version 2.7.4 (Apple Git-66) /code/pre  At this path  precodewhich git /usr/bin/git /code/pre  In a previous answer  How to uninstall Git?  it was suggested to run the codeuninstall.sh/code, but if I run codecd /usr/bin/git/code I get code-bash: cd: /usr/bin/git: Not a directory/code.  Below I copied the output of codels -l/code on the directory codeusr/bin/code (only the files that look to me as related to git for reasons of space).  precode    -rwxr-xr-x   1 root   wheel     18176 Mar 12 09:08 git     -rwxr-xr-x   1 root   wheel     18208 Mar 12 09:08 git-cvsserver     -rwxr-xr-x   1 root   wheel     18208 Mar 12 09:08 git-receive-pack     -rwxr-xr-x   1 root   wheel     18192 Mar 12 09:08 git-shell     -rwxr-xr-x   1 root   wheel     18208 Mar 12 09:08 git-upload-archive     -rwxr-xr-x   1 root   wheel     18208 Mar 12 09:08 git-upload-pack /code/pre  How do I uninstall git? I am trying to strongupdate to a newer version/strong, the installer runs successfully, but when I run codegit --version/code I still get the older version. Thus I was thinking to uninstall git and reinstall from scratch, not sure if this is the right approach tho.  <answer244041> strongDo not uninstall Apple-distributed Git./strong You can leave it as it is and run another version by having it in a directory earlier in codePATH/code environment variable.  The easiest way to install another version on OS X would be to use Homebrew packet manager.  After installing it, you can run:  precodebrew install git /code/pre  Homebrew (codebrew/code) will take care of all dependencies and configure the latest Git version, however there is still a chance it will find a setting it cannot resolve automatically, so read what Homebrew says at the end.  Packages installed with codebrew/code do not interfere with system-preinstalled packages. It installs packages under code/usr/local/Cellar/code directory and puts executables in code/usr/local/bin/code, so you just have to keep it in codePATH/code variable in before code/usr/bin/code.  <comment300569> `cd /usr/bin` then `ls -l` and post results please? <comment300570> @emotality Thanks, I've added it. Let me know if you need anything else. <comment300572> Which answer suggested removing it? It needs to be heavily down voted as it is not a good idea.and you should not install git in /usr/bin/git (in fact doing that is quite difficult so how did you manage it) <comment300578> If the question you saw was http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/146503/how-to-uninstall-git?rq=1 note that that git us not in /usr/bin/git and there is a directory which in your case you have apple's got and there is not git directory <comment300614> @Mark I forgot to add the link, but that's exactly the question I am referring to. I am not sure why I have the wrong directory, it is possible that updating to El Capitan might have changed something in the git location? Anyway, given I have git in the wrong directory I am not sure I understand your recommendation on how to fix it. <comment300637> Ok, where do you get new version from? Maybe Homebrew? <comment300638> The `/usr/bin/git*` files are a default part of OS X and there is not an uninstaller for the OS X default version of `git`. <comment300641> @techraf from here https://git-scm.com/download/mac <comment300655> @techraf Thanks it worked like a charm, I am not sure this is strictly an answer to my original question, but it's actually what I needed.
