Is it possible to an individual developer to invite another developer to manage apps on iTunes Connect? <body> I developed an application for my friend who has an individual developer registration, I have got a simple developer registration without individual enrollment.   Is it possible to invite me at the Apple App Store to manage this application? or we need a company registration?  <answer96277> Only strongCompany / Organization/strong accounts can add additional developers to its team. As stated under the Enrollment Selection page, in the emIndividual/em account section:     strongIndividual Development Only/strong      You are the only one allowed access to program resources.   <answer96281> Whilst @Thecafremo's answer is true for program resources, to strongmanage apps/strong as OP stated, strongyou can add users to access iTunes Connect without needing a company account/strong.  Simply go to iTunes Connect → Manage Users → iTunes Connect User → Add New User.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/58pty.png" alt="iTunes Connect Add New User"  <comment113028> Thanks, I think I will try this, I never heard about this app and I'm curious, thanks again :) <comment113041> This is not entirely true with regards to *managing apps*, **it is possible** on a Individual account; see my answer… <comment322708> This is inconvenient if you want to debug stuff in CloudKit Dashboard with another user account.
