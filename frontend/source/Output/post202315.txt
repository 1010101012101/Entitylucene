Word damaged files after hard disk clone <body> I tried to clone a hard drive to a new SSD. Something went wrong, and the old hard drive wouldn't work with me and was now called disk2s2. The new SSD seemed to have all the data, but wouldn't boot. I made a new install and transferred the files and folders.   All the Word files seems to have been corrupted. When I try to open a Word file it says, that the file has been damaged and I can try to open and repair it, but it doesn't work.  Has anyone got a good idea how to solve this?   Hoping for some help,  Christoffer  <comment244038> How did you try to clone it?  Do you know what went wrong? (logs) <comment244322> I used a Sandisk Hard drive cloner for the task - so no logs?.. I am not exactly sure of where the problem occurred...
