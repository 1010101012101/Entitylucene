Migration doesn't recognize macOS server (Miniserver) <body> I have a small office network with 8 Mac Minis and some Macbook pros that are all connected to a Mac Mini server. All macs are backed up via Time machine to a Large HD connected to and shared by the server.   I'd never needed to RESTORE files with this setup.   I now have to migrate one backup to a new Mac but keep getting a message that "connection to server "miniserver.local" has failed. I get the exact same message if I use recovery (although the backup disk does appear in the list in both cases. What am I doing wrong?  Please help! ;-)
