How can I reset iPhone camera roll to IMG_0001.jpg? <body> I really want to reset the iPhone camera roll to photo IMG_0001.jpg. I have tried to do it with Image Capure, iExplorer and PhoneView, but any of them did not work at all. Is there a way to clear previous history saved on iPhone (when I take picture, my camera roll starts with IMG_0002.jpg) and to make camera roll to be reset without needing to erase all content and settings?  <answer94871> At the risk of you having done the steps, here is how it worked in the past using PhoneView:  ol liPower off the phone./li liConnect to USB and let it start (this way the camera app and others are not accessing the camera roll)./li liLaunch PhoneView and in the settings turn on strongShow Entire Disk/strong (Advanced Disk Mode)/li liDelete all pictures, files, folders from inside DCIM _(such as .MISC and 100APPLE, 101APPLE, etc... leaving just the DCIM folder empty)./li liEdit the PhotoData  MISC  DCIM_APPLE.plist file to set things to 0000 and 100 as desired in the xml file./li liDisconnect the USB and power down the phone, never once tapping on any apps while you shuffled things under the OS and the Camera app./li liPower on the phone and take a picture.        DCIMLastDirectoryNumber     100     DCIMLastFileNumber     251  /li /ol  <comment110793> Can we presume you don't want to restore the device entirely? <comment110794> Also, what happened when you edited the file listed here? You just change the number to be 0000. http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/88287/5472 <comment110796> yes I do not want to restore the device entirely, also when I edited the file listed there, it did not work at all. The number was still 2 in my case. <comment110822> when I edited with iexplorer, it says saved but when I take a picture, the name of the picture is still IMG_0002 not IMG_0001. <comment110861> Hmm - that's odd since if you have deleted all the pictures and also written the 0000 value to the plist file, the camera app should either start with IMG_0000 or IMG_0001. Perhaps you need to list the steps you performed (just pick one of the tools) so that maybe we can see you are skipping a step in the process. <comment111204> maybe because I used with demo version of iexplorer? the step I followed was exactly same as the link. I connected my phone with the computer and started the iexplorer program. I went through media  photodata  misc  dcim_apple.plist and just change the number to 0 or 0000 and it actually saved itself and on the top of the window it said "edited". After that I just turn off the phone and turn it on again and try out to save any photo to the phone and it still not showing IMG_0001. I have no idea why this is not working. <comment111277> I followed your steps through the PhoneView, but in the PhoneView I was not able to edit the DCIM_APPLE.plist file. I dobule-clicked the plist file but it just automatically saved into my computer documents instead of allowing me to change the file. Also, I do know how to change the number into 0000 but I do not know what the 100 for? Thank you for your help again. <comment111287> I double-clicked the plist file but it does not allow me to change the file. Instead it just saves a file into my computer. Do you know how to fix this? <comment111288> Once you've edited it and saved it to the computer, drag it into the folder in PhoneView and it should offer to overwrite the file on the phone. <comment111314> I was able to reset the photo numbers on my iPhone. Thank you for the help :)
