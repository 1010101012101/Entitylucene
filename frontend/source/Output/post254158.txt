Service shortcut does not work in Finder? <body> I've added a service through Automator, which opens iTerm2 in the current folder.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/isvq7.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  It works when I click in service menu. However when I try to assign a shortcut for it, it won't trigger.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xoJax.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Tried plenty of combinations, none of them works  Any ideas?  Attached the script:  precodeon run {input, parameters}     tell application "Finder"         set dir_path to quoted form of (POSIX path of (input as alias))     end tell     CD_to(dir_path) end run  on CD_to(theDir)     tell application "iTerm"         activate          try             set t to the last terminal         on error             set t to (make new terminal)         end try          tell t             launch session "Default Session"             tell the last session                 write text "cd " &amp; theDir &amp; ";clear;"             end tell         end tell     end tell end CD_to /code/pre
