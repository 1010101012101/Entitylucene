Visible Hidden Folder Disappears After Renaming it to [Dot Underscore] <body> I was temporarily changing the name of a folder before moving it. The name I randomly chose was "code._/code". The folder immediately disappeared and Finder would not allow me to undo the operation. em(I know; bad convention, but it was going to be temporary, so didn't think it would be an issue.)/em  h2*** NOTE: Viewing invisible files/folders was already turned on before this incident. *** (I can still see hidden files except THIS one.)/h2  Looking through Finder, the folder was no longer visible. It was also not indexable (of course) by Spotlight Search.  So, two questions...  ol listrongPrimarily, "How do I get it back?"/strong/li liWhy did this happen? Is "code._/code" a reserved system name? Is this repeatable?/li /ol  strongUPDATE:/strong Language addressing code$ cd/code into the wrong working directory was removed from OP to reduce ambiguity and verbosity. Corrected solution moved to answer section.  <answer94229> All files and directories starting with code./code are Finder hidden files. System reserved dot directories are code./code for current directory and code../code for parent directory. This is carried on from OS X Unix heritage.  For your file, there is a chance that you have an extra space after the code_/code or some unprintable character. Try codemv ._/code then hit kbdTAB/kbd to find out if it will perform a completion on the name. If it does then continue typing the new name you desire. Note that you might need to hit kbdTAB/kbd twice or more until you get that particular file name displayed in case you had other files that start with code._/code in that directory.  Note that files and directories starting with code./code can be viewed in Finder upon desire and that you can search for on strongASK DIFFERENT/strong. They are called emhidden files/em.  <answer94256> h1How to Get it Back/h1  ol liOpen Terminal/li liNavigate to folder containing missing "code._/code" file/folder./li liRun code$ ls -a/code to confirm existence of "code._/code"./li liRename code$ mv ._ ._something_else/code/li liVOILA!

Very good suggestion. Also note that the OP actually had hidden files visible. ;) <comment110527> Sorry. I should have read the question more carefully. Did the kbdTAB/kbd solve the problem? If not, can you move into that directory in the Terminal? <comment110541> Instead of an answer, update your question with the correct info. <comment110546> Good point to avoid ambiguity. I will remove the "broken" language from the OP. However, since questions are not answers, the fixed answer language will remain here. <comment110580> Great feature to highlight! Turns out there was no invisible character, though. Indeed I can nav to it, rename it, etc. See my updated solution moved to the answer section. (I was in the wrong working directory in my previous attempt.)
