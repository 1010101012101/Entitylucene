loookup server IPs the website runs on with nslookup error - Got recursion not available from 192.168.1.1, trying next server <body> I would like to lookup servers cnn runs on for educational purposes.   I issued codenslookup www.cnn.com/code command in terminal and got an error:  precode;; Got recursion not available from 192.168.1.1, trying next server Server:     2a00:ee0:d::13 Address:    2a00:ee0:d::13#53  Non-authoritative answer: www.cnn.com canonical name = turner.map.fastly.net. Name:   turner.map.fastly.net Address: 23.235.43.73 /code/pre  192.168.1.1 looks like an address in a home network.  Although it lists one server, I don't believe they use just on. Is there something else I must do or is looking up the servers cnn runs on disabled by cnn.  <answer240524> The answer you got was correct.  codewww.cnn.com canonical name = turner.map.fastly.net./code  A emcanonical name/em, or CNAME record is a record in DNS servers that define an emalias/em for another domain.  In this case "www.cnn.com" points to the domain "turner.map.fastly.net".  As for your 192.168.1.1 server, that's most likely your router that is configured as a DNS cache or DNSMasq server.  The error message is fine, it's just telling you that the DNS server that you have listed emfirst/em in the list of DNS servers doesn't support recursion.  It's not an issue.  My personal router is configured as a DNS relay and I don't get the error because it passes all DNS requests except for anything with my defined domain out to the public DNS servers.  <comment295656> Isn't the OP's router a DNS relay and you have a normal DNS server? <comment295657> @klanomath  No, I specifically set up a DNS relay (pfSense).  Many new routers come with DNS built in (DNSMasq)
