How to connect to my web app running on mac over WiFi? <body> I have very recently switched to mac, so i am a bit lost here...  I am running a test web app (Spring Boot app) on my mac now and I need to connect to it over WiFi form another device.  Now, when the app was running on win I could connect on  precodehttps://192.168.0.106:8080 /code/pre  (the IP address of the new mac is 192.168.0.102) but if I go to  https://192.168.0.102:8080 I get only "This page is not available"....  Thanks for your help!  <answer201463> There could be a few reasons, but your security settings are probably the most likely candidates.  h1Temporarily turn Off the Firewall/h1  The easiest way to test this is to (very) temporarily turn off your firewall:  strongSystem Preferences  Security &amp; PrivacyÂ  Firewall  Turn Off Firewall/strong  ol liimg src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yAdnQ.png" alt="enter image description here"/li liimg src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gp6hH.png" alt="enter image description here"/li liimg src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Yq5dz.png" alt="enter image description here"/li liimg src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MlfHp.png" alt="enter image description here"/li /ol  Retest your connectivity, if it works, turn your firewall back on and then allow the app through the firewall.  <comment242847> Thanks Deesbek, the firewall is turned off, but no success :-((( <comment242848> open up terminal and do `netstat -na|grep 8080` look for a line like `tcp4       0      0  *.8080                 *.*                    LISTEN     ` if it is not there you need to restart the app, or it is not running.
