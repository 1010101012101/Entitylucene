How to use F1-F12 keys with MacBook? <body> Blender requires F-keys such as kbdF12/kbd and numpad. The numpad emulation works for me, but I am unable to get the function keys such as kbdF1/kbd, kbdF4/kbd and kbdF12/kbd working. For example, kbdF12/kbd should do rendering. So how can I use Blender with a MacBook?  <answer85983> You need to hold down the kbdfn/kbd key (lower-left corner) while you're typing one of the kbdF1/kbdâ€“kbdF12/kbd keys. This is the norm for any app that uses F-keys, not just Blender.  <answer85986> You have two options; either hold down kbdfn/kbd as L2G suggested, or switch to the kbdF1/kbd etc. keys to work like that directly.  This can be setup in keyboard preferences here:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/D7rrO.png" alt="enter image description here"  If you do that, kbdF1/kbd will work as the actual kbdF1/kbd key. If you want to use it for controlling the brightness, you'd hit kbdfn/kbd with it.  <answer130450> To clarify and expand on HHH's comments: in at least some recent versions of OS X, kbdF8/kbd, kbdF9/kbd, kbdF10/kbd, and kbdF12/kbd are set by default as shortcuts to control Expose, Spaces, and Dashboard. Houbysoft's and L2G's solutions don't work in this case; holding kbdfn/kbd activates Expose/etc, and checking "Use all F1, F2, etc. keys as standard function keys" in System Preferences/Keyboard just means you get Expose from the unmodified function key instead of from kbdfn/kbd + function key.  The solution is: in System Preferences/Keyboard, open the Keyboard Shortcuts tab, and find and uncheck the relevant shortcuts.  <answer169752> If you have an external extended Mac keyboard, the kbdfn/kbd key is located below the kbdF13/kbd key.  <answer182994> To expand on @Robert's solution (which in turn expands on @houbysoft's solution), to get kbdF11/kbd and kbdF12/kbd to execute application-specific functions (such as using kbdF12/kbd to open the developer tools in Chrome), you'll need to:  ol liExecute @houbysoft's solution/li liOpen System Preferences/li liGo to Keyboard/li liGo to Shortcuts/li liClick on Mission Control/li liUncheck "Show Desktop" and "Show Dashboard"/li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KidSf.png" alt="Screenshot showing what to uncheck"  <comment99146> This does not work for me. When I press this either with houbysoft's suggestion or not, I get the expose screen with a lot of little apps?! EDIT I got it working after disabling the shortcuts in the settings of the houbysoft, thank you. <comment99147> You just need to remove the shortcuts to Fuction keys from the Keyboard Shortcuts menu. Otherwise F12 is not rendering but dashboard. <comment199454> OP asks for a Macbook so no external keyboard
