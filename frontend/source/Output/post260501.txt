Where does iTunes store audible.com books on Windows 10 Computers? <body> I downloaded 2 books from Audible.com, but got a message that I had to manually move them into my iTunes library.  Where is that library on my Windows 10 computer?  And how do I move these books to that place?  <comment326194> First, follow the [directions provided by Audible](http://audible.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/4653/~/how-can-i-download-audiobooks-to-a-windows-computer%3F).
