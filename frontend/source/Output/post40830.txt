The deleted certificate will be restored after rebooting. But why? <body> I installed a file *.developerprofile. Then I went to the keychain and deleted 3 certificates (they were expired). Everything is OK. But deleted certificates appeared when I rebooted my Mac. But why?    <answer41891> I had a possibly similar problem, related to a PPTP VPN and user certs.  Be sure to delete all old certificates from strongeach keychain/strong in Keychain Access. Also: be sure to choose "All Items" as the category.  In any case, I'm curious to hear whether you came up with a solution, so please remember to log any remarks on this page.  <answer43645> Not very good solutions, but it works for me. I deleted all profiles, certificates. Then I generated new profiles, certificates and install it.   <comment49597> It didn't helped me.
