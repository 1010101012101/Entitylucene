"Screen Sharing" without sharing screen <body> I have a Linux background and I have just been given a new machine at work which puts me in previously uncharted territory i.e. a Mac running OSX. Since I have very little or no experience with OSX, I need some help in solving this problem that I face.  My problem is about each user having their own separate sessions that can be accessed remotely, but not the session on the physically attached screen.  We see that with "Remote Management" we can get everyone to log into their own session, but it seems that people can then also access my physically attached session.  If it asked me like "Screen Sharing" asks then that's acceptable, but then people can't get to their own sessions.  What I want:  ul liPeople to be able to connect to their own sessions on my Mac./li liPeople to be unable to connect to the session on the physically attached screen./li /ul  What I tried:  ul liScreen Sharing/li liRemote Management/li /ul  What works:  ul liRemote Management lets people connect to their own sessions/li liScreen Sharing prevents people from connecting to the physically attached screen without approval/li /ul  What doesn't work:  ul liRemote Management lets anyone connect to the physically attached screen without approval/li liScreen Sharing doesn't let people connect to their own sessions/li /ul
