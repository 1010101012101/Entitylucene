Displays won't stay off when I put them to sleep <body> when I press kbdShift/kbd + kbdControl/kbd + kbdEject/kbd the displays go blank for a second, then they turn on again.br There's no way I can get them off permanently.br I also don't want the computer to sleep as I leave it downloading over night.br I have a MacBook with an external monitor attached.    <answer7690> Sometimes this can be due to the System Management Controller.  Try resetting the SMC and see if that helps  <comment8320> As I understand you ask 2 different question, you can't permanently turn off your screen and let your macbook download your file during night? <comment8350> May be I wasn't clear enough. What I want is to put the displays to sleep and that they stay off, which doesn't happen. <comment8351> Great, tried it and worked. I hope it keeps working. Thanks! <comment135507> Newer Macbook Pros use Ctrl+Shift + Power, because they lack an Eject button. There is also the option of using a "Hot Corner" for the same effect. This problem still exists. Haven't tried power cycling to reset to SMC yet... I wonder if that really would solve it.
