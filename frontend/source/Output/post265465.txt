Wifi speed drops when macbook pro is on charging? <body> I am using a macbook pro 13" 2015 on El Capitan. The problem is that when the wifi network speed drops when the mac is charging via the adaptor and speed is high if not charging that is in the battery usage mode. I tried in many ways to find the solution and finally ending up here.   Please help me with it.  <comment333143> Can you please tell which AP you are using and can you send me speed test results (from speedtest.net) with AC power and battery power? So that I can debug the issue. :)
