Send mail after found new items inside the folder <body> I am running an applescript codeapplication/code using codestay open/code option.  Function of the script is:  ol lithe applescript will ask for strong"javascript"/strong to run the below is my code. the  functions of the javascript is to find a files &amp; folders inside the folders and then copy and paste into other path, which is defined inside the script./li liafter copying mail, the email will be send to the person, saying strong"please check the file"/strong./li /ol  But, what happens is, each and every time the applescript send the mail to the receipient.  My need is to send email only when the folder has some items inside in it and always.  Below is my code:  precodeproperty pathToScript : ""  on idle     if pathToScript is "" then set pathToScript to (choose file with prompt "Please choose the Javascriptfile") as text     tell application "Adobe InDesign CS5.5"         do script pathToScript language javascript     end tell  ##sending mail after the "javascript" is complete"        set recipientName to "Rajni Kanth"     set recipientAddress to "rajni.kanth@xxxx.com"     set theSubject to "Please check Files has been completly copied from server"     set theContent to "check files have been copied"      tell application "Mail"          # # Create the message         set theMessage to make new outgoing message with properties {subject:theSubject, content:theContent, visible:true}          ##Set a recipient         tell theMessage             make new to recipient with properties {name:recipientName, address:recipientAddress}              ##Send the Message             send          end tell     end tell     return 0 end idle /code/pre  <answer126534> Change your code so that the codedo script/code captures a return value and use that to decide what to do. For example:  precodetell application "Safari"     activate     set theScript to "new Date().toJSON().slice(0,4);"     set theResult to do JavaScript theScript in current tab of first window      if theResult is "2014" then         display dialog "IT IS 2014"     end if end tell /code/pre
