How to remove color formatting of links in Microsoft Word? <body> In Microsoft Word for Mac 2011, I'm trying to edit the codeHyperlink/code and codeFollowedHyperlink/code styles so that they don't modify the text's color that I'm hyperlinking.  For example, let's say I have the following words: codered blue green/code all written in thier corresponding colors. Next, I decide to highlight these words and hyperlink them. By default, all the text will be turned into blue. That's not what I want; I want all the text to be the same colors, but with an underline added. That is, I would like the word codered/code to still appear in red color, not blue.  When I edit the style, it shows this, as you would expect:     Underline, strongFont color: Hyperlink/strong, Style: Hide until used, Priority: 100, Based on: Default Paragraph Font.   I want to remove the part I bolded, however, I don't see a way to do that. When I click the color icon, there is no option to select "no color." The closest thing to that is "Auto" which just changes the links to be black instead of blue.  <answer49176> I believe if you go under general setting you can set the default formatting for them... Its not where you NORMALLY format the text... (i don't have it installed right now..) go to file and preferences.. ( i think )  <answer67230> Format  Styles  There you can modify the styles in use for the current document, including hyperlink colours.  <answer197802> From the "Home" tab, open the "Styles" box.

In the Formatting section, choose the color you want and click OK  <answer208090> For Mac, you can create a Macro to change the hyperlink color.  precodeSub Linkcolor()  With ActiveDocument.Styles("Hyperlink").Font     .Name = ""     .Underline = wdUnderlineSingle     .Color = RGB(80, 200, 210)   End With   ActiveDocument.Styles("Hyperlink").BaseStyle = "Default Paragraph Font" End Sub /code/pre  And then save it as a template with .docm. Then you can save it as a .docx.   <answer243615> Found it!  ol li'Home' tab/li li'Format' section/li liArrow to drop down/li liRight-click on the 'followed hyperlink' box/li li'Modify'/li liChoose the 'style property'/li li'Format'/li liChange the colour/li liHit 'okay' on each open window/li /ol  <answer243633> There does not seem to be a way to do this. Even hacking the .docx and removing the colors supplied for the hyperlink styles seems to make Word 2016 supply default colors.   The only workaround I can find is to hyperlink the text first, and then supply a different color after.  <answer247825> How to customize your hyperlink:  kbdHome/kbd → kbdStyles Pane/kbd → kbdFollowed Hyperlink/kbd → kbdModify Style/kbd → kbdFormatting/kbd  Then simply choose the format that you would like :)  <comment56503> I don't see any options relating to link color in the Preferences. <comment300057> That's not going to do what the OP asked. They asked how to have the hyperlink style not apply any color at all. <comment305818> Have you tried this and verified it's working for you as per the OP's request? @Senseful doesn't want a style that changes links to a specific color, they want the hyperlink style to not apply *any* color. <comment305819> There is no way to force the style to have *no* color (i.e. retain text original color).
