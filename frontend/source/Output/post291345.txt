How to use different SOCKS proxy for different CLI apps? <body> based on some politics I cannot use proxychains* utilites ( no preload accepted ). As I understood is no chance to achieve it using sandboxes and no netspaces yet in OSX. I can play with the firewall little bit, but it looks complicated. Is there a way to redirect all traffic to the SOCKS proxy per specified cli app?   <comment367833> Netspace = network namespace? <comment367837> yes, like linux <comment368058> Which cli commands? Some will use env vars for proxy config. Your best bet here is probably a virtual machine... <comment368090> Yes, that what I doing right now, a linux virtual machine. But it looks little bit heavy
