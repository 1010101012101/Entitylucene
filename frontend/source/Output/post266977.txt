What words trigger the screen effects in iMessage? <body> The recent update iMessage on iOS causes certain words to trigger screen effects.  Also, there is a way to long-press on the send button, and bring up an interface for adding these effects.   I've found the following associations between screen effects, and the messgaes that trigger them:  ul liconfetti: "congratulations", "happy birthday"/li lifireworks: "happy new year"/li /ul  What is the list of these?    <answer267120> As of iOS 10.2 (current version), the messages in the question are the only ones I could find that trigger a full screen effect, no others have been confirmed in the sources I looked at (Apple, iMore, iGeeksBlog).  So our list is:  code"Congratulations"/code or code"Happy Birthday"/code: Confetti  code"Happy New Year"/code: Fireworks  Given that I can't find evidence of any other "trigger messages", I think it's safe to say that these are the only ones.  <answer268406> "Yaaaaaaaaaaaa" also throws confetti  <answer275590> Also "Happy Chinese New Year" triggeres a cool action  <answer286413> Happy Birthday: Balloonsbr Congratulations: Confettibr Happy New Years: Fireworksbr Happy Chinese New Years: Celebration   Also if you hold down the send button you can access a set of effects you can add to your message like a (Slam/Loud/Gentle/Invisible Ink). Now if you hold down the send button, not only do you get those set of effects, but the effects above with the SHORT list of trigger words are accessible at the top of the screen.   <comment335063> Can you please site a source for this info? <comment335064> @fsb Sources added. <comment335069> Thanks but none of those sources includes a list of the effects triggered by specific keyword, as the OP was asking.  I'm curious about this, too, because there's several, similar questions here and it would be good if we could point people to a specific list of keywords & effects.  I can't find any Apple source page with the list. <comment335071> @fsb Right, in some comments on those sites it asks the same question as the OP, and the only answers are what we've found. Given that I can't find evidence of any other "trigger messages", I think it's safe to say that these are the only ones. But if you don't agree, I can take down my answer, as I can see how it could be viewed as incomplete. <comment335074> I don't think you need to take it down, it's a good answer.  I would recommend editing it to indicate something similar to what your comment just mentioned.  That way the OP and others with a similar question will know the context of the info, but that's just my suggestion. <comment335075> @fsb Sounds good to me. I'll edit it.
