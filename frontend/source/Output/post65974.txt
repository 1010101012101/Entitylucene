OS X esc key stops working (randomly) <body> I have a 2011 MacBook Air with OS X Mountain Lion (I've upgraded from Lion). And ever since upgrading my escape key randomly stops working. And it's not that the keyboard on the laptop would be damaged as the same happens if I use Apple's Bluetooth keyboard. So I'm guessing it's a software issue.  Also in some cases pressing ctrl+esc achieves the same thing as just esc so I'm 100% it's not  a hardware problem.   Does anybody have any idea what this might be all about and how to fix it?  edit: the escape key stops working completely but it starts working again after I restart the computer.  edit2: this usually happens after the computer wakes from sleep. So it's not like that is just stopps working in the middle of using it, but rather after I put it to sleep (or just close the lid) and then open it again.  Has nobody got the same issue? Is there a better place to ask OS X related questions than Super User maybe?  <answer66033> Wipe the hard drive and do a clean install of OSX.   I hate suggesting this, but it should fix your problem. I too had a weird glitch from upgrading my mac OS. (mine was that i couldn't empty the recycle bin normally- i had to use console commands) The apple genius bar was lost, google turned up nothing, and no "expert" had any idea.   I know a clean install isn't an answer to the problem, but it's a means to a resolution of it...   Feel your frustration, let me know if you try this and if it works :)  (apple will do a clean install free of charge, if you're uncomfortable doing it)  <answer66299> I wouldn't do a drive wipe and clean install just yet. I would first boot into safe mode. Do this by holding down the Shift key as soon as you hear the Apple "chime". See if you have the problem then. If the escape key works reliably, it is likely a driver or software issue that is interfering. You can remove apps or third-party drivers to try to figure out which one(s) are the cause.  If it still happens in safe mode, it might be time to do a drive wipe and reinstall OS X from scratch.  <answer66702> If this problem happens in every application then it is indeed a system wide problem. If it only happens in one application it's an application problem.  This problem might also come from another (modifier) key getting stuck.  To check if the Esc key is ignored by the system itself or if another key is stuck use the Keyboard Viewer:  ol liGo to Apple → System Preferences...   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LT8Bm.png" width="279" title="System Preferences"/li li→ Keyboard  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/aXvHC.png" width="76" title="Keyboard"/li liEnable strongShow Keyboard &amp; Character Viewers in menu bar/strong  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/h58Ls.png" width="480" title="Show Keyboard &amp; Character Viewers in menu bar"/li /ol  Then when the problem happens again display the keyboard viewer and check if any keys are stuck. If not try using the esc key there and see if it displays as being pressed. If not then you probably have a driver problem.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FlPGR.png" width="243" title="Show Keyboard Viewer"  You could then try installing your system on another drive and try to reproduce the issue on a clean install.  <answer74135> As others have said, there's probably some application conflict that's causing the issue (since you said it's happening with the built-in keyboard and BT keyboard).  I was having this problem, too, with the same symptoms (happening after waking up from sleep, reboot solves the issue).  In my case I believe it's related to my use of TotalFinder, specifically the Visor feature of it.  Bringing up the Visor and then hitting escape seems to recover from the failure until my Mac sleeps again. If you disable the Visor or uninstall TotalFinder, the escape key wont become lost in the first place.  <answer74617> I've been having the same exact issue for a couple of weeks, and it did turn out it was indeed the Visor feature from TotalFinder as mentioned before by Joe. Disabling it did solve the thing.  Anyway, as it has been said, given the fact that the behaviour is the same with the built-in keyboard or the bluetooth one, it's obvious it's not a hardware issue.  <answer76802> The escape key on my Macbook Air was not working at all. I realized that the problem was that the Speakable Items Utility had assigned the Escape Key as the "Listening Key." Turning off Speakable Items (under Accessibility panel in System Preferences) seems to have fixed the problem.  <answer79354> Why not just briefly press the power button to wake from sleep like I do? No different from pressing a key.  Works for me!  <answer82193> Note that in order to solve this, you might not have to disable the Visor feature completely. I only disabled the option to 'Hide on ESC' and now I can switch windows between my terminal apps without sacrificing the option key   <answer86132> DON"T REINSTALL YET: I had this problem.  The keyboard viewer did not register "esc" presses.  Turned out it was from turning on speech commands while playing chess.  To fix it, I went to System Preferences -- Accessibility -- Speakable Items -- Listening Key.  Then I changed the listening key to something other than esc, and the problem went away immediately.  <answer86904> For me, I'd to do the both.  ol liDisabled the TotalFinder hide on esc key/li liAnd also changed the Esc key to something (i set it to backtik `)/li /ol  Now it works.  <answer187889> I had enabled speech command in system preferences and soon after that the esc key stopped working. I tried several different fixes from forums before I realized it might be Speech command .Once I disabled this the esc key worked immediately. Go to  System Preferences System Speech Speakable Items; Off  <answer252374> For anyone who ends up here after installing the macOS Sierra release candidate. I had to disable Siri and then kill the Siri process using Activity Monitor.  <answer281441> You may need to reset your SMC  http://osxdaily.com/2010/03/24/when-and-how-to-reset-your-mac-system-management-controller-smc/  Copied verbatim from the above blog post:  This is how to reset SMC on most modern Mac laptops, none of which have a removable battery:  h3Shutdown your MacBook Air / MacBook Pro/h3  ul liConnect the power adapter to the Mac/li liOn the MacBook / Pro’s keyboard, hold down the Shift+Control+Option keys and the Power button at the same time/li liRelease all keys and the power button at the same time – the little light on the MagSafe adapter may change colors briefly to indicate the SMC has reset/li liBoot your Mac as usual/li liHere’s the key sequence to hold down:/li /ul  h3Reset the SMC of a MacBook Air or Retina MacBook Pro/h3  ul liDo keep in mind that by resetting the SMC you will lose power specific settings, like the time it takes to sleep a Mac and other customizations to power settings.

Or works intermittently? <comment77614> The first one. Then it works OK when I restart the whole computer. <comment77615> You may have a hardware problem. I'd make a full backup if you haven't already, and take it to your local Genius Bar. <comment77616> Like I said, the same happens if I use the bluetooth keyboard. Are you suggesting that two separate pieces of hardware just happen to fail in the same exact way at the same exact time :) ? <comment77617> Have you tried using a different (empty/pristine) user account and tried to reproduce the issue there? It's possible some software runs in the background and breaks things for you. <comment77626> I have a similar thing happening (early 2011 MacBook Pro), mostly with my left command key but occasionally with other keys. I have AppleCare but I'm guessing this will require some time without my computer and I've been putting off dealing with it for over a year. I figured it was the keypad on this computer but your experience with an external keyboard gives me pause. I'd love it if it were software related and something I could fix easily. I'm staying tuned here. Mine had this problem with Snow Leopard... pre-Lion and Mountain Lion. <comment77640> @Daniel Beck I'll try to do that. <comment77695> Perhaps, if you dont want anything as radical as a clean install right away, you could install on a fresh external hard drive. Boot from that, and see if the problem is there.   I think though, that this type of issue will show up or not with a new user account, so I agree to try Daniel Beck's idea first. <comment77697> agreed.. I tried that with my issue without success.. external drive is a great idea.. good call :) <comment77711> I should have said, that if this works, the OP will need to do a clean install afterwards.. <comment77760> Hmm, didn't know you can install OSX on an external drive and then boot from it. Will look into it. Clean install might not be such a bad idea, as the upgrade also messed with my PHP that I had. I'll just have to find the time now :) <comment77986> I'm seeing this issue as well, and I have a brand new retina macbook pro that came with Mountain Lion on it. It not only affects the internal keyboard's esc key but also any number of external USB or Bluetooth keyboards. <comment78561> I wonder what happened with my screen captures... they are huge for no reason... <comment80668> I'm also experiencing this on a brand new retina Macbook with Mountain Lion. I've reset the SMC, reset the PRAM, reinstalled Mountain Lion and still am having issues. Once my ESC key stops working, it doesn't work on my bluetooth keyboard and it doesn't work or show up in the keyboard viewer.  The only thing I can think of is a flaw in the OS or a hardware issue. <comment86134> Maybe you have a Retina MBP? <comment86169> @Patko: Yep it seems to be the source of the problem. <comment91323> Could you improve your or joes post by listing the version of TotalFinder that causes this bug / interaction? Is it perhaps a known issue or fixable by the TotalFinder people (for bonus points) <comment91648> This has not much to do with the escape key not working. <comment92440> Thanks! I disabled and re-enabled Visor from TotalFinder and it works! Saved me tons of trouble :) <comment93645> Thanks for pointing this out. I never would have made the connection between my esc key problem and the TotalFinder Visor. Disabled 'Hide on ESC' and now I have my esc key back! <comment97540> Simply opening and closing the visor solved this issue. <comment316261> After just installing macOS Sierra on my hackintosh, I found my ESC key only works when Siri is disabled. <comment319568> Had this problem after update to the public release of macOS Sierra, and this answer solved it. Less than optimal solution if you want to use Siri, I guess. <comment322218> Yes! thank you, you've saved me <comment325885> In my case Siri was hanged and restarting it solved the issue. thanks! <comment336202> I had this problem too. Kind of annoying as I've disabled Siri (I disabled the Notification Center too via Terminal flag which means I can't run Siri anyway). Perplexed as to why it is still running when I've disabled it... <comment343336> I am on macOS Sierra (10.12.3) and killing Siri did solve the problem!
