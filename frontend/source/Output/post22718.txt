Why does the name of my flash drive change whenever I demount, then remount it? <body> I have a LaCie key (iamakey). When I change the drive's name to "LaCie" then dismount and remount it, it's name changes to "LACIE"br I'm trying to figure out why it won't stay named as "LaCie"    Any ideas?  <answer22721> It has always been the case that changing the case of a USB volume formatted with FAT required some low-level hacking.   There are instructions to do this in the following link: (a word of warning: I have not tried this and making a mistake with some of these low level commands may wreck your drive, strongso be careful/strong!)  http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20090506034709445  Also see the thread here for instructions to change the drive icon if you so desire.  http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=677658  <comment25315> All that just to change the case of a name? Geez. Hmm, maybe I'll look into it. <comment25316> As far as I know this is the only way. If you reformat the drive to a Mac format the lower case in Finder will stick, but then you can't use the drive in any Windows machine. <comment25317> Oh I see. I might just do that, I don't know of any reason why I'd use it with Windows.
