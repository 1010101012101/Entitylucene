Mac mini connected display not showing full screen <body> I just got the new Mac Mini and plugged in my display, but it's not showing the full screen.   Here's how it looks like:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wnmgK.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Is there any way to fix this?  <answer153624> Go to strongSystem Preferences/strong â†’ strongDisplays/strong and adjust the strongOverscan/strong slider (or checkbox, depending on the screen model) so the content fits on the screen. Alternatively, you should be able to change the settings on the display itself to adjust the overscan.  For more information on overscan and underscan, see the Apple KB article:  ul lihttp://support.apple.com/kb/HT5841/li /ul  <comment180820> Thank you, overscan was enabled in my display.
