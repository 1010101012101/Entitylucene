Mac OS X Orphaned files <body> I was using hardlink (https://github.com/selkhateeb/hardlink) to point an important folder to my new google drive folder and my machine crashed. Right now I have no access to OS X so I connected my HDD to a Windows 10 machine with bootcamp drivers installed. I can see all files there, but my senstive folder looks a file, instead of being a folder.. So I can't enter the folder to get the files and I believe the files are still there. Orphaned.  Any suggestions? It could be applications and steps when using Windows or OS X as I'm trying to get access to a mac computer to try to recover those files.  <answer159864> It seems that a hardlink modifies the original folder, instead of just creating another folder(link).  I was able to use a friend mac and insided os x I was able to enter the folder and recover the data! Resolved!  Thank you everyone!  <comment187913> OS X wont start in Safe mode ? <comment187916> @TiagoCarvalho Which additional app/fs-driver do you use to access JHFS+ volumes from within Windows 10? <comment187917> @klanomath I just installed the bootcamp drivers, I can read HFS+ but I can't write on it. They are mounted automatically when windows start. <comment187920> @Buscarì›ƒ it's a hardware problem, it won't even start, that's why I got the HDD and put it on my PC <comment187932> Is your sensitive folder encrypted in any way? <comment187940> @patrix No it wasn't encrypted, I never use encryption fearing that it might get in the way of recovering data in cases like this.
