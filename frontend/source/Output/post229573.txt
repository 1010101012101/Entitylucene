Run AppleScript on lid close? <body> I'm using a MacBook Pro (Retina, Mid-2014) running OS X El Capitan and I'm curious if I can run a script when I close my computer (without installing anything).  Note: I don't want to install anything.  <comment280067> I looked at that before; it requires that I install something. <comment280068> No, the `ioreg -r -k AppleClamshellState | grep...` [solution by M K](http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/104560/93229) doesn't require any installation. <comment280069> Want to make sure: I'll have to run that continuously; will that drain my battery? <comment280070> Depends on the script/task. You probably want to [disable clamshell mode](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/152777/how-to-disable-clamshell-mode-in-yosemite).
