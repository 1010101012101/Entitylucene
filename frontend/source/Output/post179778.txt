Ping being hijacked? <body> On my Mac terminal, I typed  precodecat /etc/resolv.conf   nameserver 8.8.8.8 nameserver 8.8.4.4 /code/pre  and I do a codedig/code  precodedig www.facebook.com  ; &lt;&lt;&gt;&gt; DiG 9.8.3-P1 &lt;&lt;&gt;&gt; www.facebook.com ;; global options: +cmd ;; Got answer: ;; -&gt;&gt;HEADER&lt;&lt;- opcode: QUERY, status: NOERROR, id: 29630 ;; flags: qr rd ra; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 2, AUTHORITY: 0, ADDITIONAL: 0  ;; QUESTION SECTION: ;www.facebook.com.

Update: Look like problem solved when I edit/save the code/etc/hosts//code file again, but definitely I don't have those strange IP code193.107.16.114/code on my file, so I suspect due to any malware?  <comment213253> Certainly seems like something is doing something wrong. the Facebook.com ip address you should be getting in ping is: 173.252.120.6 <comment213264> http://193.107.16.114.ipaddress.com/ <comment213276> You should check your DNS server settings and report back here. <comment213299> Which version of OS X? /etc/resolv.conf is deprecated in newer versions (starting with 10.8 I believe) and not used conventionally.
