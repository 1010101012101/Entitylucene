Run script/ifttt recipe.... upon notification <body> Either this is impossible, or google is failing me. Ultimately, what I would like to do is push system notifications strongfrom/strong my Mac strongto/strong my iOS device. Google only gives me 1000's of hits for going the other way around. The stopping point seems to be that there is no easy way for me to make script/app that can capture notification events (not script - notification, but notification - script/app).  In my research I've found that OS X logs all notifications into an SQL database. While this is a privacy concern, it also seems like an opportunity.   Any suggestions? It's an odd question, but I can't be the only person to have wished for this.  <answer283520> Try Pushbullet (pushbullet.com). This service will sync the notifications from your computer, phone and tablet - it should work both ways. You will need a Google account to sign in.  <comment324862> What notifications are you looking to forward? Everything?
