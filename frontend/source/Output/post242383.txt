For right clicking, are ctrl-click and two-finger-tapping used exchangeably? <body> For right clicking, there are two ways when using the trackpad  ul likbdControl/kbd-click, i.e. tapping the trackpad while pressing kbdControl/kbd key /li litwo-finger-tapping /li /ul  Can they be used exchangeably?   If not, when to use which?  <answer242400> Yes, they can be used interchangeably. The two-finger tap is a shortcut employed by OS X for more convenience / accessibility, however, it has exactly the same function as the kbdcontrol/kbd-click.  <comment298166> thanks.  in guest Ubuntu via virtualbox, right-clicking by tapping the right region of the trackpad doesn't do anything, while two-finger tapping does work like right-clicking in PC. I am not sure if keystrokes in guest Ubuntu should be the same as in Ubuntu directly installed on a computer, or same as in OS X.
