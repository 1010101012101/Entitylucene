mystery files in All My Files <body> I have a brand new MacBook Air, have not saved any files to it yet.  But I just noticed there are files in AllMyFiles dating back to 1997.  Are they "borrowed" from the iCloud?  Although they are not arranged in folders like in the iCloud, the ones I have opened are also  in iCloud.  <answer247544> You can answer this question for yourself. In the codeAll My Files/code view, right click one of the files and choose codeGet Info/code. The window which opens when you do that has a codeWhere:/code field. For a file in iCloud, the codeWhere:/code field says codeiCloud Drive/code.  <comment305599> That is very interesting.  I am concerned that having all these files "in residence" will clutter up my Hard Drive, which is why they were in the Cloud.  If I delete them from All My Files, will they disappear from the Cloud? <comment305605> See http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/152028/149185 for an explanation of how iCloud drive works.
