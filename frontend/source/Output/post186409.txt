Garageband only recognizes one plugin of three installed <body> I have three plugins installed in code/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/Components/code however Garageband only finds the first one I installed, Crystal. The others, Synth1 and TAL-Bassline are ignored, even when I restart Garageband. Crystal works fine, and is available.  Has anyone else come across this? What should I do?  hr  I have Garageband 10.0.3 running on OSX 10.9.5. All plugins are AU (.component) plugins.  hr  Update: This is the what shows up in console when Garageband starts up (this is all of it; there's no filter):  precode5/11/15 12:37:27.595 PM MIDIServer[5093]: 12:37:27.594 NOTE:      [0x7fff75d32310] MIDIServer.cpp:353: FullInit: MIDIServer [5093] starting; arch=x86_64 5/11/15 12:37:28.665 PM GarageBand[5082]: Application with BundleID "com.apple.ImpulseResponseUtility" is not present on this system 5/11/15 12:37:31.447 PM GarageBand[5082]: Invalid color System, labelColor (warning given only once) /code/pre  <answer186412> What plugin-type are they?br GarageBand will only use AU plugins, with a .component extension, it can't use VST etc.   Each plugin type ought to be in its correct sub-folder - Components, Digidesign, HAL, VST etc  Seebr Interface types explained (VST, RTAS, AU, etc.)br Finding Audio Units plug-ins on your computer &amp;br How to Install plugins for Garageband - Add Audio Unit Filters to Garage band (AU)  You can force the AU cache to rebuild by deleting the cache file in code~/Library/Caches/com.apple.audiounits.cache/code while GarageBand is not running, then launch it again  <comment220051> They are all AU plugins, in the component folder. <comment220053> afaik, both Synth1 & TAL-Bassline are only available as VSTi. Do they have a .component extension, or .vst or…? <comment220054> Yes, they have a component extension just as I say in my question. <comment220055> Then it would be interesting to know where they came from… see http://www.kvraudio.com/product/synth1-by-ichiro-toda and http://kunz.corrupt.ch/products/tal-bassline <comment220056> ah, OK - ichi added AU more recently - http://www.geocities.jp/daichi1969/softsynth/ - apologies <comment220073> added cache clear info <comment220351> Still no joy :( Good tip, though. <comment220354> …then the next thing to do would be clear the cache again, open Console & watch what is reported as Garageband attempts to reload the plugins. If you've only 4 [plus the built-in ones, unfortunately] it oughtn't to be quite so painful as the several hundred I watched it go through yesterday, whilst researching this… I'm guessing it still will not be a fun 15 mins - but the chances are it will have looked at them & dismissed them for some logical reason. <comment220356> Thanks. As it happens, no such cache file has been created by running Garageband. I'll check out what console shows, and update my question. <comment220358> Updated. Nothing very illuminating, sadly. <comment220366> There should have been reams of data - maybe try running the auval tool independently, from terminal [not something I'm particularly adept with ;) but try `auval -a -q` which should only output errors & a list of 'type' codes, like 'aufx OKWX ksWV' <comment220391> I did this (with and without -q) and it only shows the plugins which Bandcamp knows about (i.e. not the ones I'm having trouble with and also including the apple ones). <comment220395> Also I zapped ~/marcin/Library/Caches/AudioUnitCache/* to no avail. <comment220409> I've tried Synth1, it fails validation [I can view the results in Logic, which Garageband doesn't show you]. I cannot find an AU version of TAL to test. <comment220411> Thanks, that's very interesting. Can you post the output/talk about what the failure is? <comment220413> nothing more than 'failed validation'. It doesn't give details
