Video controls in Chrome shake when I'm watching YouTube videos in Flash <body> So when I'm watching embedded videos from YouTube on websites in Mac OSX Lion in Google Chrome browser, the video controller bar shakes and looks weird if I mouse off the video to make the controls disappear. Is there a fix for this weirdness?  <answer91153> Update Google Chrome to the latest version and try disabling the experimental HTML5 player for YouTube.  <comment107072> How about on safari or fox?
