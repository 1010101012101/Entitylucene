Holding down the option key isn't allowing me to select Windows/OS X on startup <body> I have Windows 7 installed on a 15-inch Retina MacBook Pro.  According to Apple's Boot Camp Installation and Setup Guide, pg. 10...     strongSelect an operating system during startup/strong      You can select which operating system to use during startup by holding down the Option key.       This displays icons for all available startup disks and lets you override the default setting for the startup disk that is in Startup Disk preferences (OS X) or the Boot Camp control panel (Windows), without changing that setting.      1 Restart your Mac and hold down the Option key until disk icons appear onscreen.      2 Select the startup disk with the operating system you want to use, then click the arrow beneath the icon.   I'm finding that holding down the option key has no effect -- the machine boots into whichever OS was last running.  This is true whether I'm starting from the shut-down condition, or restarting.  I've tried hold down each of the two option keys and I've tried holding down both at once.  I've tried pressing the keys from before the startup chime and just after.  The only way I've been able to control which OS starts up is to restart from the Boot Camp control panel in OS X in either OS.  Any thoughts on how to get the machine to behave as described in the docs?  <answer99292> Two things to try:  ol liHold codeOption/code embefore/em pressing the power button and don't release it until you see the Boot Menu./li liIf that doesn't work, try resetting your Macbook Pro SMC as explained here./li /ol  <answer148275> Through experimentation, I found that disconnecting the Apple extended keyboard from an unpowered USB bus and reconnecting it directly to a USB port on the back of my Apple Cinema Display fixed this problem. Apparently the firmware that's necessary to choose which partition to boot from won't act on holding down the Option key otherwise.  <answer179889> I had a similar issue and the below trick solved it.      h3Resetting NVRAM/h3      ol   liShut down your Mac./li   liLocate the following keys on the keyboard: Command (âŒ˜), Option, P, and R. /li   liTurn on your Mac./li   liPress and hold the Command-Option-P-R keys immediately after you hear the startup sound./li   liHold these keys until the computer restarts and you hear the startup sound for a second time./li   liRelease the keys./li   /ol   supSource: https://support.apple.com/kb/ht204063/sup  <answer199411> I've had similar issues : while I was holding the key, the system would do as if if didn't recognize the keyboard(I'm on a iMac, with Bluetooth connection between the computer and the keyboard). On the contrary, with a usb port keyboard, it worked anytime ! (but that wasn't practical to plug another keyboard)  I understood that you have to be sure that the Bluetooth connects. So this is how to do it :  ul liwhile the computer is off, let's make sure that the keyboard is also off (for example, by pressing its own power button)/li liNow let's put the keyboard on : if the keyboard was off, it will search for a new connection - strongthe green light of the keyboard must blink/strong/li liThen you can turn on the computer and follow the clear instructions from above ("resetting NVRAM").

It will give you choice of Windows or Mac as want for your next start up of your computer.  <answer201751> There are 2 methods if the Option key doesn't work.     strongemMETHOD 1/em/strong @Amol mentioned it, his answer is perfectly correct. On your Mac, go to:      System Preferences  Startup Disk      Now click the Operating System that you want your next start to boot into.   Truly simple.     strongemMETHOD 2/em/strong      Download rEFIt and install it. Then reboot.      You might need to reboot twice or more before the rEFIt menu starts showing up on boot.   Good luck :)  <answer216322> I just had the same problem on osx 10.11, I have used refind before and thought that installing it might help, as it turns out it did and it works fine, the main difference between refit and refind is that by default refit installs to the os x root partition but refind install s th the hidden EFI partition meaning that it shouldn't just stop working randomly like refit has for me in the past.  <answer265617> I'm using a wireless keyboard / mouse (if it matters).  I found that I had to plug my dongle into a certain usb port, or these startup keys would not be received by the computer (even though I could use any of the ports post boot).  I also seemed to have better luck based on the timing of when I pressed the key(s). Doing it as soon as I heard the chime worked more reliably then holding it down before the chime even went off. I can't confirm that 100%, but it's worth a try if you're banging your head against the wall!  <answer277256> i found my issue was the wireless keyboard, it wasn't connecting with the boot so computer would not respond to the option key. I first made sure the keyboard was on/active then booted the computer.   <comment116754> Just clarifying: you're trying to press Option on a stock macbook's keyboard or a wireless keyboard? <comment116755> On the laptop's own built-in keyboard. <comment116756> Also try to reproduce the bug with a USB keyboard connected to the Macbook; as a last resort, you can install a third-party boot manager [rEFInd](http://www.rodsbooks.com/refind/), it will show up on its own without need to press Option <comment161333> As stated here, if on a Wireless keyboard, press Alt when you hear the chime. Before that, keyboard is not detected. http://support.apple.com/kb/PH11132?viewlocale=en_US <comment181632> Boot sequence is prime espionage target. Must be simple, transparent. Booted software takes control over machine. Any unexpected behavior here suspect. Option key must always go straight to menu. <comment288137> I did it using an external usb keyboard !
