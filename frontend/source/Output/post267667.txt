Different ways to block all HTTPS traffic containing a string <body> So I have a situation on my machine in which I would like to block an HTTP request or response if it matches a certain string.  My initial thought is that I'll need to use an SSL-breaking proxy, trust the proxy's certificate, and then leverage the proxy to break SSL and filter the traffic.    Are there any alternative methods that'll work system-wide (not just in the browser) that I might not be thinking of? I'm looking to understand emall/em methods to filter the traffic, not just one (e.g. maybe a custom built kernel filter module could do the trick?)  <comment335914> Related: [HTTPS packets filtering](http://security.stackexchange.com/questions/136500/https-packets-filtering)
