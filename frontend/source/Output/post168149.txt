I assume they want this to only allow connection from known devices.  There is no risk (or at least no more than any other connection). You just need to use normal security procedures.  <comment197457> A MAC address is not a password, it is an identifier of the machine connecting to their network. It's analogous to giving the hotel the license plate of your car (in order to park in their lot), not like giving them the keys to your car.
