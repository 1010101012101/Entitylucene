Chrome toolbar icons acting weirdly <body> It recently started happening that the icons in Google Chrome started freaking out, and randomly look weird:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/IP96l.png" alt="first screenshot"  And they don't always look the same, either:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/sO7Vh.png" alt="second screenshot"  The appearance of them tends to change if I hover over them, do any tab-related actions, disconnect or connect my external monitor, etc.  The download circle progress bar and icon also exhibit this behavior.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/A3MlL.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer46522> I assume you are using the dev version of Chrome (19.0.1077.3). If so, this is a bug that was introduced a few days ago. Expect it to be fixed with the new update. Here's the bug report on the official Google blog: Dev Channel Update.  Edit: I just checked for updates manually, and indeed the update was available, solving the rendering issue. To get the update now, got to Chrome settings (codechrome://chrome/settings//code), and click on the codeHelp/code tab. The app will check for updates automatically, and ask you to relaunch the browser.  <comment53168> Now that you mention it, I am using the dev version of chrome. Glad it will be fixed soon, I've tried deleting my profile, chrome preferences, etc. Green check for you (in 6 minutes) <comment53169> Added an edit - it seems to be all fixed already. <comment53171> Relaunched and it's fixed!
