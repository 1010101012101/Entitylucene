Automatic App Updates not in the Background anymore since iOS 10 <body> Before updating to iOS 10, I never actively saw the updates happen (the icon going dark, etc), apparently they always happened during the night or something.  Since updating to iOS 10, every morning when I first look at my phone, I see various apps starting to download updates at the same time, which I find pretty unnerving.  iOS 10.0.2 14A456 on iPhone 5S ME435DN/A. I always had Automatic App Updates activated, and never touched the setting. I do not turn my iPhone off during the night, and do not activate night mode or power saving mode. Just Night Shift.  Anyone else noticed this as well? Is there anything I could do?  Thanks, -M  <answer270209> I think this may be happening to you for a number of reasons:  ul liiOS 10 has determined that you do not use the updating apps at that time of day, so it is updating them during use to be more efficient/li liiOS may also have determined that this time of day and network are when you have the fastest connection. /li liIf you use Airplane Mode at night (for faster charging and no notifications), it can't update apps at night./li liOr there's a software glitch./li /ul  <answer290942> Background update is not working at all on iOS 10.x regardless what internet connection you have, charging status or hardware version.  I am pretty sure Apple knows about it but does nothing because pushing updates costs a lot of money.  I have about 100-200 apps, probably average is 40-50 but with billions pf devices you can easily imagine the bandwidth.  I think that they will bring it back only for incremental updates of recently used apps.   <comment324346> First thing, I would upgrade to iOS 10.1. Second, is your phone plugged in during the night, and is it within range of Wi-Fi? <comment329813> I see this all the time on my iPad mini 4, it is plugged in all day and in Wifi range, and when I first pick it up to use it after unlock and unplugging , apps start updating. On 10.1.1 currently. <comment332662> I have the same issue. Happens to my iPhone and iPad. Both have the most recent iOS. And both are plugged in at night.
