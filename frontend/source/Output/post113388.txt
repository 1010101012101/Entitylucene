Time Machine is Frozen <body> I am running Mac 10.8.5 on a 2008 MacBook Pro, I have my time machine save to an external hard drive. Recently I have been unable to back up my machine because it gets hung up on 'Preparing Back Up' I have seen it chug away for 5 hours preparing that thing, I'm begging to think that it might be broken. I have gone into the external hard drive, and deleted the .inProgress then tried to Back up, didn't work. I have also tried to delete the old back ups, I say tried because while the delete dialogue comes up, they don't go anywhere. I have had to do this in standard finder view because the Starfield freezes when I try to go into that. So my questions are these, what is wrong with my Time Machine? Can it be fixed? Should I just reformat my external hard drive and restart the Time machine?    strongEDIT:/strong The logs for the inProgress files were empty, there is no latest and the last one that worked, from october said:  precodeTime elapsed: 0.144 seconds  Processing preflight info   Space needed for this backup: 3.54 GB (864605 blocks of size 4096)   Preserving last snapshot /Volumes/TR/Backups.backupdb/Danny Michaelis’s MacBook Pro (2)/2013-10-13-174902.inProgress/6949$ Finished processing preflight info  Copying items from "Macintosh HD" (mount: '/' fsUUID:A336210F-DE80-3901-A8E1-2146BBCC66F6 eventDBUUID:5D8F456A-237A-477B-B3EC-D$  Error: (-36) SrcErr:NO Copying /Users/lego90511/.appinventor to /Volumes/TR/Backups.backupdb/Danny Michaelis’s MacBook Pro (2)/20$ Error: (-36) SrcErr:NO Copying /Users/lego90511/.DownloadManager to /Volumes/TR/Backups.backupdb/Danny Michaelis’s MacBook Pro (2$ Error: (-36) SrcErr:NO Copying /Users/lego90511/Applications/Portal.app to /Volumes/TR/Backups.backupdb/Danny Michaelis’s MacBook$  Finished copying items for "Macintosh HD" (mount: '/' fsUUID:A336210F-DE80-3901-A8E1-2146BBCC66F6 eventDBUUID: 5D8F456A-237A-477$  Time elapsed: 29 minutes, 10.000 seconds Copied 3092 items (25.7 MB) Gathering events since 3981278.

In your case, you may lose configuration settings for codeAppInventer/code (which has since been deprecated by Google anyway) and for codeDownload Manager/code.  Excluding codePortal/code from the Time Machine backup will just tell it not to backup those files.   Note: If you're using Steam, I actually recommend you excluding all of your games from Time Machine backup since you can easily recover those items, including save files, directly from Steam. This will help speed up the backup process and also save space on your backup device.  <comment133086> I repaired the Disk Permissions and unfortunatly nothing, so I've added what ever logs I could. <comment133111> Before I do this, what are the possible implications of removing .* files, specifically those files? <comment133157> Ah so .* files are things created by the applicaitions and are not integral to the system. <comment133169> Correct. Usually files or folders created in a User folder are not system dependent. They are, like you say, created by applications that are installed and configured by that user. <comment133254> Unfortunatly that didn't work, and I can't see what's in the .inprogress file on the hard drive. <comment133433> Try removing that file altogether (.inprogress) using rm in Terminal. Make sure you empty your trash as well before trying another backup. <comment133466> Tried to delete it, I added the results to the initial question. <comment133849> Please use code formatting for Terminal output — a single endless line is extremely difficult to read! I've edited your post in an attempt to add code formatting, but if I've not edited it correctly please re-edit. <comment135516> @EasilyBaffled are you still having issues with your Time Machine backups?  If so, were you able to check the system log as outlined in step 3 above?
