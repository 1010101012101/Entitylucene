Mac Terminal and Vim syntax coloring on CentOS server <body> I am using a Mac Terminal window to ssh to a CentOS server.  I have installed vim-enhanced on the server, I have created an alias for codevi=vim/code in my code.bash_profile/code, as well as confirmed I am using code/usr/bin/vim/code. I still can't get syntax colors when editing files.  Is there something I need to do with Mac Terminal settings? Any thoughts as to why it's not working as I expect?  <answer128386> Display ANSI colors needs to be enabled in the Terminal Settings.  <answer264241> Do you have the line codesyntax on/code somewhere in the file code~/.vimrc/code (on the host machine)? That should do it.
