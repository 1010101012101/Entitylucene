El Capitan Apache error message AH00526 <body> Yesterday I upgraded my Mac from Mountain Lion to El Capitan. Trying to get apache2 working I get the following error message:      AH00526: Syntax error on line 20 of /private/etc/apache2/extra/httpd-mpm.conf: Invalid command 'LockFile', perhaps misspelled or defined by a module not included in the server configuration.   What might be the remedy?  <answer211555> I looked up the information on the file http-mpm.conf at the Apache website:   It says LockFile is a correct directive. I don't know why I'm getting the same error you are. So in terminal, I went to:  precode/etc/apache2/extra /code/pre  and restored the codehttpd-mpm.conf/code file from before I loaded El Capitan. I used these commands:  precodesudo mv httpd-mpm.conf httpd-mpm.conf.elcapitan sudo mv httpd-mpm.conf~orig httpd-mpm.conf /code/pre  and entered the commands:  precodesudo apachectl restart apachectl configtest /code/pre  and got "Syntax OK"  If I enter http://localhost in my browser, I get the page "it works".  <answer217189> LockFile is one of the directives of Apache â‰¤ 2.2. This was replaced by Mutex in Apache 2.4, which is the version of Apache installed with OS X 10.11, El Capitan.  Edit the file code/etc/apache2/extra/httpd-mpm.conf/code to remove this part:  precode# # The accept serialization lock file MUST BE STORED ON A LOCAL DISK. # &lt;IfModule !mpm_winnt_module&gt; &lt;IfModule !mpm_netware_module&gt;   LockFile "/private/var/log/apache2/accept.lock" &lt;/IfModule&gt; &lt;/IfModule&gt; /code/pre  Then check config codeapachectl -t/code and restart codesudo apachectl restart/code.  <comment254735> [Get localhost running on Mac OS X Yosemite](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26454160/get-localhost-running-on-mac-os-x-yosmite) <comment255373> Did you look at line 20 of the file mentioned in the error message? <comment256815> whats the important change from your original config file?  I am starting from fresh so I don't have known working config file. <comment262237> I have the same issue, but this doesn't actually offer any fix. <comment317126> This works. This happens when you update your MacOSX from your previous OSX version.
