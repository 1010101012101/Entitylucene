How can I find them and delete all 1.1GB of the messages?  <answer157835> I got this tip from http://www.igeeksblog.com/how-to-clear-message-imessage-cache-on-iphone-ipad/  You’ll need:  ul liiBackupbot (Download)/li liYour iPhone/iPad/li liPC/Mac running latest version of iTunes/li /ul  Follow these steps:  ul liBackup your iPhone or iPad through iTunes. (Connect your iDevice to the PC/Mac, under the devices in iTunes, right click on your device and click on Backup Now; alternatively, you can also use the Back Up option from the Summary tab)/li liOpen iBackupbot/li liFrom the sidepane, navigate to System Files  Mediadomain  Library  SMS  Attachments/li liAll the folders within Attachments are your Message cache containing all photos, video and media that you sent/received. Clear them out. At its best, delete all folders./li liClick on “Restore” so your iPhone is now restored to this backup./li /ul  Obviously, it doesn’t end here. If you have an iCloud backup already, you might have to flush that too. Go to Settings → iCloud → Storage &amp; Backup and clear out any backup that exists. You can create a new backup.  <comment185586> if your Messages app is totally empty & you still see high usage, then try... 1. reboot the phone. 2. sync the phone. 3. backup & restore the phone.
