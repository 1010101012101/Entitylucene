AppleEvent Handler failed (-10000) <body> I'm having issues with a simple part of script, where I wanna get the property codedock preferences/code of System Events. I have the following:  precodetell application "System Events"     tell appearance preferences         set ap_prefs to (get the properties)         set ap_prefs to the properties     end tell     set a_pref to the properties of appearance preferences      tell dock preferences         set d_prefs to (get the properties)     end tell     set d_pref to the properties of dock preferences end tell /code/pre  In the code above I access codeappearance preferences/code in all the ways shown above, but not codedock preferences/code. It give an error codeerror "System Events got an error: AppleEvent handler failed." number -10000/code.   So what is going on, and why is only giving error with dock? Here @dj_bazzie_wazzie says:     Error -10000…most of the time it is not a target error but an incomplete command or wrong usage of brackets.    But I can't figure out what is the proper way. I've tried all I can think of, also why doesn't it throw the exception for codeappearance preferences/code?  Cheers  I've also opened this question on Stack Overflow, I'll close one when I get a answer.  <answer218680> this is not really an answer but a detailed "comparison".br When I had your code run on my Mac (El Capitan), including your malfunctioning "set d_prefs to the properties" line, I didn't get an error at all.br Results window in ScriptEditor read:  precode{minimize effect:scale, magnification size:0.178571432829, ¬ dock size:0.116071425378, autohide:true, animate:false, ¬ magnification:false, screen edge:left, class:dock preferences object} /code/pre  I wonder if you tried to get these values displayed/changed and called them by index?br I just read that: em"You can retrieve items from a record [= list of properties] by name, but not by index."/embr Maybe that's where the error came from?  <comment241697> Cross-posting is frowned upon. Pick one & delete the other. <comment241700> I've seen that error when a variable expecting a POSIX file is given a string instead. Not quite sure on 'properties', though, which iirc ought to be a list... but it might be a start-point
