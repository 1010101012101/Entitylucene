MacBook Air number pad keyboard alternative? <body> Is there any way to set the keyboard on a MacBook Air laptop so that I can toggle between normal keys and a number pad?  Seems a little ridiculous to use the mouse for calculator entry and while the number row is adequate for normal typing, it seems like there should be a way to add this functionality.  (FWIW: late 2012 i7 Intel MBAir, OSX Sierra)  hr  per Tom's Comment, as of 12/29/2016 according to their website, "Karabiner does not work on macOS Sierra at the moment" &amp; just last week there was an update released for Ukulele. Here is an old website with some additional suggestions for how to cross this bridge.  <comment334452> I think it has quite a few years since there was a built-in way to use letter keys for numbers in OS X in an Apple laptop.  I don't know if Karabiner can do it.  Presumably you could make a custom layout with Ukelele. <comment334480> @TomGewecke, have you used Ukulele? The reviews I've seen are not so good. Thanks tho for the suggestions, will keep an eye on Karabiner. <comment334503> I've made lots of keyboards with ukulele.  Great app, Surprised it would ever get a bad review... <comment334504> @TomGewecke that's good to hear - considering your rep, I have more faith in your opinion and experience than random online reviews, thanks!
