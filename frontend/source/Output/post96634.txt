How can I remove my data but keep the OS when putting my MacBook up for sale? <body> I want to delete items off MacBook but leave the Mountain Lion OS. How can I do this  <answer96636> Here is a link to Apple's directions on how to erase and reinstall OS X Mountain Lion, so it will be like new.  <answer96702> If you're willing to leave the installed applications on the unit, you could create a new "admin" user, log in as that new "admin," delete your original user (and choose to delete the home folder).  For security reasons, it might be a good idea to erase free space on the drive before you sell it (so that someone with a little skill doesn't piece your data back together).  <comment113446> I cannot type a name in the box. The format is highlighted Mac OS Extended (journaled) so I am not allowed to do anything here. I cannot erase!!!
