Is there a single place I can see all the app reviews I've written in the iOS App Store? <body> Short of individually tapping on "Write a Review" for all the apps I've ever purchased, is there any place (on the web, in iTunes, or in a third-party app) I can view all the reviews that I've written for apps on the iOS App Store?  If that is not possible, can I obtain a list of the apps for which I've written reviews?  <answer194710> Yes. Open the App Store and scroll to the bottom of the featured tab.  Tap on your Apple ID and select "View Apple ID".  The tap Ratings and Reviews:   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QMVEX.jpg" alt="Ratings and Reviews"  <comment231422> @IconDaemon http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/failing#failing__6 <comment232571> Ah yes, that is the obvious place for it. Goodjob, Apple. Thanks!
