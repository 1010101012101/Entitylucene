El Capitan (or newer OS) on a MBA late 2010 <body> I've an "old" MacbookAir 11" (late 2010, 4GB of RAM, 180GB SSD), which I've loaned to a friend. Now he gave it back to me, and I'm planning to use it as a "mobility" machine. My problem is that the applications I use (Mathematica 11, Office 2016, etc) require at least emEl Capitan/em.  What I want to ask is if someone is in a similar condition - same generation of MBAs, same (or newer) OS - and what are his feelings. Is the system fast enough? Does it have annoying lags?  PS: my "typical" working session is made by Chrome (~40 opened tabs) + Acrobat or Word (2 files open) + OneNote.  <answer275300> Late 10 Macbook Airs can run Sierra - so your difficulty may be in obtaining El Capitan if that's what you would prefer, which you can only get if it's already in your Purchase History on the App Store.    Everything else in your question is really too opinion-based to garner useful answers.  Ref - EveryMac  <comment346296> 1. I have an El Capitan USB key.. 2. I know opinion isn't objective by definition - anyway, I'd like to get some <comment346297> ...then the world is your oyster. El Cap is faster than Mavericks/Yosemite, especially in low memory situations, imho. [& unfortunately, SE isn't the place for 'pure opinion'] <comment346300> Got it. Could you delete the question, or I'll have to do it myself?...Anyway, is there a SE branch where it is possibile to have an answer on "what is a pure opinion" that would be not a "pure opinion"? <comment346301> I'd let it sit. Gives Googlers a chance to find it if it may ever be helpful to them. Basically, any question along the lines of "what OS/machine/environment is best for xyz" has no outlet on SE. Would be a better fit for a discussion-type forum. SE is question/answer, based on fact & citation, at its ideal. <comment346302> Ok. Thank for clarification.
