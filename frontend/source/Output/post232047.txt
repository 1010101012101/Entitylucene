Can I install Windows (and if so, which one) on my Power Mac G5 tower <body> Can I install Windows (and if so, which one) on my Power Mac G5 tower? I know the maximum Mac OSX that can be installed is Leopard as I think, so it would be better to run some windows on it. Do you know which one can I install, and what is the maximum version of Windows for it? Thanks guys!  <answer232050> No version of Windows can be installed on a PowerPC platform.  Windows was never compiled for the RISC architecture.  However, you can install FreeBSD.  I successfully installed FreeBSD on an XServe G4 (using a USB flash disk).  <answer232051> Virtual PC was a software emulator for creating &amp; running Windows virtual machines on Mac systems using the PPC architecture. If you can find it, it'll do what you want albeit at a glacial level of response.
