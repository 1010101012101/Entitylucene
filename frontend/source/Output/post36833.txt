PDF metadata editor for iOS <body> I have several PDF ebooks in my iBooks. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/oypcl.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Some of them have their titles &amp; authors visible. Some only displayed as "untitled".  Is there any PDF metadata editor for iPad?  <answer38361> I am a big fan of PDF Pen on the Mac and would encourage you to shoot them an email linking back to here. Adding that as a feature to their new iOS PDF editor might be something they can do quickly and really make it quicker to make these sorts of changes.  <comment42629> have you tried: 1. synch pdf books with iTunes on you mac 2. http://www.sybrex.com/products/macgui/infomanager/ on your mac  3. sync back with iTunes
