How to navigate google search results in Safari 8 with keyboard? <body> A while ago I remember being able to navigate through search results using J and K.  Is there anyway to do that in Safari 8?  I've tried changing tab behaviour in Safari prefs to tab through every item, but that's too many tabs to accomplish what I want to do.  <answer168303> You mean in the URL bar search?br Up &amp; Down arrows.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/EiWLL.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer175366> Here's an extension that will let you do it in Google Chrome: https://github.com/nqzero/knogs  At the bottom of that page is a link to do the same thing in Safari (I can't link to it directly from here because I don't have the reputation for it).  I haven't tried either version though.  Personally, I use Mafuyu (http://wakabamac.blog95.fc2.com/blog-entry-1013.html). Instead of using codeJ/code and codeK/code to navigate and codereturn/code to open the result, you use code1/code-code9/code or code0/code to open the result directly.  <comment197525> I think you can look into Google's keyboard shortcut list or try in some other browsers to see if Safari is the cause. <comment197727> I tried with google chrome, no luck there <comment197728> No, I mean the actual search results after you hit enter. There'd be a blue arrow pointing at the title of each result, and by tapping J or K you could go up or down <comment197736> Never seen anything like that - must have been a 3rd party app
