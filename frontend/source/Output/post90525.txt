How to edit writable locations in a document in Pages '09? <body> The following image shows a region of the sheet it is not possible to write or select. There the cursor is, if i write another letter it will show up on the next page. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/UCRLH.png" alt="enter image description here" How do i enable the document to let me write on that field? I have tried dragging the side markers, but they only control how far down the reference text is.  <answer90531> You can change the page borders in the property sheet:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/cMnoR.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer104886> Go to strongInspector/strong (kbd⌘ cmd/kbd + kbd⌥ alt/option/kbd + kbdI/kbd) → strongText inspector/strong → strongMore/strong and uncheck the strongKeep lines together/strong box.
