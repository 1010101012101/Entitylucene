How do sync programs get around the iOS sandbox? <body> The various iOS sync programs (SugarSync, BitTorrent Sync, etc.) claim to be able to read files anywhere on the phone. I don't see how data from my application -- in my app's sandbox -- can be accessed. How is it that these programs are able to read/write outside their sandbox and get my app's data?  <answer143141> strongThey can't/strong as all 3rd-party apps on a non-jailbroken iOS device are limited by the sandbox, both installed from the App Store and from ad-hoc/enterprise distribution.  Either they are using public APIs to access data 'the iOS way' (structured and anticipated) such as accessing the Camera Roll to import/save photos, or are integrated with an app to share data in a way that the developers of emboth/em apps have worked together to make it happen (this doesn't necessarily mean they actually know each other as they could have used a framework, such as the Dropbox framework).  <comment168588> What data are we talking about? Here is the [developers guide for storage](https://developer.apple.com/icloud/documentation/data-storage/). With iOS 8 people will be able to sync using dropbox, one drive, or google drive instead of iCloud drive. But only the ones that are in the "syncable" in the application directory. <comment168589> I think I didn't quiet understand your question. Is SugarSync or BitTorrent Sync a program on iPhone or PC/Mac, because on PC/Mac they can. I have the free iFunBox (i wanted to know what it can do), and with that I can access anything on my iPhone. All the app data, user data etc.
