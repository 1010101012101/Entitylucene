How can I extract chaptering data from a DVD? <body> I'm looking for a method of extracting chapter timings from DVDs. The DVDs are likely to be region-locked. I do not need the names of the chapters, only their start times.  There appears to be some (perhaps slightly shady) Windows freeware that will do this, but I haven't been able to find an equivalent for a Mac. The spec for DVD .IFO files looks complicated enough that I suspect I'd have trouble manually extracting this information from a hex dump (though a well-written tutorial in how to do that might also suffice for my needs).  <comment355825> See this post: [Is there an elegant way to split a file by chapter using ffmpeg?](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30305953/is-there-an-elegant-way-to-split-a-file-by-chapter-using-ffmpeg)
