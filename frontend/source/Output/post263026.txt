How to add a specific file to Firewall Exceptions list? <body> I have to add code/usr/local/lib/node_modules/npm/bin/npm/code to the exception list. I tried to find  and edit codecom.apple.sharing.firewall.plist/code but I didn't found such file anywhere. How can I manually add a specific executable to the exception list?  <answer263060> I don't have enough rep to comment, so I'll attempt an answer...  I wanted to comment since I'd like to clarify why you need to add npm - my install of npm (via homebrew) works OK, without poking a hole in the firewall. Obviously YMMV...! But be aware I've emnot/em properly tested this with npm (I tested adding npm, and it continued to work fine.)  I believe you want the application layer firewall. (It's the same firewall you can also access through System Preferences - Security &amp; Privacy - Firewall).  My socketfilterfw's API appears to have changed from the one discussed in the linked article. I'd suggest caution, and that you check what the API is for your version embefore/em doing anything else:  precode/usr/libexec/ApplicationFirewall/socketfilterfw -h /code/pre  My version of socketfilterfw doesn't have the "-t" option mentioned in the linked article so I had to use:  precode/usr/libexec/ApplicationFirewall/socketfilterfw --add /usr/local/bin/npm /code/pre
