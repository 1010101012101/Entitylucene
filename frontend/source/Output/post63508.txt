Xcode commit view: keyboard shortcut for jumping to the next change? <body> When I commit my code from Xcode (File - Source Control - Commit), is there a command (that can be assigned a shortcut presumably) to jump to the next change in the commit view? This will allow to quickly go over the changes spanned across multiple files being committed. Otherwise there is some mouse work to do, which is not very productive.  <answer64484> No way of doing it as of Xcode 4.4.1
