Yosemite Retail DVD? <body> I understand that Mac OS X is free to download and install however It would be nice to have a DVD backup printed and shipped by Apple just like older Mac OSX releases.  Is this still possible?  <answer171450> It seems that Apple doesn't supply OSX on a retail DVD anymore, since all modern Macs have a recovery partition, which contains the installer and is updateable. However, there are ways to create an installer USB drive, and here is Apple's own solution.     Before you're able to create a bootable OS X installer, you'll need to do the following first:       ol   liDownload the OS X Installer app from the Mac App Store./li   liMount the volume you want to convert into a bootable installer. This could be removable media such as a USB flash drive, or a secondary internal partition./li   liYou can then use the codecreateinstallmedia/code tool to convert the volume from step two into a bootable installer based off the installer app from step one. To learn how to use codecreateinstallmedia/code, use the following command in Terminal:/li   /ol      OS X Yosemite      code/Applications/Install\ OS\ X\ Yosemite.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia/code      OS X Mavericks      code/Applications/Install\ OS\ X\ Mavericks.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia/code      Examples       For example, assuming you have a volume mounted at code/Volumes/MyVolume/code and the OS X installer app is at code/Applications/Install\ OS\ X\ Mavericks.app/code you could erase code/Volumes/MyVolume/code and convert it into a bootable installer with this command:       OS X Yosemite      codesudo /Applications/Install\ OS\ X\ Yosemite.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/MyVolume --applicationpath /Applications/Install\ OS\ X\ Yosemite.app/code      OS X Mavericks      codesudo /Applications/Install\ OS\ X\ Mavericks.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/MyVolume --applicationpath /Applications/Install\ OS\ X\ Mavericks.app/code      Notes      You may need to adjust the path to the OS X installer app and/or your removable media device's name in the command. codecreateinstallmedia/code is an advanced option for system administrators and as such, requires some knowledge of the command line in order to be used properly. It is only intended to be used with the version of the OS X Installer app it came with.   <answer171451> I'm pretty sure you can't buy installer discs from Apple anymore (Lion was the last version they sold an installer for, and that was a USB key, not a DVD. But you can make your own in several different ways:  ul liCreate a USB installer with the codecreateinstallmedia/code tool included in the downloadable installer. See @onik's answer, or Apple Support Article HT201372: "Create a bootable installer for OS X Mavericks or Yosemite". Note that it omits an important first step: make sure the USB disk is formatted with the GPT partition scheme, and the volume you're going to use for the installer is in Mac OS Extended (Journaled) format./li liCreate a USB installer with DiskMaker X -- which basically automates the codecreateinstallmedia/code process./li liIf you really want to make an installer DVD, there's a posting on the MacRumors forum by tywebb13 that gives a command-line procedure for making a disk image that you can burn to DVD. I haven't tested it, but I'll include it here in case that source goes away:  precodehdiutil attach /Applications/Install\ OS\ X\ Yosemite.app/Contents/SharedSupport/InstallESD.dmg -noverify -nobrowse -mountpoint /Volumes/install_app hdiutil convert /Volumes/install_app/BaseSystem.dmg -format UDSP -o /tmp/Yosemite hdiutil resize -size 8g /tmp/Yosemite.sparseimage hdiutil attach /tmp/Yosemite.sparseimage -noverify -nobrowse -mountpoint /Volumes/install_build rm /Volumes/install_build/System/Installation/Packages cp -rp /Volumes/install_app/Packages /Volumes/install_build/System/Installation/ cp -rp /Volumes/install_app/BaseSystem.chunklist /Volumes/install_build cp -rp /Volumes/install_app/BaseSystem.dmg /Volumes/install_build hdiutil detach /Volumes/install_app hdiutil detach /Volumes/install_build hdiutil resize -size `hdiutil resize -limits /tmp/Yosemite.sparseimage | tail -n 1 | awk '{ print $1 }'`b /tmp/Yosemite.sparseimage hdiutil convert /tmp/Yosemite.sparseimage -format UDTO -o /tmp/Yosemite rm /tmp/Yosemite.sparseimage mv /tmp/Yosemite.cdr ~/Desktop/Yosemite.iso /code/pre  ...then use Disk Utility (or whatever you prefer) to burn Yosemite.iso to a DVD./li /ul  <comment201686> Answers below notwithstanding, Modern Macs don't have DVD drives & Apple have never had much history of supporting older machines.
