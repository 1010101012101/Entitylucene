Can one stream photos to Shared Photostream from Finder on a Mac? <body> I know someone who is considering the possibility of setting up an iPad as a digital photo frame. Ideally, they would use Shared Photostreams to easily put pictures on the device. This is easy for any live-updating of the iPad photo frame, but the challenge comes in with the photo archives taken with a standard DSLR camera.  There are many photos, then, that they would like to easily stream from their Mac computer. Because they don't have a lot of extra space on their computer for a large iPhoto library, is it possible to:  ol liManage multiple small iPhoto libraries easily, and if so how would they do that? ul liRight now a number of the photos are on SDs cards. Could they basically convert each SD card to an iPhoto Library and then use that to stream?/li /ul/li liIs it possible to post to a shared Photostream from a Mac Finder window? ul liThis would absolutely be ideal. A 3rd party app would be fine. I picture something like the standard emright-click/em - strongShare/strong./li /ul/li /ol  <answer115487> You can use iPhoto to add to a Photostream from your Mac.  I have Aperture using mine so I cannot fully test it with iPhoto without switching it off in Aperture. But is should work the same way by importing the images into iPhoto which also allows you to organise them.   And then using the Share feature to share to iCloud. ( photostream )  The share with iCloud startup dialogue in iPhoto:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/CdKcS.png" alt="enter image description here"  hr  You can have multiple iPhoto libraries and open any of them as the Library to use by holding down the option/alt  kbd ⌥/kbd  key when Launching iPhoto.  You should get a dialogue similar to this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Di2df.png" alt="enter image description here"  This means you should be able to import a SD card to it's own Library Although it maybe easier to just organise within iPhoto and a singe Library  hr  When selecting an image in Finder. The Share contextual menu does not offer up iCloud. So it looks like no with Finder at the moment  <answer115488> I would recommend Aperture…  ul lih2Tethered Shooting/h2  You mention that the photos would be taken with a standard DSLR. If it's one of the Apple verified cameras (see Apple KB: Aperture 3: Tips on tethered shooting) or many others unverified, then the photos can be automatically imported as they are taken, and therefore automatically shared through Photo Stream.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/44zSW.png" width="300"  This won't prevent the photos from being able to be shared through a Shared Photo Stream later if required.  Also, the files can be stored in a location of your choosing, therefore accessible through Finder if required.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/N7tUH.png" width="250" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/UMBAI.png" width="270"/li lih2Multiple Libraries/h2  You can break down a large library into smaller ones really simply, and switch between them on-the-fly.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4iwRX.png" width="420"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/VOfCl.png" width="400"/li /ul
