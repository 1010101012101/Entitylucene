External monitor on HDMI but no sound <body> This has been asked again but none of the answers apply because I've tried them all:  ul liMy MacBook is a 2013 Retina Macbook Pro, so it supports audio through HDMI/li lithe HDMI cable is plugged directly into the HDMI port (no adapter)/li lithe monitor has speakers, and their volume is to 100% (Asus PA248Q)/li liI've selected the HDMI audio output in the system settings/li liI've tried with a different HDMI cable/li /ul  But still no audio through the monitor's speakers. What am I missing?  FYI, the audio works fine in any other case.  <answer259142> From what I can tell from reading the Specifications Page, there are no speakers built into  this particular monitor.  There are however, two different audio outputs:  HDMI 1.3 and 3.5mm headphone/speaker jack  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NG8uN.png" alt="enter image description here"  The easiest way to test this out is just get a cheap set of speakers or a headset with the 3.5mm jack and plug them in.  If it works, you know all is well with your setup - you just need speakers.  <answer259190> If the screen is connected and switched on, you can select the speakers of your HDMI screen in System Preferences  Sound  Output.  Or if you have the audio volume button in your menubar, you could select it through OPTION + click on audio button. Then select the output device.  <comment324271> I said in the question "I've selected the HDMI audio output in the system settings" <comment324272> Oh my god thanks for reading that page correctly, it seems I wasn't able to do that. I assumed the jack port meant "audio input" (but it says right there "*output*"). I just bought jack cable today and tried it out: it doesn't work as an input. So, you are definitely right. In my defense the back of the screen looks a lot like speakers :) <comment324277> Been there many times...no worries!
