PostgreSQL not in path after installation <body> I installed PostgreSQL using the interactive installer by EnterpriseDB following this link. It defaulted the installation directory to /Library/PostgreSQL/9.6. After successful install, psql is not in the $PATH. I have to navigate to the installation directory or enter the full path execute it:  precodecd /Library/PostgreSQL/9.6/bin ./psql -d template1 /code/pre  Must I add this path to .profile or .bash_profile, create a symlink to /usr/bin? What approach is more suitable for the Mac?  Because this is not working:  precode# ln -s /Library/PostgreSQL/9.6/bin/psql /usr/bin/psql ln: /usr/bin/psql: Operation not permitted /code/pre  Temporary solution:  precodesh-3.2# ln -s postgres /usr/local/bin/postgres sh-3.2# ln -s createdb /usr/local/bin/createdb sh-3.2# ln -s createuser /usr/local/bin/createuser sh-3.2# ln -s dropdb /usr/local/bin/dropdb sh-3.2# ln -s dropuser /usr/local/bin/dropuser sh-3.2# ln -s initdb /usr/local/bin/initdb sh-3.2# ln -s pg_ctl /usr/local/bin/pg_ctl sh-3.2# ln -s pg_dump /usr/local/bin/pg_dump sh-3.2# ln -s pg_dumpall /usr/local/bin/pg_dumpall /code/pre  <answer262843> In contrary to other PostgreSQL installers (e.g. Homebrew), the EnterpriseDB installer doesn't install the PostgreSQL executables in a path covered by your default $PATH.  So either add it to your .bash_profile file  precode... export PATH="/Library/PostgreSQL/9.6/bin:$PATH" ... /code/pre  or  precode... export PATH="$PATH:/Library/PostgreSQL/9.6/bin" ... /code/pre  or symlink the executables to /usr/local/bin:  precodeln -s /Library/PostgreSQL/9.6/bin/* /usr/local/bin /code/pre  You can't link them to /usr/bin/ because this path is protected by SIP and - after disabling SIP - a sudoer would have to prepend emsudo/em  to link the files. /usr/local/bin is the default path for user installed executables anyway, so stay with this one.  <comment329812> I guess homebrew was the way to go <comment356980> It appears the EnterpriseDB installation is junk. I wanted to use Postgis and I read the installer notes: http://postgis.net/install/ (The OSX PostgreSQL/Stackbuilder combination from EnterpriseDB has had mixed reliability. Avoid)
