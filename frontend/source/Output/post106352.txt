How can I customise the toolbar in the new iWork apps? <body> Since the update to the iWork app suite, it appears that it is no longer possible to customise the toolbar with option from the right-click menu. All you can do is hide the text, or hide the entire toolbar:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MJxdX.png" height="60"  In addition, you can't ⌘-drag any of the toolbar buttons, whether that be to different places on the toolbar, or off the toolbar completely…  I really want to remove the Tips subimg src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ekzcb.png" height="17"/sub button, as well as re-arrange some things to make it more like how I had iWork '09 set up.  Is there a Terminal command or other preference to re-enable the customisation of the toolbar, or at the least a command to forcibly remove the Tips button from the toolbar?  <answer111590> This has been fixed in Pages 5.0.1, Numbers 3.0.1 and Keynote 6.0.1.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YN32s.png"
