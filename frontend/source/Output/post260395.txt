Disable Arrow Keys + Command reshaping windows in Windows VM <body> Whenever I press Command and an arrow key in my Windows VM it resizes the current Window to the left or right half of the screen.  I frequently press these by accident.  I can't see this keyboard combination in Parallels settings - and can't find any way to disable it in Windows (I think Command is mapped to the Windows key - or is it the alt key - I can't see this either).  How can I disable this and most other keyboard shortcuts in my Windows VM?
