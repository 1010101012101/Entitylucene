OSX Yosemite won't show desktop <body> So I got some freeze issue and beach ball indicator was appeared for me. So I was watching rotation of it during ten minutes and then hard reset my mac. So did because I can't click any buttons or apple menu. Just keyboard caps lock pressing shows me that there is some reaction from my actions.  After reset I pick a user entered a password and then saw this screen:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QwvQl.jpg" alt="enter image description here"    And after that I saw this screen and it was last:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FdMgz.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <comment217206> Seems I have this problem http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=1804212 <comment217210> That looks like your GPU died, and it also can not find the boot volume. Did you try to boot in support modes  or from external device ? As you know hard reset is not recommended since it can create problems. <comment217231> Why do you think his GPU died? <comment217274> I'd like confirmation from the OP that the heavy moir√© on the first picture is just a camera effect, & wasn't actually visible on screen, before deciding whether or not that could be a GPU issue. If it's not, then it's a simple HD failure <comment217278> @Tetsujin yep it is just a camera <comment217279> OK, then it's a drive failure - see if you can repair it by starting in Recovery Mode - Cmd/R at the chimes <comment217289> @Tetsujin is there any way how to download all current files from disk utility without osx, because after I click cmd r I can access to disk utility, how can I copy HDD to external USB HDD ? Is it possible? <comment217295> You may be able to do it from single user mode, but you'd need someone better at terminal than me ;)
