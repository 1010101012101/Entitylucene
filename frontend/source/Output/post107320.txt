How can I make a watermark with hyperlink in a PDF document? <body> I have a large number of PDF documents that I am trying to process consistently  One thing that I would like to do with them before uploading them into the public domain is to add watermarks at the bottom of every page with a hyperlink back to my website  I might be missing something, but I can't seem to accomplish this in Adobe Acrobat XI Professional for the Mac  I can't find any way to do this in Preview, either  I'm looking forward to seeing what's out there!
