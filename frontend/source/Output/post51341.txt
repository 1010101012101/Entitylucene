QR code reader for OS X 10.6? <body> I'm looking for a QR code reader that doesn't utilize iSight but instead, allows me to take a screenshot of a portion of the screen which it will then scan for and detect the QR code. I'm having trouble finding one because most QR code readers for mac that I can see uses the iSight which is not what I am after.  <answer51510> http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/quickmark-qr-code-reader/id412378487?mt=12  you can try ihis.  <answer51512> An alternative to a native OS X application is an online QR code reader, such as   ul liZXing /li liminiQR (also allows you to use your iSight camera) /li liOnline Barcode Reader (also decodes barcodes; an added plus)/li liPatrick Wied QR Generator (also allows you to create QR codes)./li /ul  All of these services are free. To use them, all you need to do is upload a screenshot, and the website will return the result.  <comment58883> Answers on Ask Different need to be more than just a link. It's okay to include a link, but please summarize or excerpt it in the answer. The idea is to make the answer stand alone. <comment65228> +1 for Zxing, which can be compiled as a CLI application.
