Fullscreen app location in Mission Control <body> Is is possible to make the fullscreen applications be put right next to the desktop you are currently on, rather than to the right of all existing desktops in Mission Control?  <answer134608> Yes, go into System PreferencesMission Control. Check the box next to "Automatically rearrange Spaces based on most recent use"  <comment159358> Does that actually do what I want? I thought that just arranged the spaces randomly based on what it thinks you use <comment159579> No, it rearranges based on most recent use. You can always disable it if it isn't what you want. <comment159580> This is not quite what I'm looking for. I only want to affect the location of new spaces. <comment159591> This isn't possible in that configuration then
