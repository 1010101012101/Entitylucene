How to gain access into /etc/networks/loopback file from terminal? <body> In the terminal I am typing:  strongsudo vi /etc/networks/loopback/strong  , but I am getting a permission denied inside the vi editor.  The /etc/networks file has this inside:  precode## # Networks Database ## loopback    127    loopback-net /code/pre  hr  Are those three items actual files I can go into?  hr  I am running El Capitan Version 10.11.6.  Thank you.  Edit: I rebooted into recovery mode, typed in csrutil disable, and now when I type in sudo vi /etc/network/loopback I get this output:  precodeE575: viminfo: Illegal starting char in line: /private/etc/networks E575: viminfo: Illegal starting char in line: ^I"^I1^I0  Press ENTER or type command to continue  /code/pre  Then when I press enter, it goes into the vi editor but it still says [permission denied] on the bottom.  <answer286239> strong/etc/networks is not a folder/strong, it's a plain text file with the contents given in your question.  loopback, 127 and loopback-net are not files within a file, they're just words within the contents of the /etc/networks file, as part of the configuration expressed within. There's no /etc/networks/loopback, as it's just the file /etc/networks with the word loopback within.
