How to set fmask, dmask or umask on OS X? <body> I want external drives mounted with specified permissions. I know that emfmask/em, emdmask/em and emumask/em in emfstab/em do this trick.  I added this line to code/etc/fstab/code:  precodeLABEL=D2-HT250   none    msdos   rw,auto,fmask=0122 0 0 /code/pre  But when I checked file permissions, still coderwxrwxrwx/code. OS X simply ignored the codefmask=0122/code option.  How to set masks on OS X? (I am using OS X 10.9 Mavericks.)  <comment255974> To be clear, OS X permission model is more layered than POSIX. Is there an end goal other than setting the underlying posix permissions which ACL will trump always anyhow? (Basically this looks like a classic XY question) <comment256022> Since it's being mounted as an `msdos` volume, and assuming it's formatted `FAT32`, then therein lies your problem as FAT32 does not support basic Unix permissions and all files and folders will always show `rwxrwxrwx`.
