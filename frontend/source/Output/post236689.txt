Removing a lost iPhone from find my iphone/apple id <body> My iPhone was stolen back in february, since than it was on pending lost mode... by now I realized I will not see it again so I removed it from my apple id and from find my iPhone, now I saw that the activation lock was disabled which means that someone can re-use it, but the fact that I removed it from my account also removed the password it had?  Thanks in advance   <comment289722> Lost stolen iPhones should be left on your account forever.  Apple should make a "hide this lost/stolen device until there's something to tell you" option tho because way too many people make this mistake.  If the password you refer to is the unlock PIN, that has not been removed from the phone. <comment289775> @Tyson well, I removed it, I did it because I know there is 0% chance that I will get the device back, therefore there is no reason it will be associated with my Apple ID, too risky:/, it has been offline for over two and a half months..I did wipe it remotely, off course it was pending, anyway it has a strong password on, not the 4/8 digits pin rubbish BTW, In my opinion whoever took it put it in to recovery mode, so now they will be able to use it, but my data is safe, correct? <comment289779> The reason to leave it attached to your appleId is so that it can't ever be attached to a different appleId.  Data on an iPhone is pretty secure especially if you were using a strong password.   You might have followed the recent news item that Apple doesn't even have the tools to break in, there was a company that was successful tho, it can be done but likely they wanted your phone for the hardware, and there a good chance since it never came back online that it was parted out... I.e. Disassembled for the parts that are useable for repairs. <comment289781> @Tyson thanks for your help, as long as data is secured I am happy.. For the record I removed it from my appleid only when I knew I won't see the device again...
