Is it possible to change text size & formatting of Numbers' formula input field? <body> Is it possible to set the text-size and possibly other formatting of the actual values/formula input field in Apple iWork Numbers?  Comparing these two screenshots, it seems possible to set the size of the text to something larger.  Too small text-size for my taste:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/99oww.png" alt="Text-size too small for my taste"  Easier to read (screenshot originally posted here):  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0jKDT.png" alt="Text-size better sized for my taste"  <answer51040> When I click in the formula entry bar I get an additional toolbar that has a "Formula Text Size" field. Does this appear on your screen?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KPTBV.png" alt="enter image description here"  Here's a screenshot from the Numbers '09 User's Guide:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/E8yIb.png" alt="enter image description here"  sI haven't found a way to make it larger than 14./s  h2Edit/h2  I figured out how to make it larger than 14.  ol liQuit Numbers/li liRun Terminal/li liType the following command:/li /ol  codedefaults write com.apple.iWork.Numbers LSFormulaBarFontSize 80/code  When you run Numbers again your formula bar is plenty big:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7Ilqh.png" alt="Big Big Bar"  You can use a number smaller than 80 in the Terminal command for a more reasonably-sized formula bar.  <comment58253> I'd like to know how as well. Thanks for posting this. <comment58499> Wow. That's an astonishing answer. It's funny I didn't see that `Formula text size` dropdown menu (it's even there in my second screenshot, hehe). And the `defaults` command you provided is simply brilliant. Thank you.
