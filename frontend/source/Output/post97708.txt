Mounting Remote Server for editing files on my Mac <body> My web development server is in the Cloud and I am very new to Macs.  On Ubuntu and other flavors of Linux, I would mount the remote drives using sshfs. I have researched SSHFS for Mac and come up with strongFUSE for OS x/strong and strongMacFUSE/strong. I have them both installed but when I attempt to run emman sshfs/em on my commandline I get a command not found error.  Unless I am missing something, I can't find simple instructions to help me resolve this issue.  I have tried strongMount/strong and strongMount_smbfs/strong too but I immediately get emserver connection failed: operation timed out/em errors.  My Mac runs on OS X Lion 10.7.5 (11G63)  Can anyone please give me some simple steps to help overcome this obstacle?  <answer97711> If you have installed strongFuse for OSX/strong you will find the binary you are searching at code/Applications/Macfusion.app/Contents/PlugIns/sshfs.mfplugin/Contents/Resources/sshfs-static/code.  You can use codeln -s [Path-like-above] [Your-favorit-bin-path]/sshfs/code if you want to call it with codesshfs/code.  If you get a codecommand not found/code error and not a codeNo manual entry for sshfs/code, then codeman/code is not found and this indicates no issue with strongsshfs/strong.  <answer104895> It looks like the software might not be installed the right way, or in the right place.  On a Mac, the easiest way to install sshfs and fuse is with Homebrew.    ol liInstall Homebrew http://brew.sh/ /li licodebrew install sshfs/code  This will install dependencies such as fuse4x.  Read all the instructions that appear -- some of other steps may be required, such as  codebrew link fuse4x/codebr codesudo /bin/cp -rfX /usr/local/Cellar/fuse4x-kext/0.9.2/Library/Extensions/fuse4x.kext /Library/Extensions/codebr codesudo chmod +s /Library/Extensions/fuse4x.kext/Support/load_fuse4x/code/li /ol  <answer129922> First, you don't want to have both MacFUSE and FUSE for OS X (OSXFUSE) installed, OSXFUSE is a replacement for MacFUSE, which is no longer under active development.   OSXFUSE is not an application, it is a kernel extension and libraries that allow developers to easily write a file system that lives in user space rather than in the kernel. Once you have it installed you need to then install a file system, in your case sshfs, which can be found on the OSXFUSE website (http://osxfuse.github.io/).  Once you have both OSXFUSE and sshfs installed then you still won't have a Mac application, but you will have a command line tool codesshfs/codein code/usr/local/bin/code and a codeman sshfs/code at the command line will give you the manual page for it.  If you would like a GUI then you can install Macfusion (http://macfusionapp.org/) and follow the instructions here (https://github.com/osxfuse/osxfuse/wiki/SSHFS#macfusion) so that it uses the much more reliable OSXFUSE version of sshfs rather than the MacFUSE based one it ships with.  <comment114767> Thank you for you answer Dor. Whilest I can see FUSE for OS x clearly installed in the System Preference area, I can't navigate to it via the command line. It just lists all the other applications except for FUSE OS X
