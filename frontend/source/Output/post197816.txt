How can I regain the Instant Hotspot feature in Yosemite after noticeable errors? <body> While normal hotspot interaction functions perfectly between an iPhone 6 (iOS 8.4) and my MBPr '14 with Yosemite 10.10.4, the Instant Hotspot feature does not. emThis feature used to work, but after some time this feature stopped working./em  I found the source of the issue, but can't determine how to resolve it.   My Yosemite logs reveal some errors.  codecom.apple.preferences.icloud.remoteservice[749]: [-[CastlePlugin appleIDNeedsFixing]]/code codeaccountsd[270]: Deleting com.apple.gs.appleid.auth service token/code codeAppleIDAuthAgent[286] SERVER AppleIDAuth: Forgetting account "&lt;my-apple-id&gt;@?????.???"/code  codeSDHotspotBrowser::appendHashToData:withType: No apple ID hash/code codeSDHotspotBrowser::restartAdvertisingTetheringRequest Did not start advertising request/code  Steps I've tried that have not worked:  ul liSigning out and back in to AppleID on both devices/li liClean restore of iOS to iPhone/li liEnsuring wifi and bluetooth enabled on both devices, neither with an active wifi connection/li liAll the above steps with full LTE coverage and 12 inch proximity between devices/li /ul  <answer198427>    strongUPDATED/strong to reflect confirmation an further testing of OP's solution.   In looking at the steps you have taken, I am assuming that by signing out and back into AppleID on both devices that you mean that the strongaccount in iCloud is the SAME/strong if you look in settings iCloud on strongBOTH devices/strong. If that isn't the case, then those need to be in sync. strongEDIT:/strong Also as y3sh found out, having more than one iCloud account can cause additional issues.  Next open the strongBluetooth Settings/strong on both devices turn on their antennas. You will also need to have the WiFi antenna of your Mac turned on. It is not necessary to have the iPhone WiFi antenna on, so long as it is set up to use Cellular Data.  At this point you should be able to see your strong"Instant" Hotspot/strong as a selection under your available WiFi Networks. Clicking on it will establish the link and takes care of the rest. You will not need to have established the link with strongPersonal Hotspots/strong before, and you will not need to add the password seen in strongPersonal Hotspots/strong. strongInstant Hotspots/strong takes care of the log in for you automatically.  There is a switch under strongSettings Personal Hotspots/strong that will be automatically turned on by strongInstant Hotspot/strong when it forms the connection. If you do not want your iPhone to continue broadcasting its Hotspot after you have completed your session, you may have to manually turn this option off. A blue menu bar at the top of your iPhone will tell you whether or not it is still broadcasting the Hotspot. There is a switch under strongSettings Personal Hotspots/strong that will be green. Switch that off and the Hotspot will stop broadcasting.  Another note is that you are strongNOT/strong required to have strongHandoff/strong under strongGeneralHandoff &amp; Suggested Apps/strong turned on on your iPhone in order to form the strongInstant Hotspot/strong form the connection between your iPhone and your Mac.  After all of this you should see your iPhone as an option under WiFi on your MBP. If you click it, the Instant Hotspot should be established right away. And if you still can't get connected, you did get AppleCare, didn't you? ☺︎  <answer198438> While other answers here may help troubleshooting other causes of instant hotpsot failure, mine was caused by having two iCloud accounts used for keeping some syncing features separate.

It will go a long way in helping others. It didn't solve my problem, but I think this page can help provide more workarounds for odd issues rather than the dreaded "me too!" apple forums. Consider revising your answer, because it contains some innacuracies: personal hotspot does not need to be on, the device does not need to be paired over bluetooth at any point in time, and the iphone _can_ remain in the mac's preferred networks. <comment237466> It appears that you only thing that you need is to have the same single iCloud account logged in on each device and Blue Tooth on and the Mac to have its WiFi antenna turned on. **Instant Hotspot** actually turns on **Personal Hotspots** for you on your iPhone. It also adds the iPhone and sign in data to your Network Preferences under Wi-Fi **Preferred Networks**. Also Handoff's can be turned off as well and it still works.
