Will Parallels Desktop harm the hardware of my MBP? <body> I am running VM, PD in particular, on my MBP.  I have encountered several scary things today: machine noise (sounds like "Kah-Kah") occurs while I am in 64-bit Windows 7 in VM.  Will the PD actually harm the hardware of my MBP? The sound is really scary!  <comment135937> How old is your MBP ? If you have a HardDrive does the sound comes from it ? (AFAIK, PD should not "able" to hard a computer.) <comment135943> @MatthieuRiegler it is the newest. So I guess it is already SSD. Yeah, exactly! The sound is just like from a hard disk! <comment135965> I wonder if there are recorded sounds in Parallels similar to how electric vehicles are now getting recorded engine noises to alert sentient beings that they are in motion. <comment136009> @FarticlePilter you have a Retina MacBook Pro ? If so please edit your post.
