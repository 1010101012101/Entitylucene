UI becomes extremely unresponsive <body> Hardware: MBP Retina, 13-inch, Late 2013  OS: OS X 10.9.3  For a while the UI has become totally unresponsive. I tried to run Activity from Spotlight, but I am only able to see the Activity app in search result but unable to select it.  At the end I have to reboot the machine.  After reboot, I can see a lof of error message in Console like this:  precode13/07/2014 7:00:01.477 pm WindowServer[146]: common_reenable_update: UI updates were finally reenabled by application "VirtualBox" after 10.54 seconds (server forcibly re-enabled them after 1.14 seconds) /code/pre  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/RwwSy.png" alt="Console messages"  They are followed by these message:  precode13/07/2014 7:01:30.934 pm WindowServer[146]: CGError post_notification(const CGSNotificationType, void *const, const size_t, const bool, const CGSRealTimeDelta, const int, const CGSConnectionID *const, const pid_t): Timed out 1.000 second wait for reply from "TextEdit" for synchronous notification type 102 (kCGSDisplayWillSleep) (CID 0x272d3, PID 9516) /code/pre  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gZvub.png" alt="enter image description here"  Is the information sufficient to deduce what has caused the UI unresponsiveness ?  <comment163708> Does this only happen when you are running VirtualBox? <comment163710> It happened once so far. Yes, virtual box was running. <comment163711> I'm assuming you had something running in a VirtualBox VM at the time the UI became unresponsive? Was whatever was running in the VM doing something particularly intensive at the time?
