Snow Leopard Time Machine backups are not visible in Lion <body> I upgraded to Lion recently.  I noticed tonight that backups performed on Snow Leopard do not show in the Time Machine interface so I cannot restore from them.  If I browse my backup volume I can see my backups exist right back to December 2009.  How do I get Time Machine in Lion to recognize my old backups?  <answer26240> Well, without doing anything apart from rebooting my Mac and my NAS drive the backups are now visible so I wasted 50 points on a bounty I didn't need.  Oh well...  <comment29534> Related information: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/17804/can-i-restore-a-snow-leopard-backup-onto-a-lion-machine <comment29815> Thanks Philip that's useful information but doesn't help me achieve what I want. <comment29957> And here goes quote from IT Crowd: “Have you tried to turn it off and on again?” ;-) <comment29960> Haha, well being in I.T. I tried that several times but to no avail.  Maybe there's a specific number of times I needed to turn it off and on.  ;o) <comment29963> Actually yes, it's 3, "Threefold repetition"... Maybe you can award the points to someone and they can award them back; Then your points are not wasted as you put it.
