The pinentry dialog always shows in the first tab of iTerm2 <body> If I have multiple tabs open in iTerm2, any operation I do that requires the gpg-agent to display the pinentry dialog has to happen in the first tab. If I perform the operation in any other tab, the pinentry dialog will still display in the first tab, but will fail regardless of what I input.  Does anyone have any ideas what's going on here?
