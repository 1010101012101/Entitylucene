Messages.app won't add new account <body> I recently decided I'd try to use Messages.app instead of Adium as my all-in-one chat app, and was immediately stymied by the + button in the Accounts pane not working.br I click the button, it darkens to indicate I clicked, and then nothing happens.    I've tried adding it to Messages through System Preferences  Mail, Contacts &amp; Calendars, just by checking the box next to Messages on my Gmail account, but that just gives me the error "There was a problem setting up the account.  An unknown error occurred."    I am using two-factor authentication on my google account, but my Mail account is properly set up with an application-specific password.  I imagine things might work better if I could add the account to Messages specifically, with a different application-specific password, but since the + button in Accounts isn't working, that doesn't seem to be an option.    Anyone else had similar problems and solved them, preferably without reinstalling the OS?  Edit: Running Mountain Lion 10.8.3, no updates available in Software Update.  <answer92619> Gave up last night and reinstalled OS X, everything seems to work fine now.   <comment108481> Delete the account and start over. <comment108554> @Buscarì›ƒ, do you mean delete the user account?  I've tried making a new one and setting up Messages in there, same problem.  I guess that suggests I should really just reinstall. <comment108629> Good Job :)....
