VMware Fusion 6.0.3: "reclaimable" stays zero for Windows 7 VM <body> I have a Windows 7 x64 Update 1 guest VM on a host with OS X Mavericks (10.9.2) and VMware Fusion 6.0.3:  ul liThe Windows 7 guest has a sparse HDD of 30 gigabyte, with about 5 gigabyte free, and the latest VMware Tools running./li liOS X indicates the full size of the VM directory is (32,2 GB on disk) for 655 items (most of the items are in the various caches, most of the size is in the VMDK files)/li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/R94fl.png" alt="enter image description here"  VMware claims that VMware Fusion can reclaim space, but in my situation VMware Fusion never shows it can consolidate.   I tried this again with a Windows 8.1 110 gigabyte HDD that has about 10 gigabyte free: same result.  This is what I tried to force VMware Fusion to recognize there is something to consolidate:  ol lishutdown the VM/li lidefrag the VM, then shutdown the VM/li lidefrag the VM, then shutdown the VM and restart VMware Fusion/li lidefrag the VM, run codesdelete -c C:/code inside the VM, then shutdown the VM, then restart VMware Fusion/li /ol  Still no luck: the reclaimable size stays zero (see image below).    emWhat should I do to force reclaim of the disk?/em  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/f6L0N.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer141483> For Windows 8.x, this works:  ol liDefrag the C: drive with these commands to defrag the files, then the free space:  codedefrag /v /h /u C:/codebr codedefrag /x /v /h /u C:/code/li liReclaim the disk space in VMware Fusion 6.0.4:  ul liShut down the virtual machine./li liGo to codeVirtual Machine/code  codeSettings/code  codeGeneral/code./li liSelect codeClean Up Virtual Machine/code./li /ul/li /ol  Somehow this does not work for my Windows 7 VM. I even tried emMyDefrag/em free space optimization without success.  <comment166478> Same for VMware Fusion 6.0.4 and same for Windows 8.0 and 8.1 clients.
