Sharing iCloud storage between family members <body> Is there a way to share iCloud storage between family members?   I included my wife's iPhone into Family sharing, but I would like to have one storage bucket (20G) that would allow us both Apple ID accounts to backup more then default 5G per device. Is it possible?  <answer187125> The correct answer is No, there is not.  Apple does not let you share iCloud Storage with family members, unfortunately.  Here's a forum link where this has been discussed:  https://discussions.apple.com/thread/6543858  You can share your account and password, but then the storage is yours and not really sharing with a sub-account. Each individual Apple ID gets their own paid/gifted/free storage quota and any one account can bump up their storage only and it doesn't affect any other AppleID storage capacity - family membership regardless.  <answer286565> This feature is coming in iOS 11 (see iMore). From that page:     .. yes, now you can share that data with your family, with up to six   people using one storage plan for backups, files, and photos.   Presumably, each family member's files are only available to that   person, unlike, say, Family Sharing of iTunes, iBooks, and App Store   content.   <comment221129> Basically this is asking if account A needs 5.5 GB and account B needs 10.5 GB, can they avoid paying for 40 GB (20 x 2) and still have backup fit in one 20 GB payment.
