Xcode odd behaiviour and bad rendering code <body> Recently I'm experiencing some odd behavior from Xcode. It jump up and down on its own, it does not render codes correctly. Like this screenshot â†“  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/EJa08.png" alt="Xcode screenshot - odd behavior"  It's driving me crazy. Have this ever occurred to anybody else? Is there a solution?  P.S. this problem happens with both Objective-C and Objective-C++ and with every theme I use. (Currently I'm using xcode 6.3)  <answer211061> I think that was a bug at XCode 6. Since XCode 7 I have not encountered this problem.  <answer235655> Turn off the strongShow live issues/strong checkbox in strongXcode  Preferences  General/strong (found near the top of the panel).  I was experiencing the same issue. I found this answer through Editor glitch when editing near end of long file in Apple's Developer Forums.   It worked for me running Xcode 7.3 with a 2706 line file. The glitch happened around line 2250.  <comment255399> The bottom line is: I had the problem which has been +1ed (the question) & after 3 months and releasing a new version of XCode it appeared it was due to a rendering bug (the answer). How the hell this could result in down vote to the answer????????????? So not answering this question was a better option??????? <comment311412> I'm not your downvoter, but this still happens to me in xcode 7.3.1, so perhaps the downvoter had a similar experience <comment359080> I hate having to disable a feature, but it did fix the problem. It was happening to me in a file of only 435 lines. <comment359081> This bug is happening to me in Xcode 8.3.2
