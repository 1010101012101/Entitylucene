iTunes doesn't detect non-synced PDFs <body> I am running iTunes and iCloud on Windows 10 and keep running into this problem. On my iPad I have downloaded numerous PDFs from the internet and synced them with iCloud. When I try to sync my iPad with iTunes, iTunes doesn't detect any PDF files on the iPad and the "Transfer Purchases" command has no effect. When I try to sync PDF files from my iTunes library to my iPad, the PDFs synced with iCloud are not deleted.  iTunes is unable to detect or modify PDF files on the iPad unless they were originally synced from the iTunes library. There is no way for me to download PDF files stored in iCloud onto my PC. This is a pretty huge oversight.  Is there any way for me to copy my PDF files from iCloud/iBooks into iTunes library?
