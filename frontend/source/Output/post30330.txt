Bluetooth mouse quit functioning after lion 10.7.2 update <body> I will be as short yet detailed possible.  The devices are Microsoft IntelliMouse Bluetooth mouse and keyboard.  The keyboard still works.  The mouse no longer works properly since I updated from lion 10.7.1 to 10.7.2. The keyboard connects and pairs, the mouse will "connect" during the initial setup but never shows the status "paired," although I never noticed if it was "paired" in the past.  The mouse works during the initial setup.  It will also work 50% of the time if I just press the sync button on the bottom of the mouse.  Each time it works until the connection is lost due to inactivity and then its down again until I perform one of those previous two steps.  In the bluetooth status bar the mouse and keyboard both show up as system devices.  When I first click the mouse during a period of inactivity it alerts bluetooth, in the status of the menu bar the "Microsoft Mouse" becomes bold as if the device is connected, but there is never activity from the mouse.  I have already tried the following.  ol liRemove Bluetooth with bluetooth manager and re-setup (restart in between)/li liRemove via bluetooth preferences pane and re-setup (restart in between)/li liReset SMC/li liReset PRAM/li liunchecked the box "allow bluetooth devices to wake this computer" (it was already checked so I tried both ways)/li liClean install of Lion 10.7.2/li liI tried completely removing all microsoft drivers (100% during the lion CLEAN install) and it is still broken.  Unfortunately the copy of lion I have is from the Mac App store and it is 10.7.2./li liI have removed and reinstalled every way I can think, by mouse preference pane, bluetooth manager, bluetooth pref pane, etc.../li liActually this is the first thing I did, but I changed the batteries with three new sets just to be certain./li liTried pairing in the bluetooth manager/li /ol  I have browsed google and some forums and can't figure out a fix.  Based on the console files, I suspect that Lion's blued is expecting some sort of passphrase from the mouse but it is a mouse?  It does not have a passphrase and never has from what I remember.  I will show the console errors, if someone knows how I can assign a passphrase or give the bluetooth daemon the setting no passphrase required for the mouse device type, I think that might fix the problem.  In the meantime I will look for how to manually add a bluetooth device in OSX.     Console errors, these occur not when I first click the mouse from a disconnected state, but after 15-20 seconds after the connection fails:  precodeNov  6 00:13:09 harrys-MacBook kernel[0]: [SendHCIRequestFormatted] ### ERROR: [0x0411] (Authentication Requested) -- Send request failed (err = 0x0010 (kBluetoothHCIErrorHostTimeout)) Nov  6 00:13:09 harrys-MacBook kernel[0]: [SendHCIRequestFormatted] ### ERROR: [0x080D] (Write Link Policy Settings) -- Send request failed (err = 0x0002 (kBluetoothHCIErrorNoConnection)) Nov  6 00:13:09 harrys-MacBook kernel[0]: [SendHCIRequestFormatted] ### ERROR: [0x0C37] (Write Link Supervision Timeout) -- Send request failed (err = 0x0002 (kBluetoothHCIErrorNoConnection)) Nov  6 00:13:23 harrys-MacBook kernel[0]: [SendHCIRequestFormatted] ### ERROR: [0x0405] (Create Connection) -- Send request failed (err = 0x0004 (kBluetoothHCIErrorPageTimeout)) Nov  6 00:13:23 harrys-MacBook kernel[0]: [SendHCIRequestFormatted] ### ERROR: [0x040C] (Link Key Request Negative Reply) -- Send request failed (err = 0x0002 (kBluetoothHCIErrorNoConnection)) Nov  6 00:32:40 harrys-MacBook kernel[0]: [SendHCIRequestFormatted] ### ERROR: [0x0411] (Authentication Requested) -- Send request failed (err = 0x0010 (kBluetoothHCIErrorHostTimeout)) Nov  6 00:32:40 harrys-MacBook kernel[0]: [SendHCIRequestFormatted] ### ERROR: [0x080D] (Write Link Policy Settings) -- Send request failed (err = 0x0002 (kBluetoothHCIErrorNoConnection)) Nov  6 00:32:40 harrys-MacBook kernel[0]: [SendHCIRequestFormatted] ### ERROR: [0x0C37] (Write Link Supervision Timeout) -- Send request failed (err = 0x0002 (kBluetoothHCIErrorNoConnection)) Nov  6 00:32:48 harrys-MacBook kernel[0]: [SendHCIRequestFormatted] ### ERROR: [0x0C20] (Write Authentication Enable) -- Send request failed (err = 0xE00002ED (kIOReturnNotResponding)) Nov  6 00:33:01 harrys-MacBook kernel[0]: [SendHCIRequestFormatted] ### ERROR: [0x0405] (Create Connection) -- Send request failed (err = 0x0004 (kBluetoothHCIErrorPageTimeout)) Nov  6 00:33:01 harrys-MacBook kernel[0]: [SendHCIRequestFormatted] ### ERROR: [0x040C] (Link Key Request Negative Reply) -- Send request failed (err = 0x0002 (kBluetoothHCIErrorNoConnection)) /code/pre  Bluetooth system information:  precodeApple Bluetooth Software Version:   4.0.1f4   Hardware Settings:   Address:  00-1e-52-d2-cf-91   Manufacturer: Cambridge Silicon Radio   Name: harry’s MacBook   Firmware Version: 1965   Bluetooth Power:  On   Discoverable: No   Vendor ID:    0x5ac   Product ID:   0x8205   HCI Version:  3 (0x3)   HCI Revision: 1965 (0x7ad)   LMP Version:  3 (0x3)   LMP Subversion:   1965 (0x7ad)   Device Type (Major):  Computer   Device Type (Complete):   Mac Portable   Composite Class Of Device:    3801356 (0x3a010c)   Device Class (Major): 1 (0x1)   Device Class (Minor): 3 (0x3)   Service Class:    464 (0x1d0)   Services:   Bluetooth File Transfer:   Folder other devices can browse:  ~/Public   Requires Authentication:  Yes   State:    Enabled   Bluetooth File Exchange:   Folder for accepted items:    ~/Downloads   Requires Authentication:  No   When other items are accepted:    Ask   When PIM items are accepted:  Ask   When receiving items: Prompt for each file   State:    Enabled   Devices (Paired, Favorites, etc):   Microsoft Keyboard:   Address:  00-0d-3a-a4-f2-b6   Type: Keyboard   Firmware Version: 0x10   Services: Microsoft¬Æ Keyboard Elite for Bluetooth¬Æ   Paired:   Yes   Favorite: No   Connected:    Yes   Manufacturer: Broadcom (0x2, 0x100)   Vendor ID:    0x45e   Product ID:   0x99   EDR Supported:    No   eSCO Supported:   No   Incoming Serial Ports:   Bluetooth-PDA-Sync:   RFCOMM Channel:   3   Requires Authentication:  No   Outgoing Serial Ports:   Bluetooth-Modem:   Address:     RFCOMM Channel:   0   Requires Authentication:  No /code/pre  <comment34794> Just to rule out the obvious: Did you put fresh batteries into the mouse? Did you try to re-pair the  mouse with the Mac? <comment38215> I have the same problem, as soon my computer sleeps the mouse will lose the connection. This worked perfectly in snowleopard but fail's in Lion. the preferences of bluetooth sais that this device is not paired. <comment38218> Thanks for this thorough documentation of your problem. Now the obvious question: Have you contacted Microsoft tech support and asked them if they know of any issues? <comment44239> Did you get any feedback on this, I am having similar problems with bluetooth mice (Rocketfish and Gear Head brands I tried)
