Amending PATH so that /usr/local/bin is ahead of /usr/bin <body> I'm trying to install brew but get the following warning:  precodeWarning: /usr/bin occurs before /usr/local/bin This means that system-provided programs will be used instead of those provided by Homebrew. The following tools exist at both paths:  2to3 2to3-2.7 idle idle2.7 pydoc pydoc2.7 python python-config python2.7 python2.7-config pythonw pythonw2.7 smtpd.py smtpd2.7.py  Consider amending your PATH so that /usr/local/bin is ahead of /usr/bin in your PATH. /code/pre  I have no idea how to amend the path.  I've explored several files from this stack overflow post (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8886114/using-brew-with-ruby-1-9-2), but can't find a relevan path to edit.  The only file that I do have that exists is my /etc/profile file which currently looks like:  precode# Setting PATH for Python 2.7 # The orginal version is saved in .bash_profile.pysave     PATH="/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/local/bin:${PATH}" export PATH /code/pre  I wanted to just uninstall python then reinstall it through homebrew, but am a little nervous about breaking too many things at once.  Is there an easy way to amend the path?  Should I create a .bash_profile file?  Thank you for any help in advance.  <answer49399> Yes, create a code.bash_profile/code file in your home directory containing  precodePATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH" /code/pre  and then do one of the following to make the change active  ul liexecute code. ~/.bash_profile/code/li liexecute codePATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH"/code in the current shell/li lirestart Terminal/li /ul  <answer49961> You need to amend /etc/paths so that /usr/local/bin is listed before em/usr/bin/em. You'll need to sudo your editor in order to do that.  One of the ways to open editor is  precode sudo open -t /etc/paths /code/pre  <comment56551> Thank you!  My system is now 'raring to brew' <comment56572> @threenovation if the answer above is correct, can I suggest you mark it as answer (click the tick next to the answer) <comment57769> I wonder if this should be exported? Child processes should have this new path also. Also: When I set up brew, it did not alert me that /usr/bin came before /usr/local/bin. <comment57772> @StevenLu, it's already exported by the time you get to .bash_profile. It wouldn't hurt to explicitly export it again, but not necessary. <comment59934> Thanks for this. Worked  "Your system is raring to brew." <comment113424> My PATH was configured correctly in my .bash_profile, but not in ``/etc/paths``. This worked beautifully. <comment154027> Do NOT use this method for setting your path -- there is risk that non-terminal applications will pick up the "brewed" components and fail.  Using "sudo" should also be a red flag unless you truly understand what you're doing (especially with a user-level development system like Mac Homebrew).  Editing your .bash_profile and restarting terminal should be sufficient.
