Roll back to Mountain Lion without time machine backup <body> I've installed OS X Maverick which was downloaded by someone else and was registered to other apple ID, that's why I can't install maverick free apps like keynotes, pages...how can I roll back to my mountain lion or start a fresh install or change the registered user of maverick I'm using right now? I don't have any time machine back up or any installation disk.  <answer107141> Open the Mac App Store.  Then go to the Menu "Store"  Sign Out.  Now you can login with your account and you should be able to download the desired software.
