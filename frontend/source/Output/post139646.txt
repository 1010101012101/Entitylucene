Is it possible to stream audio via AVB between two Macintoshes? <body> I have two Macs that I am trying to stream AVB between. Both machines are running Mavericks and can see other AVB devices and stream with them. However when trying to stream from one Mac to another Mac it does not function. We have tried with an iMac, two Mac Mini, a Mac Book Pro, and a Mac Air.  Is it possible to stream between two Macs for just audio? Under Audio Midi Setup the network devices is empty.  Thank you.
