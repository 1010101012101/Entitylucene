How To Open System Directories In Finder Without Opening A New Finder Tab <body> In the finder I made hidden directories visible. The odd thing is that any system directory (IE one whose name starts with a ".") I can't open them by double-clicking on them. Instead I have to right click and and select to open in a new tab. Is there a way to change this behavior?  I'm using Mavericks, not sure if this issue is specific to Mavericks or not.  <answer168462> You can enter those directories from keyboard with kbd⌘ CMD/kbd+kbd↓ Down arrow/kbd.br  Or kbd⇧ SHIFT/kbd+kbd⌘ CMD/kbd+kbdG/kbd and type the name of the directory You want to enter. You can complete directory name with kbd⇥ TAB/kbd button (for example type codeDown/code in code$USER/code dir, press kbd⇥ TAB/kbd and it will become codeDownloads/code).  <comment197877> I like that cmd + down arrow, but I'd really like to just be able to double click it.
