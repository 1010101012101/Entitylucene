How do I really (dig) flush the DNS cache on OS X 10.9? <body> I'm on OS X 10.9, according to support.apple.com I can flush the cache with  precodesudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder /code/pre  Unfortunately this does not really refresh my DNS cache at all, also not like this:  precodedscacheutil -flushcache; sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder /code/pre  E.g.  precode$ dig www.example.com|grep CNAME www.example.com.    83955   IN  CNAME   example.com. /code/pre  If cache were cleared it would be showing a number close to 86400, 3600, 300 or 60 are the TTL values offered by my domain name provider).  If I add code@dns-host/code to dig it works as expected:  precode$ dig @ns0.transip.net www.example.com|grep CNAME www.example.com.    60  IN  CNAME   GITHUBACCOUNT.github.io. /code/pre  I also tried the other commands on that page. In the meantime I work around this by ssh'ing onto one of my servers and check things there. But I'd like a proper way to emreally/em refresh all DNS cache on my Mac.  How can I do that?  <comment202632> `dig` bypasses the OS resolver (and hence cache), so this isn't telling you anything about whether it's been flushed or not. What it *is* telling you about is caching at your DNS server, and you cannot flush that from the client.
