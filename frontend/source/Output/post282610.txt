Odd Dropdown Styling MacOS Sierra 10.12.4 <body> I just got a new MacBook Pro and for some reason all my drop downs now have this weird styling (example is from Xcode):  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5kizo.png" alt="Odd Drop Down Styling"  And when the mouse is hovered over it, it looks like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/SL0qx.png" alt="Odd Drop Down Hover Styling"  Can someone please tell me how to turn this off?  Thanks in advanced for the help.  <comment364241> I'm still having this issue. I've looked through all of the settings and can't figure it out.
