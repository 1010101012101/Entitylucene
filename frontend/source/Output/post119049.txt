Mac Lync Conversation History Storage Location <body> Anyone know where Mac Lync 2011 stores its conversation history? Since it isn't tied to Outlook, it isn't stored on the Exchange server is it? If not, I need to back it up...  <answer119050> Found it!   precode/Users/&lt;username&gt;/Documents/Microsoft User Data/Microsoft Lync History /code/pre  <comment346407> I deleted that directory but the chat history has not disappeared. You can delete history entries manually in the UI but I haven't found a way to bulk delete.
