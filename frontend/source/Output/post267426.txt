Login into google account on Iphone 5s not possible <body> About a month ago my Iphone 5s updated and afterwards I couldn't log in to my google account on my Iphone, when I try to log in from any other device it works completely fine. Neither in the youtube app nor when I try to log in to my gmail account in the safari browser. I always get following message:   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lO62n.jpg" width="250"   When I click on next following instructions are shown:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KNevF.jpg" width="250"   I did everything as told and it didn't change. I searched google, and nothing could help me. I uninstalled the youtube app, reinstalled it, still no changes.  The only intresting fact is, that I am logged in to my gmail account in native mail app and this works completely fine.  I could try to reset the whole Iphone, but I would prefer to find a better solution than that.  <answer290503> Follow  the following steps:  ol liDelete your cookies/li lidownload the official Gmail app from the app store instead of trying to login  using safari./li liif these fail, read the problem solving gmail login tutorials./li /ol  <comment335546> Are you using any content blockers?  Can you log into that account from a different iPhone? <comment335547> No I am not, and I can log in from an Iphone 6 <comment335635> Looks like an in-app web browser in that image. Which app? Try using plain old safari to sign in? <comment337762> Youtube app, same thing in safari <comment366686> I already tried deleting the cookies and the problem is not only the Gmail, but also the youtube app. I was just trying to log into gmail online to check if that works. I've already gone through those tutorials but nothing worked :/
