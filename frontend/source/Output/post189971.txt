how to find my icloud username? <body> I can't remember my icloud username, but I remember my Apple ID. I think I remember the password to my icloud, but I don't know if that will help me. Do you know where I can find my icloud(not apple id) username? (can't use my phone until I know what my icloud username is....i'm in desperate need right now)  <comment225490> I think you are confused.  Your iCloud username is your appleid. <comment225566> yes I thought so, but I am able to log on icloud.com with what i thought was my appleid - and it was. But when i am writing the same username and password on my phone, it says "(my email) cannon be used to unlock this iPhone". My phone says that "this iphone is currently linked to an Apple ID(g*****@icloud.com), and the username i used at icloud.com was not with "icloud.com" behind, it was with "live.no" behind. I don't know what my icloud email is, but on icloud.com i am able to log on with my email that has "live.no" behind, ugh i don't get this... <comment225568> Your comments a little hard to follow, but one possibility is that have two similar appleId's.  One iCloud.com and one live.no . Try going to appleId.apple.com on a regular computer and logging in as each.  Use iforgot.apple.com if you need password help with either. <comment225582> I was able to get in with "live.no" but not as "icloud.com". But when i made my icloud.com email i think i used a different name before the @ than what I have at my usual email(live.no), but I don't know where i can find what it is <comment225780> okey, i fixed it by calling Apple Support, great help!
