Create service to create calendar event selecting text <body> I was wondering if it's possible to add a custom service for OS X that is able to create a new event in my (default) calendar when I select some text and right click on it in a webpage, document, email etc.  I saw that automator has calendar support but i don't know how to set it up properly. Any suggestion?  Thanks!  <comment242782> What do you mean by "when I select some text?" Would the text contain the date/time of the new calendar event or the title? Or would you use the text to create a new "Quick Event?" Please add some more details to your question. <comment243150> @aaplmath for example: i'm browsing a page and in a paragraph is see like "... on the 20th of August ...". At this point i would like to select the text with the mouse, right click on it and open 'Services Menu', and there have a custom action to add Calendar Event. Hope it's more clear now! cheers <comment243252> [This question](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/18869/creating-a-quick-event-in-ical-using-launchbar-applescript) may be useful. You could borrow their Quick Event AppleScript, then put it into a Run AppleScript block in Automator.
