Do iphones with force touch work better with gloves than older iphones without force touch? <body> If I'm using gloves, often times it's difficult for my iPhone to detect a touch, even with gloves that have metallic thread for such a purpose.  Since iPhones with force touch detect the touch via capacitance and pressure, Does an iPhone with force touch respond better to touch while wearing gloves than without?
