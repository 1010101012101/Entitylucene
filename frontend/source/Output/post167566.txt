Why does Google Drive create so many conflicted files? <body> I have a Windows system and a Mac. When I create a file (e.g. codea.cpp/code) in Windows (with vim), Google Drive creates a lots of files like codea (1).cpp/code, codea (2).cpp/code ...br Some of them are delete by Google Drive after it creates them. Some are not.  Why does Google Drive generate so many files?  Also codea.cpp/code is not the same as codea.cpp/code in Windows. codea (2).cpp/code in Mac is the same as codea.cpp/code in Windows in some cases.  Why do the same files have different content?  When I check the access right of files, it should be something like  precode-rw------  ..................  a.cpp /code/pre  However, when I create a file codeb.cpp/code in Mac it is   precode-rw-r--r-  ..................  b.cpp /code/pre  Is it because of the accessing privilege problem?  <answer202592> I noticed the same issue, the problem it seems is when you 'edit' a file it get locked by the application and the google drive auto sync kicks in and creates a conflict file.  I notice this mostly with Photoshop files, as the files can get pretty large and the sync doesn't happen quickly like a simple text file and it cause a lot of duplicates.  strongMy solution:  pause google drive while I am working on these files and when done, let them sync./strong  <comment355150> Are you using google drive to control your code versions? Why don't you use a real version control, like git? I don't think that google drive is prepared to handle version control in a file that it's edited a dozen of times. Every time that you save your file, google drives understands it as a new version, and it probably causes your problem.
