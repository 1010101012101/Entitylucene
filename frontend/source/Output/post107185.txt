How can I test access to encrypted (FileVault2) Time Machine partition? <body> I have my Time Machine backups going to an external disk, and all of it is encrypted with FileVault2. I plan to do a fresh install of Mavericks on my local hard drive, but before wiping the disk, I want to make sure that I can still access my Time Machine backups.  As mentioned in this other SO post, I should be able to use my FV key (and I vaguely remember using my account username/password to access data), but I want to be 100% sure.  Short of plugging this external drive into a separate OS X box (which I don't have), what else can I do to trigger the prompt for password/FV key/etc?  Would creating a new user on my machine be enough? Is there some Mavericks LiveCD mode (i.e. like Ubuntu)?  <answer107229> you could delete the key in your keychain. After plugin the disk back in, the password prompt should pop up  <answer107241> You can confirm this by booting from the Recovery Partition on the codeTime Machine/code disk and choosing to restore from a backup (without proceeding with the restore).  Here are the steps:  ul liConnect the external hard disk with the encrypted codeTime Machine/code backup/li liBoot (or reboot) the system and during startup hold the kbdOption/kbd key so that it shows you the list of available volumes to boot from/li liSelect the strongRecovery HD/strong from the codeTime Machine/code disk to boot from it/li liChoose strongRestore From Time Machine Backup/strong from the list of actions/li liSelect the encrypted codeTime Machine/code volume from the list/li liEnter the Fila Vault 2 password when prompted/li liWait for it to show the list of available backups from the codeTime Machine/code volume/li liRestart the system now that you have verified the availability of the backup/li /ul  <comment125793> While this is good, part of my concern is that I saved the wrong key/password for the Time Machine backups, so before deleting/clearing anything from Keychain, I best confirm I have access :)
