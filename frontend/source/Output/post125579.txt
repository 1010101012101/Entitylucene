Is there a way to record my iPad screen for free? <body> Good afternoon, br I own an iPad 2 and a Macbook Pro. I am looking for a free solution to recording my iPad's screen from my computer. I plan to record the gameplay of various iOS games and upload them on video sharing websites. brbr About my iPad 2 -  Version: 6.0.1 br Not jailbroken. brbr I apologize if this exact question has already been answered but I have been unable to find an answer that is suitable for my specific needs. Finding a free alternative to Reflector seems to be very difficult! brbr All answers will be greatly appreciated.  <answer125582> I don't know of a free option. There are products like X-Mirage (USD 16), which lets you record your device via AirPlay. This is probably the most hassle-free and cheap solution.   You can also buy an HDMI adapter from Apple, or some third party version, and record your gameplay that way using e.g. an HDD-recorder with HDMI input. For this solution you obviously need quite a bit of hardware.  <answer125583> There used to be some free apps, but they stopped working because the devs didn't have time to update them to work with the latest changes to airplay.   If you are willing to pay a bit of money you can get apps which turn your Mac into an Airplay server. You can then mirror your iPad's screen to your Mac, and record it there.  ul liReflector is $12.99/li liAirServer is $14.99/li liX-Mirage is $16.00/li /ul  Check them out, and work out which one is best for you.  strongEDIT:/strong  X-Mirage has a 7-day free trial, so I think it's the closest you'll get to a "free" solution.  <answer142217> emu4ios.com...install then find iRec and click install and begin   <answer149065> Just go to camera and click the buttion flip camera!

You can buy an adapter to stream live whatever is on your iPad screen to your Mac screen. Then using a PC screen recorder system to record the "livestream" footage. There is free screen recording software out there. Software such as CamStudio and TinyTake offer pretty decent recording options for free, and extra if you pay for it.  <answer250929> Get  airshou. Here's the link cherryroad.xyz/airshou. To use it just click record, choose your orientation and quality, hit next and swipe up from the bottom of your screen. Then click AirPlay and press AirShou. Wait a few seconds, and the recording starts  <comment146953> Is jailbreaking an option? <comment146954> Use Photo Booth. (This is a joke, by the way. It would work though...) <comment146958> I would prefer not to have to resort to jailbreaking my device. I understand that I could use the camera on the computer to record the iPad's screen but I obviously do not want to do that. <comment147045> Thank you, Arne and daviewales. br It seems that, at this point, Reflector is my best option. I hope they do develop more free screen recorders for iOS devices in the future. Thank you very much for taking the time to answer my question. br Also, I would like to thank whoever turned my "Answer" into a comment. <comment147046> you should have the ability to comment on your own question, even with only 1 rep. <comment272708> Just so all are aware, iRec is no longer an option, it is listed under the "does not work" category in the emu4ios.net store. <comment278737> This actually is a pragmatic solution for casual documentation needs. It doesn't make sense to pay for professional tools on a budget that prioritizes free. +1 in my book
