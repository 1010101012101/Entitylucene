How do I tell Finder to always show my Library folder on Mavericks? <body> I thought there was a checkbox to suppress the hiding of my user Library folder on Mavericks, but I can't seem to find it. I appreciate hiding Library by default, but since Lion have missed it being easily accessible.  How can I get the library folder to be visible in Finder, the Finder go menus / file save dialogs without needing to hold down shift?  <answer106646> Open your desired user Home folder in Finder (kbdShift/kbdkbdCommand/kbd + kbdH/kbd) and select strongView  Show View Options/strong. There should be a checkbox for toggling the Library folder.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NzgXO.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer107588> Apple decided to hide the Library from its users in recent OS X updates, but in Mavericks you can now change that with a simple checkbox.  In the past you had to enter a Terminal command with every little system update:  precodechflags nohidden ~/Library /code/pre  With OS X Mavericks, you can just navigate to your home folder, press kbdcmd/kbd+kbdJ/kbd to bring up the folder settings, and strongcheck the box/strong next to strong"Show Library Folder"/strong instead.  <answer125019> Even without Admin privileges, you can use the Finder's Go menu to access the library folder. Click on Go, then choose emGo to folder.../em near the bottom of the dropdown menu.  In the resulting dialog box, type      ~/Library   and hit Return.  strongEDIT:/strong Alternatively click Go press kbd‚å•/kbd and click Library as it will show up on the key-press.  Your Library folder will open in the active Finder window, or in a new window if one isn't already open.  <answer180928> You have to make sure that you first drag over your Home Folder to the side bar if it's not already there. Then click on it and press kbdCmd/kbd+kbdJ/kbd.  <comment125190> That absolutely shows me the Library in file save dialogs and Finder views. Now to see if we can leverage that to get the Finder Go menu as well :-) Thanks! <comment125192> Yes, that's odd that it still doesn't show up in the Go menu after enabling it in Finder. Is that a bug or a feature? <comment139653> Actually, the check box doesn't appear unless your account is an admin account. <comment146327> The downside of this method being that there is no (one step) keyboard shortcut for doing that. <comment146331> @dwightk hit the ALT button and it will show up as item in the list. <comment146332> Absolutely, you can always "go" to the location whether it's visible or not. I was really hoping to document how to influence the visibility which is what the accepted answer provides. This is a true statement, and I'm not sure where the admin comes into play - did you mean to edit the answer that's chosen to explain when it won't work? <comment146333> @bmike changed via review page - I cannot see the full question there? Feel free to rollback. <comment146334> @Robert I'm seeing the checkbox fine (& it works) under a non-admin account. <comment146344> @robuust that's cool, then it shows up which lets you bypass the Go to folder command, but oddly there's no keyboard shortcut next to it. <comment180770> Hell, Apple what are you doing here. Do you want to drive every last potential developer into using Linux?
