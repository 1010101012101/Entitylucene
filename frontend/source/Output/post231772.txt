Stop "iPhone is not Activated" message from appearing <body> I bought a used iPhone 5s not to use as a phone, but to use like an iPod touch. I bought a cheap, dummy SIM card to get it activated. All is well, but I keep getting thecodeiPhone is Not Activated. Contact Your Carrier./code message.    How can I get rid of this?  <answer254845> Turn off iMessage and FaceTime  <comment283060> The actual message is "Iphone is not Activated"  Contact your carrier . . . . the only way to get rid of it is to hit "dismiss" but it keeps coming back. <comment283061> it's not 'your phone' until it's activated. Have you tried it when connected to wifi, or can't you get that far? <comment283077> wifi is great!  Have gotten new apps just fine.
