Open URL as File <body> If I go to an application and open a file, such as using Cmd-O, is there some way to enter a URL, so that I can open a file directly from the web?  For example, in a graphics application, I would like to open an image file directly from the URL without having first to save it from the browser.  I know I can point to a local path using Cmd-G.  <answer265687> No, there's no generic way of doing that in every application on macOS.  Some specific applications provide a way of opening a URL - for example VLC Player allows you to open a URL and play a video directly from the web.
