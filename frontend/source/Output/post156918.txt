I have an iPhone 5S with Applecare+, do I have any options for trading in for 6? <body> As stated above, I have two month old iPhone 5s that I bought directly from an Apple store. It's been really jittery lately, screen flickers, crashing, etc, and although I know that apple will replace it or fix it (within 90 day warranty and I have Applecare+), do I have any option for trading this phone in to them against buying the iPhone 6 outright?    Any help is much appreciated.  <comment184533> You don't, but it is up to the discretion of the apple store. Bring it in for a fix, then few days later bring it in again :) they might just give you new 5s or upgrade! <comment184553> Agreed: there is literally no way that Apple will upgrade you to the iPhone 6. However, if they swap your iPhone out, you could always try to sell it and purchase an unlocked iPhone 6. There will be a $$ difference in the end with that still, but perhaps not much.
