Can’t open Safari on iMac <body> Anyone having trouble opening Safari? I tried deleting the plist and restarting but still can’t open Safari.  There was a security update on 24 May but I cant get in to read it.  <answer284951> There are a couple of things you can try  ol liCreate another user and log in as them. If Safari launches there is something in your old profile causing this problem./li liFailing that reboot your Mac holding down the kbdShift/kbd key until you see the gray Apple logo. Your Mac is now booting into safe mode. It will take emlonger/em to boot, so go get a drink and come back in 5 minutes. If Safari launches then there is something that has been installed that is causing Safari to not launch./li liDownload and run the latest Combo Updater for the same version of macOS that you currently have. For the current version of Sierra the combo updater is here./li liDownload a cleaning app (I use Onyx). Quit out of all running apps and run the app. In Onyx click on the Automation Icon and click execute. This will take a while, go have two drinks. When it is done reboot. If Safari works then there was a damaged cache or other file that Onyx cleaned up./li /ol  Those should be a good start on fixing it.
