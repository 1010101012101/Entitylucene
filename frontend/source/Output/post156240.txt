Activity Monitor suddenly showing all cores in Dock icon <body> After upgrading my MBP from Mavericks to Yosemite, the "CPU History" option of the Activity Monitor only showed one aggregate graph.  After reinstalling Yosemite from scratch, I suddenly have 8 tiny graphs, one for each core, which I find too tiny to be useful. Is there any way to switch the Dock icon of Activity Monitor back to the single graph?  <answer198195> I saw this on a fresh install on 10.10.4. To fix it, close Activity Monitor and then:  precodedefaults write com.apple.activitymonitor IconType -int 4 /code/pre  <comment359242> This fix still works in Sierra 10.12.5. Thanks.
