leopard forgot password+launch_msg socket is not connected <body> I was working on increasing the speed of an ancient (6 years old) iMac running Leopard when I accidentally set the password incorrectly. I then turned to the internet to look for an answer and found:  http://www.macyourself.com/2009/08/03/how-to-reset-your-mac-os-x-password-without-an-installer-disc/ Which seemed to work fine until I reached   precodelaunchctl load /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.DirectoryServices.plist /code/pre  Which returned the error   precodelaunch_msg socket is not connected /code/pre  I decided to ignore this and see where this would lead me, when I got to:  precodedscl . -passwd /Users/username password /code/pre  It told me that I had to run:  precodelaunchctl load /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.DirectoryServicesLocal.plist /code/pre  which returned the same error.  Additionally the system is very slow despite Activity Monitor telling me no programs are using more then 2% cpu or 50 mb ram. Could this be connected?   It's also worth noting that the disc reader was damaged some time ago and is useless.   Anyone got a fix?  <answer127939> Did you follow the instructions exactly? I had the same problem, until I realized that I had omitted the code//code at the end of codemount -uw //code.  Can't comment on slowness or damaged hardware, that seems unrelated.  <answer193339> The above worked on osx 10.5.8  I didn't use the "/" in mount -uw and once I did that it let me reset the password  Working command: mount -uw /  <comment115282> Since you successfully hacked your own mac, how about making new account. <comment115538> I'm a bit hesitant to close this as a duplicate now that you have added a bounty, but http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/61905/how-can-i-reset-a-macs-password-from-single-user-mode looks rather similar. <comment115781> I tried that but I keep getting the socket error so it's not really the same. (it comes down to the same as the link I followed originally tried it the same but that didn't work). <comment230395> I had forgotten I asked about this here but this does indeed work.
