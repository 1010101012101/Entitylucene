What is the .plist.lockfile introduced in Lion? <body>    strongPossible Duplicate:/strongbr   Why are my plists in ~/Library/Preferences accompanied by a matching lockfile in Lion?       Since upgrading to Lion, I have noticed that Lion is placing lockfiles that correspond to the plist in code~/Library/Preferences/code. For example, in this folder I have both codecom.apple.finder.plist/code and codecom.apple.finder.plist.lockfile/code.  Any idea what these files are there for? I know what lockfiles are in general, but I dont understand why they may have been introduced in Lion.
