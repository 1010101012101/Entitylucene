Undo/Recover a quick formatted JHFS+ HDD drive <body> I just have made the biggest mistake in my life, accidentally format ~2TB of my personal data. Here is information about the Disk :  precode2TB HDD Drive : GUID Partition Map : OS X Extended (Journaled) : Single Partition /code/pre  Is there any OS X software able to simple codeundo/code the quick format, recover strongCatalog File/strong section (which contains records for all the files and directories stored in the volume), preserve filename &amp; directory structure... to put the drive back to previous state?  If not then with smaller requirement, may I able to recover files &amp; folders with its original name ? The drive is all of my data in digital life so I knows how massive in number &amp; complicate in structure it is. Therefore it will be an infinitive nightmare if I get those data back with random names.  And in the worst case of having to go with that nightmare, can you suggest me with best-of-the-best available recovery softwares to minimize data loss?  <comment291558> Why can't you restore from a backup? If the data is that important, then you should've had a backup <comment291574> You can find recovery apps in the App Store or with Google. Can't guarantee results though. <comment291626> @IronCraftMan just completed building my backup server and about to use it, unfortunately I picked wrong disk number to format. The data is very important to me, I would buy any softwares to get it back <comment291661> @Huy.PhamNhu Well, if the data was really that important you shouldn't been so quick to reformat it. You can try some of the disk recovery apps, but most of them are expensive and there's no garentee they work.
