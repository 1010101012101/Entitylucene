Permissions error when downloading or quick-looking attachments in mail.app after symlinking Mail Downloads directory <body> Awhile back, I symlinked my code~/Library/Mail Downloads/code directory to code~/Downloads/code so that my email attachments would be downloaded to the same location that all my other applications download files to.  When I upgraded to Mountain Lion, I noticed that the codeMail Downloads/code folder had been restored.  So I deleted it and recreated the symlink the same way I did for previous versions of OS X.  Now, every time I try to download or quick-look an attachment in mail.app, I see the following error (might not be exact; translating from Spanish):     Mail was unable to save the attachment "..." to disk.  Make sure that the downloads folder has write permissions.   Some of the fixes I have tried:  ul liMaking code~/Downloads/code world-writable./li liRemoving the symlink and re-creating the directory. ul liMaking that directory world-writable./li /ul/li liRepairing permissions via Disk Utility./li liChanging the location of the Downloads Folder preference for Mail.app to code~/Downloads/code./li /ul  How do I restore the functionality of my codeMail Downloads/code folder (preferably so that it is symlinked to my home codeDownloads/code folder)?  <answer88832> Assuming Mountain Lion...  ol liQuit Mail/li liDelete the code~/Library/Mail Downloads/code folder./li liDelete the code~/Library/Containers/com.apple.mail/code folder./li liRestart Mail/li liRebuild Mailboxes/li liSet your Downloads folder in Mails preferences to ~/Downloads.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xiRab.jpg" alt="Screenshot of Mail.app preferences dialog with downloads folder highlighted"/li /ol  Better?  <comment101991> Silly question: have you tried changing the "Downloads folder" preference in Mail.app? <comment102040> lol That is a good point; I forgot about that.  Unfortunately, changing the preference to my home downloads folder does not solve the issue (although perhaps it helps pinpoint the problem).  I will update my question. <comment104118> Maybe just try to set the downloads folder directly in preferences before deleting `com.apple.mail`. <comment104153> Sweet.  That did it.  Thanks so much for your help!
