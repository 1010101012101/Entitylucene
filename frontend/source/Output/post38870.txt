Can I create a chat room for 3 different clients for Gtalk service? <body> I'm using Adium on my Mac and I wish to communicate with several people. My friend on Linux uses Pidgin. Another friend is using Gtalk client and all using gtalk service. It's possible to create a chatroom to contain these clients similar to how Skype does group room chat?  <answer38978> In Adium:  ul liRight click on one of the contacts, and use "Initiate Multiuser Chat with (name)@gmail.com"/li liYou should now join a group chat yourself, and an invitation will be send to that contact./li liRight click on the other contact, and select "Invite to Chat" â†’ (The name of the private chat you created)./li liNow the other contact gets an invitation they should accept./li /ul
