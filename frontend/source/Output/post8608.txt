How do I select more than one file in LaunchBar? <body> Is it possible to select multiple files in LaunchBar?  (For example, I may want to select two files in a folder and "drag" them to another folder.)  How do I do that?  <answer8619> I found a post on the Objective Development Forums that suggests a different approach:  ol liSelect the file to move or copy (either in the Finder, or in LaunchBar)./li liCopy it (⌘-C)/li liSelect another file (again, either in the Finder, or in LaunchBar)./li liUse ClipMerge (Press ⌘-C twice.)/li liRepeat steps 3 &amp; 4 if you wish to select more than two files./li liSelect the destination folder./li liPaste (⌘-V)/li /ol  I was skeptical until I tried it.  It works quite well.  <answer198707> strongAn update for LaunchBar 6/strong  Version 6.0 introduced a slick way of selecting multiple items. The LaunchBar folks call it the &#8220;Sixth Sense&#8221;. Selected items are held in a &#8220;staging area&#8221; and can be acted upon all at once using typical LaunchBar tools.   ul liTyping Command-A will select all items in the search list./li liTyping a Comma (&#8220;,&#8221;) will select the current item and allow you to move on to select more./li liPressing Shift will scrolling up or down with the arrow keys select continuously as you scroll/li liYou can undo these actions by repeating them with a selected file. Hitting Escape clears the selections.br/ /ul  The selection then works with other actions: Press Tab to send them to another folder, etc./li  There&#8217;s a discussion at the LaunchBar blog  <comment9195> If this is possible it's pretty cool. I have a feeling it is not. I couldn't find a way to select multiple files from a LaunchBar file search. All key+select operations I tried just selected one file. <comment9199> Surprising. And awesome to know.
