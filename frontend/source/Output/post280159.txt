Weird remotedesktop folder in usr/local - safe? <body> While doing some cleanup of old files on my Mac (macOS 10.12.4, having updated a few days ago) I just discovered a weird file I couldn't find any information on.  In codeusr/local/code, there is a folder called coderemotedesktop/code with a codeRemoteDesktopChangeClientSettings.pkg/code file inside.  precodedrwxr-xr-x  3 root  wheel  102  6 Mär 20:10 remotedesktop drwxr-xr-x  3 root  wheel  102  6 Mär 20:10 RemoteDesktopChangeClientSettings.pkg /code/pre  While I know that remote desktop clients have many legitimate use cases, I am a bit worried where this is coming from since I've never used any on this machine.  Is this file a regular part of the OS or a vendor file that was placed there? Should I try and open it?  <answer280160> To determine the origin you have several tools at hand:  ul liCode signing. Check the code signing of the app/pkg:  precodecodesign -dv --verbose=4 /usr/local/remotedesktop/RemoteDesktopChangeClientSettings.pkg  /code/pre  This yields the following:  precodeExecutable=/usr/local/remotedesktop/RemoteDesktopChangeClientSettings.pkg/Contents/Info.plist Identifier=com.apple.pkg.RemoteDesktopChangeClientSettings Format=installer package bundle CodeDirectory v=20100 size=176 flags=0x0(none) hashes=1+3 location=embedded Hash type=sha1 size=20 CandidateCDHash sha1=888c8c6a6abd2f544020594e7d6f4dc31a7e01b8 Hash choices=sha1 CDHash=888c8c6a6abd2f544020594e7d6f4dc31a7e01b8 Signature size=4072 Authority=Software Signing Authority=Apple Code Signing Certification Authority Authority=Apple Root CA Info.plist entries=24 TeamIdentifier=not set Sealed Resources version=2 rules=12 files=21 Internal requirements count=1 size=96 /code/pre  Seems legit and (comparing it to other apps) from Apple itself. If the app/pkg was signed by another company at least one of the Authority lines would show a different vendor/developer./li liCheck the receipt bom files:  precodegrep --include=\*.bom -rnw '/System/Library/Receipts/' -e "RemoteDesktopChangeClientSettings" /code/pre  which will probably yield:  precodeBinary file /System/Library/Receipts//com.apple.pkg.RemoteDesktopClient.bom matches /code/pre  Check the corresponding plist file and you will get the installer package: RemoteDesktopClient 3.9.2. Seems also legit Apple. Now you can codelsbom .../code the file. See codeman lsbom/code.  A second emReceipts/em folder with non-Apple boms/plists is in the /Library folder!/li /ul  hr  There are probably some more methods to check if the file is legit or not which I'll try to add later.  <answer285813> It's definitely an Apple component. It remained even after I tried uninstalling my Remote Desktop.app, so I'm guessing it's something the OS may have installed.  I filed an issue with Apple Bugs since /usr/local is meant to be under the user's control and there shouldn't ever be any OS files installed there.  I deleted my /usr/local/remotedesktop folder since it's ugly having it there but it may break Remote Desktop in some way, not sure. Hoping the next OS update might fix the issue and not put files in /usr/local any more.  <comment352355> Wow, thank you for this amazing answer! Not only am I relieved that the file is legit, I am also happy to have something new to learn – determining the source of a file can sometimes be really important to me. <comment360566> Welcome to Ask Different.
