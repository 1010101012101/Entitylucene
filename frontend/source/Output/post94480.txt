Java class file could not be launched on startup <body> I'm not sure what happened but now when I boot up my Mac I get this message that pops up every time:   "The Java class file "myClass.class" could not be launched.br Check the Console for possible error messages."  This class file is part of a larger program I'm developing.   I checked the console and found the message with sender code[0x0-0x1b01b].com.apple.JarLauncher/code and the message says codejava.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: .../code.   I failed to find the Jar Launcher or anything Java related in code/Library/StartupItems/code and code~/Library/StartupItems/code but that's all I thought to do.  Any ideas on why I'm getting this message and what to do to get rid of it?  <answer130860> Finally found it in System Preferences - Users - Login items.  <comment110853> 1) `com.apple.JarLauncher` or the program you're developing may be started at login if they saved state: In the Finder press Cmd+Shift+G and type `~/Library/Saved Application State`. Now look for folders named `com.apple.JarLauncher` and after your program's identifier. Delete them. 2) Boot in safe mode (support.apple.com/kb/ht1564). If no message pops up look for `jarLauncher` and `myClass.class` entries in `/Library/LaunchAgents` and `~/Library/LaunchAgents`. 3) Unlikely, but check whether a login hook is defined: `defaults read com.apple.loginwindow LoginHook`. Try `sudo defaults ...` also.
