Parallels Desktop 12 - macOS Sierra mount USB drive <body> I am trying to mount an USB drive with my macOS Sierra Parallels VM. I am using Parallels Desktop 12. I called the Parallels support – not very good support – he just tells me I cannot mount an USB drive in an macOS VM. But in my opinion that is a key feature – if that is not working how should I get data from USB drives?  I would like to mount my TimeMachine USB drive and install macOS Sierra from my TM backup. How is that possible?  When I start the VM and select on top "Device - external Devices - my TM USB disk" it get unmounted from the host macOS System and should get mounted to the VM macOS. But is never gets mounted there. So I am not able to get my Data from my TimeMachine backup in the macOS VM.  Any ideas how to solve that?  The reason: I would like to switch my native system to an virtual system and carry that VM on an external SSD to boot my system on my iMac and my MacBook Pro wherever I need it.
