What Is Graphic Switching & Are There Reasons to Turn It Off? <body> I was tinkering about in the System Preferences of my Macbook Pro yesterday, when I came across strong"Automatic Graphic Switching"/strong within the Energy Saver pane as exemplied below:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/AsZjX.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  What exactly is Graphic Switching, and are there any reasons or instances when it shouldn't be automatically enabled &amp; switched off ?  <answer91712> Graphics switching is where the integrated graphics is switched for the discrete graphics when more performance is required (and where performance is more important than battery life &amp; heat output).  You can see the current graphics card that is enabled, and forcefully switch between the two, with gfxCardStatus.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xOBAn.png" height="300" title="Menu Options for gfxCardStatus"  ul liIntegrated graphics should be used when you need battery life over performance (the Integrated Only option in gfxCardStatus can be used to force integrated graphics in circumstances where OS X believes that the discrete graphics is required)./li liDiscrete graphics should be used when you need performance over battery life (this is usually not required to be set manually with the Discrete Only option since OS X is happy to switch automatically)./li liDynamic Switching uses the default OS X graphics switching./li /ul  When 'Automatic graphics switching' is disabled in the Energy Saver system preference pane, only the discrete graphics is used.  <comment107735> I thought to determine which graphics card your mac is using you all you need to do is -  click the Apple Icon and select About This Mac. From the popup window select the More Info button. This will bring up a report window. Within the list it will say graphics followed by the graphics card you are using. <comment107736> Yes, but this is slow and annoying to quickly check. gfxCardStatus adds a menu bar item that you can use to check: the icon changes between **i** (Intel integrated) and **n** (NVIDIA discreet). It also lets you forcefully change between graphics cards as I mentioned. <comment107737> Ah I see, good to know :)
