Strange behavior within MS Word: using Command-Shift-L launches Safari sometimes <body> It seems that Command-Shift-L were tied to safari. It is however also tied to "create bulleted list" in Word - which is an action I happen to (want to) do frequently.  How does one change or disable the built-in shortcuts for apps (in this case safari) ?  strongUpdate/strong  I found the following under system preferences | keyboard |shortcuts|apps  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NnDla.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  But as you can see there is nothing specific to Safari here.  strongAnother update/strong I just closed down Word and opened it up. strongemThe behavior seems to have been fixed/em/strong: bullets are now appearing.  It is very strange that the given key combo had been emconsistently and repeatably/em redirecting to safari before Word was restarted.  strongYet another update/strong  This behavior recurs - even after restarting Word. The shortcut works a few times, then a bit later - and I do not understand what triggers the change in behavior - the shortcut changes behavior to stronglaunching Safari/strong   Just have no idea what is happening here.  <answer180039> When Word is the frontmost application, all keyboard shortcuts are sent to it. Therefore ⇧⌘L will create a bulleted list before any other action that is set to it.  ⇧⌘L is not a standard keyboard shortcut for Safari, therefore you need to look for whatever app has set up this keyboard shortcut to override Word.  <answer180065> The issue was a bit difficult to find: that shortcut is linked to "Search with Google".  But the result is that Safari is launched - with whatever is in the clipboard as the search query to google.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uvcnH.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  The resolution is to uncheck the "Search with Google" checkbox in the services | shortcuts | searching area.  strongAfterwards the Mac shortcut for bulleted paragraph works properly (and always)/strong  <comment213690> Actually, Cmd/Shift/L is 'show sidebar' - but that shouldn't affect anything outside of Safari, of course. I've also a Service shortcut for Cmd/Shift/L for "Search with Google" though I've no clue where it came from
