Intermittent WI-FI connection issues <body> I'm experiencing a very weird network issue on my newish (2014) macbook pro. I've noticed it the last few weeks, but it could have been around longer, perhaps dating back to the Yosemite upgrade. I'm only getting to look at it now.  Mostly macbook works fine, but every now and again it stops talking to the internet. It seems to happen every 15-20 minutes, for a duration ranging from 30 seconds up to 5 minutes. It's mainly an issue for Skype, where I experience occasional disconnections.  I have run codeping youtube.com/code and it reports codeRequest timeout for &lt;ip-address&gt;/code at times corresponding to my outages. Note that emit does not say/em codeNo route to host/code.  I have also run ping against my router IP-address and this always works without fault. emthus issues on wireless interface can be ruled out/em.  I have run ping on my actual router too, against the youtube IP-adress, and this reports no fault. emthis rules out actual service-provider network issues/em.  I have run ping from my iPhone, and this reports no problems emso the issue is almost certainly something to do with macbook/em, rather than wifi devices in general.  Apple's wireless diagnostics utilities do detect the outages, but provide no solutions. The tools it provides also show no wireless congestion issues, and no problems with signal.  I've tried a whole slew of fixes:  ul lidisabling bluetooth/li lichanging from 802.11g to 802.11n between 2.4GHz and 5 GHz and changing channels./li lisetting IPv6 to link-only/li lidisabling handoff/li /ul  I'm going to have a go at the PRAM reset thing if the issue becomes chronic again, and I really don't think I should have to resort to an O/S reinstall.  I would like to understand though, even theoretically what is going on here. It's driving me bananas!  <answer168488> I discovered that bouncing airport (Disable/Enable on Air Port Icon in the top right) resolved the issue temporarily.  Eventually I tried a PRAM reset and that seems to have fixed the problem for good.  Would have loved to understand the root cause though ...  There is a collection of fixes on reddit here, that people with similar issues might like to try: http://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/2jwah7/psa_yosemite_wifi_issues_list_of_possible_fixes/  <comment197063> Reading on this topic further I think it may have been the Yosemite 10.10.1 update that broke my computer! Hopefully it's the 10.10.2 on its way that will resolve my issue!
