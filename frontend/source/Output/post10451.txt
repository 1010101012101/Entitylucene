Transferring Skitch history to new Mac <body> I bought a new MacBook and am wanting to transfer my Skitch history. I've copied all of the code.skitch/code files from code~/Pictures/Skitch/code on my old MacBook, but Skitch isn't showing them in the history list on my new MacBook Pro.  Any ideas?  <answer10452> Looks like Skitch employee, Keith, answered this question on GetSatisfaction.  The short answer is that you need to copy the following preferences files:  precode~/Library/Preferences/com.skitch.skitch.history ~/Library/Preferences/com.skitch.skitch.plist /code/pre  This is in addition to copying the actual code.skitch/code files located in:  precode~/Pictures/Skitch /code/pre
