Chrome window all screwed up after locking or disconnecting second monitor? <body> I've noticed that when I unlock my computer or disconnect a second monitor, about 25% of the time my chrome window will resize itself to about 100 pixels tall and position itself at the top of the screen.  When it does there I have no way of resizing it or accessing any of the pages.  Even if I drag one of the tabs out to it's own window it will have the same problem.  I always end up quitting Chrome to solve the problem.  Does anyone know of a fix for this problem?  If not, does anyone know of a way that I can make Chrome accessible without having to quit out of it?  <comment143948> Please explain the 2 non related activity in more details. Unlock computer? disconnect 2nd monitor (how?) <comment143951> I don't think I understand the question?  Are you asking me how I disconnect a second monitor?  I unplug it from my laptop.  To unlock my computer I type in my password.  Did I misunderstand your question? <comment143953> Thank you, it is clearer now. Does it work without using the screen lock. <comment143954> Yeah Chrome hums along just fine until I lock the computer usually.
