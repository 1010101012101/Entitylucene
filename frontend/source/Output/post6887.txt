Does Safari for iOS 4.2.1 support WebGL? <body> Does iOS 4.2.1, the latest release at the time of this question, support WebGL?  <answer6892> Not at this point, no. WebKit, that which Safari for Mac OS and iOS are both based on, is supposed to support WebGL but I have yet to be able to get it work properly on Mac OS 10.6, much less iOS. I get the impression the whole thing is too new (relatively) for proper support.  <answer6893> WebGL resources:  ul lihttp://www.khronos.org/webgl/wiki/Main_Page/li lihttp://www.scriptol.com/programming/webgl.php/li lihttp://learningwebgl.com/blog//li lihttps://developer.mozilla.org/en/WebGL/li lihttp://planet-webgl.org//li /ul  Looks like its only in Webkit, and even then you have to enable it: More info: http://webkit.org/blog/603/webgl-now-available-in-webkit-nightlies/  <answer25901> I would not get your hopes up of iOs ever supporting WebGL. Not only because exposing the video drivers to untrusted parties poses a security risk. It would also give game developers a way to circumvent the app store for distributing games. Same reason you will never see the flash support extend beyond anything but video.  <comment7259> I tried enabling it and I still get an error from all of the WebGL demo sites. I think there are still kinks to work out. <comment7294> Maybe try the firefox beta as an alternative. <comment8356> Firefox for iOS? <comment29460> Huh? There's no Flash support on iOS at all. <comment29751> Flash Media Server 4.5 will reencode flash video to be iOs compatible. http://www.gizmag.com/adobe-flash-ios/19790/
