Sound Output from Garageband (on iPad) using Bluetooth <body> Is it possible to use bluetooth to listen to the sounds of Garageband on iPad? I don't succeed to do it. I hear the sound from the ipad's speaker... But I can do it when I listen to iTunes for instance.  Is this a pref to be set in Garaband itself?  <answer85217> As far as i know, theres no bluetooth option in Garageband for iPad.
