Finder and other apps keep crashing / fail to launch <body> I have never had this issue before, but sometimes when I turn on my Mac, Finder fails to start or crashes and then cannot be reopened. Other times Finder starts fine, but apps fail to launch, such as xCode, Atom, and Safari Web Content service crashes. I have booted in Safe Mode, used Disk Utility to check for problems, reset the SMC, reset the PRAM and nothing seems to help. I don't think it's my HD, because running my BootCamp Windows partition works 100% fine.  This problem occurs so often that it makes my computer borderline unusable. I've tried deleting Atom and xCode, but that did nothing. Sophos confirmed I have no viruses. Activity Monitor does nothing but tell me that Finder is unresponsive. The only thing I haven't done is erase and restart, but that is a huge imposition for me, because it takes incredibly long to restore a 500GB backup.  I know this is a broad question, but the nearest Apple Store is 60 Miles away and my Computer is a Mac Pro "Tower", so it's extremely heavy.  emI can include any log files that are necessary, but I don't know which ones I should include right now./em  System Specs:  - OS X 10.11.4  ul li14GB RAM/li li1TB HD (2 partitions)/li li2 x 2.8 GHz Quad-Core Intel Xeon/li liFileVault Enabled/li /ul  <comment287667> I would guess a RAM issue so run hardware checks - otherwise I would reinstall the OS from scratch <comment287679> That the Bootcamp partition works OK is _no guarantee_ that the structure of the OS X partition is error-free. Also, Bootcamp and Windows use the sam RAM that OS X uses, so perhaps a RAM issue is a red herring.
