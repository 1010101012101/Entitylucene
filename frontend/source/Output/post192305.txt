Upgrade svn on OS X 10.9 <body> On OS X 10.9.5, there is code/usr/bin/svn/code, which is version 1.7.19 (r1643991). However, the most recent version is 1.8.13. Apperently, with version 1.7.19 I cannot access certain subversion servers.   How can I upgrade codesvn/code? Do I really need to download and make codesvn/code (or build it via homebrew)? Why is Apple keeping me out-dated with an old version?  <answer192313> Easy way is installing via Homebrew. Just need to type the following:  precode$ brew install svn /code/pre  These are the options:  precode$ brew info svn subversion: stable 1.8.13, devel 1.9.0-rc2 Version control system designed to be a better CVS https://subversion.apache.org/ Not installed From: https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/blob/master/Library/Formula/subversion.rb ==&gt; Dependencies Build: pkg-config ✔, scons ✘ Required: sqlite ✔, openssl ✔ Optional: gpg-agent ✘ ==&gt; Options --universal     Build a universal binary --with-gpg-agent     Build with support for GPG Agent --with-java     Build Java bindings --with-perl     Build Perl bindings --with-python     Build with python support --with-ruby     Build Ruby bindings --devel     Install development version 1.9.0-rc2 ==&gt; Caveats svntools have been installed to:   /usr/local/opt/subversion/libexec /code/pre  If you need to install homebrew, just use this sentence:  precoderuby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)" /code/pre  <comment228902> Is this the only way? When will Apple upgrade svn (are new macbooks set up with this old version)? <comment228908> It isn't the only one but the easiest. Of course, you can download and compile yourself. About when Apple upgrade svn, I'm afraid can answer you, but I suppose that will be far enough. It's the same as git, the version on mac are outdated too. <comment228920> @Walter Apple's past practice and depending on the package's version system, major and minor updates/upgrages may be applied at the next version of the operating system. Patches/revisions are only applied when a securitiy flaw has been found in a package. <comment229274> So I tried to install homebrew, but got "Illegal variable name" upon entering your sentence. What's wrong? I do have macports which provides curl version 7.38 (as opposed to 7.30 in /usr/bin). <comment229972> Okay, so I sorted this out and installed svn via homebrew. However, it sits in /usr/local/bin/ and is shadowed by /usr/bin/svn. Shouldn't brew make sure that the former precedes the latter in PATH? Do I have to edit my login run command or is there a more natural way? <comment230051> Homebrew tells you that when you install something, but you must alter the PATH in order to `/usr/local/bin` take precedence over `/usr/bin`.
