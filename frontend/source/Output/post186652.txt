Display Slack notifications on both screens <body> I'm using my Macbook while it's connected to a larger display. I'm mostly working off the larger display. Is there a way for notifications to be displayed on both screens simultaneously? I'm specifically concerned about Slack, but if there's a way to do this for all applications, knowing how that works would be much appreciated.  <answer225362> No, notifications are always only displayed on on the display designated 'primary'. (The one which has the white menu bar line on it in codeSystem Preferences → Displays → Arrangement/code)
