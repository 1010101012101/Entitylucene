How to import Live Photos from Finder to Photos.app? <body> I only use Photos.app as a browser of all my images.   I unselected the emcopy items to the Photos library/em so my files can live in my hard drive and I don't duplicate them inside the Photos Library.photoslibrary archive.   I use Image Capture to import the iPhone pictures to a folder and after I used to imported to Photos.app and everything was great.   But now with Live photos I get two files for each picture, the picture and the little movie that makes the Live part possible. The problem is that if I try to import them to Photos.app, it doesn't recognise them.   Is there any way to import the picture with the Live functionality to the app strongwithout duplicating the content/strong?
