OSX keyboard shortcut for pushing button with underlined character <body> Is it possible on OSX to push buttons that have an underlined character? In Windows you can hold in ALT and push the key that is underlined on the button.   Example: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/39C4x.png" alt="enter image description here"  On Windwos I can hit the "Replace"-button by hitting ALT+p, the "Replace all"-button by hitting ALT+a, etc.  How can I achieve this on a mac?  <answer173781> On my Macbook Pro with external keyboard and PHPStorm workd CTRL+ALT+P.  But, before try this shortcut, you need remove from phpstorm internal shortcuts.  <comment202148> Alt is used for special characters on a Mac, so I think you would have to use another key like command or control. <comment204486> Most Mac apps don't have this feature, and as such, it is not part of the OSâ€”meaning it's your app only that's doing it, and it might not work at all. If you tell us what it is maybe we can help you.
