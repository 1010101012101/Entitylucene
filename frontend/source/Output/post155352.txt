iPhone: doesn't change views when tilted <body> When browsing web pages I like to tilt for landscape view. It seems that I can't get it to rotate the image anymore.  Is there a setting for this?  <answer155359> Found the answer to this question: http://support.apple.com/en-us/TS3805  Make sure that Portrait Orientation Lock is off.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QwUCL.png" alt="Control Center"
