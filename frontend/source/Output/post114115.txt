Network stops working, with "Can't Assign Requested Address" <body> On OS X 10.9 (but no prior version), every now and then, I start getting strange network errors.  I can still ping, but anything that requires actual content (like a web page) completely stops.  For example:  precode$ ping 80.68.93.197 PING 80.68.93.197 (80.68.93.197): 56 data bytes 64 bytes from 80.68.93.197: icmp_seq=0 ttl=46 time=175.291 ms 64 bytes from 80.68.93.197: icmp_seq=1 ttl=46 time=172.519 ms ^C --- 80.68.93.197 ping statistics --- 2 packets transmitted, 2 packets received, 0.0% packet loss round-trip min/avg/max/stddev = 172.519/173.905/175.291/1.386 ms $ curl http://dailyjs.com/ curl: (7) Failed to connect to 80.68.93.197: Can't assign requested address /code/pre  It seems similar to this message thread, but I don't see an answer there.  I've tried deleting the ethernet interface and re-adding it, but that doesn't seem to help.  I've tried deleting the ethernet interface and turning on wifi, which shows the same symptoms.  A reboot might fix the problem, but it's rather intrusive.  Any ideas?  <answer116605> A reboot was the only thing that corrected the problem for me.  :(  <answer121455> I saw lots of TCP sessions in CLOSED, FIN_WAIT_1, and several other states, and they were not clearing.  It looks like the TCP timer just stopped.  I had to reboot to get my network back.  <answer126116> I saw this problem rear its head when NFS automounts started failing. They attempted to fall back to UDP. Running mount_nfs -o tcp fileserver:/export/path /mnt/path reliably failed with:  mount_nfs: can't mount /export/path from fileserver onto /mnt/path: Can't assign requested address  kernel.log contains entries like this as well:  Mar 31 15:40:38 guru kernel[0]: 0xfbdf4000, 0xe00002be  Intel82574L::outputStart - NoResources from txFrame - pkt saved  OSX - 10.9  A reboot also cleared the problem.  <answer193325> I cured one by unplugging my USB WiFi interface and plugging it back in.  <answer251642> I just fixed this from the command line on my own workstation running OS X 10.11.6  by flushing the routing table, and then adding my default route back in:  precode    sudo route -n flush     sudo route add default 192.168.1.1 /code/pre  <answer253182> In my case there was only one host giving me this issue. codesudo route delete example.com/code fixed it instantly, no reboot.  <comment141836> Seems like a bug in OSX network stack. Also another message thread at https://discussions.apple.com/thread/5551686?tstart=0 <comment147660> Also, other network connections worked fine (eg: from a browser) Maybe this is a port allocation issue since NFS uses trusted ports. <comment165352> Check whether your VPN software is leaving behind static routes to the tun/tap device: netstat -n -r If that is the case make sure you configure it to reset the primary interface after disconnecting. <comment263520> Just a note; I'm currently running OS X 10.11 (.2 Beta) and I no longer have this problem.  I strongly suspect it was due to the DNS changes in 10.9 which Apple rolled back in 10.11.  So, if anyone is still experiencing these outages, upgrade to the latest version of OS X and that should fix it. <comment341757> This was the only way I could get my Sierra install back on the rails. <comment348222> amazing.... worked like charm ! Thanks @Andy <comment356736> worked for me also, thanks <comment359170> What is causing that problem?
