iPhone 6 screen touch highlights but doesn't activate controls <body> Often, when I touch an iPhone 6 screen control the control highlights, recognizing that it's been touched, but the control doesn't activate to perform its intended function.   Is this an intended mimic of 3D touch?    Is this a feature of iOS (9.3.2), or of the running app?   When it happens I have to touch the control longer for it to take effect.  <comment298749> Do you have any Accessibility settings on? <comment298778> Zoom (Follow focus, smart typing, window zoom), reduce motion, vibration, phone noise cancellation. Any of these interfering?
