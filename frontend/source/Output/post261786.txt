all tabs in iterm are the same terminal (e.g. ttys007) <body> I just downloaded iTerm2 as a replacement for TotalTerminal (i.e. primarily for the 'visor' functionality), but I'm having some trouble with it.  When I open new tabs in a given window (any iterm window) each tab is accessing the same terminal session.  I.e. I currently have three tabs all showing 'ttys007' --- so if I change directories in one of the tabs, all of the others change also.  Now, I just tried splitting a pane, and the second pane emwas a different terminal/em... this is the reverse of the intended behavior right?  Different windows do run different terminal sessions.  macOS Sierra 10.12.1 (16B2659)  hr  Open iTerm2 Issue on GitLab  Edit: The problem is actually just using the keyboard shortcut codeCmd+Shift+Left/Right/code to switch tabs.  Switching by clicking, or using codeCmd+&lt;#&gt;/code works fine.
