Key re-mapping or how get HEX for button <body> i have new macbook air  13". There is "&lt;" button under Esc. I want to rebind this button to semicolon ";". How? Or please tell me, how can I find Hex for this button, than I can change it by my self in defaultkeybinding.dict :) Thanks  <answer68697> DefaultKeyBinding.dict wouldn't work in a lot of applications, and code"&lt;" = (insertText:, ";");/code wouldn't change ⌘&lt; to ⌘;.  You could try using KeyRemap4MacBook and saving this as private.xml:  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt; &lt;root&gt; &lt;item&gt; &lt;name&gt;test&lt;/name&gt; &lt;identifier&gt;private.test&lt;/identifier&gt; &lt;autogen&gt;--KeyToKey-- KeyCode::BACKQUOTE, KeyCode::COMMA, ModifierFlag::SHIFT_L&lt;/autogen&gt; &lt;/item&gt; &lt;/root&gt; /code/pre  KeyCode::BACKQUOTE is the same key code as code&lt;/code on ISO keyboards.  The test folder has an XML file with all the predefined remappings.   Another option would be to create a keylayout file with Ukelele.
