Getting MAC Address from known network <body> I lost my old router, and I need to know its MAC address, only info i got is the log of my Mac (Yosemite), i have found that with this command i got a lot of info about the preferred networks (saved networks) on my Mac.  precodedefaults read /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/com.apple.airport.preferences KnownNetworks /code/pre  And it outputs something like:  precode"wifi.ssid.&lt;77696669 2d756e65&gt;" =     {     AutoLogin = 0;     Captive = 0;     ChannelHistory =         (     );     Closed = 0;     CollocatedGroup =         (     );     Disabled = 0;     LastConnected = "2014-09-19 19:20:23 +0000";     Passpoint = 0;     PossiblyHiddenNetwork = 0;     RoamingProfileType = None;     SPRoaming = 0;     SSID = &lt;77696669 2d756e65&gt;;     SSIDString = "heeeyomywifi";     SecurityType = Open;     SystemMode = 1;     TemporarilyDisabled = 0; }; /code/pre  But i see no MAC address :(, could this be done? or shall I search somewhere else?  <answer164210> You can check the arp table on your mac.  From terminal  precodearp -a /code/pre  <answer164214> Pending how long was the last connection, you could find the answer in your Console log.  I have it showing the information for last 7 days. Back to Dec 23. 2014  In Console type codeMAC/code in the search window.  Look for codeMacAuthEvent/code  In systemlog7.gz file.  EDIT:  If it is older than that:  Use Terminal and type codemdfind systemlog/code  if it shows ....codePreviousSystemLogs/code try that one. (highlight the find and use Reveal in Finder)  If it does not show it in Terminal then look for it in the hidden folder code/private/var/db/code under .cpgz archive that you have to unpack.  <comment192442> Arps are cached for a **very** short amount of time. <comment192446> please add the manufacturer and the model of your lost router <comment192449> Just to make sure we are solving the right problem here: What do you need the MAC (hardware) address of your lost router for? <comment192457> LastConnected = "2014-09-19 19:20:23 +0000" :-( <comment192460> YOUR time machine backup? ;-) <comment192469> From what I can see the answer is correct given some constraints, most prominently the fact that the computer must have (re-)connected to the router within the last seven days. So I don't think it will solve the problem described by the OP. <comment192473> I run `mdfind systemlog` on my Mac here, there are no `...PreviousSystemLogs` at all. <comment192483> Nice. On Snow Leopard is appears as `kernel[0]: Auth result for: xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx MAC AUTH succeeded` <comment192729> @patrix I need it because i want to change some parameters of my network. I cant do it manually entering directly to my router because mi ISP has blocked access to the administration panel from the LAN, nor i can access from the outside, the only way to do it is calling my ISP or accessing to my ISP auto-support web page where i can modify some parameters of my router only if i have the mac address. <comment192730> @patrix, and yes i have tried many tricks like resetting my router, but when i plugin the ISP cable it loads the ISP configuration which blocks all access to common users <comment192731> Thanks for trying, but last access was much time ago :( <comment192734> Yes, tried and only showed last 3 connections
