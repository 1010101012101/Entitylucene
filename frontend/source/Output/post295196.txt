How Do You Launch The Finder Process in Terminal <body> Is it possible to start the Finder process from Terminal? If so, what would be the command?  <answer295198> Simple:  codeopen /System/Library/CoreServices/Finder.app/code  <comment372644> The Finder is started at login and runs all the time a user is logged in so it is open all the time. What exactly are you after? <comment372647> Thanks! works perfectly. <comment372655> It is possible to quit the Finder in any number of ways. You can even add the Command-Q option to the user interface by typing in this Terminal command: `defaults write com.apple.finder QuitMenuItem -bool true` <comment372837> I had set Finder to relaunch but it would not turn back on after shutting off.
