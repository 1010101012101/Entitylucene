Two different locations for Homebrew <body> I had a 3-year old installation of Homebrew in /usr/local/Library/Homebrew. It didn't update properly, so I reinstalled it (without, unfortunately, uninstalling first). This time, Homebrew installed in /usr/local/Homebrew.   Not only are the folder locations different, but the subfolders also are different. Is the old installation deprecated and can I delete it? Or does the new installation depend on the old installation? This is under Mac OS Sierra.  <answer290892> I'm sure new installations of Homebrew are installed under code/usr/local/Homebrew//code, so I see no harm in deleting the old installation. I also noticed I have no code/usr/local/Library//code in my Sierra file structure.  To keep things tidy you might still be able to delete the old installation using the script which has more uninstall options.
