iPhone 4S speaks items on the screen <body> I have an iPhone 4S and I was looking at the photos in my album when it suddenly started speaking all the commands. How do I disable this?  <answer101497> In your settings, check codeGeneral -&gt; Accessibility -&gt; VoiceOver/code, and see if this feature is on. I suspect that it is. Turn it off, and it should stop speaking all of the commands.  <comment119554> What might "taking all the commands" involve? Does it normally ignore your commands or perhaps something else we can help clarify? <comment119558> did you accidentally active the voice control?
