No package 'libffi' found in Homebrew Virtual Environment <body> I'm using a homebrew installation of python and getting an error using pip within a virtualenvwrapper environment:  precodeNo package 'libffi' found Package libffi was not found in the pkg-config search path. Perhaps you should add the directory containing `libffi.pc' to the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable /code/pre  Homebrew has a formula for libffi (codebrew install libffi/code), which seemed to be successful.  I can run  precode$ python-config --include /code/pre  which yields:  precode-I/usr/local/Cellar/python/2.7.9/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/include/python2.7 -I/usr/local/Cellar/python/2.7.9/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/include/python2.7 /code/pre  So should I "add the directory containing `libffi.pc'"?  codeecho $PKG_CONFIG_PATH/code yields an empty string.  [Someone on SO had recommended][3]:  precodeUse -I /opt/local/include on the command line  /code/pre  or  precodeC_INCLUDE_PATH=/opt/local/include in the environment. /code/pre  Would I add the line:  precodeC_INCLUDE_PATH=/usr/local/Cellar/python/2.7.9/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/include/python2.7 /code/pre  to the code~/.bash_profile/code?  or possibly codeexport PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/Cellar/python/2.7.9/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/include/python2.7/code  <answer169605> Figured it out.  precodebrew install libffi  locate libffi.pc /code/pre  (in this case i also had to run the command to build the locate database, for which the code was included in the prompt from locate)  returned code/usr/local/Cellar/libffi/3.0.13/lib/pkgconfig/libffi.pc/code  Then emwithin the virtualenv/em ran codeexport PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/Cellar/libffi/3.0.13/lib/pkgconfig/libffi.pc/code.  Confirmed with codeecho $PKG_CONFIG_PATH/code, which showed the path.  And pip "Successfully installed" the modules!  In case it's useful, this is how I got the virtualenvwrapper environment working:  I have added the following contents to the code~/.bash_profile/code as well as code~/.bashrc/code files:  precodeexport VIRTUALENVWRAPPER_PYTHON=/usr/local/bin/python export VIRTUALENVWRAPPER_VIRTUALENV=/usr/local/bin/virtualenv export WORKON_HOME=$HOME/.virtualenvs source /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH /code/pre  As per this tutorial.  <answer201365> FWIW, I had to actually use codeexport PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/Cellar/libffi/3.0.13/lib/pkgconfig//code to get this to work. Same command, but just the directory instead of the libffi.pc file itself.
