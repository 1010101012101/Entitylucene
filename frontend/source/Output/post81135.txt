Help Viewer Crashing in Mountain Lion <body> I am having trouble with the Help Viewer in Mountain Lion crashing. I first tried updating Lion to Mountain Lion. The problem was very pronounced. Then I re-installed the 10.8.2 combo updater - same problem.  Lastly I did a clean install, them migrated data from my Lion system. I have cleaned out old apps and checked my hard-drive (finding no errors).  Any idea how I find out what's causing this? For reference, the codehelpd/code process is the one that's crashing.
