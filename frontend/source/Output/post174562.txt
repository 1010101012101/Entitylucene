Slide links not working when exporting as PDF from Keynote <body> I've done a presentation in Keynote. On the first screen I included a few links to different slides. I tested them in Keynote and they're working, however when I export to PDF they're simply not there anymore.  Note that used Export to  PDF and not print as PDF and I also looked in the export settings and saw nothing related to links..  <answer181815> I had the same problem. I put the link to a slide on items that were grouped together. If I ungrouped the items (I had text inside a circle) and just selected the text and added the link to that, then when I exported to PDF the links worked.  <answer240279> I had a similar problem running on Keynote 6.6.2 with links to websites not working when exported to PDF. The above answer worked: you have to ungroup assets in Keynote for the links to work in PDF.   strongI used keyboard shortcuts to do about 30 in 20 minutes time:/strong  • Click grouped/linked asset: press kbd⌘/kbd kbdK/kbd to open Hyperlink option   •   Cut the link from the URL bar with kbd⌘/kbd kbdK/kbd • Press Enter to leave the     command   • The group should still be selected; ungroup with     kbd⌘/kbdkbdOption/kbdkbdShift/kbdkbdG/kbd keyboard shortcut   • The ungrouped assets should be     individual now; with them still selected do the Hyperlink shortcut     again: kbd⌘/kbd kbdK/kbd  • Press the down arrow to select webpage to link to, vs     the slide number (in my case, or select whichever you were linking     to) press enter to select.   • Finally, press kbd⌘/kbd kbdV/kbd to paste in the     previous linked URL.   • Re-export as PDF from the FileExport option.     Every link should work now :)  strongemTa da! You just flew through the whole thing with the power of keyboard shortcuts!/em/strong
