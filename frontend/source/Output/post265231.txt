How can I look up Apple hardware recalls (to verify what a apple repair shop told me)? <body> I have a Mac Book Pro that didn't boot up.  I took it to a popular repair shop in NYC and they said they could clean the physical hardware which would often fix the issue.   This involved, of course, a "cleaning fee" of $200.  Two weeks later I discover that they were able to replace the motherboard because it was recalled by apple (actual term of "recall" isn't accurate), and was eligible for a free replacement.   I think I might have gotten had by the repair shop, where if I only looked up my own machine number, I could ask for the free RMA replacement, instead of the "cleaning fee"   strongQuestion/strong  Is there any way I could have navigated this situation better? Is there any way I, as a consumer can look up warranty/recall information specific to my model?  <comment333122> I recommend a visit to the Apple Genius Bar. They will be able to diagnose most basic hardware problems (at no charge). If your hardware is subject to a recall or an extended support then that will be a free repair. If your motherboard was replaced, you can still take it to Apple Genius Bar for them to verify that your hardware has been replaced correctly. They may agree you have been treated poorly and if this was an authorised repair organisation then they may be able to take some sort of action.
