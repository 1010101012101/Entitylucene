How do I tell OS X to always mirror displays when I plug them in? <body> I plug the same external HDMI monitor in every day, and each time, I have to manually switch from external to mirrored mode. It's minor, but annoying.  Is there a way to tell OS X to default to mirror mode whenever I plug in a monitor? I looked in codeSystem Preferences -&gt; Displays/code, but I couldn't find such an option.  <answer179067> You didn't say what version of OS X you are using. Yosemite remembers your settings by default so just set it once.  <comment122415> Do you use both the screens together?, if not when connecting to the external display, plug the Macbook to power and close the lid. that's what I do when I am not using the Macbook screen. <comment122445> Why not just use extended mode? You benefit from the extra screen space, and the resolution would be more appropriate for each monitor <comment122819> @XAleXOwnZX I did not ask for whether X was a good idea, I asked for how to do X. <comment122840> I'm aware but it's a valid question nonetheless. You don't have to solve a problem that might not exist. <comment122877> It's not a problem so much as a preference. <comment186030> +1 because I'd like to do the opposite - always connect in extended mode since I don't want people to see my desktop when I plug in an external monitor (i.e. before I have had time to switch off mirroring). Note that a keyboard shortcut to switch between mirror and extend is Command+F1.
