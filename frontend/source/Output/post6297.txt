How can I rotate a video? <body> I just recorded a video on my phone, but when I play it on my Mac it's in the wrong orientation.   How can I rotate the video by 90 degrees so that I can upload it to youtube?  Free solutions are preferred.  hr  I just found out how to do it using YouTube's Video Editor which has rotate left/right buttons.   But this is not an answer how to rotate on Mac.  <answer6300> Using codeffmpeg/code you have a few techniques:  For newer versions of codeffmpeg/code use:  precodeffmpeg -i in.avi -vf "transpose=1" out.avi /code/pre  For older versions of codeffmpeg/code:  precodeffmpeg -vfilters "rotate=90" -i input.mp4 output.mp4 /code/pre  hr  Using codemencoder/code:  precodemencoder -oac copy -ovc lavc -vf rotate=1 original.mp4 -o 90_CW_rotated.mp4  mencoder -oac copy -ovc lavc -vf rotate=2 original.mp4 -o 90_CCW_rotated.mp4 /code/pre  Sources: ffmpeg, mencoder  <answer6303> You can use MPEG Stream Clip: http://www.squared5.com/svideo/mpeg-streamclip-mac.html  Simply open the file and choose to export it from the file menu in a format of your choosing, selecting the appropriate rotation in the selection box.  You can find out the current format of the video by choosing File  Show Stream Info as to match the export to the input settings if required.  <answer25372> h2Use QuickTime to Rotate Videos/h2  You don't need to use any 3rd party tools to do this. It's built right in to QuickTime Player.   Any file that can be opened in QuickTime can be rotated by choosing codeEdit &gt; Rotate Left (or Right)/code or by typing kbdCommand/kbd-kbdShift/kbd-kbdL / R/kbd.  If you alter a movie file in this way and attempt to close the file (kbdCommand/kbd-kbdW/kbd) you will be prompted to save your changes. Save them to a new file and you will have a newly rotated video.  h2Share your Video on YouTube with QuickTime/h2  QuickTime also has a built-in way to share your video on YouTube. With the video open (and correctly rotated now) select codeShare &gt; YouTube.../code  <answer96819> Just open QT and it automatically rotates it. Then simply export it.  <answer100211> If you are willing to trust a web-based solution you can do the following:  ol liGo to video.online-convert.com./li liFrom left menu, choose what is your desired file format (select avi or mp4 if you don’t know much about this)/li liChoose your file, it can be of any size and format/li liWithout changing or entering any settings, just choose to which angle you want to rotate your video/li liPress “Convert button” and wait for the file to upload and convert./li liConverted file will be automatically downloaded/li /ol  Source  <answer115421> Use the kbd⌘ Cmd/kbd+kbdShift/kbd+kbdL/kbd, kbdR/kbd, etc. when you open the video in Quicktime.  That should do the trick.  <comment28686> MPEG Streamclip is one of the best applications! +1 for an awesome recommendation! <comment28687> It may be great but it's totally unnecessary for this task. QuickTime is fully capable of this. <comment117949> Answers should be more than just a link, can you please summarize the video in your answer? <comment117952> Sorry, it's not a video, it's a tutorial. This tutorial is simple as compared to Wikihow's method where they tell you to download software and other complex methods that are difficult for basic users. I've edited and simplified my answer. <comment117955> The idea is to make answers stand on their own. Links may break rendering link-only answers useless. <comment124285> For further reference: use `ffmpeg -vf` <comment166402> Vertical Video Syndrome (VVS): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bt9zSfinwFA <comment215213> Agreed if you need to do this goto the next suggestion. Do not introduce more software to complete this task. Sam's method using the built in quicktime program is far easier. <comment269704> Well this didn't work. The video when rotated goes black. <comment270758> Same problem The video when rotated goes black <comment297621> Same here, using QuickTime on El Capitan. <comment298774> While MPEG Streamclip is an excellent program, it is very wonky when doing rotations: it's very difficult to get the settings right. By contrast, Quicktime does what you expect the first time, although almost always with a much larger file than you began with (then you can use MPEG Streamclip to get the file small again!).
