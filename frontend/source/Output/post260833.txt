How to force Lion Server Time Machine to backup IMAP .Trash folders? <body> Using Mozilla Thunderbird as IMAP mail client for an OS X 10.6 (Lion) based e-mail server, the result is that Thunderbird creates a hidden trash (code.Trash/code) IMAP folder in the users mailbox directory.  That is OK until your server crashes and you need to restore OS X from its Time Machine backup. Then the IMAP code.Trash/code folders are strongnot restored/strong. It turns out that Time Machine doesn't even backup any IMAP folders that are named code.Trash/code:  precode$ sudo ls -l /private/var/spool/imap/dovecot/mail/3876A085-58CF-44FA-94FF-3011EAB9912A/ total 40 drwx------  6 postmaster  mail  204 Nov 12 14:28 .Trash drwx------  2 postmaster  mail   68 Nov 12 14:28 cur ... $ sudo ls -l /Volumes/Time\ Machine/Backups.backupdb/Server/Latest/Server\ HD/private/var/spool/imap/dovecot/mail/3876A085-58CF-44FA-94FF-3011EAB9912A/ total 40 drwx------@ 2 postmaster  mail   68 Nov 12 14:28 cur ... /code/pre  h3Workaround/h3  The result is that users can no longer delete messages in their IMAP account until the code.Trash/code folder is recreated with correct permissions and ownership:  precode$ sudo mkdir /private/var/spool/imap/dovecot/mail/3876A085-58CF-44FA-94FF-3011EAB9912A/.Trash $ sudo chmod 700 /private/var/spool/imap/dovecot/mail/3876A085-58CF-44FA-94FF-3011EAB9912A/.Trash $ sudo chown mailboxusername /private/var/spool/imap/dovecot/mail/3876A085-58CF-44FA-94FF-3011EAB9912A/.Trash /code/pre  h3Regression/h3  StdExclusions.plist doesn't contain any text like code.Trash/code, neither does the file code/Library/Preferences/com.apple.TimeMachine/code.
