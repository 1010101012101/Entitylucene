Flag/Unflag shortcut in mail.app <body> I learned that kbd⇧/kbdkbd⌘/kbdkbdL/kbd in mail.app should toggle the flag of a selected message. However, it doesn't work for me... I'm using Snow Leopard and Mail 4.5. Any ideas?  <answer32066> In Lion the shortcut is exactly that and you can actually take a look at the menu:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/tjhJn.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Make sure you're using the right one. If you wanted to alter those, you'd have to go to System Preferences - Keyboard - Keyboard Shortcuts and add a new one:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qbwZc.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer32128> codecmd-L/code was set as the eminput source/em shortcut. This caused a conflict with the codecmd-shift-L/code of mail.app. Once I have changes the input source shortcut (to codecmd-M/code) and restarted mail.app everything worked as expected.  <comment36778> The problem in my case was that there was a conflict between the cmd-shift-l of mail.app and cmd-l which I use to change the input language...

Please take a look at the [FAQs](http://apple.stackexchange.com/faq) for more info. Thanks. <comment36835> I explicitly wrote that I'm not using Lion... Anyway, thanks for the detailed answer. <comment36849> @Dror I know you were using Snow Leopard (I actually added the tag to your question) but I was suspecting that you had a Keyboard Shortcut conflict, and hence why I posted the info. Glad you fixed it. <comment36887> Somehow I didn't understand it from your answer... I thought it was Lion oriented. Anyway - thanks for the hint and help!
