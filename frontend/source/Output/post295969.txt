Mac enabling auto-brightness and turning backlit keyboard full every time I reboot <body> I am running macOS High Sierra 10.13 Beta (17A352a) on my MacBook Air (13-inch, Early 2015). Whenever I reboot my laptop it turns my backlit keyboard to full brightness and turns on display auto-brightness which I dislike. I have to go into system preferences and turn it off every time.   This has been occurring since I updated to High Sierra. This is not really a major issue for me but it is very annoying.   Any help would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks in advance.   <comment373795> I do not have the same problem as you. High Sierra is still in beta. You should file a bug report with Apple. https://bugreport.apple.com <comment373806> Done. Thanks for the comment :) Hopefully it is fixed soon.
