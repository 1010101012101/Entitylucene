Open all iCloud tabs from iPhone on Mac <body> TLDR; Is there a way to simultaneously open all iCloud tabs saved on iPhone, on a Mac?  I use my iPhone for browsing and as a means of "read it later" I just leave the open tabs there with the purpose of opening them all later on my Mac. Is there a way to open them all (much like Chrome allows in the "Tabs from other devices" in History page)?   <answer266557> Assuming you don't require them to open literally simultaneously, but simply rapidly, this is quite doable.  First, add the iCloud Tabs icon (img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/as5Do.png" width="18" alt="iCloud Tabs icon") to your Safari toolbar, if it isn't there already. To do this, right-click the toolbar, select "Customize Toolbar…", and drag the icon to where you want it.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vYIaV.png" alt="add the icon to the toolbar"  Once the icon is in your toolbar, click it. A list of tabs open on your other devices will appear. To quickly open lots or all of these pages in Safari, simply hold down the command key (kbd⌘/kbd) while you click each site you want to open.  Command-clicking a link, bookmark, or other reference to a page will, by default, open it in a background tab. If you find, when you command-click one of the items in the list, that it opens in the foreground and closes the iCloud Tabs menu, either emshift/em-command-click, or deselect "When a new tab or window opens, make it active" in Safari's tab preferences (Safari  Preferences…  Tabs).  <comment334239> Even though not so easy to use as the Chrome solution and tabs opened on iPhone take some time to appear on desktop, it fits the bill. Thanks!
