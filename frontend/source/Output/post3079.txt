How I can save a screenshot of an iPhone application? <body> I want to take a screenshot of an iPhone or iPad application to share.  How is that accomplished?  <answer3080> Press the home button and the sleep button simultaneously. Newer phones have the sleep,on the side instead of the top but save images the same.   This will save a picture of the current iPhone screen to the em"Photos"/em application. From there, you can either email it to anyone you want or sync it to your computer.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MisT3.jpg" alt="buttons to press"  Assistive touch also works on newer iOS versions.   ul liHow can I create iPhone screenshots without the lock button?/li /ul  On iOS 11 screen recording might be if use for capturing transient events where your reflexes or the device itself isnâ€™t responsive enough at the correct moment.   ul liHow do I take a screenshot in iOS without hitting the Home Button and the Power Button?/li /ul  <comment2721> [Illustration](http://www.examiner.com/images/blog/wysiwyg/image/iPhoneScreenshot.jpg) to complement your answer. :-) <comment343811> Works on iPhone6 (although sleep is now button on top right  side)
