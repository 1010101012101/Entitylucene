Is there a way to set application-specific 'hot corners' in OS X? <body> OS X's 'hot corners' feature is great, but I'd like to use it in just one specific application - or, set a specific hot corner action for one app, and a emdifferent/em action (for the same corner) in another app.  Is there a tool that can do this?  The tool CornerClick seems to have a lot of custom features over OS X's own one, but from a brief look it doesn't seem it offers a way to actually isolate/customize hot corners to specific apps per se.  <answer128653> h2CornerClick and AppleScript/h2  Try creating an AppleScript that is triggered by CornerClick. Your AppleScript could check which application is front most and act accordingly.  h2Enhancement Request/h2  Also, consider opening an enhancement request with CornerClick.
