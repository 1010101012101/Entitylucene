Copy BPM & Star rating to Comments in itunes using Applescript <body> I want an applescript to grab the BPM &amp; Star Rating of a selected group of MP3's and paste the info into the comments section.   I found this code that will copy the star rating one track at a time but I do not know applescript well enough to modify it to do a group of selected tracks and also grab the BPM.   precodetell application "iTunes"     set theTrack to (item 1 of (get selection))     set theRating to rating of theTrack     if theRating = 100 then         set comment of theTrack to "5 Star"     else if theRating ≥ 80 then         set comment of theTrack to "4 Star"     else if theRating ≥ 60 then         set comment of theTrack to "3 Star"     else if theRating ≥ 40 then         set comment of theTrack to "2 Star"     else if theRating ≥ 20 then         set comment of theTrack to "1 Star"     else if theRating = 0 then         set comment of theTrack to "0 Star"     end if end tell /code/pre  <answer211617> You want to grab the selection, which will be a list of tracks. Then, you use a repeat block to process each track in the list. Here's the script. You may want to adds checks to make sure iTunes is running, and some try blocks in case of failures:  precodetell application "iTunes"     set selectedTracks to selection     repeat with thisTrack in selectedTracks         set theRating to rating of thisTrack         set theBPM to bpm of thisTrack         set theComment to "" &amp; (theRating / 20 as integer) &amp; " star | BPM: " &amp; theBPM         set comment of thisTrack to theComment     end repeat end tell /code/pre  <comment255174> I actually figured out how to edit a script to get the BPM. Now I just need to make this script able to edit a selection.
