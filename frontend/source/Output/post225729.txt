Lock down a device address in AirPort Utility? <body> I have one device on my network that does not use any form of rDNS or Bonjour, and I have to access it primarily through ssl. So I'd like to to stop moving around in the IP listing so I know where it is (instead of, as I did yesterday, assuming it was broken). Is there a way, through the AirPort Utility, to give a particular device, as identified by MAC, a specific non-changing IP address?  <answer225744> Try the steps detailed at this URL: http://www.macinstruct.com/node/553  ol liFind your Mac's MAC address for the Wi-Fi network interface.
