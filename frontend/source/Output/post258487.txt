Preview app make PDF's Bookmarks not clickable <body> My MacBook (Sierra) sometimes gets a weird behavior when opening a PDF in Preview.app. It makes the PDF not clickable on Bookmarks after reopening. All of bookmarks only links to the first page and then other apps opening the file get the same behavior as well. (May be Preview changed the Bookmarks). It's not always get that but very often so it's difficult to find out what's happening. Please help. Thanks in advance.  <comment323314> Is the Table of Content part of the document, or are you referring to bookmarks? Can you find out which mechanism is used to get from the Table of Contents to the actual page (link, JavaScript, etc.; you may have to open the document in Acrobat to find out). <comment323363> oh sorry, my bad, I used to call Bookmarks as TOC since it often has the same content. In my case, I mean Bookmarks was not clickable, Table of Content had no problem. I am able to edit bookmarks to link to the actual page line by line but it takes so long (hundreds of bookmark lines) and the first version (before opening in Preview.app) is not like that. Thank for your comment. <comment323462> If the bookmarks were using JavaScript to get to the targets, they won't work in Preview.app because Preview.app is too dumb (and does not know JavaScript at all). I did read elsewhere that the most recent Preview.app seems to have problems with active elements (such as bookmarks) in general (but I have not verified that).
