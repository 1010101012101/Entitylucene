Where are my own contact details <body> In the contact list there is no entry for my own contact details. All there is is my mobile number at the top of the list.  But I have a home landline number, desk phone at work and some email addresses, how do I view/use these?  <answer230309> Tap your entry at the top of the list, it's really a full contact and can be edited as such.  <answer230312> To create your own contact:  1) Make a new contact with your name and info, like you'd make one for someone else.  2) Go to codeSettings &gt; Mail, Contacts, Calendars/code  3) Under the codeContacts/code section should be an option called codeMy Info/code. Select this, then pick your new contact from the pop up list.  <comment280968> Tap your entry at the top of the list, it's really a full contact and can be edited as such. <comment281091> @Tyson You should make that into an answer, Tyson. <comment286499> Cool, it works, cheers mate. <comment286500> Nice one, mate.
