connecting my laptop to iPhone HotSpot using Ethernet adapter <body> Can someone suggest an adapter to connect to iPhone hotspot through Ethernet data cable?  Wireless hardware in my laptop has stopped working and I am using Ethernet cable to connect to Internet. But once in a while, I want to use it outside and I am looking for some kind of hardware to connect to iPhone HotSpot.   I looked at codeIOGEAR Universal Ethernet to Wi-Fi N Adapter/code and it could have worked but their customer support said they have had problems to connect to hotspot and they haven't tried iPhone hotspot yet.  https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004UAKCS6/ref=cm_sw_r_tw_dp_x_YL-9ybAKFN7NK  <answer281346> h1How to Use Your iPhone’s Personal Hotspot to Tether on Windows and macOS/h1  First of all: not every cellular carrier includes this feature in every plan. If your cellular data plan doesn’t allow for tethering, you may not see the Personal Hotspot option at all on your iPhone’s settings screen. You may have to pay extra to gain access to it.  Second, it’s important to remember that when you use your iPhone as a data connection, you are using your mobile data plan and as such, if you have a data cap, then it will count towards that. If you have unlimited data or a large cap, then this might not trouble you, but you’ll otherwise want to be mindful of what you’re using you computer for when connected to your iPhone as a hotspot.  Even if you have unlimited data, there’s a good chance you have a limited amount of tethering data — or, at least, high-speed tethering data. Your carrier may charge you extra if you need more tethering data. Check your cellular plan for more details about your plan’s hotspot, or tethering, capabilities.  Lastly, Wi-Fi tethering will also drain your phone’s battery more quickly. I recommend connecting your iPhone to a power source–or plug it into your laptop via USB cable–while tethering. Be sure to disable the hotspot when you’re not using it, too.  hr  h2How to Turn On Your iPhone’s Personal Hotspot/h2  As the wireless hardware in your laptop has stopped working, there are two ways to connect to your iPhone and use its data connection: Bluetooth, and USB. When you turn Personal Hotspot on, it will allow you to use any of these three options–you don’t need to alter any settings.  ol liOpen the strongSettings/strong app and tap strongPersonal Hotspot/strong to access the Personal Hotspot settings./li liTurn Personal Hotspot on using the switch along the top of the Personal Hotspot settings./li /ol  Next, it’s time to connect to your hotspot on your laptop using Bluetooth, or USB.  hr  h2Connect to Your Hotspot via Bluetooth/h2  USB is faster than Bluetooth, but if you’d prefer to use Bluetooth to connect to your hotspot, you can do that too.  h3On Windows/h3  To connect via Bluetooth from a Windows computer:   ol liClick on the strongBluetooth/strong icon in the system tray and select strongJoin a Personal Area Network/strong./li liClick “Add a Device” in the upper-left corner./li liChoose your iPhone from the resulting screen and click strongNext/strong to continue. em(Like any other Bluetooth connection, you’ll be shown a pair code on your computer and your iPhone.)/em/li liCompare the two passcodes, and if they are the same, tap strongPair/strong on your iPhone’s screen and strongYes/strong on the Windows pair screen. em(Allow your Windows machine to install the necessary files on your system.)/em/li liRight-click on your iPhone to connect it as an access point. You’re ready to surf the Internet, check e-mail, chat, and so on./li /ol  h3On macOS/h3  ol liHead to strongSystem Preferences/strong  strongBluetooth/strong, find your iPhone in the list, and click strongPair/strong next to your iPhone. em(You’ll be shown a pair code on your Mac’s screen and on your iPhone.)/em/li liIf the codes match, tap the strongPair/strong button to confirm the connection./li liFrom your Mac’s menu bar, click the strongBluetooth symbol/strong, then stronghighlight your iPhone/strong in the list, and click strongConnect to Network/strong.

As long as you have your Personal Hotspot turned on, all you need to do is:  ol liPlug your phone in with a USB cable and you should be good to go./li /ol  h3On Windows/h3  On our Windows’ network adapters, we can see we’re connected via strongApple Mobile Device Ethernet/strong.  h3On macOS/h3  On our Mac, we can see in the Network settings that our iPhone is connected through our USB connection.  hr  h2Which Method Is Best?/h2  USB is the fastest but most inconvenient, requiring your iPhone to be physically connected to the computer. Still, it’s super simple to set up, requiring zero configuration.  Bluetooth is the slowest of the two, also requiring the most configuration, though once it’s done, you don’t have to worry about it again.  <comment353981> What kind of laptop do you have?  With a Mac, just plug the phone in to a USB port with a lightning cable. <comment354004> I've 15GB from AT&T and I have used it several times to connect my laptop to Internet. I haven't thought about connecting to hotspot from USB. My work computer is old but I will give this a try.
