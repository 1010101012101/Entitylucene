Find Google Chrome Installation Directory On MAC Using Terminal <body> How do find the Google Chrome Installation Directory/Path using command line. Is Google Chrome always installed on default path "/Applications/" folder.   I have tried the following Commands can anyone suggests what am i doing wrong.  ol listronglocate "*Chrome.app"/strong :: When i used this command it only search the DB entries of installed software./li listrongfind / -type d -name "*Chrome.app"/strong :: List all the file on system.Please tell me how can i find only Google Chrome path using this command or is there other way/li /ol  Thanks in Advanced  <answer95838> You could do this from a shell prompt:  precodeosascript -e 'POSIX path of (path to application "Chrome")' /code/pre  However note that this will also launch Chrome if it isn't already running.  See: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5860517/path-to-application-without-opening-it  <answer95839> Your second command  precodefind / -type d -name "*Chrome.app"  /code/pre  should work - it works ok on my system.  What do you mean by "List all the file on system"? "find" will search your file system from '/' as you specified, but if you think Chrome.app could get installed in some odd place, "find" is one sure way to locate it.    <answer95872> You can query for this kind of information using the Launch Services database to dump a list of all registered apps, then codegrep/code for the one you want (in this case Google Chrome), for example (using Mountain Lion 10.8.4):  precode/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Versions/A/Support/lsregister -dump | grep -i "google chrome" /code/pre  gives me the output:  precodepath:          /Applications/Google Chrome.app/ executable:    Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome path:          /Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/Versions/27.0.1453.116/Google Chrome Helper.app/ executable:    Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome Helper /code/pre  <comment112472> Hi Keith, Thanks for reply. I needs to find the absolute path of the application (Google Chrome) only using terminal, that command i will used in my MDM Zinc Application.My Project Requirement <comment112506> As noted the find command should work a better version would be to not include the * - what does it actually show ? <comment112507> why do you need this path? <comment112542> If you mean "find all installations of Chrome" on your file system, 'find' as you've written will provide those paths.
