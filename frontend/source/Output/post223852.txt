How to upgrade brew ssh after recent client exploit? <body> I'm running OS X El Capitan 10.11.1  Since the recently discovered SSH client exploit mentioned here I wanted to take action to secure myself. In the process I noticed I'm using Apple's ssh and not the brew version I have installed. So I wanted to change that. One of the things I need to do is edit the file below to point to code/usr/local/bin/ssh-agent/code instead of the system default code/usr/bin/ssh-agent/code. However, even as sudo, I cannot edit this file. It only opens as readonly.  precodesudo vi /System/Library/LaunchAgents/org.openbsd.ssh-agent.plist /code/pre  How can I open this file in read/write mode?  <answer223855> To be able to modify certain directories/files in OS X El Capitan you have to disable System Integrity Protection (SIP) AKA “rootless”:  ol liReboot your Mac into Recovery Mode by restarting your computer and holding down kbdcmd/kbd+kbdR/kbd until the Apple logo appears on your screen./li liIn the menubar click Utilities  Terminal./li liIn the Terminal window, type in codecsrutil disable/code./li liRestart your Mac./li liAfter finishing your mods re-enable it in Recovery Mode with codecsrutil enable/code./li /ol  hr  The file em/System/Library/LaunchAgents/org.openbsd.ssh-agent.plist/em may be replaced in the next system update.  <comment271374> Yes it was.
