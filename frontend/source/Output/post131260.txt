How to add sites to the Safari Power Saver exclusion list? <body> In Safari, a feature I really like is that flash plugins are automatically blocked by default and you have to click in order to start the flash plugin (see, e.g., http://mac-fusion.com/manage-the-safari-power-saver-feature/). I found, however, that it prevents Google Play's "play music" buttons from working, so I had to temporarily disable the feature (uncheck the "Stop plug-ins to save power" box) and restart Safari in order to listen to music on Google Play.  There is some sort of exclusion list. I currently have 3 sites listed, but I do not know how they got there. How do I add a site, e.g. codeplay.google.com/code, to this list?  I don't see a UI to do this, but perhaps there is a way of editing a plist to insert a new entry?  <answer131350> Thanks to Thecafremo's tip, the responsible file is code~/Library/Safari/PlugInOrigins.plist/code.  I found an AppleScript published by GitHub user crmne (Carmine Paolino), codeSafariPowerSaverWhitelister.scpt/code, that is supposed to add entries (https://gist.github.com/crmne/5855a901a0a9a6ef30a5).  You might try it, but it did not work for me in Safari 7.0.3.  Instead, after clicking on a "play music" button, I opened up Web Inspector and ran the following JavaScript on the console:  precodewindow.embedElem = document.querySelector("embed"); embedElem.style.position = "fixed"; embedElem.style.width = "100px"; embedElem.style.height = "100px"; embedElem.style.top = "500px"; /code/pre  There was a 100x100 black square hovering on the left of the page toward the bottom.  After clicking it, Safari added an entry to the exclusions list for codeplay.google.com/code.  <comment154159> Perhaps [this](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/5514058) will help you with your problem.
