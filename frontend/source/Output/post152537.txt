Fixing a couple of odd problems after I dropped my MacBook <body> I dropped my MacBook (six years old, running OS X 10.6.8) on the ground, and have observed a couple of odd problems since then:  ul liWhenever I open my MacBook it attempts to eject the CD, makes a couple of violent-sounding noises, fails, and gives up. (Also, the software no longer recognizes that there is a CD in the drive.) Whenever I try software solutions (e.g. drutil tray eject) it does the same./li liOccasionally, roughly every two or three minutes, the computer freezes for about ten seconds. When it does this it often highlights the "File" option in the menu at the top./li /ul  Otherwise my MacBook works fine. Anyone know how I might fix these issues? (Especially the second, if I busted my CD drive I can live with that.)  <answer152542> ul liIt sounds like the CD drive is broken./li liA sign of potential future HDD failure. Does the drive make any clicking noises or any strange sounds? I'd make a full backup and prepare for the worst, especially considering the age of the machine./li /ul
