Troubles after changing keyboard layout with Ukelele <body> I used Ukelele and modified a layout.  I copied the bundle file from code/System/Library/Keyboard Layouts/code to my desktop, then saved my new layout to the bundle-file. I replaced the original one with the modified one, then rebooted my iMac (Mac OS X Snow leopard), but at the login screen I'm stuck.  I can't enter my passwordâ€”it does not respond to the input, but the Function keys do work, I can adjust brightness etc.  How can I undo this? I don't have a Time Machine backup and clean install is not an option.  <comment182874> Maybe try a Windows keyboard - something that will force it to have another look at what's connected. <comment182902> One way or another I think you will have to reinstall your OS.  Next time just put your new layout on its own in Home/Library/Keyboard Layouts and leave the system bundle as is.
