MBP does not install Windows 10 Pro recommended updates <body> I don't know why my MBP (Mid-2014) does not install Windows 10 recommended updates which are mostly drivers' update through Windows 10 update normal procedure.   Good to know that I can not find these type of updates under "System = Update &amp; Security"; however, my antivirus (ESET) shows me that there are some recommended updates and it's good to be installed!  This inconsistency should have caused by something which I could not figure this out yet.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3fVfF.jpg" alt="ESET) shows me that there are some recommended updates"  <comment286231> Are you running Windows 10 Home or Pro? <comment286299> I edited the title, I am running windows 10 Pro 64bit - Build 10586.164
