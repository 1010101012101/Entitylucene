Boot Camp Assistant: "Your disk could not be restored to a single partition." <body> I want to delete my Windows partition and regrow my Mac partition to use the whole disk. But when I click Restore in the Boot Camp Assistant, it says:     Your disk could not be restored to a single partition.      An error occurred while restoring the disk to a single partition.   I'm using Mac OS X 10.8.5, on a mid-2009 MacBook Pro.  <answer111063> ol liGo to Disk Utilities/li liclick the Windows Partition and then Format It as Mac OS X Journaled/li lithen click Enable Journaling on the Disk Utility Toolbar/li lithen go to the MAIN DISC and Click on the Partition tab/li liremove the Windows Partition which is now "Mac OS X Journaled"/li liafter removing it, resize the partition size of the main partition to the maximum/li /ol  Then, you should have your full sized disc for use and you can use bootcamp later.  <answer117196> ol liGo to Disk Utilities/li liSelect Windows partition and make sure you MOUNT IT/li liOnce Windows partition is mounted, return to Boot Camp Assistant/li liRe-try Restore and it should run OK now and restore the Mac partition to the size of the whole disk./li /ol  <answer140067> Just restarting and trying again solved the problem for me.   <answer141846> Today I tried the various suggestions above, but couldn't restore the Mac partition.  This may have been in part due to the fact the amount I initially partition for Bootcamp wasn't  sufficient, so decreased the Mac partition and then use Mini-Tool Partition on Windows side to extend my Bootcamp partition.    Instead I used Disk Utility to erase the unwanted partition, and then I was able to restore it through the Boot Camp Assistant.  <answer142873> I had this issue and I solved it by doing the following.  ol liGo to "Disk Utility.app"/li liSelect your Windows Partition/li liClick "Erase" and select "Mac OS Extended (Journaled)"/li liErase the partition/li liOnce that has completed, select the Complete Disk (Not Partitioned) img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/tjJZt.png" alt="enter image description here"/li liNow select "Partition"/li liSelect the newly Formatted "Windows" partition and select the "-" symbol at the bottom to remove the partionbr img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xQt1r.png" alt="enter image description here"/li liYou should see an empty space where the partition was/li liSelect your main partition, and to the right where it says "Size", type the Disk's full size and hit enterbr img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wa2ap.png" alt="enter image description here"/li liAfter Disk Utility completes the resizing, you should now have a single, full partition again./li /ol  <answer214478> I fixed it in 10.11.1 El Capitan by formatting the Bootcamp Partition several times to FAT formatting. Then going back into Bootcamp Assistant and telling it to once again restore the original boot partition to size. This then asked to adjust my settings for Bootcamp 4 times. I said yes each time. This removed the Bootcamp partition completely for good.  <comment164546> Lol, StackOverflow gave me a Popular Question badge for this. Zero upvotes. <comment259366> In newer versions of Disk Utility, "Enable Journaling" is available under the `File` menu. <comment298259> This might have been effective at the time, but it ended with a rude surprise for me on El Cap: The Boot Camp partition is gone, but the space it was using is also also gone. It's not available for me to reallocate to the main OS X partition! <comment358495> Worked for me on Sierra
