Removing software that came from a pkg file? <body> I can't find the uninstaller. I installed some service using a pkg file and now I want to get rid of it. How do I do that? I would prefer not to use lsbom and rm and stuff. It looks scary.  <answer3432> I recommend you try something like AppZapper ($) or  AppCleaner (Freeware). There are others that work similarly.  <answer3433> For the most part, Mac applications don't have uninstallers because they're rarely needed. You can almost always just toss the undesired offender into your trash.  <answer3444> Not a direct answer to your question, but you can also use "Suspicious Package", a QuickLook plug-in for Finder, to see what files a package installed: http://www.mothersruin.com/software/SuspiciousPackage/  Depending on what files were installed where, you may be able to find them in Finder and drag to the trash; otherwise you may have to go into Terminal and rm around.  <comment3155> After downvoting an answer, it's considered polite to say why in a comment. <comment3174> Agreed (I didnâ€™t do it) <comment3249> Neither of them have a pkg removal option that I can find... <comment3251> I disagree. After much digging I found this package installed a service and a launchagent. The service was eating CPU and memory at login. I had to manually remove them. <comment3253> Tx. Helps prevention. Though a remedy would be nice.
