Does my Game Center ID change when I upgrade my iPhone? <body> I'm about to get a new phone and obviously would like to transfer my CoC village.  Are my Game Center credentials the same as my Apple ID? Also, does anybody know the process I need to take to transfer my CoC village over from iOS over to Android?  <answer223270> Your Game Center account will be the same as on your old iPhone so long as you sign into the same Game Center account when setting up your new iPhone. Game Center credentials should be the same as your Apple ID. strongGame Center is only present in Apple's iOS, in other words Game Center is for iPhones only./strong  Regarding your other question about how to transfer your village across OSes: that's off-topic here, look to the developers website for support on that.  <answer223274> As RedEagle suggests, your Game Center ID would not change from phone to phone, as long as you sign in with the same Apple ID.  To transfer your Clash of Clans village from iOS to Android, tap Settings, the gear icon (in Clash of Clans itself), tap "Link a Device", and proceed from there. Essentially you will get a code on your iOS device that you put in your Android device to transfer your village and its data.  <comment270671> While mostly correct, Game Center is only available on iOS devices.   There is no Game Center on Android, so the OP cannot login to Game Center after leaving the iOS platform. <comment270672> While mostly correct, Game Center is only available on iOS devices.

I clarified my post. <comment270674> You are correct in the OP not being able to log into Game Center after leaving the iOS platform, but **Clash of Clans specifically supports the transfer of one's village from iOS to Android platforms and vice versa**. <comment270675> right...  I just want to clarify that the Game Center id does not change between **iPhones** but is not available on Android phones, as the OPs post suggests switching (clearly a bad choice, but that's another topic)
