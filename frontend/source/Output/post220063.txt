Is there a way to set the dock height in fixed pixels? <body> I want to set the dock size to 40 pixels.  Is there anyway to do it in Yosemite?    <answer220083> The Dock height is delineated by the size of the icons on the Dock, called the tilesize.

Do you have a Retina display? Feel free to adjust the formula based on results for the AppleScript, but the formula works fine for measurements obtained with xScope.
