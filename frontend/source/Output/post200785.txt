ffmpeg - how to merge two h264 videos, using one of them as alpha? <body> I need to merge two 264 videos: one of the two is a normal rgb video, and the other is a greyscale video that I would use as luma matte to make a final prores clip with alpha.  Is it possible doing it in terminal using ffmpeg?  It would be great to wrap it in a nice GUI too! (advice on making it?)  <comment242020> What step have you taken to accomplish this task? If it didn't work, how did it fail? <comment242096> I was asking if there is a way using the ffmpeg command line that that could accomplish that task... I've got no experience using it :(
