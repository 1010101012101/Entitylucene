After deleting a partition, iMac will only boot to a grey screen -- how do I fix this? <body> I was deleting a partition when my iMac froze and rebooted itself. Now I can't get any further during boot than a grey screen.  Things I have tried to fix this include:  ul liBooting with CMD-R (boots to a grey screen)/li liResetting the PRAM (boots to a grey screen)/li liResetting SMC (boots to a grey screen)/li liBooted in target disk mode and repaired the disk. Disk repair was successful but a reboot booted to a grey screen/li liAttempted to boot from an install disk but all I get is the grey screen/li liAttempted to boot in Safe Mode. This gets about half way and then fails./li liCMD-V on boot shows last posted messages as: codeSMCREADKEYACTION ERROR SMCREADDATA 8 FAILED/code/li /ul  Do you think the hard drive is done even though Disk Utility said it was okay? Or is something else wrong with it?  This is a 2006 iMac 6.1.  <comment171232> The formatting and information here make this question hard to decipher.

You obviously have done something to the boot sector, so it needs to be recreated, assuming there is no screwed up partitioning. <comment171339> when i try to boot from install disk i get grey screen spinning wheel then .full grey screen. how do i fix boot sector?
