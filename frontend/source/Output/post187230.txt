Reset iPad mini forgotten Apple ID <body> I wanted to know if there is a way to reset my son's iPad mini, because he forgot the Apple ID password. He accidentally reformat, and now, he doesn't know the password.  <answer187610> Try resetting on iOS then create new apple I.D. Use an email address and use a different password.  <comment221247> Start at https://iforgot.apple.com <comment221801> (I've had the same problem before.) <comment221810> & have to buy all your apps againâ€¦ lose your old photos... <comment222006> I know. It's a nightmare.
