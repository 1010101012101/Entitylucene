How do I prevent OS X from immediately trying to mount unlocked drive / prompt for password? <body> Due to a hard disconnect of my encrypted external hard drive, it seems my HFS+ partition has become corrupted. Every time I unlock my hard drive, OS X tries to mount it silently in the background and then hard ejects the drive, such that OS X is not recognizing it whatsoever in codediskutil list/code and I have to turn off/turn back on my hard drive bay.  I run:  precode$ diskutil cs unlockVolume 7DB6AE16-158B-45A4-B1F7-7791B650E552 /code/pre  To unlock the drive, which makes the GUI password prompt disappear, but then when I try to run:  precode$ sudo fsck_hfs -fryS /dev/disk3 /code/pre  I get:  ** /dev/rdisk3 (NO WRITE) Can't open /dev/rdisk3: Resource busy  I was able to get one successful codefsck_hfs -fy /dev/disk3/code to run, and here are the results:  precode$ diskutil verifyVolume /dev/disk3 Started file system verification on disk3 BLUE1 Verifying storage system Checking volume disk2s2: Scan for Volume Headers disk2s2: Scan for Disk Labels Logical Volume Group 4A47A942-A97F-4A96-B46A-4B405B598C02 on 1 device disk2s2: Scan for Metadata Volume Logical Volume Group has a 24 MB Metadata Volume with double redundancy Start scanning metadata for a valid checkpoint Load and verify Segment Headers Load and verify Checkpoint Payload Load and verify Transaction Segment Incorporate 0 newer non-checkpoint transactions Load and verify Virtual Address Table Load and verify Segment Usage Table Load and verify Metadata Superblock Load and verify Logical Volumes B-Trees Logical Volume Group contains 1 Logical Volume Load and verify 64E4D5E6-74B6-482E-8F57-9C079C22702D Load and verify 7DB6AE16-158B-45A4-B1F7-7791B650E552 Load and verify Freespace Summary Load and verify Block Accounting Load and verify Live Virtual Addresses Newest transaction commit checkpoint is valid Load and verify Segment Cleaning The volume 4A47A942-A97F-4A96-B46A-4B405B598C02 appears to be OK Storage system check exit code is 0 Verifying file system File system check exit code is 8 Error: -69845: File system verify or repair failed Underlying error: 8: Exec format error /code/pre  However, I want to try codeS/code scanning the drive for badblocks (in case that's the actual reason it can't mount), and coder/code sbecause then it spells fryS/s because if one of the logical volume b-tree is what's corrupted then it would need to be rebuilt, or maybe t wouldn't have gotten so far in the fsck. Really this is just a guess at this point, I'm trying anything.  <comment363991> *"...maybe I wouldn't have gotten so far in the fsck..."*: I don't see any successful file system check! *"Storage system check exit code is 0"* is a successful LVG/PV/LV metadata check (disk2s2)  which isn't really related to disk3's HFS+ file system. <comment363992> That's why I want to rebuild the b-tree catalog. It doesn't seem like it's getting all the way through that step.
