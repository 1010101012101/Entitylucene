Classical music playing out of order on iPhone <body> 2009 iMac runing ElCapitan; iPhone 6 Plus running iOs 10.0.2. Until very recently the movements of classical music pieces played in the correct order both on my iMac and iPhone.  (I sync my songs via hooking the iPhone up to the iMac). Recently, however, the classical music on my iPhone plays in exact reverse order.  I have tried deleting all the music from the iPhone and re-syncing and reordering the music in various ways on the iMac then trying a re-sync.  Absolutely nothing I do will place the classical music movements on my iPhone in the correct order. Hope someone can help.
