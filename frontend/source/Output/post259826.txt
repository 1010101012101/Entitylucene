How do I add cover art to an .aiff on OSX from the commandline <body> How do I add cover art to an .aif file on OSX from the commandline.  With ffmpeg this seems fairly easy for mp3 and other formats but i need aiff's with cover art.    <answer259841> Under OS X, I've used Kid3 to add cover art to AIFF files, from both the GUI and CLI with the latter in both direct and interactive modes. The CLI version is not for the faint of heart and you must read the documentation  The Kid3 Handbook (English version) to use the CLI, especially the CLI examples section as it shows something that's not shown elsewhere in the documentation or output of the internal help file of codekid3-cli/code.  Which is the use of single quotes around the emcommands/em being used, e.g.:  pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"codekid3-cli -c 'select "/path/to/filename.aiff"' -c 'set picture:"/path/to/coverart.jpg" "Picture Description"' -c 'save' /code/pre  Note that the example above is basic syntax for just setting cover art and code/path/to//code can be omitted if everything is in the emworking directory/em and code"Picture Description"/code can be code""/code if no description is wanted, but it has to be supplied one way or the other in this use case.  The codekid3-cli/code executable is within the kid3.app application bundle, e.g. code/Applications/kid3.app/Contents/MacOS/kid3-cli/code and to make it easier to use, you might want to set an emalias/em for it in your codebash/code profile file or set a emsymlink/em for it to a location that is within the codePATH/code variable.  Example for your codebash/code profile file:  pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"codealias kid3-cli='/Applications/kid3.app/Contents/MacOS/kid3-cli' /code/pre  Example to create a symlink from Terminal:  pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"codesudo ln -s /Applications/kid3.app/Contents/MacOS/kid3-cli /usr/local/bin/kid3-cli /code/pre  Then from the command line you could use: codekid3-cli .../code
