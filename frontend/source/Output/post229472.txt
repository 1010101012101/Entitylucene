MacMail Forgotten Attachents Reminder <body> I am trying to find a solution/plugin to remind me about adding attachments to an email on MacMail (using OS X El Capitan). I tried the "just double check your email, you idiot" option to no avail.  There is a depreciated plugin and wanted to know if any alternatives have been developed, or if there's a new sneaky setting that might do this for me.  I also found this post but given that's 3+ years old I would like more up to date feedback, in the hope that Apple has opened a new door.  Anyone know of a simple solution to this?  <answer262031> It looks like there is a Mail plugin which does what you're looking for called Send Companion (free, with other paid features). As of the time I'm writing this, it purports to work with the latest versions of Mail.  <answer286849> MailButler does this and much more for the Mac mail app.   I tested the attachment reminder feature in MacOS Sierra (10.12.1) and it worked perfectly: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YQaxt.png" alt="Screenshot of working attachment reminder"  They have a free version and two tiers of paid versions, though the free version has a lot of good features (including the attachment reminder):  ul liUndo Send/li liCloud Upload/li liAttachment Reminder/li liAvatar Images/li liDirect Inbox/li liEmojis/li liUnsubscribe/li liInbox Pause/li liQuote/li liGiphy/li /ul  Their website mailbutler.io has descriptions of all the features.
