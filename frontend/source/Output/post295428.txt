Sierra won't install <body> From my mac OS 10.8.5 I downloaded OS Sierra from app store. It said it was downloaded and the icon was in my apps folder. I clicked it, agreed, gave my password, but it wouldn't install.  Per advice from Mac Support, I dragged the download to trash, and did a new download (took 22 hours). However, that one will not install either. I tried restarts, holding keys down and everything suggested, but still nothing. It's a mac mini 2013, OS 10.8.5. I gave the serial numbers to Mac Support over the phone and they said it should work.  Why will it not install?!  <answer295472> It is a 5 Gb file.  Find a place where you can download it in 1-2 hours (22 is not good). Apple store can do it for you! or at Starbuck coffee shop you can do it in about 2 hours :)  Also, Verify the downloaded file is correct.  Open a terminal window up (Applications - Utilities - Terminal) then type: cd "/Applications/Install macOS Sierra.app/Contents/SharedSupport" with those double quotes.  then type in:  precodeshasum InstallESD.dmg /code/pre  and after a couple minutes it should return: strong139ef35e4af0da8286b2a3af326cb114d774f606/strong  InstallESD.dmg  <answer295611> It sometimes happens that the Installer app gets confused on older system versions. Have you tried to make an install medium? This can be done manually by going into the package of the install app and clone the InstallESD.dmg in there onto a USB drive.  If you want a shortcut for that: DiskmakerX will automate that process. You then boot from that USB-drive and no older system can interfere.  <comment373013> What model / age mac? It may not install if the specs are not correct. <comment373018> It's a mac mini 2013, OS 10.8.5. I gave the serial numbers to Mac Support over the phone and they said it should work. <comment373020> Do you have plenty of disk space available? <comment373021> Way more than enough. I've only used 30 gb out of 500 gb capacity. <comment373022> The 22-hour download is ridiculous too. Do you have hi-speed internet. I don't know if problems are related though. <comment373029> Hi Dennis, welcome to Ask Different. :) Is it at all possible you could [edit](https://apple.stackexchange.com/posts/295428/edit) your question to further explain what you mean by *but it wouldn't install*? For example, are you getting any error messages? Or, does it just do nothing at all? Or does your mouse pointer turn into a spinning beachball? Etc. Also, did the original time you downloaded Sierra take a long time too (or is this normal because you just have slow internet)?
