Fixing Netbeans 7.3 freezes (on startup) on OSX Mountain Lion Macbook Air <body> I encounter the following issues with my Netbeans 7.3 installation on my OSX Mountain Lion Macbook Air.  ul liWhen launching the app, it bounces in the Dock for about 2 minutes before it simply stops. When you click on the icon nothing happens and when you right click on it, OSX says the app is not responding./li liAfter Force Quitting Netbeans, I am successfully able to get the "loading" message to come up while it attempts to open. 8 times out of 10, it loads properly but other times it simply hangs while trying to load modules./li /ul  Has anyone else encountered issues like this? Are there any known fixes out there? For reference, here's what Java version I am using:  precodejava version "1.7.0_21" Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.7.0_21-b12) Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 23.21-b01, mixed mode) /code/pre  <answer96785> Here was the problem:  Netbeans is slow because the antivirus program I have installed was scanning the application as it tried to open. If you turn off your Antivirus software, it will boot at a "normal" speed.
