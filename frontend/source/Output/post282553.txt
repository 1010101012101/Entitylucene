Internet sharing via Thunderbolt Cable? <body> I have a MacBook Pro connected to an iMac 27" Mid-2011 with a Thunderbolt cable. I use this for Target Display Mode.  My iMac is connected to the Internet via an Ethernet cable, and I would like to share that connection to my MacBook Pro, using the Thunderbolt cable. Is it possible to use Internet Sharing to do this?  I've tried using the settings below, but they don't work. While the "Thunderbolt Bridge" has a self-assigned IP, the "Thunderbolt Internet" connection is dead. In the image Wi-Fi on the MacBook is On, but if I switch it Off, there is no Internet connection at all.  I'm using the Thunderbolt-to-Thunderbolt cable. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/CPrpN.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  h2iMac ("Sender"):img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Bql4s.jpg" alt="enter image description here"img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lhyBz.png" alt="enter image description here"img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6tRdS.png" alt="enter image description here"img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/J04lA.png" alt="enter image description here"img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/j8MPA.png" alt="enter image description here"/h2  h2MBP ("Receiver"):/h2     img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/XZX7W.png" alt="enter image description here"   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uBdk7.png" alt="enter image description here"img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/76ubY.png" alt="enter image description here"img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ijkof.png" alt="enter image description here"img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qHdBn.png" alt="enter image description here"  hr  h1Update: Seems to work OK/h1  Thunderbolt Bridge Internet Sharing now appears to work. On the receiving MacBook, the Thunderbolt Bridge service is placed on top and has a "green" marker. I get Internet access even if I disconnect the Wi-Fi, so it does indeed work.  However, I'm not sure what changed, except that I might've restarted the computers once or twice.      img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/s9iXA.png" alt="enter image description here"   <answer282875> It is possible to share Internet from Ethernet to Thunderbolt!  ul liYour gateway (iMac) Internet Sharing settings are ok:  Share your connection from: emEthernet/em  to computers using: emThunderbolt bridge/em/li liChoose the Thunderbolt Bridge device in the network preferences of the  client and set emConfigure IPv4/em to emUsing DHCP/em./li /ul  Open Terminal on both Macs and enter codeifconfig/code respectively.

When I took the screenshots and Internet Sharing didn't work, TDM was not active however. So I'm not sure which effect it will have (if any). <comment356494> Your _Sharing_ preferences on the iMac look fine. If possible it'd be good to also see the Network Preferences on your iMac for the Thunderbolt service (not just the main screen, but also the TCP/IP, DNS and Hardware tabs _within_ Advanced). <comment356665> @Monomeeth: I added the images you requested <comment356666> Internet Sharing via Thunderbolt bridge now appears to work (see screenshot in updated post). I didn't do anything to make it happen, other than restart the computers once or twice. So maybe there was something that was making the Thunderbolt connection unreliable, in this regard. It sometimes happens that TDM can't be invoked either, without restarting one or both of the computers.
