Installing .pkg with terminal ? <body> Is it possible to install a .pkg using a terminal ? (I wanted to install an app through ssh).  <answer72227> h3/usr/sbin/installer/h3     The installer command is used to install Mac OS X installer packages to a specified domain or volume.  The        installer command installs a single package per invocation, which is specified with the -package parameter ( -pkg        is accepted as a synonym).  It may be either a single package or a metapackage.  In the case of the metapackage,        the packages which are part of the default install will be installed unless disqualified by a package's check        tool(s).   See codeman installer/code for the full functionality. Often  precodesudo installer -pkg /path/to/package.pkg -target / /code/pre  is all that's needed.  <answer276762> Install all code.pkg/code files from the current folder to code/Applications/code:  pre class="lang-bash prettyprint-override"codefor f in *.pkg ;      do sudo installer -verbose -pkg "$f" -target / done /code/pre  As an alternative you can install the packages to your home folder with code-target ~/code. They will end up in code/Users/&lt;your_account&gt;/Applications/code unless a specific path is predefined in the installer.     supIf you need to see what exactly an pkg installer contains and what pre- and post-install scripts will be run then you could install SuspiciousPackage (freeware), and use quick preview from Finder while the code.pkg/code file is selected. Pressing spacebar in Finder with the file selected should work too./sup   <comment83866> I usually type "sudo installer -pkg /path/to/package.pkg -target /"  and it works fine. <comment83921> Perfect, thanks to you both. <comment256852> This comment should be included in the answer. Mere copy and pasting of this command is sufficient in many cases. <comment256874> @Dilawar anybody can edit existing questions/answers on AD :-) <comment326954> Note that the -target is a device and not a path. So keep it "/" for most cases. <comment358949> This doesn't necessarily install to `/Applications` - it depends on the package, for example PowerShell for macOS installs to `/usr/local`. <comment361904> @AlexV colour me confused - `/` is a path and a device is mounted on it. So why would an option that requires a device as an argument accept `/`?
