Perform a full login from the command line <body> I have a system daemon that demands a full GUI to run, as well as some user level daemons that need to be run from within the user account. I want to perform, from my SSH command line connection, a full user login. After the login, the user should show as logged in from the login screen.  Is there any way to do this? I'm running 10.9 Mavericks Server.
