Does "Download and Keep Original" require manual sync of each photo? <body> Following the update to iOS 10.3.1, my phone warned me (unnecessarily as it turned out) that I had too little space to store all my photos at full resolution, and suggested that I switch to "optimized" storage (which for those unfamiliar with the feature stores a uselessly blurry simulacrum of the original only), which I foolishly did.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/d2i4H.png" alt="enter image description here"  I immediately realized my mistake, and restored the "Download and Keep Originals" setting. But this appears to have had no effect. I still see only the placeholders, until I click on an individual photo and wait for it to download.  So the question is: what does "Download" mean? Does it mean  ol lidownload all photos automatically (e.g., in the background over time) or /li lidownload a photo only when it is viewed?/li /ol  If the answer is 2, is there a way to force all my photos to sync at full resolution to my iPhone without clicking on each individual photo (which would take about a month of continuous clicking, with no breaks for sleeping)?  <answer281686> To downloads all photos, Download and keep originals will retrieve all images from the cloud and save them to your phone.  Optimize storage will only download when photos are viewed and/or are needed by an application.    It may require you to plug your phone in and wait for a bit for all of the photos to download, as you said there are quite a few.

It may help to have **Photos** open beforehand too. <comment354521> So: the answer is 1? <comment354522> @Phong: Ah, maybe that's why it seems to not be happening!
