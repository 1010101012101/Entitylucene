dtmf dial recording for playback to bypass automated dial-in systems <body> I'm looking for an app that would offer the ability to (among other things) record your dtmf key presses into a sort of recording or macro.  The reason behind this would be to go through calling a 1-800 number and pressing various sequences of:  precode1,3,0,# etc  /code/pre  till you get a live person.  Obviously the ability to "pause" for a certain amount of time will also needed to be added.  Does something like this exist? If not how hard would it be to make an app that does this function?  <answer102672> The iOS Contacts app allows pauses and waits to be programmed into phone numbers.   With the number input pad visible, press the emspecial characters/em key on the lower left.  This will reveal options to input 2 second strongpauses/strong (you can use multiple pauses to increase the time) or to strongwait/strong until the dial key is pressed again.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/JXvjo.jpg" height="450" title="Special Character key highlighted" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/M3CVC.jpg" height="450" title="Pause and Wait highlighted"  <comment120833> Would programming those pauses into the existing dialer suit your purpose? <comment120905> Awesome. Is there a way to record it like a macro though? <comment120909> What would a macro do that dialing the number from contacts wouldn't? <comment121309> @grgarside I appreciate your downsizing the imagesâ€”I did the entire post via iPad and "forgot" the appropriate width (it's a service on my Mac). However, with the white background screens I'm not sure side-by-side works well here. I'm leaving it as is for now, but I think without image borders it's somewhat confusing. <comment122491> I suppose what do you mean by a dialer though? <comment122492> I indicated in my question that I would want to program the ability to skip the automated msgs when you call businesses.  Having this as a macro would do this I believe. <comment122628> I do this all the time when I dial businesses using the built-in dialer. I "skip" the automated messages by hitting the dial button (again) after waits.  If you trust the timing, you could use pauses instead. I'm sorry, I did read what you said originally, but I don't see why the built-in dialer doesn't provide the functionality you're looking for.
