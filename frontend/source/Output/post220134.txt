Can word break characters be changed in OS X 10.11 El Capitan (or Xcode 7.2)? <body> When I double-click text in an Xcode string to select an entire word, any text connected to it with a dot (.) will also get selected. I would like to make that not happen so that dots and other characters behave as word break character, like dashes (-). Is there a way to change this either in general for OS X 10.11 or just specifically for Xcode 7.2?  I notice this happens in Xcode and in TextEdit so I'm guessing it would be an OS X setting, but then it doesn't happen when double-clicking on Xcode variables (only within strings) so I'm not sure.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/AOMZR.png" alt="enter image description here"
