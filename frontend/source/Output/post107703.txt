Deleting files with applescript messes up Finder's CoverFlow <body> I wrote myself a little script to delete JPG+RAW files by just reviewing my JPG (who loads faster thant CR2).    I've put the following code in an Automator service bound to a keyboard shortcut.   precodeon run {input, parameters} tell application "Finder"     set myFile to item 1 of input     set {dispName, nameExt} to the {displayed name, name extension} of myFile     set extLength to length of nameExt     set nameWithoutExt to (characters 1 thru ((length of dispName) - extLength) of dispName) -- with the . at the end     set rawfile to ((parent of myFile as string) &amp; nameWithoutExt &amp; "CR2") as string      set fileIndex to index of myFile      delete every item in {myFile, rawfile}      select file fileIndex of window 1 end tell end run /code/pre  It works well but it seems to mess with Finder's cover flow : The pictures are not deleted in the coverflow. As you can see i'm a the bottom of the list and coverflow show more picture than there are in the directory (as multiple deletions reduces the size of the list but not the size of the coverflow).   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xMsW3.png" alt="enter image description here"  Any idea why ? Is that maybe a bug in Mavericks ? Or am I missing something ?   Edit : Well I just got the same behavior using kbdCommand/kbd+kbd&lt;-/kbd. Maybe a bug of Finder in Mavericks ?   <answer108658> have a look:  https://discussions.apple.com/message/23487157#23487157  or  https://discussions.apple.com/thread/5471251  Its an issue from Mavericks (Finder)  <answer115429> This issue seems to be solved on 10.9.1. I don't have problems anymore after updating the system.   <comment126293> Not relevant to your current problem but more to the JPG+RAW management issue, [here](http://photo.stackexchange.com/q/16401/9161) [are](http://photo.stackexchange.com/q/16657/9161) [some](http://photo.stackexchange.com/questions/5957/simple-app-for-viewing-jpg-and-then-deleting-jpgraw-files-simultaneously/5961#5961) links to questions asked on the [Photo.SE](http://photo.stackexchange.com) site for a similar situation. I know this doesn't solve your Applescript problem, but it might give you more insight in managing JPG+RAW files. <comment127350> Answers on AD should be more than just a link. Including a link is fine, but please summarize the content of the referenced pages in your answer. The idea is to have answers stand on their own (and also to avoid breaking links as well as having people search for the relevant part themselves on the referenced page)
