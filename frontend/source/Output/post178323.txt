Some Finder Sidebar Icons Missing? <body> In the Finder windows, the iCloud Drive and Downloads icons are missing from my sidebar. I use CleanMyMac 2 could that have deleted the icons by mistake?   I have rebooted the icons are still gone. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DsFwH.jpg" alt="This is what it looks like."  Yosemite 10.10.2 MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Mid 2014)  How can I get these icons back? Any idea what caused them to go away in the first place?  strongUpdate:/strong  Can't I just drag the iCloud Drive icon into the info panel and change the icon like that? If so where can I find the original icon from?  <answer187670> It looks like that you've used incompatible version of CleanMyMac 2. Please contact us for further instructions: support@macpaw.com  Regards, MacPaw Support.   <answer189671> This generally happens when you've used a utility that changes your sidebar icons to colorized versions. iCloud Drive and Downloads do not use the standard icon format. These products are based on a SIMBL plugin called ColorfulSidebar that does not recognize the non-standard format. Even if you've changed the icons back to the non-colorized versions, the routine that changes the icons may still be running. You have to totally disable the software that colorized the icons.  <comment211196> did you reset your finder? use alt+cmd+esc than select Finder relaunch. And get rid off the CleanmyMac. <comment211358> Ya I've done that many times I'm really not sure what to do. <comment211449> We do not know what you have done already, so to spare us time please list it in your question. <comment221894> In its current form, this really only provides a reason, but not a fix. Please edit the answer to include a solution for the OP. <comment221902> Fix would be good - there have been a few of these issues posted, none with any solution as yet. <comment221936> This isn't delete worthy since it does in effect say you need the vendor's support to craft a specific solution. Better would be if they could link to an article or explain what version is compatible and/or if there are documented requirements or self help that could be edited into this post.
