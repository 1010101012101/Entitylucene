Menu bar dictionary search <body> Is there an app that allows me to search the mac dictionary from the menu bar? I thought spotlight was able to do this but it doesn't seem to work (in Lion) (I noticed Dictionary isn't even listed in spotlight preferences).  I (stupidly) forgot to mention that I forbade spotlight from indexing my main drive. I thought that would just keep it from searching my files and not affect dictionary search, but I'm guessing that they're all bundled up together.   <answer53894> Spotlight emcan/em do this.  You just need to hover your mouse over the "Look Up" entry:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/AeYG9.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer53895> Spotlight is able to search in you dictionary. Just make sure it is selected in System Prefernces - Spotlight  <comment371915> The answer of @dave-delong gives as good solution but as today it is not possible to change a order of sections in spotlight search. So, I am also interested in an app which will give me a possibility to search from top menu bar directly.
