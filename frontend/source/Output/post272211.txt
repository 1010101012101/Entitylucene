Replace or change grey lock screen background after turning off transparency in MacOS Sierra <body> Is it possible to change the lock screen background while Reduce Transparency is kept turned on in MacOS Sierra? As it is now, the screen is just a solid grey color and it would be nice to have a different background for it, perhaps even the same blurred background used for the login screen, which remains the same when the Reduce Transparency feature is enabled. The grey background for the lock screen is bland and rather unappealing. Thank you to whoever can figure this out.
