Booting into Windows gives "Operating System not found" <body> I just upgraded my Macbook Pro from Snow Leopard to Lion, and now when I boot into Window 7 using Bootcamp I get the error "Operating System not found."  Following the advice at http://reviews.cnet.com/8301-13727_7-20090187-263/boot-camp-partitions-not-working-after-installing-os-x-lion/, I found that I had MacFUSE installed, so I uninstalled it.  The problem still persists.   That article also suggests the possibility that there could be too many partitions on my drive, but Disk Utility says there are only two: Bootcamp and my OSX partition.    I can still access the files on my Windows partition through Finder.  Does anyone know how to fix this problem?  <answer45750> Try to repair the Windows boot sector using the strongStartup Repair Tool/strong by Microsoft.  You can attempt a strongStartup Repair/strong using these instructions:     ol   liInsert the strongWindows 7 installation disc/strong or USB flash drive, or a system repair disc, and then shut down your computer./li   liRestart your computer using the computer's power button./li   liWhen prompted, press any key, and then follow the instructions that   appear./li   liOn the strongInstall Windows/strong page, or on the strongSystem Recovery Options/strong page,   choose your language and other preferences, and then click Next./li   liIf you are using the Windows installation disc or USB flash drive,   click strongRepair your computer/strong./li   liSelect the Windows installation you want to repair, and then click   strongNext/strong./li   liOn the strongSystem Recovery Options/strong menu, click strongStartup Repair/strong./li   /ol      img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5XRTs.jpg" alt="enter image description here"   <comment52158> Is it possible for the new version of Lion to have changed bootcamp or your startup procedure in some way? <comment52180> I tried this, but when I tried to boot into Windows my computer ejected the disc and I got the same error `Operating system not found`.  If it helps, when I go into Disk Utility in Lion and try to Verify Disk on my Windows partition, I get an error "Invalid Request." <comment52184> Actually, I found the problem.  I had the Boot Picker software installed, and the Lion upgrade had made Boot Picker think that Boot Camp was on the wrong partition.  Changing the settings so that Boot Picker pointed at the right partition solved the problem. <comment52241> @Jeffrey Something related to Boot Picker would have been a second guess. I've read that this tool has caused such problems. Well, I'm glad that you got this problem solved. These are the kind of problems you never want to have ;)
