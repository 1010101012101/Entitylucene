Flickering on certain sites with Intel HD 3000 <body> I have a mid 2011 macbookpro 15.4 2.2ghz quad core, 16gb ram and ati 6750m w/ intel hd 3000. Mac OS X 10.9.3 &amp; 10.10 beta.  Whenever I use chrome v35 and the graphics card is set to use the intel hd 3000, I get flickering on certain sites,  the best one to show the issue is bootstrap 2.3.2 site which shows up as diagonal lines. I have tested this on other 10.9.3 intel hd 3000 machines and it seems like its a bug in the graphics driver, also I have tested it on the yosemite beta and it is still an issue.  I have attached a png from my dropbox that should work in any browser &amp; preview, but this will only work if you are using an intel hd 3000 on a laptop.  Test Image for flickering.  Does anyone know of a fix other than to not use chrome?  <answer162073> I have the same issue with a 17" MacBook Pro (Late 2011). I can only solve it by switching from the Intel HD 3000 card to the AMD Radeon one by using the gfxCardStatus tool.  <comment159824> You dropbox link seems to not be public <comment159928> @Thomas I updated the link with the correct image.
