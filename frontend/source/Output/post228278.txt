Favorite list of servers of "Connect to Server" window disappears <body> Usually, when I connect to a server (cmd "âŒ˜" + K), I can see the list of my favorite servers :  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jl2hs.jpg" alt="Connect to Server with favorites"  But after upgrading to El Capitan (Mac OS 10.11.X) and after freshly booting my MacBook, this list sometimes disappears and I can't add a new server to it ("+" button doesn't works) :  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/UTFYz.jpg" alt="Connect to Server without favorites"  Does anyone have a similar problem and knows how to resolve it?  <answer242035> I had this problem too. Here's how I fixed it: delete the folder ~Library/Application Support/com.apple.sharedfilelist/ and then use Activity Monitor to kill the sharedfilelistd process belonging to your user. Then I relaunched Finder for good measure. Works now!  <comment278359> I can't replicate the problem.  I just (within the past 48 hours) upgraded a 2009 MBP and 2012 iMac to 10.11 and both are working fine here.    Is this a clean install, an in-place upgrade or a migration from an older version of OS X? <comment278542> I'm upgrading my 2011 MacBook Pro (was on Snow Leopard) to newer's Mac OS version each time from the beginning and I have never encountered serious problems. May be it's problem of Finder's cache linked to my other unsolved problem : http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/227112/empty-favorites-sidebar-of-third-party-applications
