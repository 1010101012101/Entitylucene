Where are the system spellchecking dictionaries? <body> I would like to use the spellchecking dictionaries bundled with OS X from the command line (codehunspell/code), but can't seem to find them. In code/System/Library/Spelling/code there are only 2 files codepl_PL.{aff,dic}/code, and codefind / -name '*.dic'/code revealed nothing.  I know I can dowload dictionaries from OpenOffice etc., but I'd like to find the ones bundled with OS X.  strongEDIT/strong To clarify, there are at least two kinds of dictionaries in OS X:  ul liDefinitions used in Dictionary.app. I'm not interested in those./li liWord lists used by the system spellchecker (red dotted lines). I know OS X uses hunspell because the hunspell website says so, and there are numerous posts on how to add new ones (1, 2). Just, I don't want to add new ones but use the English one that obviously comes with the system./li /ul  <answer97884> The spelling dictionaries you are interested in appear to be located in the following location (checked on 10.8.4 and 10.6.8):  precode/System/Library/Services/AppleSpell.service/Contents/Resources/ /code/pre  The word lists are stored in this directory by language, so U.S. English is in the codeEnglish.lproj/code folder.  However, these files are stored in a binary format that I haven't deciphered yet...  <comment114861> What build of hunspell is in play? (as it's not explicitly included as a command line tool on OS X - adding that detail might help you get a better quality answer.) [Another answer here](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/21429/uk-spelling-dictionary-teach-os-x-all-ize-spellings) shows that the spell check routines for TextEdit source words from the same place as Dictionary app - so be clear to explain how your problem is different than locating /Library/Dictionary or ~/Library/Dictionary <comment114871> @bmike libhunspell is in /usr/lib/libhunspell-1.2.0.0.0.dylib. I'm not sure which of the answers you're referring to, the top-rated answer copied words from Wikipedia? Another answer + comments in this thread however is correct and exactly what I'm after (http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/21446/54379) <comment114882> Now that you have added information to your question it makes more sense so my answer was wrong and I removed it. <comment114884> /usr/share/dict there is a words file in there <comment114896> @thipani, libhunspell is a library and not callable directly from the command line, what is hunspell
