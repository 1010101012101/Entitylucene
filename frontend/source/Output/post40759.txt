Missing autoconf/automake in Xcode 4.3? <body> After I purged Xcode 4.2 and installed Xcode 4.3 from App Store, I can not find autotools (automake/autoconf) through the command line. I've tried to run codefind /Applications/Xcode.app -name 'automake'/code, but apparently they are not there..  Does anyone knows what is Apple's point to remove these essential toolsets?  <answer40760> Are you certain your codePATH/code hasn't been corrupted? I've got the auto-tools in code/usr/bin/code on my machine:  precode&gt; ls -lah /usr/bin/auto* -rwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel    13K 16 May  2011 /usr/bin/autoconf -rwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel   8.2K 16 May  2011 /usr/bin/autoheader -rwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel    30K 16 May  2011 /usr/bin/autom4te -rwxr-xr-x  2 root  wheel   227K 16 May  2011 /usr/bin/automake -rwxr-xr-x  2 root  wheel   227K 16 May  2011 /usr/bin/automake-1.10 -rwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel    73K  3 Feb 21:55 /usr/bin/automator -rwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel    20K 16 May  2011 /usr/bin/autoreconf -rwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel    17K 16 May  2011 /usr/bin/autoscan -rwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel    33K 16 May  2011 /usr/bin/autoupdate /code/pre  Edit: it appears I did still have 4.2 on my machine. So this above is probably not helpful in the least.  hr  You could try using the autoconf package from homebrew. It does not appear to be a keg that's available by default with homebrew, but you can still get it from here by placing the following in to code/usr/local/Library/Formula/autoconf.rb/code:  precoderequire 'formula'  class Autoconf &lt; Formula   url 'http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/autoconf/autoconf-2.13.tar.gz'   homepage 'http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/'   md5 '9de56d4a161a723228220b0f425dc711'    def install     system "./configure", "--program-suffix=213",                           "--prefix=#{prefix}",                           "--infodir=#{info}"     system "make install"   end end /code/pre  <answer53116> They moved them in 4.3 into a separate download afaik.  Try install the command line tools via Settings - download.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/81Swo.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer81808> For what it is worth- (and others stumbling onto this problem like I did) in the latest XCode (4.6, 4.5 and friends) autoconf is not even available in the command line tools.   I have manually installed just autoconf and a few friends, but still have trouble with some of the automake-ish software out there.   See http://jsdelfino.blogspot.com/2012/08/autoconf-and-automake-on-mac-os-x.html for a how-to to manually install.  <answer87476> I am running Mountain Lion and have XCode 4.5.2 installed. I have installed strongemautoconf/em/strong using MacPorts:  precodesudo port install autoconf /code/pre  I have not tried but I am sure that codesudo brew install autoconf/code should also work for those that prefer Homebrew.  <comment46107> Here is mine..I installed Xcode 4.3 and even the [command line tools](http://kennethreitz.com/xcode-gcc-and-homebrew.html).   `$ ls -lah /usr/bin/auto* -rwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel    73K Feb  1 16:28 /usr/bin/automator` <comment46173> Have you uninstalled Xcode 4.2 entirely? <comment46175> Good catch: no. I missed that, apologies. I appear to have 4.2 on my machine still. <comment94326> Good call - I hadn't noticed it going missing. <comment163470> I have Command Line Tools installed, but automake is still missing.
