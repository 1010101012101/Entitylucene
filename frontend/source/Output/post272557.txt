Alternate n songs from different playlists <body> I would like to play emn/em amount of songs from multiple playlists, however I'm not sure how to achieve that on iTunes.   For example, let's say I have the following playlists:  ul liHip-Hop (40 songs) /li liTop 40 (40 songs)/li /ul  I would like to play (or create a new playlist) with 2 songs from each playlist, like:  precodeSong 1 (Hip-Hop)  Song 2 (Hip-Hop)  Song 3 (Top 40)  Song 4 (Top 40)  Song 5 (Hip-Hop)  Song 6 (Hip-Hop)  Song 7 (Top 40)  Song 8 (Top 40) /code/pre  I use iTunes on Windows 10 and I would be playing it on a iPad mini.   Thanks.
