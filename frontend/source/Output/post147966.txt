Where do files go when you AirDrop them on iOS? <body> Where do AirDrop files go when I transfer them between an iPad, iPhone and iPod? I AirDropped some Google Docs from my iPad to my iPhone but nothing happened; where did my files go? The file was a list of tools.  <answer294367> I Found them... check your downloads folder!  <answer294380> On iOS, AirDropped files open immediately and automatically in the app registered to handle them via AirDrop. If no such app exists, those files simply disappear.  Typically, if you AirDrop a document using one app, youâ€™ll want to have the same app installed on the receiving iOS device.  <comment174436> What app is sending which sort of file from the iPad? <comment174437> AirDrop from iPad Google docs to iPhone <comment174439> Welcome to Ask Different! Just select the edit button to explain that you're sending from Google Docs. Also, what  _kind_ of file you send matters on how the receiving iOS device will handle it. <comment371595> Your answer is Mac based. The question is about iOS!
