I can't install “lockfile-progs” which is necessary for “log check” by HOMEBREW on YOSEMITE <body> I have upgraded my Mac OS X to 10.10, Yosemite, but things go wrong. For other commands, I've succeeded to re-build those programs.  However codelogcheck/code, which is installed by homebrew can't work well since the codelockfile-progs/code is a prerequisite. The error message is:  precodefatal: lockfile-progs is a prerequisite for logcheck, and was not found. /code/pre  But I can't find the way to install the codelockfile-progs/code to Yosemite. Is there any advice for this situation?  <answer156399> This appears to be a bug; you should report it to Homebrew.
