How to enable Chrome's "continue where you left off" for OS X El Capitan? <body> I need Chrome to restore last session tabs after closing its whole window.  Simple "continue where you left off" does not work when I close Chrome's window.  I was looking for the resolution but all I got is useless answers provided by apple fanboys "that is the proper way - closing window does not mean closing a program". Sincerly, I don't accept it.  How to achieve proper behaviour of "continue where you left off"?  <answer218171> Not 100% sure what you are asking, but to get Chrome to resuming its last state:  Chrome  Settings Page (chrome://settings)  On Startup  Continue where you left off.  <answer218172> First, you want to make sure the setting is enabled in Chrome.    In the upper left corner of the screen, you'll want to click on Chrome - Preferences and make sure the "continue where you left off" button is checked.  Next, please do understand there is a difference between closing a window and closing a program.   kbdCommand/kbd - kbdQ/kbd is used to exit a program completely.    In OS X, if you close a window using the "red x" in the upper left corner, you are closing out a window, and not the program.      To see this work correctly...  try opening 3-4 tabs.   Then press  kbdCommand/kbd - kbdQ/kbd.    Then relaunch Chrome.   You should see all your tabs there.  <answer276703> To add to a previous answer, if you happen to accidentally close the window using the red x at the top, you can quickly get back all your tabs by using kbdcommand/kbdkbdshift/kbdkbdT/kbd. This is usually used to reopen a recently closed tab, but also works to reopen a recently closed window.  <comment263727> So...   as part of asking for help, you insult the Apple Community and call us "fanboys"? <comment263729> And yes...  closing a windows (Command - W) is not the same as closing out the whole program (Command - Q).   If you have the "continue where you left off" option selected in Chrome, and you quit Chrome...  you should get the tabs that were there previously. <comment263769> Maybe it makes more sense this wayâ€¦ If you close the window instead of quitting the app, then "where you left off" is with that window closed.
