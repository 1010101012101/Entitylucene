Microphone not working in Mac Mini after system update <body> I have a Mac Mini Mid 2011 Model. Earlier when I used OX X 10.7.5 my microphone was working fine.  I updated my system to Yosemite 10.10.2 and my microphone stopped working. In System Preferences--Sound--Input, I am getting Line In (Name) Audio Line-In port(TYPE).  I am using Iball headphones.  <answer178540> Try deleting the following files...  From the root folder -  strong/Library/Preferences/Audio/com.apple.audio.DeviceSettings.plist/strong  strong/Library/Preferences/Audio/com.apple.audio.SystemSettings.plist/strong  From your Home folder -  strong/Library/Preferences/com.apple.audio.AudioMIDISetup.plist/strong  It may be worth installing the current build of Onyx and clearing out the strongSystem/strong and strongUser caches/strong before restarting your Mac. Hopefully your audio devices will be set back to their defaults and your mic will work again.  <comment211408> Please don't cross-post to different areas of Stack Exchange. Pick one & stick to it. <comment211409> @Tetsujin someone at other site told that you should try apple.stackexchange <comment211410> Someone [me] posted a link to an answer on Ask Different; I didn't see any specific request for it to be migrated, which would have been the better option. <comment211412> i am having problem in microphone and not heaphones/speakers
