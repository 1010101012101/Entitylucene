reattach terminal tab to another window <body> Suppose you have a terminal with two tabs. You click, drag, and let go one of these tabs and it becomes an independent terminal window. After a while, you want to take this terminal window and reattach it as a tab to the previous window. How do you do it ? I have seen the merge windows option in the menus, but that merges emall/em windows into one, which I would then have to revert.  <answer14706> You need to, in the window you want to move, go to View- Show Tab Bar (if the tab bar isn't showing already).  Then, drag the tab of the window you want to move onto the window you want to move it to.  strongUpdate for iTerm 2/strong: In iTerm 2 the setting is no longer exposed in the View menu.  Go to iTerm  Preferences  Appearance and check "Show tab bar even when there is only one tab". Note that in early releases of iTerm 2 the setting was "Hide tab bar when there is only one tab".  <answer100101> I have iTerm2 (Build 1.0.0.20130302) here - there's no codeView/code  codeShow Tab Bar/code. But as Chris Page suggested, disabling codeHide tab bar when there is only one tab/code (in codePreferences/code  codeAppearance/code) helps. The single windows can then be moved and merged again.  <answer101026> I had troubles merging windows with the Hotkey Window profile.  I eventually found a way to un-split the windows by doing the following:  ol licodePreferences/code  uncheck codeHide tab bar when there is only one tab/code/li liSet codeTab position/code to codeBottom/code/li liPress your hotkey to show the Hotkey Window/li liClick &amp; drag the tab into the Hotkey Window's tab bar/li /ol  <answer196960> The answer is to hold down kbdcommand/kbd + kbdshift/kbd + kbdoption/kbd whilst dragging the body of the terminal (not the tab) back to the terminal you wish to merge.

I recommend doing so, because tabs have several useful status/activity indicators (starting in Mac OS X 10.7 Lion). <comment118926> I've tried Cmd+Shift+Option to click and drag iTerm2 tabs into other windows, but it only works with normal windows.  How can I merge tabs back into the Hotkey Window (I'm using iTerm2 in [visor](http://technosophos.com/content/configure-iterm2-act-visor) / [yakuake](http://yakuake.kde.org/)-like mode) <comment127495> You can also Cmd+t to create a new tab and tab bar will automatically visible <comment150300> It's called "Show toolbar" in my version.  The tab bar is always visible, but you cannot drag one tab into another window unless the *toolbar* is showing. <comment243450> If you just have 1 tab and thus no tab bar, temporarily make a new tab, move away the tab you want, and then murder the temporary tab.
