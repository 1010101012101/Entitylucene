How can I uninstall Safari Technology Preview? <body> I installed Safari Technology Preview, but want to get rid of it now. Clicking and holding on Launchpad doesn't do the trick, STP "wiggles" without a cross. The download is an installer, so I'm wondering if anyone knows of an uninstaller. Else I guess I'll just dump it in the trash.  <answer234021> strongExactly./strong To delete an Application that is not sandboxed (not downloaded from App Store) you have to go in code/Applications//code and delete the Application File.  <answer253615> I used AppCleaner.app to make sure I don't have any leftovers. And it turned out there were a lot, namely crash reports, plists, diagnostics, cookies and more.  Just make sure no Safari files are included in the list of files about to be deleted. In my case there were no such files, it was either plugin related crash reports (e.g. VLC plugin) or other files clearly related to Safari Technology Preview.  <comment338554> Thanks for the tip on AppCleaner.  I've been looking for something like that.
