Prevent app from adding itself to startup items <body> I have an application (Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client) that starts every time I start my MacBook Air. (Sierra 10.12.5) It seems the app keeps adding itself to startup items. There are two plist files associated with the app that I can find:  precode/Library/LaunchAgents/com.cisco.anyconnect.gui.plist /Library/LaunchAgents/com.cisco.anyconnect.vpnagentd.plist /code/pre  I have been looking in:  precode/Library/LaunchAgents /Library/LaunchDeamons /System/Library/LaunchAgents /System/Library/LaunchDeamons ~/Library/LaunchAgents /code/pre  This is what I have tried so far:  ul liRemoved the item/app from System Preferences/Users &amp; Groups/Login Items/li liRemoved both plists and one at a time/li liEdited the code&lt;key&gt;RunAtLoad&lt;/key&gt;/code to codefalse/code in plist /Library/LaunchDeamons/com.cisco.anyconnect.vpnagentd.plist/li liLocked com.apple.loginitems.plist in ~/Library/Preferences/li licodelaunchctl unload /Library/LaunchAgents/com.cisco.anyconnect.gui.plist/code/li licodesudo launchctl unload /Library/LaunchAgents/com.cisco.anyconnect.vpnagentd.plist/code/li /ul  codelaunchctl list/code also shows a service I can't locate: codecom.cisco.Cisco-AnyConnect-Secure-Mobility-Client.3092/code
