Disable sticky keys only while certain applications have focus? <body> Is there any way to enable sticky keys in OS X but automatically disable them while in certain applications?   Modifying system files and heavy terminal use is ok.  Here's a screenshot of the preference pane containing Sticky keys for reference.  My specific case is virtualisation of Win 7 in Virtual Box on OSX 10.7.5  <comment93997> You mean the press and hold to get the special chars? What version of OSX are we talking about? <comment94033> Yes! Clarified in my question, its OSX 10.7.5 <comment94053> If you always quit the application in question after using it, then I can imagine a possible solution. Otherwise I'm not sure. Assuming you do quit the app after using it, you could set a script up to watch which apps were open, then edit the preference file when it detected the app opening or closing. (I'm not skilled enough to write the script unfortunately.) <comment94144> Thanks, but I'd like it to toggle on and off as I switch between virtualbox and other OSX applications. <comment94205> I don't think you can do that without attempting some sort of Applescript that disables it when VirtualBox is in the frontâ€¦ but It's certainly nothing "native".
