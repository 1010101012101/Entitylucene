iPad 1 stuck in DFU mode after 5.0.1 -> 5.1 OTA-update <body> I have tried restoring through iTunes, but I only get "Error 37" at the end of the "Restoring iPad firmware" step.  Snippets from the restore log:  precode2012-03-11 18:00:05.684 [3132:e4]: &lt;Restore Device 069D6950&gt;: operation 18 progress 53 2012-03-11 18:00:05.884 [3132:e4]: &lt;Restore Device 069D6950&gt;: operation 18 progress 61 2012-03-11 18:00:06.169 [3132:e4]: &lt;Restore Device 069D6950&gt;: operation 18 progress 69 2012-03-11 18:00:06.535 [3132:e4]: &lt;Restore Device 069D6950&gt;: operation 18 progress 76 2012-03-11 18:00:06.821 [3132:e4]: &lt;Restore Device 069D6950&gt;: operation 18 progress 84 2012-03-11 18:00:09.037 [3132:e4]: device returned AMR error 37 /code/pre  (It fails at 84% "restoring firmware" each time)  and:  precodeentering update_device_firmware entering update_iBoot write_image3_data: flashing LLB data (length = 0x14a19) AppleImage3NORAccess::_getSuperBlock imageVersion: 3 AppleImage3NORAccess::_getSuperBlock imageVersion: 3 write_image3_data: flashing NOR data (length = 0xb10) ticket updated write_image3_data: flashing NOR data (length = 0x2ea19) write_image3_data: flashing NOR data (length = 0xf859) write_image3_data: flashing NOR data (length = 0x1d59) write_image3_data: flashing NOR data (length = 0xb999) write_image3_data: flashing NOR data (length = 0x4519) write_image3_data: flashing NOR data (length = 0x1819) write_image3_data: flashing NOR data (length = 0x13d9) write_image3_data: flashing NOR data (length = 0x3e59) write_image3_data: flashing NOR data (length = 0x13d9) write_image3_data: flashing NOR data (length = 0x3cf19) 0: RamrodErrorDomain/3e9: update_iBoot: error writing image 1: NSMachErrorDomain/e00002bc: write_image3_data: AppleImage3NORAccess returned an error when writing image3 object attempting to dump restore log writing log file: /mnt1/restore.log /code/pre  I have tried pretty much everything:  ul liDifferent computers (both mac and win7)/li liDifferent usb-cables/li liRe-downloading the ipsw/li liRe-installing iTunes/li liRemoving every playlist/book/movie from my iTunes library/li liDisabling auto-sync of devices in iTunes/li /ul  The documentation for "error 37" indicates problems with security software (which I'm not running), and judging by the restore log this looks like more a bug in the updater/firmware itself.  The iPad was running fine with iOS 5.0.1 and has never been jailbroken.  <answer43373> This suggests that your NOR is failing/has failed. It could be a communications error also, but strange it gets so far before failing if it is a comms error.  Almost certainly this is hardware. If you still have extended warranty, use that. Otherwise you need to get this replaced via Apple's out of warranty program. I'm not sure any third party hardware repair place could fix this, they would need to copy the unique data that is stored in another part of your NOR chip to a good NOR chip. This unique data is encrypted and I don't know if it can actually be copied successfully.  source: http://www.hackint0sh.org/f131/212842.htm
