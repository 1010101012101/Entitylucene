I cannot turn off beta software updates <body> Step one, open App Store control panel: Step two, click CHANGE under beta updates:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/S5kaf.png" alt="enter image description here"  Step three, click DO NOT SHOW BETA SOFTWARE:   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yIJIS.png" alt="enter image description here"  Now if you look at the control panel it looks like this and the beta section is gone:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/VwJ5C.png" alt="enter image description here"  hr  Here is where it gets weird. If you quit and then reopen the control panel it look like the first screen shot again.  So how do I actually STOP beta software updates?  <comment360781> "Can't ...due to a network problem" might be significant. <comment360784> Possibly related: Apple has remotely enabled iCloud Keychain on my account without my permission. https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/285384/apple-id-settings-popup-asks-for-iphone-passcode-but-i-dont-want-to-give-it
