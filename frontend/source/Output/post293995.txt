Correlative numbers formula in Apple Numbers <body> I have text in column B. But there are some columns that are empty. There is no rule the empty raws are at random. This is what I have now:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wxzlx.png" alt="Before"  I want to have correlative numbers in column A. The problem is to detect the empty raws. That should be the result:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MtuoK.png" alt="After"  <answer294192> ol liEnter a 1 in the cell A1./li liInsert the following formula into cell A2.  precodeIF(ISBLANK(B2),"",MAX(A$1:A1)+1) /code/pre  This formula checks the cell to the right to see if it is blank. If it is blank, the cell in the A column should be blank too. If not, the cell should be filled with the next integer, which equates to the maximum integer reached so far + 1./li liFill the rest of the A column using this formula. Use the yellow fill handle so that the formula is adjusted correctly as it fills. The $ sign fixes the first cell of the range used by the MAX function./li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7ukYG.gif" alt=""  <comment371046> Do you want this as text is added? What if text is added in the middle, do you need the sequence of numbers to recalculate? If you could add a little more info about your process or how the data is added that would be helpful in finding a solution. In general, conditional formulas are your friend here. Cheers! <comment371199> @bjbk: it is ok if the numbers are created after the text column. The other cases would be a plus. Can you put an example of the most basic case, please? <comment371239> I would love to help, but if you could edit your question with more information.  Such as, is the text simply just added to random rows?  Is the empty row a result of inserting rows or deleting text?  As asked, it really difficult to advise the best approach. It makes a difference in how the spreadsheet is managed.

There is no inserting or deleting text. I already have all the text, and I need to create correlative numbers in column A <comment371307> I'm just curious - do you need to keep the blank rows? For example, in your second image Column A has been populated based on the content in Column B, but all the rows that are blank in Column B (e.g. rows 3, 6, 7 etc) are still there. Is this by design (e.g. some of the other columns have data in these rows) or can you delete these rows altogether? <comment371337> @Monomeeth: I need that rows. That is the key of my question. Here I put a simplified case. In real life in those empty rows there are titles o they are separations between blocks of information <comment371344> It works very well. Clear and simple <comment371403> All good! I always get concerned when people have totally blank rows in a spreadsheet list, but obviously that's not the case here. :)
