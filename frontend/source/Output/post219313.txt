How to figure out which exact python app regularly results in crashes of Python.app? <body> I have several python (server) apps running on my Macbook.br One of them regularly crashes on my system, resulting in a desktop notification popup with the message: codePython quit unexpectedly/code.  Checking the crash logs on my system in code/Users/jottr/Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports/code I find several reports pertaining to Python.   precode$ head -n 8 Python_2015-12-12-201816_hostname.crash  Process:               Python [605] Path:                  /System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/Resources/Python.app/Contents/MacOS/Python Identifier:            Python Version:               2.7.10 (2.7.10) Code Type:             X86-64 (Native) Parent Process:        ??? [1] Responsible:           Python [605] User ID:               501 /code/pre  These crash logs are too unspecific to establish which exact process keeps crashing.  strongHow can I debug which exact python process/app crashes the interpreter?/strong  <comment265232> Possibly not a solution, but worth a try: Write a small bash script to use `ps -e | grep python  /path/to/some/file` and have it started with launchd. Once a crash occurs, you can cross-reference the PID and see which parameters had been used (effectively seeing which script was running with that process). <comment265242> thx @Phoenix.  Probably worth a try. Still hoping for a more straight forward solution though.
