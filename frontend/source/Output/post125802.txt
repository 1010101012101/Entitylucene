Logs for checking establishment and disconnect of mac user remotely <body> I am using Vine VNC Server in Mac OS X for accessing my desktop remotely. I want to fire two scripts:  ul liOne at establishment of the VNC connection /li liOne at disconnection of the VNC connection/li /ul  I thought of using command as   precodenetstat -a | grep vnc | grep ESTABLISH /code/pre  but I noticed that in netstat vnc protocol is displayed as tcp4.  Does anybody have an idea how to fix this?
