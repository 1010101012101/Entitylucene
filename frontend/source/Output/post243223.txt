Will an external USB 3.0 hard drive connected to an Elgato Thunderbolt 2 Dock run at USB 3.0 speeds even though the Macbook Pro is USB 2.0 only? <body> I have an older Macbook Pro (8,2 - Late 2011).  It doesn't have a usb 3.0 port, only USB 2.0 ports. I have an Elgato Thunderbolt 2 Dock with a WD External HD, USB 3.0.  I was expecting to see USB 3.0 type speeds, but only get transfer rates around 35MB/s, which looks like USB 2.0.    Can a MacBook Pro that only has USB 2.0 ports realize USB 3.0 transfer rates when connected to a Thunderbolt Dock that has USB 3.0 ports and an external usb 3.0 hard drive?  <comment299450> According to an Amazon Reviewer, "blue=USB3, white=USB2". What color does this Elegato glow when you plug in a USB device? <comment299455> What are you using to calculate that transfer?  That seems awfully slow for even USB 2.0 (480 MBbps).  Also, according to [Elgato Support](https://help.elgato.com/customer/en/portal/articles/1487056-does-elgato-thunderbolt%E2%84%A2-dock-have-usb-3-0-ports-?b_id=360), the dock will provide USB 3.0 on MBP with only USB 2.0 ports <comment299464> I don't see a glow, white or blue. Do you have a link for the review? I'm using BlackMagic Disk Speed Test, its reporting 35 MB/s (480 Mb/s). <comment299465> Thanks Allan for the Elgato link.  It reads "You can use these fast USB 3.0 ports, even if your Mac only has standard USB 2.0 ports."   I'm not sure it clears things up.  It seems to imply that you would get the faster speeds, but it could also be interpreted to mean simply that it will work (albeit at usb 2.0 speeds). <comment299468> Thunderbolt is an extension of the PCIe bus, not USB.  So, you can add a USB 3.0 port to a machine that doesn't have them.  However, based on your speeds, you are getting USB 2.0.  Are you going directly from the dock to the Passport?  Did you install the [Utility Software?](https://www.elgato.com/en/thunderbolt-2-dock-support) <comment299482> What does the Device Tree show? <comment299502> I was going directly from the dock to the external drive.  I installed the Elgato Utility Software and after a reboot I'm getting 140MB/s now.  Allan, if you answer the question, I'll mark it as accepted.
