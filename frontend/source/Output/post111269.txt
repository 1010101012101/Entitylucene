Stop zooming when I film <body> I want to film myself with my iphone, when I'm drawing. The iphone is not moving, and are about 30 cm ≈ 11" above my desk. My paper is on my desk, I sometimes change paper. But when I do so, or even when my hands are moving, the camera "zooms in" on my hands, and then the drawing gets blurry for a second. That's not nice to watch. So, is there a way (or an app or jailbreak) to disable this?  <answer111273> supemI presume you're referring to the 'zoom' effect from autofocus…/em/sup  strongFiLMiC Pro/strong lets you lock the focus whilst filming.     The four buttons on the left enable the FiLMiC Pro user to lock and unlock focus, exposure, white balance, and control a full time torch   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LGLMr.png" alt="FiLMiC Pro on iPhone"  <answer111306> By just holding my finger on the screen, it applies AE/AF lock.  <comment131023> To clarify a bit, as it says on page 78 of the iPhone User Manual (for iOS7), "To lock the exposure and focus until you tap the screen again, touch and hold until the rectangle pulses."
