How to open a new tab in iTerm in the same folder as the one that is open? <body> I'm using iTerm for my command line needs, and when I open a tab using ⌘T I want it to open the tab cd'ed to the same location as the tab that was open when I hit ⌘T (instead of opening in my code/Users/kramer65/code).  I searched around the Preferences, but I can't seem to find it. Does anybody know how I can do this? All tips are welcome!  <answer148514> Select "Reuse previous session's directory" from the preferences of your profile:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/CINtc.png" alt=""  Alternatively click on "Advanced Configuration" then "Edit..." so you can set the working directory separately for new windows, new tabs &amp; new split panes  img src="https://i.imgur.com/wFmPCCx.png" alt=""  <answer211050> This is a year old, but I'd like to add a response that isn't so heavy-handed. The accepted answer will open the previous directory emevery/em time you open a new tab, which I personally find frustrating. I feel it's easier to always open in the home directory and then open the current directory in a new tab as needed.  To do that, simply run the following command:  precodeopen . -a iterm /code/pre  That will open the current directory (codeopen ./code) using the application (code-a/code) that most closely matches codeiterm/code.   <comment271235> Beautiful and elegant solution.  Thank you! <comment291025> or just use command `$ tab`?
