iPhone 4 locked out while on holiday, how can I unlock it? <body> I arrived in Greece yesterday and suddenly this morning my phone turned off, then on again and now it says codeActivation Required/code. When I unlock it to try and do it, I get the message:     This device is no registered as part of the iPhone Developer Program.##br####br##If you are a member of the Program, please register your device in the @@url@@   It is registered with the developer program. Is there any way I can fix this remotely? I don't have my computer.  strongUpdate/strong   I updated my phone via the new non beta iTunes to the new iOS5 as far as I'm aware. I'm pretty sure it just said 5.0. That was a couple of days ago.   Also, I will be able to get to a computer with iTunes, but it won't be mine.   <answer28640> I assume you, as a developer, have iOS5 installed? Try recovering from iCloud?br That is if you have backed up your iPhone using iCloud before of course.   strongEDIT/strong: Use a random computer to back-up your iPhone  <comment32928> Looks like a duplicate of http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/28630/9058 - install iOS 5 via iTunes <comment32929> To follow up on patrix, which version of the OS is installed? Is it an iOS beta? Or the latest version? <comment32947> I have but I don't have an option to recover from iCloud. How do I do this? Hard reset? <comment32948> Just follow the movies instructions in the given link? <comment32949> The problem is not that it can't be restored. It's that it can't be activated. I'm the question asked btw. <comment32950> Also, what link? <comment32951> question asker* <comment32953> I am actually the question asker, just managed to sign in. I should add that the first screen I get says 'restore completed' despite the fact I didn't do any restore! <comment32955> Hm, the activation can't be done using iCould I guess. You can take a backup with the laptop you have over there (see the link (light-blue text) in my edit) and do a full recovery using iTunes on the laptop. <comment32960> Oh ok cool, thanks I'll give that a go. <comment32974> Welcome to Ask Different!
