Wi-Fi Network Not In iMac's Keychain Access <body> On my iMac, I have Wi-Fi via Airport and Time Warner. It works fine for my iMac but I am trying to get my work laptop -- a PC -- to use the same network. (It also works fine on my phone and my daughter's phone, both iPhones.)  I don't know the password for the network (empaul's wifi/em) and I followed the instructions to find it through Keychain Access. However, when I see the list of Wi-Fi networks in the utility, empaul's wifi/em is NOT among them.  There is one listing for an Airport Express connection but its password isn't recognized when I try to link up the PC/Laptop.  According to some notes I've read, if my network isn't listed in Keychain, the password is not stored in the computer. However, I certainly don't recall doing anything out of the ordinary when setting up my Wi-Fi a few years back.  Thus, my questions:  ol liHow can I find out my Wi-Fi password if it's not in keychain access utility?/li liWhat other options might there be?/li /ol
