Single User Mode can´t repair my HD <body>    strongPossible Duplicate:/strongbr   What are next steps when fsck reports “could not be repaired after 3 attempts”?       Hi Guys I hope someone can save me!!!  I´m so stupid that I don´t have a backup of my files and I have 220 GB of Photos, Music and Work in one Partition. Now it won´t start.   Now that I have an external HD I´m desperate to find a way to save my files but I don´t know how to do it in Disk utilities or Route Shell. I have read there is a DiskWarrior but I have no clue how to install it without entering my Macintosh HD.  When I run fsck_hfs in Single User Mode this is what I see, hopefully someone can help me thank you from the heart:  precodeExecuting fsck_hfs (version diskdev_cmds-557-393) Checking Journaled HFS Plus volume.

Since it's commercial software, they provide support in getting it installed and working.  Similarly, you could boot into Recovery HD and work on fixing or erasing the drive as the situation warrants.  <comment93525> Let's close this for now - it's so close to the other question, it might be better to add the comment here that you do not have a back up to http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/81093/ <comment93526> Also, for this to really be answered, you'll want to review the guide on [ask] and list some specific error messages or detail what you tried to get DW to work. Saying you don't know what to do is a good first step and people will explain RTFM (with F being friendly) but you'll want to document a bit of what you did to try to solve the DW won't install / run for someone to not have to guess what issue you are facing. We prefer "detailed questions that stand alone" as opposed to "general - help me until I solve X with many iterations of details along the way" type questions.
