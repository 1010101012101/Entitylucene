Mac Pro capable of dual processors? <body> I know the older mac pros are capable of running multiple processors. I have the 2013 cylindrical mac pro. I know I cannot put another internal processor in it, but I was thinking about getting a thunderbolt expansion chassis with a PCIe port and running another processor that way. What I would like to know is if the motherboard in the machine would be capable of running these two processors simultaneously?  <comment327334> I have a feeling that's not going to work.  Think about the chipset inside your Mac Pro as a chain in this order: `CPU → Northbridge → Southbridge`.  The RAM is connected at the Northbridge, and the Thunderbolt bus is connected at the Southbridge.  The Southbridge does not handle RAM, and it cannot go through the Northbridge to get at the RAM.  So trying to connect another CPU through the Southbridge is not going to work. <comment327389> Hey Bob, thank you for responding! Are you saying that if I hook up another processor through a thunderbolt expansion chassis like I mentioned above that the processor would not work at all (no less both of them working simultaneously) since that other processor would not be able to see the RAM that is installed on the computer? I purchased the quad core Mac Pro and regret not purchasing one with more cores - If what I just said is true I guess I have to buy a new internal processor with more cores and replace the internal quad core one all together. Can you think of any other workarounds? <comment327396> No, you'll have to just replace the processor.  Unless the motherboard is specifically designed for multiple processors, there's no way to add another one and have it work the same.  There might be some hacks to get it to work, but without using the chipset the way it was designed, performance would be terrible.   Besides, you mentioned connecting the processor through PCIe—did you determine if such a device actually exists (I would be really surprised if it did). <comment327397> Looking at the [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_Pro) for the Mac Pro, it uses a standard LGA2011 socket, so you have plenty of options to choose from if you want a new CPU! <comment327528> I would have to do more research. My friend did it with a graphics card using that connection but I guess that's completely different. I did not upgrade when I originally purchased because I did not want to give up the core speed for more cores. I have now found processors that have more cores and still retain my same 3.7 GHz. I have 64 GB of RAM in the machine along with a 2 TB SSD; I run multiple VM's and have a lot of applications open at the same time and I keep seeing the CPU hit 100% in the activity monitor and when that happens applications start not responding and everything starts <comment327529> Going extremely slow. I'm assuming that the only way to solve this is to add more cores, is that correct? <comment327812> If you're doing heavy multitasking (and every single core is maxed out), adding more cores would probably help.  If, however, your system is a its limits and not all cores are in use, then it's due to software and adding more cores won't help.             Now about the graphics card, that uses a lower level of interaction in that system chipset, so that's how it works over PCIe and the Southbridge. <comment327823> So how do I go about figuring out if all of my cores are being maxed out or if it's a software thing and not all of my cores are even being used? <comment327869> Use Activity Monitor.  Open the CPU Usage window (⌘2) to see exactly what each core is doing.
