How to install apps which require a newer version of iOS on a 1st gen. iPad? <body> I have a 1st generation iPad and when I download apps it tells me “this requires iOS 6.0 or later” but when I go to update it tells me it's fully updated? Why is this happening, and is there any way I can fix it?  <answer135061> The latest iOS version your system supports is iOS 5.1.1. You won’t be able to update it to iOS 6.  Unfortunately, it means you won’t be able to install any app which requires iOS 6 or higher.  <answer136150> As Édouard said: the latest supported iOS for your device is 5.1.1, and if an iOS application supports only newer iOS versions, then you can not install / update this application.  You could try to search for an similar application with the same features which supports older iOS versions.  Or you could try to contact the software developer / company and ask for a compatible version. I did that for my favorite media application, and they included my old device as beta tester... but this is unusual.  <answer144924> Here's the easiest way to download apps onto an old iPhone/iPad that doesn't support downloading apps through the App Store (if you're getting an error that you need a greater software version to download):  ol liOn your old iPhone/iPad, go to codeSettings/code - codeStore/code - set codeApps/code to codeOff/code./li liGo onto your computer (it doesn't matter if it's a PC or a Mac) and open the iTunes app. Then go to the iTunes store and download all the apps you want to be on your iPad/iPhone./li liIf the iTunes on the computer and your iPad are both signed into the same Apple ID, and the iPad is connected to the internet, then go on your iPad/iPhone to codeApp Store/code - codePurchased/code - tap on an individual app you want to install./li liYou'll get a message that says "The current version requires iOS 6.1 or later, but you can download the last compatible version," just hit codeDownload/code./li /ol  This method should at least allow you to have most apps on your outdated device. Most of them will work, but sometimes even once you have the app installed on your it still won't run correctly. That's just tough luck. But in my experience that's not too common; apps usually work just fine.   <comment161443> I would reduce your answer to the actual answer part. <comment161445> As Apple changes the APIs and deprecates tons of methods, support for older iOS versions becomes difficult. And ARC totally ruins backwards compatibility. I know because I program for iPhone. Very frustrating. It's probably hard to get the developer to support an old version. <comment161467> Downvoted, as this answer is purely subjective.   Apple did not force you to buy new hardware.  If you are happy with the hardware you have, and the software that runs on it, then don't upgrade.   If you want to run newer programs, that require a newer OS, upgrade.   It's very simple.   In any case, please limit answers to FACTS and not opinions. <comment162074> Thank you for these hints - I tried to improve my answer by removing my emotions. Even if I still think that supporting old platforms has changed… 9000: Apple has changed their system features since they exist, but a longer time ago they did it by supporting old system. And they still do, but make it difficult. Just one example: in XCode you can still compile iOS apps for 4.3 (with full support for iOS 7 features), but they hide this. Charlie74: I would like to agree, but if someone bought hardware for very much money and all software stops to support it, then I can understand frustration too. <comment170786> I thought you only got the message to download the last compatible version if you had previously purchased the app when it was the current version for the older iOS. <comment221236> See also http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/141840/finding-old-versions-of-ios-apps-for-5-1-1-on-a-1st-generation-ipad <comment286527> This *also* works when you haven't purchased an app before. I donated an old iPad 1 after wiping it clean. The above method allowed the new user to install for instance Google Drive and other apps (but not Google+: that one refused). <comment327457> You **will** often be able to install the app, just not the latest version of it. See Chad's answer for details. <comment327458> It's possible, see Chad's answer. <comment327459> @Fiksdal it will not guarantee it will work. Because the underlying API's might have changed. <comment327466> @Rob Yes, it will. The method in Chad's answer doesn't install the new, incompatible app. It installs an *older* version, which **is** compatible. Of course, if an old enough version doesn't even exist, then it won't install at all, because there's nothing to install. Another thing that can happen is that the app needs to connect to an online service (server) from its creator, and that service may drop support for very old versions of the app. But it mostly works. <comment327481> @Fiksdal your 2nd last line: that's exactly the API I was naming. If the developer takes the older service offline, you cannot use the app anymore. <comment327483> @Rob Oh, ok, fair enough. Yes, absolutely. Some apps are like that. Haven't come across any yet, though, but I'm pretty sure there are some. <comment328985> Man, I posted a bounty but forgot to award it! Damn,
