Can't boot from Snow Leopard DVD <body> I bought a new hard drive for my 2011 MacBook Pro and did the following steps:  ul liBackup using Time Machine/li liReplaced the hard drive/li liPut in a Snow Leopard DVD (10.6 from ~2009)/li liBooted holding down the kbdc/kbd key/li /ul  I can hear the DVD spinn for a while but I never get past the Apple logo in the boot, no error message.  Why isn't it working?  <answer94439> Your MacBook Pro requires a more recent version of OS X (A least 10.6.6). Mac OS X versions (builds) for computers on Support.Apple.com  <comment110708> How old is your MacBook Pro ? <comment110711> It's the first version with Sandy Bridge, from 2011. <comment110712> Perhaps the DVD is *corrupted*, or it's not the appropriated DVD (if it came with an specific computer, it will be computer model bound). Try booting holding down **Option**, and see if the DVD is listed. <comment110719> @Thecafremo the DVD was listed. I think the version on the DVD is to old as Matthiue pointed out in his answer.
