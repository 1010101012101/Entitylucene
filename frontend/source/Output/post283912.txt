Change volume range for sound? (i.e. dB-range for slider) <body> I have an issue where the "slider" for volume is near unusable for a USB-headset. Only the first four mini-steps (see Lowest volume is still too loudâ€”how can I make it even lower?) are somehow valid volume ranges, the rest are way too high.   In the MIDI-control I can see that the dB-range is from -37 dB (0-volume) to -0 dB (1-volume, or max, the scale is between 0 and 1). With mini-steps (see above) the increment is 0.016-volume, but the first step from 0 to 0.016 gets the dBs from -37 to -32.37, and each following mini-step is roughly 0.5 dBs closer to 0.  I want the volume slider to step between -37 and -18 dBs instead of -32.37 (the lowest mini-step with sound) to 0. Is this doable somehow?  As a comment, I think the actual dB-values are way off, but that probably depends on the fact that it is a USB-headset.
