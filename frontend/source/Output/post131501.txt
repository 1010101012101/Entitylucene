No covers after copying shared iTunes songs <body> I got a new MacBook and now I would like to transfer all my media files via iTunes sharing from my old MacBook to the new one. But sometimes the strongcovers/strong are not copied.   Does someone know why and stronghow I can/strong copy my songs strongwith covers/strong?  <answer131507> My experience:  there are 2 ways that itunes associates art work with songs:  ul lione is in the "Album Artwork" folder in itunes.  this can be updated from inside itunes in the menus.  these images stay in a folder and get some soft association with the music files./li lithe other method is added manually with the gui, cutting and pasting.  these get added into the mp3 file./li /ul  it seems to me that i've tried to xfer the album artwork folder different ways before, but it doesn't work unless you copy the whole itunes setup.  <comment154570> That is right. If the cover image can be a part of the song file itself or managed by iTunes. In the later case the cover images are stored in a separate folder. I found an article in a German magazine with an AppleScript for storing the cover in the file itself. But I have not tried the script.
