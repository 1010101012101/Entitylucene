How to run a keyboard macro with automator in a background application? <body> I'm trying to figure out how I can automate a repeating key press within a specific application on automator. Essentially, I want it to run in the background while I'm free to do anything else on my computer.  I'm new to this, so I don't know if it (or anything for that matter) can do what I'm describing  <answer265747> It cannot be done, afaik.  Only the frontmost app will accept keypresses.  I don't have an absolute reference to confirm this, but there are discussion at Apple Communities, Stack Overflow &amp; MacScripter that would appear to agree with my belief.  <comment333221> It would be helpful to know what the specific application is, what you are trying to accomplish and your Mac OS version too.
