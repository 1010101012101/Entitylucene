"Remove personal information" default save in Office for Mac 2011? <body> Is anyone aware of a way of setting Office for Mac 2011 to automatically use the "remove personal information" option on every save?  <answer7704> The best way I can see of doing this is to modify or create a new blank template with the setting baked in.   ol liFile - New From Template - Blank Document /li liMake Privacy changes as before/li liSave as Word Template (This will normally appear under my Templates, but I presume you could overwrite the existing Blank template, wherever it is located)./li liThen when creating a new document, use the new template you created./li /ol  Jonathan
