Command + F1 did not shows the more... in IntelliJ IDEA <body> When I view my codepom.xml/code in IntelliJ IDEA, an error is shown:     Dependency "org.springframework:spring-web:4.2.2.RELEASE" not found &nbsp; more... (⌘F1)   However, when I use kbd⌘/kbd + kbdF1/kbd, it doesn't show more information.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mVeaZ.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer274981> Which way the F-Keys respond is dependant on this pref    System Prefs  Keyboard  Keyboard  Use all F1, F2 etc. keys as standard function keys.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9pcn9.png" alt="enter image description here"  Unchecked, your F-Keys will change screen brightness, turn the volume up &amp; down etc.br With it checked they become regular F-keys.  Holding kbd Fn /kbd will temporarily flip this default for that one keypress.  <comment345826> Did you try Fn/Cmd/F1 ? <comment345827> @Tetsujin, thank you ,you are right. <comment345828> I don't know the software, but it's always a good guess. It depends which way you have your F-keys set in prefs. Will put up an answer...
