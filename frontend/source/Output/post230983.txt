How do you do command-line video screen capture on OS X with libav? <body> On linux I can do something like:  precodeavconv -f alsa -i pulse -f x11grab -r 25 -s 1400x1050 \   -i :0.0+0,0 -vcodec libx264 -threads 4 \   -acodec libmp3lame video.mkv /code/pre  but of course the alsa and x11 driver should be different on OS X. How would this work to do command-line video screen-capture?  <answer230984> For taking screenemshots/em (not movies) there is codescreencapture/code:  precodepse@Mithos:~$ screencapture -h screencapture: illegal option -- h usage: screencapture [-icMPmwsWxSCUtoa] [files]   -c         force screen capture to go to the clipboard   -C         capture the cursor as well as the screen. only in non-interactive modes   -d         display errors to the user graphically   -i         capture screen interactively, by selection or window                control key - causes screen shot to go to clipboard                space key   - toggle between mouse selection and                              window selection modes                escape key  - cancels interactive screen shot   -m         only capture the main monitor, undefined if -i is set   -M         screen capture output will go to a new Mail message   -o         in window capture mode, do not capture the shadow of the window   -P         screen capture output will open in Preview   -s         only allow mouse selection mode   -S         in window capture mode, capture the screen not the window   -t&lt;format&gt; image format to create, default is png (other options include pdf, jpg, tiff and other formats)   -T&lt;seconds&gt; Take the picture after a delay of &lt;seconds&gt;, default is 5   -w         only allow window selection mode   -W         start interaction in window selection mode   -x         do not play sounds   -a         do not include windows attached to selected windows   -r         do not add dpi meta data to image   -l&lt;windowid&gt; capture this windowsid   -R&lt;x,y,w,h&gt; capture screen rect   -B&lt;bundleid&gt; screen capture output will open in app with bundleidBS   files   where to save the screen capture, 1 file per screen /code/pre  For capturing video, the easiest way is to use the Screen Capture option in Quicktime Player. It even should be possible to initiate this from Terminal with some Applescript (which is beyond my skills).  <answer249973> I can't get ffcast installed on mac (as it cant find libx11, though I installed xquartz), otherwise that would be perfect  https://github.com/lolilolicon/FFcast  <comment282009> Yes - found some answers re QuickTime: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/63056/can-applescript-be-used-to-automate-a-screen-recording-session-on-os-x http://netjunki.org/capturing-video-with-applescript-and-quicktime.html http://superuser.com/questions/612474/applescript-quicktime-start-and-stop-a-movie-recording-and-export-it-to-disk Hard to find anything on OSX + libav though. <comment282040> I don't know whether somebody modified libav for OSX, don't think there is an urgent need for such a library
