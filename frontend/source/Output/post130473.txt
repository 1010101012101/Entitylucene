Make rule for message in mail.app <body> Is there a way to create a mailbox rule based on the currently highlighted message in mail.app? OSX 10.8.5   I want to create a rule from the application rather than have to go to Mail - Preferences - rules and create it there.  <comment152948> Please explain further what you want to do with the rule and message <comment152960> something like a keyboard shortcut? <comment153034> That would do I guess.
