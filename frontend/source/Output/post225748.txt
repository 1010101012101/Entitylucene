El Capitan Server: Reshaping NFS share via AFP/SMB <body> I have a Linux box sharing HDDs via NFS, which I prefer for its simplicity and speed. My local network is on a directory server (El Capital Server OpenDirectory).  However, I have family members who have OD accounts and who VPN into my network to access file shares, but their computers are configured to be part of the OD, so it is impractical, insecure, and (because of my VPN's settings) impossible for them to access the NFS shares directly (note: their user-IDs won't match!), so I want to re-share them via AFP/SMB on the OS X server.  I've tried in the past connecting the linux box to OD and sharing AFP/SMB from there, but (1) that's a pain in the butt and (2) it often requires manually setting SMB passwords which is impractical. I'd rather have the OS X server just re-share the appropriate places.  However, whether I use code/net/10.0.0.11/path/to/share/code or I mount it at, say, code/Volumes/share/code, when I share it via the Server configuration utility, users cannot mount it.  On my Retina MBP, when I connect to that share, it never shows that it successfully mounts (i.e. the eject button never appears) and, if I try to put something there or codetouch/code a file, it gives an error that the operation isn't supported.  I have the NFS server give both my OD server and its replica (which will do the AFP/SMB sharing) codeno_root_squash/code access, which I have verified by doing codesudo/code-things from it which don't work from other computers.  strongHas anybody else gotten this to work? Is there some trick?/strong  emMore information:/em  Here is an example line from the NFS server's code/etc/exports/code file:  precode/Volumes/PDISK3 10.0.0.2(rw,async,no_subtree_check,insecure,no_root_squash) 10.0.0.3(rw,async,no_subtree_check,insecure,no_root_squash) 10.0.0.0/16(rw,async,no_subtree_check,insecure) /code/pre  When I manually mounted it, I'm pretty sure this is the command I used em(I'd check, but the console I was using is currently doing a 2TB rsync, so I can't look at its history at the moment)/em:  precodemount -t nfs 10.0.0.11:/Volumes/PDISK3 /Volumes/PDISK3 /code/pre
