How to set a ringtone on iPhone? <body> I have recently bought an iPhone. I don't know how to set a ringtone on an iPhone. Can anyone explain the procedure to set a ringtone in an easy manner?  <answer285483> Open Settings → Sounds → Ringtone. Choose a ringtone from the list. As you choose a ringtone, it begins to play so you can preview it.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/PIgwh.png" width="210" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fjYQw.png" width="210" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mGVq8.png" width="210"
