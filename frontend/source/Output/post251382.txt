How to resize an iBooks' book window after switching between display? <body> I was reading a book on my MBP when it connects to two external monitors. I have make the book window fits the screen width.   However after I disconnected the monitors and tried to read the book on the MBP screen, it is what I see  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6zQmE.png" alt="enter image description here"  The top part of the window is outside the viewport. The window allows me to resize but  there is no way I can move the window around. I tried to move the book window to a different desktop but the window stays in the same shape and form.  Because the top menu part if obstructed, I cannot even close the book window.  No option to close the window is available even after the book window is minimized.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/UHuWh.png" alt="enter image description here"  How can I refit the window to the screen?  <answer251384> Try to resize the book to its "original" size with  kbdcmd ⌘/kbdkbd0/kbd. Usually the window gets very small then.  You can always close an open book with kbdcmd ⌘/kbdkbdW/kbd.
