Applescript time to GMT from specific location <body> I can use codetime to GMT/code to get the difference in time between the current time zone and that of GMT. Is there a way to plug in coordinates of a specific location and get the time zone of that location, then compare it to GMT, or at least compare it to the current time and then to GMT?  <comment369537> In the shell it's easy: `TZ=Europe/Berlin date +%z` (= +0200) or `TZ=America/Chicago date +%z` (= -0500) <comment369538> @klanomath And that accounts for daylight savings, too? Great, thanks. Why not post it as an answer, with `do shell script`? <comment369555> @klanomath It doesn't seem to work for every city - only those in the [TZ database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones). I even tried Atlanta, but it just gives me +0000. Especially if I choose some obscure city like Valdosta, GA. <comment369612> @klanomath It relates to a sunrise/sunset code that I'm writing. Rather than using Wikipedia's sunrise equation (which Applescript seems to hate), it uses the solar elevation formula and sets the equation to 0. But one variable is Î”T(GMT) - the time zone difference from GMT. For current location, `time from GMT` works just fine. But what if I want to calculate sunrise and sunset for somewhere outside of my current time zone? I suppose I could manually input which time zone it's in, but I was hoping there was a way to do it manually. <comment370281> To the hit-and-run downvoter, care to explain? It's considered impolite to claim that a question is unclear or not useful without informing the OP why that is your opinion. <comment370284> I up-voted your question so your net win is +3 ;-). BTW did you try jackjr300's answer (which was deleted 12 hours ago)? I don't even know if you still can see it - usually deleted answers are only visible for users with higher scores... <comment370292> @klanomath Yeah, I think you need 10K to get any sort of mod privileges. I never got a chance to see it. <comment370293> https://pastebin.com/E00hqbKu <comment370294> @klanomath Thanks. I'll try that later. Maybe he deleted it because he realized it didn't work? <comment370295> Quite possible...
