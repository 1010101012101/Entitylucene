Why are all my addresses not syncing from iCloud to Mac? <body> I have a laptop running Sierra and a desktop running Sierra. They both sync with the same account on iCloud.   On my desktop, next to the all iCloud link, there is a lightgrey error indicator:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nm0rN.png" alt="enter image description here".  Also When I click on it I see this odd error message:   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0M0nK.png" alt="enter image description here".   On my laptop, the set of groups displayed is different. in fact there are two groups which appear there, and which also appear in iCloud, which do not appear on my desktop.  I have tried turning off iCloud address book sync on my desktop (all contacts and groups disappear) and turning it back on (all contacts reappear but the groups are wrong.)  I can't explain it. Maybe someone else can? (By the way, this problem occurred before upgrading to Sierra)  <comment314755> To make sure, this is correct - occurred before upgrading to Sierra <comment314839> @norcaljohnny dont understand your comment. <comment314841> You had this problem prior to upgrade? <comment314911> Is there anything said in the Console.app? Search for 'Ignored vCard' and see which contact is causing the problem. <comment315391> yes I did have this prior to upgrade
