HomeKit sharing crashes when sharing home with guest. (Owner is legacy iCloud) <body> A HomeKit user has shared their home with me for the first time. They are reusing a very old iTunes/AppStore account to handle all iCloud functions... this means they are on the legacy "iCloud" and haven't yet taken the "one way upgrade" to iCloud for Xcode 6.   The issue I see is that once I accept the invitation, there is a spinning hourglass on my device that never finishes.  I've waited 4 days.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/AdGkhm.png" alt="enter image description here"  My guess is that the host iCloud account must be upgraded to the latest version, but there is no such warning that this is required.   Here is a developer screenshot of the iCloud versions I'm describing. There is a corresponding end-user dialog that could make more sense but I don't have a screenshot of that.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2wxwf.png" alt="enter image description here"  strongQuestion/strong  ul liThe terms "XCode 5" and CloudKit support might not be the correct user-facing terms. What is the correct term for an end user who may need to be updated?  /li liCan anyone confirm that "Xcode 6 support" is required for HomeKit sharing?/li liHow else can I troubleshoot this?/li /ul
