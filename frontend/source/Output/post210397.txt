How do I silence the "itunes needs to check for an update to the carrier settings for your iPad" message? <body> I no longer use a cellular connection on my iPad. I am quite content with WiFi.  For this or some other reason, I am getting  precodeitunes needs to check for an update to the carrier settings for your iPad /code/pre  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/an1aJ.png" alt="itunes needs to check for an update to the carrier settings for your iPad"  How do I silence this message?  iOS 9.0.2  <answer247153> To silence this message follow its instructions:      Go to the Advanced pane of iTunes preferences and turn on “Check for new software updates automatically”.   <comment253924> What happens if you Check? <comment253925> Nothing! But the message will return when iTunes is relaunched. OS X and iOS used to have an unwritten "Thou shall not pester thy users" rule. This is one recent example of their move away from this doctrine. <comment283904> I get this maddening window every time too, whether I check or not. I hope someone figures this out.
