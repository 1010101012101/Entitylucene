Adding a dictionary in different language and enabling spellchecking for that language too? <body> I always install the system with English and have no idea how to add a Spanish dictionary and spellchecking on my mac, how can it be done?  <answer282963> You set the language for spellcheck in system preferences  keyboard  text  spelling, and at the app level in Edit  Spelling and Grammar  Show Spelling and Grammar.  Some non-Apple apps, like MS Office, have their own internal settings for this function.  You set your preferred reference dictionaries in Applications  Dictionary  Preferences.  <comment356675> I have set `system preferences  keyboard  text  spelling` to "automatic by language", tried on TextEdit and it started to autocorrect spelling as soon as I typed a few words in Spanish. Also added a Spanish dictionary on the Dictionary app and it says downloading on the new tab for Spanish, I'll check it latter.
