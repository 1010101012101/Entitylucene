Change spaces but keep current application on top/active? <body> I have a number of apps that are shared across all desktops, for example Console.app.  When I change from one desktop to another with Console.app active, it changes to some other application on the new space.  If my current app is available on the space I am switching to, it should be active on the new space as well.  The worst part of this is that the application I was using before the switch stays visible for a split second before bringing another application to the front.
