Notes data from external drive <body> I recently replaced the HDD in my mid-2012 MacBook Pro with an SSD. After doing a clean install of OS X Sierra, I wanted to get my old notes from the backup copy of my old HDD. After some research I found that the data is stored in "/Library/Containers/com.apple.notes....". I've tried to copy this data to my current ssd, but notes doesn't recognise this data when I open the application.   I just want to access the text in the notes and transfer it. I'm not fussed about preserving the original structure of the notes.   Please someone help me! those notes are really important to me!  <answer274552> You should be able to recover your notes data from a Time Machine backup as follows:  ul liEnter Time Machine from the Time Machine menu/li liUse the timeline (it's on the edge of the screen) to locate a version of the Notes storage folder from strongbefore/strong your clean installation of macOS Sierra. (The location should be em~/Library/Containers/com.apple.Notes/Data/Library/Notes//em where the '~' indicates your user account home folder)/li liSelect the folder and click on Restore to restore it/li /ul  If you haven't got a TM backup or want to try recovering the data from your HDD, see below.  strongExtracting notes data from your HDD/strong  If you haven't got a TM backup or can't get it to restore from one, you can manually extract the data using a web browser (e.g. Safari, Etc).  To do this:  ol liGo to the location on your HDD that is equivalent to the following path: code~/Library/Containers/com.apple.Notes/Data/Library/Notes/ /code/li liInside this folder you'll see files with names such as emNotesV6.storedata/em/li liCopy these files to another location on your SSD/li liAdd a .html extension to each of them. (strongNote:/strong You will be prompted as to whether you're sure you want to use the .html extension - click on the kbdUse .html/kbd button)./li liUse Safari or another web browser to open the emNotesV6.storedata.html/em file first (it may not be 'V6' in your case, but it will be 'V' followed by a number)/li liYou should now see your missing notes/li liNow go through the process of copying and pasting the data into new notes and saving them/li /ol  If any of your notes are missing after going through the above steps, repeat Step 5 and open the other files you copied across at step 3 to see if your missing notes are there.  Let me know if you run into problems.  <comment345243> Is your old notes data also from an installation of macOS Sierra? Also, how are you _copying_ the data across? <comment345260> I believe the OP clearly states they tried to retrieve the notes folder from a backup but it's not being recognized as valid. At this point a helpful answer would be to extract the data from whatever format they're in, if that's even possible. <comment345264> @tubedogg Thanks for keeping me honest! :) I've updated my answer to offer a second solution.
