MacPort - jslint fails to install due to incompatible spidermonkey installation <body> emProblem Description in Brief:/embr/ I am trying to install strongjslint/strong which depends on the strongspidermonkey/strong macport.  Installation of strongspidermonkey/strong is successful, however, it appears to be incompatible with the installation of strongjslint/strong.  Consequently, strongjslint/strong is not installed.  emProblem Description in Detail:/embr/ When I tried to install strongjslint/strong, it successfully installed its dependency, strongspidermonkey/strong, however, failed to install strongjslint/strong.  Below is the error message that was returned, which I copied and pasted from the log that was produced.  precode:debug:configure configure phase started at Mon Nov 11 13:31:53 EST 2013 :notice:configure ---&gt;  Configuring jslint :debug:configure Using compiler 'Xcode Clang' :debug:configure Executing org.macports.configure (jslint) :error:configure You need to install spidermonkey with the +fileobject variant in order to use jslint. :error:configure org.macports.configure for port jslint returned: incompatible spidermonkey installation :debug:configure Error code: NONE :debug:configure Backtrace: incompatible spidermonkey installation     while executing "$procedure $targetname" :info:configure Warning: targets not executed for jslint: org.macports.activate org.macports.configure org.macports.build org.macports.destroot org.macports.install :notice:configure Please see the log file for port jslint for details:     /opt/local/var/macports/logs/_opt_local_var_macports_sources_rsync.macports.org_release_ports_lang_jslint/jslint/main.log /code/pre  This is a problem that has been reported to the MacPorts project, however, closed due to it being 'invalid'.  See the following link.  http://trac.macports.org/ticket/37053  So, my question is, how do I go about installing strongspidermonkey/strong with the strong+fileobject/strong variant in order to install and use strongjslint/strong?  Furthermore, is there a way to configure macports so I don't have to do this each time I try to upgrade my macports?  Any advice/suggestions on how to resolve this would be appreciated.  <answer113495> If you don't have spidermonkey installed, use codesudo port install jslint +fileobject/code. If you already have it installed, you need to rebuild it with the code+fileobject/code variant: codesudo port upgrade --enforce-variants spidermonkey +fileobject/code and re-try installing jslint.  <comment133256> Thanks for that! It did the trick!  Was able to upgrade spidermonkey by enforcing its variants and, by doing so, was able to successfully install jslint.  Once again, thank you!!!!
