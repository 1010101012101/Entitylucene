Why nc doesn't response even if the "w" option set? <body> For some servers:  precodenc -w 1 -z x.x.x.x 22 /code/pre  doesn't work. It has no response, but is looking like very busy: only kbdctrl/kbd + kbdC/kbd can help.  So code-w 1/code seems to be a useless option, to specify the timeout.  Does somebody know what is going wrong: how specify a real timeout?  <comment113405> Might be a bit off topic for the apple, might try unix, however. adding `nc -w 5 -l 1222` works for me. the timer does not take effect until a connection is made. <comment113445> I thought it is only issue of apple's version of netcat
