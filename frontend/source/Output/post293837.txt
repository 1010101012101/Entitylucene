What is the best replacement battery for iPhone 5s <body> My battery is 300+ cycles on my iPhone 5s, and it is draining very quickly, even though I do not have much applications running, and not many of them use background app refresh. Where and/or how can I find a decent replacement battery for iPhone 5s?  <answer293839> I would buy an replacement battery for your iPhone 5s from iFixit.
