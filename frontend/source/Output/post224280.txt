installing express without npm for the MEAN stack <body> My El Capitan shows node installed in strong/usr/local/bin/node/strong, but code $which npm /code reports nothing.br I have Angular installed and which to play around with the MEAN stack which requires express and mangoDB.      My current path is: /usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin  Online reading to install express shows I must issue npm command.br Can I install express using brew instead?  Thanks  <answer224293> I fixed it by downloading and installing node.js which also installed npm.  <comment271997> What is your PATH ? <comment271998> /usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin <comment272000> Why are you doing which npm but say you have /usr/local/bin/node ? What not say if you have npm and where that is <comment272001> to see if the npm command is available or not on my system so that I can install express in my web project dir. <comment272002> Why mention  /usr/local/bin/node ? what has that to do with npm <comment272003> Because online reading indicate that npm comes bundled with nodeJS <comment272004> You have the executable node what is that to do with npm? <comment272005> Sorry, I don't get it :)
