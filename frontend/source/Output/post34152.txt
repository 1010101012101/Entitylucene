sync sent mail between iPhone and mail.app <body> Can I set up my mac/iPhone/mobile me to sync the mails I've sent on my iPhone back to my mail.app on my mac?  I use two email addresses: an IMAP (gmail) address and a microsoft exchange address.  On the other hand, I can't even see the mails I've sent on my iPhone in the mail app on the iPhone, it only shows mail.app sent mails.  <answer34156> h2Solution for Gmail:/h2  Gesendet must the the emlabel of the mailbox that you use for sent mail on the iPhone/em. (info: gesendet is German for sent)  I believe the default label is named strongcodeSent Messages/code/strong created once you set up Gmail on your iPhone using IMAP.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/PmFHf.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment38967> This doesn't help since I've set up my mail.app not to show gmail labels...
