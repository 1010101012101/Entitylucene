What programs have trouble with case-sensitive (HFSX) filesystems, and how to fix them? <body> There are some programs that require a case-sensitive filesystem, and others that require case-insensitive. Even though Apple warns against using case sensitive file systems, in some situations it is useful.  strongWhat programs have trouble with Case Sensitive (HFSX) systems?/strong  strongWhat are the work-arounds?/strong  In general, the problem is that the developers have a file in their app called codeFOO/code, but try to access the file by the name codefoo/code. In an HFS+ system that is case preserving but case insensitive, searching for codefoo/code will find codeFOO/code. That is not the case in HFSX. The general solution is therefore to   ol liFind the misnamed file or folder/li liMake a copy, a link, or rename so the expected name is found/li /ol  <answer46326> According to this question, Photoshop CS5 won't work on HFSX.  Convert a partition from case-sensitive to case-insensitive  <answer46327> MeshLab version 1.3.2 does not work on HSFX systems. The codeCFBundleExecutable/code in codeInfo.plist/code specifies codeMeshLab/code, but the binary in the Contents/MacOS folder is codemeshlab/code. The solution is to edit codeInfo.plist/code (change codeMeshLab/code to codemeshlab/code) or:  precodecd meshlab.app/Contents/MacOS ln -s meshlab MeshLab /code/pre  A bug report has been filed here: https://sourceforge.net/p/meshlab/bugs/323/  <answer46328> Thing (beta, 1.6b24) does not work with HSFX.

This is emtroublesome/em only if you expect queries to be sorted alphabetically without case sensitivity.

Not currently an issue. <comment233758> My guess that Console would behave in this way – with HFS Plus with Mavericks – was based on past knowledge of how Console behaved with ZEVO ZFS on Mountain Lion. The relevant topic, in the GreenBytes area (before it was closed by Oracle) was *disorderly representations of files in apps such as Console*; Don Brady described it as a bug in Console.
