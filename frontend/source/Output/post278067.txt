Open terminal via Safari <body> Is it possible to open a terminal window from a Safari webpage? I have found a way to open a ssh terminal window, but is it possible to only open the terminal window without pre filled commands?  I have tried to search on google but i only find solutions for opening Safari from terminal.  To open terminal with ssh from Safari i put the following link on a webpage:   code&lt;a href="ssh://adminuser@10.225.xxx.xxx"&gt;ssh&lt;/a&gt;/code  <answer278090> There are three URL types which can open Terminal from Safari:  ol licodessh/code/li licodetelnet/code/li licodex-man-page/code/li /ol  Those informations can be found under codeCFBundleURLTypes/code key in: code/Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app/Contents/Info.plist/code  So in order to open Terminal app, you can place link like:  code&lt;a href="telnet://"&gt;telnet&lt;/a&gt;/code  code&lt;a href="ssh://"&gt;ssh&lt;/a&gt;/code  code&lt;a href="x-man-page://"&gt;man page&lt;/a&gt;/code  It does not prefill informations in Terminal for me.  hr  Bonus: This rule can be applied to any application that can open URLs.  Check URL types of the app with:  codedefaults read /absolute/path/to/Info.plist CFBundleURLTypes/code  for example:  codedefaults read /Applications/Utilities/Script\ Editor.app/Contents/Info.plist CFBundleURLTypes/code  This gives me codeapplescript/code as URL type, so making link like:  code&lt;a href="applescript://"&gt;Script Editor&lt;/a&gt;/code  Opens the Script Editor app.
