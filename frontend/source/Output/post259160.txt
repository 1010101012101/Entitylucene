iPhone songs order of name <body> I am wondering if possible to ask.  Why songs with chinese titles can be arranged like english ?....  Taking e.g:  C:  猜猜我是谁  Come Over  D：  大方  Dangerous  ....and why can't korean or japanese be arranged? Theese are always on the # category (examples of titles are shown below):  シアワセ林檎  20 Lives  <comment324203> How is an English OS expected to know what 'letter' they belong to?  They cannot possibly be placed in 'alphabetical order' if none of the characters are actually in the alphabet of the chosen language. <comment324206> Japanese can use romaji to know their 'letter'. <comment324207> Romanji **is**  English letters... so of course can be placed alphabetically.
