A Windows' Ctrl+Z equivalent for OSX <body> On many operating systems if you want to strongundo/strong something you can press kbdCtrl/kbd+kbdZ/kbd. I tried this on Mac OS X and it does not work. What is the suitable equivalent?  <answer22040> kbdCommand/kbd + kbdZ/kbd check Edit menu if you are unsure if the shortcut is available for a program or a scenario.   On a side note, kbdCommand/kbd works as the default shortcut key on Mac OS X where Windows' default modifier key is kbdCtrl/kbd  This holds for Copy, Paste, Open, etc...  <answer22041> On a Mac, many Windows kbdCTRL/kbd + kbdxxx/kbd shortcuts are changed to kbdCMD/kbd + kbdxxx/kbd.

On a Mac, many Windows CTRL-xxx shortcuts are changed to CMD-xxx." - interesting history about this, when the 1984 Mac came out (with the world's first mass consumer distributed GUI OS), it was Apple that came up with all the "CMD Z, CMD C, CMD X, etc" short cut keys.  When Microsoft followed with Windows a few years later, it was Microsoft that copied all those shortcut keys and used CTRL key instead (since they didn't have a dedicated CMD Apple key on their DOS PC style keyboards). <comment24394> I didn't know that! Interesting piece of history! :-) <comment25095> In addition, the Mac OS was the first OS to establish the same command keys system-wide, to be adopted by all applications. Before Mac OS (in MS-DOS, etc.) every application had its own different command or function keys for Cut, Copy, Paste, Undo, Print, etc. So you had to learn different key commands for each and every application. When Microsoft developed Windows, they deliberatly copied the Mac system-wide approach.
