Is my iPad 2 a "Rev A"? <body> After spending some time searching with Google and on developer.apple.com, I still can't figure whether my iPad 2 is a "Rev A" or not (its model is MC979LL/A).  How can I know my exact model?  <answer120788> You don't have a Rev A iPad 2 — the MC979 is an iPad2,1 (16 GB White).  The Rev A iPad 2 (iPad2,4 — A1395) model numbers start with strongMC954/strong (black) or strongMC989/strong (white). They use the Apple A5 Rev A.  supSource: The iPhone Wiki — Models/sup  To view your model number, you can find it in Settings &rarr; About.  <comment140832> Thanks, I'll accept in 7 minutes when the system lets me. While we're here, how do you know this? <comment140834> @Yar Added the source :) <comment140836> Thank you, the concern is that the document linked doesn't mention "Rev A" nor "Revision A" etc... so how would a person who is not you know this? Thanks! <comment140837> @Yar The iPad 2 Rev A is the iPad2,4 — the last model of iPad 2. Edited answer to clarify. <comment140839> Thanks, as you well know, we're creating content for the Internet here, so I will be the last person to suffer. Thank you!
