Cannot uncheck 'pending' iCloud keychain on both mobile and OSX <body> This is very frustrating.  One day I wanted to try iCloud keychain. I turned that on without knowing I will be struck with it forever.  I'm asked to verify with code which I can enter, then message to the phone which I don't have access to because I left it in another country. I decided to turn iCloud Keychain off for the time being.  But  ol liOn OSX (Yosemite 10.10.3) when I uncheck the box in PrefiCloud it immediately come back the moment I unchecked it. Pressing "Options..." button only leads to using code and phone to verify which I don't want to. I want to turn it off. I cannot sign out now either because it ask me to turn off all iCloud services including iCloud Keychain which I'm now struck with it forever./li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/sA0Pg.png" alt="enter image description here"  ol start="2" liOn iPod I also cannot flip the switch off. On the page with 'Approve..' and a switch for turning off iCloud Keychain I can flip that off. But when I press back, the list still say 'Pending' and sure enough coming back in I discovered it is still green, turned on. On iPod however I can sign out, but signing back in does not fix the pending forever problem./li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HZhAi.png" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/N1N2H.png" alt="enter image description here"  Now my OSX and iPod keeps asking each other endlessly to approve each other but I cannot approve it, nor I want to do it because I want to turn this frustrating thing off..
