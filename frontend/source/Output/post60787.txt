How to fix mail to particular contacts not appearing in Sent folder? <body> On Mountain Lion's Mail, I am having a problem with the messages I send to a particular coworker from my work account not appearing in the Sent mailbox.  ul liThe messages strongare/strong going through. (I got her to Fwd: the important one back to me.)/li liMessages I sent to my other accounts, even from that account, are correctly appearing in Sent./li liMessages I send from another address (even using the same SMTP server) are appearing in Sent./li /ul  Things I've tried so far:  ol liConnection Doctor. It shows no issues./li liDeleting + recreating the account./li liRebuilding the mailbox./li liI'm familiar with strongUse This Mailbox For /strong and it is not a factor here./li /ol  Any ideas?  <answer69482> This appears to have been a hiccup on the SMTP server.  <comment70028> A coworker has suggested this may just be a hosting glitch. The symptoms seemed unlikely, but IMAP does seem… complicated. (I believe SMTP is used to send, but IMAP is used to put the message in Sent.)
