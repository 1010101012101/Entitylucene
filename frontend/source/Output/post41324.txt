How can I use an Applescript from within a program? <body> This question Is there a way to add all of the recipients of an email to a group/folder in contacts from Mail? seems to have an answer that would be useful for me, but I don't actually know how to use the script from within Mail.  Alternatively, it seems that Automator could be used too, but I'm also very unfamiliar with Automator. I'm looking to extend the tools and link them to solve general problems, with the maintenance of group membership being my current challenge.  How can I run an AppleScript from within a program?  <answer45504> To use this (or any) script in a program like Apple Mail, you could create a service in Automator.  Launch the strongAutomator/strong program.  When it says emChoose a type for your document/em, select strongService/strong and click strongChoose/strong  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/JFqn7.png" alt="Choose a type for your document"  In the top dialog, select emService receives/em strongno input/strong in strongMail.app/strong (or, the name of your program, or strongany application/strong if that's what you want).  You will insert one action: From the emUtilities/em group, double-click strongRun AppleScript/strong.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3ndhG.png" alt="Run AppleScript"  Select the text that says     code(* Your script goes here *)/code   and paste in the script you want to run. In your case, the script you want to paste is   precode  tell application "Mail"     set theSelection to selection     set theMessage to item 1 of theSelection     set theSubject to subject of theMessage     tell application "Address Book"         set theGroup to make new group with properties {name:theSubject}     end tell     set theRecipients to to recipients of item 1 of theMessage     repeat with a from 1 to count theRecipients         set theRecipient to item a of theRecipients         tell application "Address Book"             set theName to name of theRecipient             tell application "Mail" to set theAddress to address of theRecipient             set thePerson to make new person with properties {first name:name of theRecipient}             make new email at end of emails of thePerson with properties {value:theAddress}             add thePerson to theGroup         end tell     end repeat     set theRecipients to cc recipients of item 1 of theMessage     repeat with a from 1 to count theRecipients         set theRecipient to item a of theRecipients         tell application "Address Book"             set theName to name of theRecipient             tell application "Mail" to set theAddress to address of theRecipient             set thePerson to make new person with properties {first name:name of theRecipient}             make new email at end of emails of thePerson with properties {value:theAddress}             add thePerson to theGroup         end tell     end repeat     tell application "Address Book" to save   end tell /code/pre  Once you have done that, go to the strongFile/strong menu and click strongSave/strong.  Give the service a name you will remember, like "Add Recipients to Group".  Then when you are in Mail, you can select a message or messages and go to the strongMail/strong menu in the menu bar, then the strongServices/strong menu in the Mail menu, and select the service strongAdd Recipients to Group/strong.  <comment47366> You could run the script by pasting it in AppleScript Editor. And assign a shortcut to it by [creating an Automator service or using FastScripts or other third party apps](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/24063/create-global-shortcut-to-run-command-line-applications/28272#28272).
