osx update error <body> I just tried installing an update on my OSX(10.6) and I got the following error :-     Some of the selected updates couldn't be saved.      The file “SUBaseSystemCombo10.6.8.pkg” couldn’t be found on the server   “swcdn.apple.com”.      The file “iTunesX.pkg” couldn’t be found on the server   “swcdn.apple.com”.   I'm not sure why the error happens. Could someone suggest a way to diagnose or get past the issue? Thanks.  <answer56936> Apple is updating it's servers right now; Manually download them from:  ul lihttp://support.apple.com/downloads//li /ul  Or you can try back later...  <comment65419> Ah I see thanks - do I have to download updates manually? Or is there a single OSX update that I can download and use for 10.6? <comment65459> @wheee, if you still can't update I would recommend downloading the following first:  http://support.apple.com/kb/DL1512  — Then after you install it, try to run the software update again. If you can post a reply as to whether or not it helped solve the problem we can go from there. Manually downloading the updates hopefully will be unnecessary (and for multiple/concurrent updates I'd try to avoid it); if you need to update manually though, i'll try and help make it less time consuming for you. <comment65512> thanks for your reply! I tried to download and install the update, however, I recently reinstalled my OSX and an having 10.6.3 - it seems that I can install the update your mentioned above only if im on 10.6.8 <comment65571> @wheee oh sorry, i didn't realize you were using 10.6.3 — try installing this one instead: http://support.apple.com/kb/DL676, then try   Software Update... and let us know if you're successful with updating automatically.
