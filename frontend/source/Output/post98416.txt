Reboot from the command line (stuck processes) <body> I started a remote reboot of my machine but a couple of emstuck/em processes are hanging the reboot.  ul lilogin with SSH is still possible/li licodesudo reboot/code or sudo codeshutdown -r/code hang/li litwo processes are emtrying to exit/em  precodeUSER             PID  PPID  PGID   SESS JOBC STAT   TT       TIME COMMAND root              43     1    43      0    0 ?Es    ??    0:00.00 (mds) corti            407   376   407      0    1 ?E     ??    0:00.00 (talagent) /code/pre/li liI did not manage to kill them (i.e., codesudo kill -9 43/code or codesudo kill -9 407/code have not effect)/li liA remote desktop session is no more possible (last screen that I got was a gray screen with the wheel while shutting down)/li liTrying to reboot without flushing the caches does also hang (any combination of code-n/code and code-q/code)/li /ul  Any other things I could try other than going home and physically reboot the machine?  <answer98420> If you can't kill something with code-9/code, and codesudo reboot/code doesn't work, you're pretty much out of options. The process is deadlocked in a manner that has prevented the OS from shutting down.  Have you closed all other Windowed applications? codetalagent/code is apparently the process that manages Resume, your guess is as good as mine in determining why it's deadlocked; Errors communicating with a process it was trying to save before closing, disk errors, etc. Since it's attempting to exit, it's unlikely that anything else (forcing system sleep, closing the process it was waiting on) will cause this process to work out it's lock.  The power button is necessary at this point.  <comment115517> I tried again with `sudo reboot -nq` and after 15 minutes the machine rebooted. I don't know it one of processes finally died or something else did the trick. <comment115518> `mds` released the `/` filesystem, and one of your `shutdown` was let terminate.
