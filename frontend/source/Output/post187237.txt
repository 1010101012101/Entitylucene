How to install LP_solve solver on Yosemite? <body> I want to install java based "lp_solve" LP solver on my MacBook Air, OS X Yosemite. I tried to follow the instructions given here. But when I run sh ccc.osx, it is not creating the liblpsolve55.dylib and liblpsolve55.dylib. I need help installing this solver. Or maybe suggest me a similar solver which is easy to install on OS X Yosemite.   <answer187240> What's your problem in specific? Any error messages?  I just tried to compile it and I didn't run into any problem:  precode$ cd lpsolve55/ $ sh ccc.osx $ ls  bin/osx64/ liblpsolve55.a     liblpsolve55.dylib /code/pre  <answer187247> The easiest way is doing it using homebrew. You just need to type the following couple of commands in a terminal window:  precodebrew tap homebrew/science brew install lp_solve /code/pre  If you don't have homebrew installed, just type the following to install before the previous commands:  precoderuby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)" /code/pre  <comment227007> Thanks for the edit. I will take care of the links from next time. <comment227008> I tried to do exactly this, but I cannot see the liblpsolve55.a & liblpsolve55.dylib files. <comment227011> Thanks a lot, this thing successfully installed the LP solver. I will use the LP solver and confirm whether it works fine or not. <comment231001> It really works. Thanks again. <comment360636> Do you know how to get this lp_solve working in Python or R? I got some lpsolve already working for R but not for Python.
