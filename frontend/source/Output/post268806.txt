Will find-my-iphone report a device is around when it is not? <body> I can't find my iPad.  Find-my-iphone says that is is here in the house but is not connected to the internet (so make-a-sound ps "pending").  Is this accurate or is this a false positive, i.e. the iPad ISN'T in the house and find-my-iphone is just confused?  <comment337555> If it's not connected to the internet, all it can tell you is where is was last time it was connected.
