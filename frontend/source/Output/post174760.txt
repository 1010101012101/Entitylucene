How do I run a binary program without showing the gear icon? <body> I created a automator workflow, add a codeRun Shell Script/code part and put these lines in:      /Users/xxx/Library/Android/sdk/tools/android avd   I saved it as an app and it works.  But I will always see a gear icon on the menu bar.  I tried to put a code&amp;/code or codenohup/code, if so the program won't start.  Any ideas? The codeandroid/code I'm trying to execute is a shell script  <answer174775> You will always see the gear in the menu bar if you are using Automator. If you want it to exit quickly, create a wrapper that forks off your codeandroid/code script into another process, and exits.  For example, you could run      echo "/Users/xxx/Library/Android/sdk/tools/android avd" | /usr/bin/at now   em(source for script is from this Apple Discussions page near the bottom)/em  <comment256535> Can you explain how to implement this? Ideally with an example? <comment256536> @guptron enjoy.
