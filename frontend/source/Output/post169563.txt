After Installation of Yosemite some command line tools not found! <body> I just did a clean installation of 10.10.  Now some command line tools won't work anymore. In example codegshred/code is not found anymore (always worked on Lion) and codeman gpg/code gives "No manual entry for gpg".  Has anyone an idea what the problem might be? :)  <answer169566> GPG for Mac can be found at: https://gpgtools.org/  Your problem description also means, if not using some PKI infrastructure, you lost your PGP keys...  <comment199197> Did you have installed homebrew or something like that? Did you looking to command `shred`? Not sure, but I think `gpg` is not part of OSX. <comment199199> The keys might not have been lost as they would be in your home directory <comment199200> gpg and shred are not part of OS X so how did you install them <comment199209> You are right if you made an upgrade not a fresh Yosemite installation from an USB stick with erasing the HD. :)
