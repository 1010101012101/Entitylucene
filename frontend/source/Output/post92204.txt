Mac OS X 10.8 crashes after Thunderbolt display disconnect and sleep <body> At work I run my MacBook Pro 15" Retina (with Mac OS X 10.8.3 Snow Leopard) lid-closed with two Thunderbolt displays.  If I disconnect the power and displays, walk to a conference room, and re-open the lid, everything works as expected.  If I disconnect the power and displays, drive home, and re-open the lid after about an hour, the Mac crashes. The screen and keyboard light up but are unresponsive. The only way out is a long-press of the power key.  Any ideas how to diagnose or solve this?  strongUPDATE 1/strong (per Bravado's question): There aren't any useful logs in /Library/Logs or ~/Library/Logs, but the syslog (via Console.app) contains a single interesting line amidst everything else which looks normal:  precodekernel[0]: DarkWake thermal limits breached. Going to sleep! /code/pre  strongUPDATE 2/strong: I remembered that a long time ago I had run codesudo pmset -a hibernatemode 0/code in an attempt to disable deep sleep which results in lengthy resumes. I've set it back to the default using codesudo pmset -a hibernatemode 3/code... let's see if that helps...  <answer92220> Did you look in ~/Library/Logs/CrashReporter/  if there are new entries that date from the crash?  Or look at the syslog (Utilities, Log-Viewer) if anything shows there prior to the hang?   <answer112757> As described in my update, I ran codesudo pmset -a hibernatemode 3/code to reset the sleep mode and I've had only two of those crashes in the last six months.  FWIW, running two Thunderbolt displays on a lid-closed MacBook is hell. Now that I only use one Thunderbolt display, things are generally much more reliable.  <comment108225> Good suggestions, thanks! Updating question...
