Mission Control; how do I correct the order of Desktops? I have 1, 2, 4, 5, 3, 6, 7? <body> I've been playing with Lion and Mission Control.  I'm not sure how I did it, but I seem to have reordered my desktops.  When I open Mission Control, the labels of the desktops at the top of the screen are (from left to right):  Dashboard, Desktop 1, Desktop 2, Desktop 4, Desktop 5, Desktop 3 (in the wrong place!), Desktop 6, Desktop 7, Desktop 8, Desktop 9  How did I relocate 3?  And how do I put it back in the right place?  <answer18069> By default, Spaces are reorganized by last used. You can change this in System Preferences - Mission Control.  <answer18070> What you can do is this:   Delete the desktops and then recreate the by hovering over them and pressing the red thing in the corner, then looking at the right to make a new desktop.  hr  This is no longer necessary as of Mac OS Lion 10.7.2, see this answer for an easier solution.  <answer18071> You can't drag or relocate them emeven after you disable automatic ortanization/em in System Preferences - Mission Control.  They seem to be fixed, which is weird. Let's hope that in a future update, Apple emfixes/em this issue.   <answer19058> You can change the windows displayed on the single desktops by pressing the alt key and then clicking on a desktop. So if for example you want preview (which was on desktop 3) to move to desktop 2 you would do:     Alt + Click on Desktop 3 &amp; Drag the Window of Preview and put in on   desktop 2.   Else you can also go to desktop 2 and right click on the Preview icon in the Dock and then click on: Assign to Desktop 2.  <answer27568> Starting with Mac OS Lion 10.7.2, you can drag to re-order your desktops, even the ones that are in full-screen mode.  <comment19766> Thanks, deleting by clicking on the X for "Desktop 3" did the trick. <comment31645> For future reference, [that's 10.7.2](http://www.macrumors.com/2011/10/12/apple-releases-os-x-10-7-2-with-icloud-support/). <comment31744> *Except* desktop 1. Apparently it cannot be moved nor any other desktop can be made as new number one. <comment237361> @koiyu No longer true in OSX 10.10.4.
