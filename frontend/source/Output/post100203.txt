codesign says 'no identity found' <body> I have a utility that patches the Apple remote control service so it doesn't start iTunes when pressing play.  With OS X 10.8 rcd was signed by Apple.  I found out that I could ad hoc sign the modified rcd to prevent it from crashing, but it seems that some users don't have an identity.  precode$ sudo codesign -f -s - /System/Library/CoreServices/rcd.app/Contents/MacOS/rcd /System/Library/CoreServices/rcd.app/Contents/MacOS/rcd: no identity found /code/pre  Does anyone know to generate the ad hoc identity?  Thanks!
