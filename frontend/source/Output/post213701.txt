Thunderbolt 3 compatible with Apple Thunderbolt Display <body> Is it possible to connect a Thunderbolt 3 equipped Mac (I know there isn't one at present) with the 2011 Apple Thunderbolt Display? I'm just curious. Maybe there's an adapter which works?  <answer213732> Looking at the Thunderbolt 3 FAQ, it states the following which should apply to all Thunderbolt-labeled Display Port displays.     Thunderbolt 3 ports are fully compatible with DisplayPort devices and cables.   and     Products built to Thunderbolt and Thunderbolt 2 specifications will work with Thunderbolt 3 via an adapter.   <comment258022> I also read this on the Thunderbold Intel homepage. I hope the adapter works with the Apple Thunderbolt Display also. <comment258096> Yet this is just an educated guess.
