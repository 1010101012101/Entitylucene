Standard User account not getting removed on El capitan <body> I am not able to delete user account on El capitan . The Minus (remove option ) is inactive here . I tried doing this by logging in to admin account .  Please help!!!!  <answer262125> We had a similar need to delete a local account after binding the computer to Active Directory. We accomplished this by running these commands while logged in with a network account that was granted admin.  precodesudo dscl . delete /Users/&lt;username&gt; sudo rm -rf /Users/&lt;username&gt; /code/pre  <comment262095> I assume that you 'unlocked' the settings in the preference panel... if so, and if you are trying to delete the *only account* on the machine in question, try: - add a new account, with admin privileges. - now try remove the account you want to remove. See if that works. BTW, I think you will need at least 1 account with admin powers at all times.
