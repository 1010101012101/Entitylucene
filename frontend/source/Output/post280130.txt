Digital Color Meter does not show all pixels. Is there a tool that does? <body> Digital Color Meter seems to drop pixels from the inspection window on retina displays. Here is what Digital Color Meter thinks the spotlight search icon looks like:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hasfF.png" alt="enter image description here"  However, a screen capture PNG shows a much more detailed icon (zoomed up here to match the zoom level of Digital Color Meter):  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/02pxq.png" alt="enter image description here"  The display on my macbook 13" has a native resolution of 2560x1600 but is scaled to 1440x900, so perhaps Digital Color Meter is dropping pixels to compensate for this. But I would like the meter to show actual pixels, like a screen capture shows. Is there a mode to do this? Is there an alternative tool?  emedit: this is Sierra 10.12.3/em  <comment352335> What version of macOS? <comment352468> This is on Sierra 10.12.3
