How can Apple Script open a shell script with options in a Terminal window? <body> Iâ€™m trying to use Apple Script to execute a shell script file in a new Terminal window, while sending it options. How do I do that?  It seems as if Terminal only interprets the path to the script, and ignores what comes next.  I'd like to use something like that:  precodedo shell script "/Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app/Contents/MacOS/Terminal " &amp; pathToScript &amp; " -option" /code/pre  The script runs but it doesn't get code-option/code.  Note: I need a Terminal window for user interaction. Running the script directly executes it in the background.  <answer157125> The following AppleScript works for me:  precodetell application "Terminal"     do script "~/testscript" &amp; " -arg1" &amp; " -arg2" end tell /code/pre
