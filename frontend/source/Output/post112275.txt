How to access a newly mounted DMG from VMWare Fusion (Windows 8.1)? <body> I'm running Windows 8.1 on VMWare Fusion, on top of OS X 10.8.5.  I have some DMG files on Mac that I mount sometimes to work with. These are some encrypted data folders.  Can I access them from the virtual machine when I mount them?  Example: VM is running, Windows is running inside. Then I go to MacOS and mount a DMG. Next moment, a new drive (or folder) appears in Windows... without needing to restart the virtual machine.  Is this scenario possible?  <answer112309> I don't think this is possible without some special software in the windows vm. The dmg  is analogous to the windows .exe.  In the same way a Mac can not run an .exe, a windows box can not open a dmg.  That being said a software solution like transmac installed in the vm may offer the functionality you seek.   No personal experience with transmac myself.   http://www.acutesystems.com/scrtm.htm  Trasmac features:  -Open Mac format disk drives, flash drives, CD/DVD/Blu-ray media, high density diskettes, dmg and sparseimage files.  -Copy files to Mac disks and dmg images.  -Format for Mac and restore disks and flash drives.  -Create, compress and expand (convert to iso) dmg files.  -Built in burner functionality to burn ISO and dmg files directly to CD/DVD/Blu-Ray.  -Read Mac multisession and hybrid CDs.  Good luck.   <answer128754> Can't you just share a folder on the mounted DMG through the Fusion folder sharing facility?  It would appear under the Z: somewhere I believe inside the Windows VM.  <comment132004> No no no no no that's not what I want. I want to go to Mac, and mount a DMG. So now Mac has one more "disc", i.e. virtual disc, mounted on the system. Just like when I plug in a USB hard drive, only this drive is virtual. Okay? So now Mac has one more drive. Then I open the VMWare window, in which Windows 8.1 is running all the time. I want that virtual Windows to recognize that host OS has one more drive, as if I plugged a drive into Windows. Am I explaining this in a good way? <comment132217> As I said in my original reply, a windows o/s, virtual or otherwise can not natively mount/open a .dmg.  The software I posted is installed on the windows o/s.  With it you 'can' then mount/open .dmg's.  I just downloaded and installed the transmit software and it works as advertised. <comment132282> DMG gets mounted in OS X, not Windows. Windows should only be informed (by the virtual machine) that new hard drive is connected to the system. OS X accesses the DMG, and Windows sees this DMG as a simple new hard drive. Virtual machine (VMWare) translates interactions between virtual Windows and physical DMG. To illustrate this, here's an example: within virtual machine Windows can easily read and write to Mac's file system, without any additional software - because virtrual machine translates all interacions. I want the same with newly mounted DMGs. <comment132325> Just because you think windows "should" be informed about the DMG does not mean it works that way.  Apple disk images (dmg) is a proprietary format.  No matter how many ways you state your case it will not change the fact that a windows o/s (virtual or otherwise) can not natively 'see' a DMG file.  You can read more about the Apple Disk Image format on wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Disk_Image. <comment132364> OK. Let's go step by step. How does my Windows natively "see" propriatery HFS+ filesystem? <comment150820> Can you add some more detailed descriptions on how to do this? This would help other users not so familiar with the concept to implement the solution you are proposing <comment150962> Right now I'm out of virtual machines on my system, but when I copy one back I'll definitely try this scenario.
