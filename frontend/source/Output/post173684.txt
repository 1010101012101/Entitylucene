MacPro OS install kernel panic <body> Something happened(crashing and graphic issues) to my MacPro(3.1) and so I decided to reinstall the OS with the factory discs. When I try to boot off the discs I get the following error.  precodepanic(cpu 0 caller 0x00431DA3): "Unable to find driver for this platform: \"ACPI\".\n"@/SourceCache/xnu/xnu-1228.4.20/iokit/Kernel/IOPlatformExpert.cpp:1407 Debugger called: &lt;panic&gt; Backtrace, Format - Frame : Return Address (4 potential args on stack)  ...

It seems like the recovery dvd should be able have the driver for this system shouldn't it?  Any ideas?  <comment204339> are you trying to install older os x over a newer one ? <comment204340> I would try the Internet recovery. <comment204412> 3,1 can't do Internet Recovery, nor can it boot from USB, it's DVD or another, ready-prepped HD only. There's a possibility the original DVD drive is past its sell-by date [mine was] so it's either a PATA replacement [£100] or an SATA in its place [£15] & learn how to plumb it into the 'spare' SATA ports under where the main fans are; or make a boot HD on another machine.
