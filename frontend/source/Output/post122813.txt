Adding comments to /etc/launchd.conf <body> Since I migrate to Maverick, I cannot add comments anymore to entries in code/etc/launchd.conf/code, like:  precode# setenv VAR VALUE /code/pre  Is there a new format for adding comments there ?  When I restart launchctl with:  precodesudo launchctl &lt; /etc/launchd.conf /code/pre  I get this message for each comment in the file:  precodelaunchctl: unknown subcommand "#" /code/pre
