Paintbrush cuts off clipboard image from screenshot <body> When taking a screenshot to the clipboard using kbdCmd/kbd + kbdCtrl/kbd + kbdShift/kbd + kbd4/kbd you can add a portion of the screen to the clipboard.  However, when pasting into Paintbrush with kbdCmd/kbd + kbdV/kbd, it crops randomly and can't be moved down.  img src="https://giant.gfycat.com/WideUnrealisticAntarcticfurseal.gif" alt="screenshot"  MacOS: 10.10.5 Paintbrush: 2.1.1  Does it have to do with the retina display?  <comment246181> Sounds like a problem with Paintbrush. You can trash it's Saved Application State, in your User Library ... and move its Preference File to desktop or trash.
