Unable to remove space from OS X Yosemite (10.10) account name <body> I had been using a username ("Name (new)") with a space in it for two years without incident. However, for certain applications (QGIS), this space appears to be causing me problems and I've been advised to change it (https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/231731/qgis-saga-cross-tabulation-error).    After making a Time Machine backup, I'm now attempting to make the change to an account name with no space in it.  I've attempted to follow the instructions here: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201548.  Step six of these instructions states,     When modifying the account name (short name) or home folder name, it   should not contain any spaces. If the current account name already   contains a space, you won't be able to edit this field until the space   has been removed. Click immediately after the space, or use the left   arrow key to move the text insertion point immediately after the   space, then press the Delete key to remove the space.   However, when I attempt to delete the space I get the no  sound and am unable to do it. I have tried searching for other resolutions of this issue but haven't found anyone with the same problem.    Any ideas on how I go about removing the space from the account name?
