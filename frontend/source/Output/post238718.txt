Can't change resolution on MacBook Pro running Windows 10 Boot Camp <body> I've been running  Windows 10 via Boot Camp on a MacBook Pro 2015 for several months. After a period of inactivity, and a corresponding backlog of updates, I can't change the screen resolution. It's stuck on the highest resolution, 2880 by 1800 pixels (Retina), and the Windows control panel settings are disabled. Is there a remedy?  <answer238719> Yes.
