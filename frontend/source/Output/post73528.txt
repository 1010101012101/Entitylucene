Dictate and speak/read text from Terminal <body> I have an idea in mind for a Terminal command I run often. I haven't found answers to these on my own, and they all have to do with voice/dictation:  hr  strongDictation in Terminal/strong  Can I dictate to the Terminal? I've tried the standard kbdFn/kbd-kbdFn/kbd, but it only plays the sound effect that it makes when you've cancelled it. No microphone bubble appears either. Is it not possible to do this? I notice that in the Edit menu of Terminal, I find that Start Dictation is not greyed out; it's still an option.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8Gh0L.png" alt="Terminal &gt; Edit &gt; Start Dictation (fn fn)"  I am empositive/em that Dictation is setup correctly, it works great system-wide.  strongReading output from Terminal/strong  Can I get the output of one Terminal window and have it read to me by the system (via AppleScript)?  I am essentially trying to reproduce this behavior strongwith continuous output/strong (I want every line that follows the first to be read):  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZB9cF.png" alt="Ctrl-click, Speech, Start Speaking"  <answer73551> You can assign a custom shortcut for toggling speech in System Preferences:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6l9X6.png" alt=""  There's probably a better way to do this with VoiceOver, but this would speak lines as they are added.  precodeset spoken to "" repeat     tell application "Terminal"         set c to contents of window 1     end tell     repeat while c ends with linefeed         set c to text 1 thru -2 of c     end repeat     set tospeak to c     if tospeak starts with spoken then         set tospeak to text (count spoken) thru -1 of tospeak     end if     say tospeak     set spoken to c     delay 1 end repeat /code/pre  <answer73555> codesay/code. You can download different voices in Mountain Lion (not sure about older versions) and can be looked up from System Preferences  precodeUsage: say [-v voice] [-o out] [-f in | message] /code/pre  You can use codecommand | say/code to stream output of the command once its completed.  The famous Vicki voice from Portal.  precodesay -v Vicki Do not adjust your screen. You will be assimilated. The process is quick and painless, stand by /code/pre  <comment86011> Thank you! May I ask (being new to AppleScript): could you explain the "set c to text 1 thru -2 of c" and "set tospeak to text (count spoken) thru -1 of tospeak"? (especially thru) One more question: if the contents of the Terminal window have text above and below that I don't want, can I grab the middle portion and have it spoken? I've looked at trim_line(), but it doesn't seem to be what I'm looking for... <comment86012> also, this script just repeats the same thing, even if I haven't changed anything...? I'm using emacs in Terminal, if that helps. <comment86036> @EthanLee I wasn't sure what you meant with continuous output, but the script is supposed to speak only new text in a normal shell session. `text 1 thru -2` just removes the last character. <comment86267> Typing `fn fn` in Terminal starts Dictation for me so it "should" work. Are you sure it's working in general the moment you want to use it in Terminal?
