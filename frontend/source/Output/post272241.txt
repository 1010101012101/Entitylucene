Neither my Bose or Apple iHome docking stations are playing my iPad music <body> I have used my Bose and iHome docking stations to listen to my music, now neither work. I have cleaned every plug and port with canned air. My music still plays through the iPad speakers. Do you know what it may be?  <comment342178> Welcome to Ask Different.
