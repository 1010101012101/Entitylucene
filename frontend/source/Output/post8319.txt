Where are Apple's default desktop images stored? <body> When I go to System Preferences  Desktop &amp; Screen Saver, I see many images in folders such as "Desktop Pictures", "Nature", "Plants", etc. Where are these images located?  I want to use them in an application such as SpaceSuit to set them as background images for different spaces.  <answer8321> They're in code/Library/Desktop Pictures//code
