To make substitles for audio in OSX <body> I have many recordings where I want English subtitles. However, those subtitles do not exist.  So it would be great to have some application which could pick up some words and make a raw subtitle.  strongIs there any good software to make subtitles from recordings in OSX?/strong  <answer120269> Video Lan Client can play just about every format of subtitle that's out there.  <comment140305> Sorry, I made my question clearer. I want to make subtitles from recordings which do not have subtitles.
