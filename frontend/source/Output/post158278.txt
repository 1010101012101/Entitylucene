importing .vpl files (vpn tunnels) on mac <body> Is there any way I can import a .vpl file? This is the only way of connecting I have and for now I can only do it on Windows (with FortiClient 4.x.x) because 5 doesn't support importing .vpl anymore.  <answer158295> You can use the "FortiClientTools" application in Windows to import your code.vpl/code configuration file. From there, you can export the configuration file to a newer type (4.3/5.0) that can be imported into newer versions of FortiClient. Exported config files that are encrypted will likely have a filename extension of code.sconn/code; unencrypted config files should be appended with code.conn/code.  If you need to import those config files into the newest version (5.2) of FortiClient, you can change the filename extension from code.sconn/code or code.conn/code to the newer format (code.sconf/code; code.conf/code). Once the extension has been changed, you can import that config file under the FortiClient menu - Preferences - General - Restore.
