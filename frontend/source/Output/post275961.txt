Delete Purgeable disk space <body> Is it still the case that Purgeable part is not under our control (to be deleted)? There are several posts (e.g., How do I clear the purgeable area on my disk?) on this, but no solution as it seems.  <comment347260> Also see [What does Purgeable means in Storage under About This Mac section?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/252217/37797) <comment347266> You can't delete purgeable space.  The system will take care of it so you don't need to worry about it.
