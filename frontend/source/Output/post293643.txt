Two entries for Google Chrome in Notifications preferences <body> In System Preferences  Notifications, there are two entries for Google Chrome, and they have different settings.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HzOoy.png" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/IJi8D.png" alt="enter image description here"  I can obviously change them both to what I want, but why is this happening and how can I get rid of the extra one?  <answer293645> strongThe new answer/strong  The reason why you see two notification sections in System preferences is because one is for calendar (That is the one with the banner) and one regular notifications (the one that controls website notifications   hr  strongThe old answer/strong The reason why this answer is not right in your cause is because this is for Chrome's settings  If you have multiple accounts on your Google Chrome browser, you can change the notifications for both accounts. If you want to get rid of a Google Chrome notification panel, simply get rid of the account that you are not using anymore. The reason why they have different settings is that the primary account will show up different then your other accounts.       <comment370583> The "People" menu only shows one account. Could the other notification panel be for the built-in "Guest" account? <comment370584> Is there any way to tell which setting is for which account? <comment370585> Oh wait, that is the wrong notification panel. Let me edit my answer real quick <comment370586> The answer I gave was what you see in Google Chrome.
