Sticky keyboard after spill <body> So, I spilled some vodka/tonic on my laptop during a flight the other day.  Luckily enough the machine still works but some of the keys are very sticky now, seems to be getting worse with time.  I would like to get the machine professionally cleaned now. What are my options?  If location is relevant, I am in London, UK.  Any ideas on cost would be appreciated also.  <comment211955> Have you tried asking around your local computer shops? Try Googling **independent apple repair london**, there a number of places to try and I'm sure someone would be able to help at rates cheaper than Apple. <comment211962> Yes, I have had a search around, but it's the kind of business where everybody says they can do it. I'm looking for endorsements on good places to go. I'm not necessarily seeking the lowest cost as this is a one off. What I do need is the laptop reverted to pre-spill state. <comment212009> How many keys are affected? If you can be bothered you could probably sort this yourself. Chances are high that the sticking keys have sugary remnants in the scissor mechanisms immediately below the keys. These are easy to remove and clean once the key cap has been popped off and should work as normal afterwards... <comment212025> Use pure Vodka and clean it to remove the sticky Tonic.
