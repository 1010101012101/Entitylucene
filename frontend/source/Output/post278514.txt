Copy Selected Text, Paste on Google Translate App (Fluid App) and Translate It with Automater/Service <body> I have a Google Translate app created with Fluid App. I want to strongtranslate/strong emany selected/em text with this strongmy Google Translate Fluid App/strong.   So, for this purpose how do I create a service with Automator/AppleScript?  <answer278797> Here is the AppleScript code I use in a Run AppleScript action, in an Automator Service workflow in conjunction with my Google Translate Fluid App, which is named Google Translate.  Create an Automator Service workflow with the settings as shown in the image below, while replacing the default AppleScript code with the AppleScript code found below the Automator image. Note that I saved it as Translate with Google Translate and this is what shows on the Services menu and context menu when I have selected text that I want to translate.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/eRNva.png" alt="Automator Service workflow"  hr  AppleScript Code:  precodeon run {input, parameters}      set textToTranslate to item 1 of input as string     set windowName to "Google Translate"     set targetURL to "https://translate.google.com/"      tell current application         do shell script "open -a " &amp; quoted form of windowName     end tell      tell application "Google Translate"         repeat while (loading) of front browser window             delay 0.5         end repeat         if (get title of front window) does not contain windowName then             open location targetURL             repeat while (loading) of front browser window                 delay 0.5             end repeat         end if         tell front browser window             activate             try                 do JavaScript "document.getElementById('source').value = \"" &amp; textToTranslate &amp; "\";"             on error                 set the clipboard to textToTranslate as string                 delay 1                 activate                 do JavaScript "document.getElementById('source').value = ''; document.getElementById('source').focus();"                 tell application "System Events"                     keystroke "v" using command down                 end tell             end try         end tell     end tell  end run /code/pre  hr  Note: My Translate with Google Translate Automator Service tries to use JavaScript to change the value of the source text area, as this is IMO a better method then literally programmatically pasting the text to translate to the source text area, however if it can't, it then copies the selected text to the clipboard and then pastes it to the source text area. Before pasting, via programmatically pressing âŒ˜V, JavaScript is used to both clear the source text area and set focus to it, so the paste will occur as intended in the right location.  The use of codedo shell script "open -a " .../code is necessary because a Fluid App with default Preferences, one created with Fluid, by default when opened from the macOS UI shows its Home Page. However, when programmatically opened via AppleScript, example case, codetell application "Google Translate" to activate/code, only the Dock Tile appears, no codebrowser window/code, i.e. no Home Page is displayed. This is in part why I originally coded it the way I did. However, since your comment, I found out that if I programmatically opened via AppleScript using codedo shell script "open -a " .../code, it opens with a browser window, not just the Dock Tile and as such was able to recode the Service differently because the use of codedo shell script "open -a " .../code also would bring a minimize window back up without the need to account for that with additional coding.  Hopefully the new code will eliminate two Google Translate tabs from appearing when starting from a closed state. em(Although depending on timings, it may occasionally happen.)/em  <comment350915> Thank you alot. :) It's working. But I'm using this Google Translate Fluid App on the MacOS' status bar and if I call this service it's opening on new tab at fluid app ([this is screencast](https://cl.ly/jt8O)). Is there anyway to open Google Translate on current window/tab? <comment350988> @fatihturan, I have recoded the Service to hopefully address the double tab issue. Please use the new code and read the additional information presented in the last two paragraphs of my answer. <comment351077> It doesn't changed the behaviour of Fluid App; so it's still opening new tab instead current one. But I fixed this issue with [this settings](https://cl.ly/jufX).
