Can't find file saved in Propellerhead Reason 8 <body> I made a song in Propellerhead Reason 8 and I named the file ".cubicle..reason" but now I can't find the file. I was wondering how I could use terminal to locate the aforementioned file.   <answer163452> Files that begin in a code./code are invisible to Finder. If you go to the directory in terminal and enter codels -a/code it will show the invisible files.   You can do codemv .cubicle..reason cubicle..reason/code which will change the name and make the file visible.   To view hidden files in Finder see: How to show hidden files and folders in finder?
