MIcrosoft Outlook stopped working on Yosemite <body> I ran Outlook for a day after updating to Yosemite, but after a reboot, it no longer works.  When I click on the Outlook icon, it bounces a few times but never runs. Looking in system.log (via Console.app), it complains about a call to gestaltSystemVersion from both Outlook and Microsoft Database Daemon. (see below)  I rebooted again, and I reinstalled Office for Mac 2011. My Outlook is version 14.4.5. I've found very little regarding this error searching Google, and most of it is from the beta stage for Yosemite.  Has anyone else seen this, or better, solved it?  precodeNov 4 08:42:15 JLGPB Microsoft Outlook[1664]: objc[1664]: Class OnClickLinkAction is implemented in both /Applications/Microsoft Office 2011/Office/OutlookLegacy.framework/Versions/14/OutlookLegacy and /Applications/Microsoft Office 2011/Microsoft Outlook.app/Contents/MacOS/Microsoft Outlook.

I found some suggestions that the best solution was to rebuild the identity, so that's what I did:  ol ligo to ~/Documents/Microsoft User Data/li limake a "backup folder"/li lidrag the contents of ~/Documents/Microsoft User Data/Office 2011 Identities into the backup folder/li lirelaunch Outlook and configure as if it's a fresh install./li /ol  This has things working again.   <answer154713> Without more clues its hard to give specific advice, but this is what I would try.  h2Clear out the Saved Application State/h2  Look for Outlook's saved application state folder within your account. You should find it at code/Users/YOURUSERNAME/Library/Saved Application State/com.microsoft.Outlook.savedState/code. Just rename or delete the folder. Then launch Outlook to see if it opens successfully.  h2Hide your Outlook Identities folder/h2  Rename the code/Users/YOURUSERNAME/Documents/Microsoft User Data/Office 2011 Identities' folder to something like/codeOffice 2011 Identities Old`, and try Outlook again.  h2Hide Outlook's preference list files/h2  Within code/Users/YOURUSERNAME/Library/Preferences/code you should find four Outlook plist files.  precodecom.microsoft.outlook.database_daemon.plist com.microsoft.outlook.databasedaemon.plist com.microsoft.outlook.office_reminders.plist com.microsoft.Outlook.plist /code/pre  Rename them or drag them to another location temporarily, and try Outlook again.  There are also Outlook plist files in code/Library/Preferences//code. On my Mac they are blank, if they have content on your Mac you might want to try renaming or moving them temporarily and trying again.  h2Hide Office's Cache folder/h2  Temporarily rename the code/Users/YOURUSERNAME/Library/Caches/com.microsoft.Outlook/code folder something like codecom.microsoft.Outlook.old/code and try Outlook again.  h2Hide the Office Application Support folder/h2  Similarly temporarily rename the code/Users/YOURUSERNAME/Library/Application Support/Microsoft/Office/code and try again.  h2Still not working?/h2  Try running codesudo opensnoop | grep Outlook/code in a Terminal window and see if you can work out which files Outlook accesses before giving up and closing.  <answer180682> I had the same problem and the best action in order to get again my Outlook operative was:  ul ligo to code~/Documents/Microsoft User Data/code/li limake a "backup folder" (just in case)/li lidrag the contents of code~/Documents/Microsoft User Data/Office 2011 Identities/code into the backup folder/li lirelaunch Outlook and configure as if it's a fresh install./li lishut outlook before it keeps on downloading all server(s) messages/li licompletely erase (even from the Trash bin) all messages directly from the server(s). Close server once it is empty./li lirelaunch outlook. It stops closing, and works fine in spite of heavy use I give to it on a daily manner./li /ul  I can then confirm that ONE email message awaiting in the server to be downloaded to  outlook  was corrupt (or something) making  outlook crash again and Again every time I relaunched it. I had had the problem almost two days and every other solution I tried was useless; it all started with a problem with the Microsoft Daemon Database close message to a general Microsoft Outlook has found a problem and will close message.  <answer189934> https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2360509  Microsoft suggests rebuilding the Identities database to attempt to correct this.  Navigate in finder  Home  Documents  Microsoft User Data  Office 2011 identities   A quick summary of the link above:  ul liQuit all applications/li liDetermine the amount of space available on the hard disk - you will need 3x the size of the Identities folder in free space on your disk/li liBackup up the Identities folder somewhere /li liHold down the Option key while starting Outlook and in the Database Utility window that appears, select the database that you want to maintain, and then click Rebuild./li liMake a cup of tea while the database is rebuilt/li liOnce the Utility has announced "Done" launch Outlook as normal/li /ul  <comment182002> I don't think those errors are the cause of your crashes. I get them with Outlook running Yosemite and my Outlook operates fine. They are just warnings to developers to update their code. <comment182021> As noted in http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/154712/47159 I basically took your second step and that worked, so can't really do the rest. But these may help the next person who comes along. <comment222243> i love you mannnn 3 <comment225394> While the linked page may answer the question, we prefer answers which include the relevant parts directly in the answer to avoid problems if the link breaks in the future. <comment225549> OK good point  - will do :)
