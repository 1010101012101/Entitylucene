Keyboard shortcuts for dynamic menu items (Keynote) <body> I often find myself creating Keynote presentations with lots of extra slides.  I then go through and skip a bunch for a particular class.  To make this slide choice easier, I added a keyboard shortcut for the "Skip Slide" and "Don't Skip Slide" menu commands.  Unfortunately, they don't work consistently.  In fact, it only seems that one at a time will work, which I think is a function of the fact that the menu item changes based on whether the selected slide is set to be skipped or not.  If a slide is selected that is hidden, the "Slide" menu will show "Don't Hide Slide."  If I look at the menu by clicking "Slide," then the "Don't Hide Slide" keyboard shortcut will work.  But, then if I select a slide is that is not hidden, the "Hide Slide" keyboard shortcut won't work.  I can get it to work by opening the "Slide" menu (where I can verify that it shows "Hide Slide" and my keyboard shortcut).  But, after that, the "Don't Hide Slide" keyboard shortcut stops working.    My question then: How do I get to use a keyboard shortcut for a menu item that is not in the menu at a particular time?  <answer45004> This doesn't solve the general case problem of how to assign a keyboard shortcut for any dynamic menu item, but it strongemdoes/em/strong solve the specific problem of having a keyboard shortcut to hide or display slides in Keynote.  We can work around the shortcut problem because Keynote is AppleScriptable.  Create a new strongservice/strong in strongAutomator/strong.  The service takes strongno input/strong in strongKeynote.app/strong.  The service has a single action: strongDo AppleScript/strong. The script (in all its one-line beauty) is:  precodetell application "Keynote" to tell current slide of the front slideshow to set skipped to not skipped /code/pre  Save the service as "ToggleSkipped".  Use the strongKeyboard Shortcuts/strong tab within the strongKeyboard/strong pane of strongSystem Preferences/strong to bind the service to an unused keystroke.  <comment43098> Did you find a solution? I am looking at a similar issue of how to create a Keynote presentation that is a subset of a larger possible set of keynote presentation. <comment43209> @JimMcKeeth, no solution yet.  Still bugs me every day. <comment44552> Would a macro be an acceptable solution? <comment44556> @TimothyMueller-Harder, Yes.  Anything that keeps me from "right-click Skip slide, Right-click Show slide" would be acceptable. <comment45336> Do you happen to have Keyboard Maestro?
