IntelliJ / Android Studios: hide the project pane <body> I'm quite new to mac but have managed to figure out a lot of the shortcuts but this one baffles me.  In intelliJ / Android Studios, occassionally, I need to hide some of the panes so that I have more space to see my code. The shortcut to hide the project pane on the left side of the screen when I hover over it has the following shortcut displayed:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/CygAL.png" alt="enter image description here"  I can see a shift there, but the circle with the arrow is nowhere to be found on my keyboard. Also, the click with the Alt button makes no sense as a normal click will hide the project pane in any case.  Where is the arrow out of the circle button on my macbook pro?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/JHiUh.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer226523> That is the Escape (kbdesc/kbd / kbd⎋/kbd) key.  You can find more explanations for Mac Keyboard Symbols here.  The click with kbdoption/kbd/kbdalt/kbd/kbd⌥/kbd function exists to hide the entire sidebar. The sidebar can contain multiple panes, such as the Favorites pane. Without holding kbdoption/kbd/kbdalt/kbd/kbd⌥/kbd, it will hide only the Project pane and expand any other pane in the sidebar (if none, it will hide the sidebar).
