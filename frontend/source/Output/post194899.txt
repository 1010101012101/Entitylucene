Why won't Iphones reply to sms texts sent from yahoo messenger? <body> I can send my friends SMS texts through Yahoo Messenger but one recently changed to an iPhone and her replies won't come through. Why does it work with Androids but not iPhones?  <comment232593> Do you actually send SMS (in the sense of a message sent/received via a phone number, not over the internet), meaning you receive them in your messages app or are they sent over the internet (are you receiving them in the messenger app)? <comment232685> https://messenger.yahoo.com/features/sms/ <comment232898> With Yahoo messenger you can enter your friends phone #, along with other info, the go to "Actions" and choose send SMS message. After choosing the contact you type your text and send. She is getting my texts but I'm not getting her replies. Because no phone is involved they have to save a text you send them and they can send you texts, which Yahoo alerts me about. After changing her phone from a Droid to iPhone she still gets the ones I send but her replies do not come to me. I hope that helps clear things up. In short I'm able to send/rec text over the app on my PC not a phone. <comment242794> It's not just IPhone. I suddenly - since the middle of June 2015 - don't receive SMS text from an Android phone I have texted using Yahoo Messenger with for years.
