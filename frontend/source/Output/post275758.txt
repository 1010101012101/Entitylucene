Automounting nfs share fails with err=2, RPC: Timed out <body> I want to automount a nfs share whenever a user logs in to our Mac Minis. My original idea was to use the remote share as the place for the user's home directories, but due to being not able to mount the share, I'm just trying to get it mounted to an unrelated directory via autofs first.  My code/etc/auto_master/code looks like this:  precode+auto_master /net              -hosts -nobrowse,hidefromfinder,nosuid /home             auto_home -nobrowse,hidefromfinder /Network/Servers  -fstab /-                -static /-                auto_nfs -nobrowse,nosuid /code/pre  My code/etc/auto_nfs/code:  precode/home_tmp -fstype=nfs,vers=3,rw,resvport,tcp,soft,intr,rsize=8192,wsize=8192,noatime,timeo=900,retrans=3 192.168.0.2:/home_tmp  /code/pre  The remote machine is running 4.9.11-1-ARCH x86_64 GNU/Linux and it's code/etc/exports/code looks like  precode/home_tmp -nohide,sync,rw 192.168.0.0/26 /code/pre  and the share is also visible from the client:  precode$ showmount -e 192.168.0.2 Exports list on 192.168.0.2: /home_tmp                           192.168.0.0/26 /code/pre  The machine trying to mount the nfs share is within the 192.168.0.0/26 subnet.  When I do a codesudo mount -t nfs -o resvport,rw 192.168.0.2:/home_tmp /home_tmp/code, I can change into code/home_tmp/code and see it's content. But when I try to change into this directory with automount, I get:  precode$ cd /home_tmp -bash: cd: /home_tmp: No such file or directory /code/pre  The system log shows:  precodeautomountd: MOUNT  REQUEST: name=/home_tmp [] map=auto_nfs opts=nobrowse,nosuid path=/home_tmp direct=1 automountd:   PUSH /etc/auto_nfs automountd:   POP /etc/auto_nfs automountd:   mapline:  -fstype=nfs,vers=3,rw,resvport,tcp,soft,intr,rsize=8192,wsize=8192,noatime,timeo=900,retrans=3 192.168.0.2:/home_tmp automountd:   do_mount1: automountd:   (nfs,nfs)   /home_tmp -vers=3,rw,resvport,tcp,soft,intr,rsize=8192,wsize=8192,noatime,timeo=900,retrans=3 automountd:               192.168.0.2:/home_tmp      penalty=0 automountd:   nfsmount: input: automountd:       192.168.0.2[other] automountd:       nfsmount: mount on /home_tmp vers=3,rw,resvport,tcp,soft,intr,rsize=8192,wsize=8192,noatime,timeo=900,retrans=3: automountd:         192.168.0.2:/home_tmp automountd:       ping: 192.168.0.2 request vers=3 min=3 automountd: pingnfs: 192.168.0.2: RPC: Timed out automountd:       pingnfs FAIL: can't get nfs version automountd: NFS server 192.168.0.2 not responding automountd:       Couldn't mount 192.168.0.2:/home_tmp, err=2 automountd: MOUNT  REPLY  : status=2, AUTOFS_DONE automountd: mount of /home_tmp failed: No such file or directory automountd: MOUNT  REQUEST: name=/home_tmp [] map=auto_nfs opts=nobrowse,nosuid path=/home_tmp direct=1 automountd:   PUSH /etc/auto_nfs automountd:   POP /etc/auto_nfs automountd:   mapline:  -fstype=nfs,vers=3,rw,resvport,tcp,soft,intr,rsize=8192,wsize=8192,noatime,timeo=900,retrans=3 192.168.0.2:/home_tmp automountd:   do_mount1: automountd:   (nfs,nfs)   /home_tmp -vers=3,rw,resvport,tcp,soft,intr,rsize=8192,wsize=8192,noatime,timeo=900,retrans=3 automountd:               192.168.0.2:/home_tmp      penalty=0 automountd:   nfsmount: input: automountd:       192.168.0.2[other] automountd:       nfsmount: mount on /home_tmp vers=3,rw,resvport,tcp,soft,intr,rsize=8192,wsize=8192,noatime,timeo=900,retrans=3: automountd:         192.168.0.2:/home_tmp automountd:       Couldn't mount 192.168.0.2:/home_tmp, err=2 automountd: MOUNT  REPLY  : status=2, AUTOFS_DONE automountd: automountd exited /code/pre  I read somewhere that this emRPC: Timed out/em error can be caused by the nfs-server being started before some other service, so I restarted the nfs-server, but without effect. Any advice welcome to solve this...  <answer275910> Your Arch Linux distribution probably contains an NFSv4 server. The NFSv4 server requires a base directory (e.g. /srv/nfs4).  Any additional share has to be a subdirectory (e.g. /srv/nfs4/home_tmp). So move the server-side /home_tmp to the base directory.  The file /etc/exports looks like this then:  precode/srv/nfsv4 192.168.0.0/26(rw,fsid=0,insecure,no_subtree_check,async) /srv/nfsv4/home_tmp 192.168.0.0/26(rw,nohide,insecure,no_subtree_check,async) /code/pre  (only tested with emasync/em but should also work with emsync/em)  Reload the file with codeexportfs -arv/code on the server.  Your client-side file /etc/auto_nfs has to be changed also:  precode/home_tmp -fstype=nfs,vers=3,rw,resvport,tcp,soft,intr,rsize=8192,wsize=8192,noatime,timeo=900,retrans=3 192.168.0.2:/srv/nfsv4/home_tmp /code/pre  Finally enter codesudo automount -vc/code in the client's shell to "refresh" the mounted share.  hr  To set up networked home directories for OS X users some directory integration is required or at least recommended (e.g. LDAP or AD). For Linux servers I've found a pretty old how-to:  Automount OS X Home Directories Using OpenLDAP and Linux. I don't know if the approach still works well with newer macOS versions. An updated how-to would require a new question here or at Server Fault.   <answer276166> Turns out that this is a simple firewall issue. Fravadona's answer pointed me into the right direction. The IT department didn't know which port to open (111 was already open) and didn't have time to dig into it at the moment, so they extensively opened ports. They told me they will change firewalls in the near future and will have a detailed look when they are finished. I hope to remember to update the post here.  <comment347057> Please add the server system (e.g. Ubuntu 16.04.2 LTS Server 64bit) <comment347063> @klanomath I added the server's OS. Should this question better be on serverfault? <comment347129> The question fits in here. <comment347496> Thanks for this detailed answer, but it is not related to the NFS version, as I can mount the folder when I run the mount command manually. So the server side is fine. <comment347520> @PVitt You are right - I somehow missed the *pingnfs FAIL* in your system log excerpt...
