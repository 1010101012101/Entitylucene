Number pad does not work in vim and less <body> I am working from an iMac running Yosemite and using this keyboard.  The number pad works in the terminal, but when I open codevim/code or codeless/code it does not.  For example using codeless/code, if I type for the number code8/code, I get codeESCOx/code, not an code8/code.  In vim 7.2 (in command mode), it inserts an codex/code.  How do I fix this behavior? I got this keyboard specifically for the number pad.  <answer201341> If you are using Terminal (not iTerm or others), there is a setting that might help. Turn off this setting (sorry, it's in german. But the location should be the same):  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/UDFvL.png" alt="Sorry for the german screenshot"  If you are using codeiTerm/code, there is at least a fix for codevim/code: You can remap the keys to get this to work. Just add the following lines to your code~/.vimrc/code (Create it, if it doesn't exist.)  precodeinoremap &lt;Esc&gt;Oq 1 inoremap &lt;Esc&gt;Or 2 inoremap &lt;Esc&gt;Os 3 inoremap &lt;Esc&gt;Ot 4 inoremap &lt;Esc&gt;Ou 5 inoremap &lt;Esc&gt;Ov 6 inoremap &lt;Esc&gt;Ow 7 inoremap &lt;Esc&gt;Ox 8 inoremap &lt;Esc&gt;Oy 9 inoremap &lt;Esc&gt;Op 0 inoremap &lt;Esc&gt;On . inoremap &lt;Esc&gt;OQ / inoremap &lt;Esc&gt;OR * inoremap &lt;Esc&gt;Ol + inoremap &lt;Esc&gt;OS - inoremap &lt;Esc&gt;OM &lt;Enter&gt; /code/pre  Source: a comment in the vim wiki.  <answer215487> If you're using iTerm and I correctly understood your question, in iTerm2 there is an appropriate preference:  http://www.twistermc.com/39930/use-number-pad-vim-iterm2/  <comment242688> As far as I know, that's a special "feature" of vim. It also happens on Linux too. <comment242694> This definitely solves the pain.  Evidently this is also answered [here](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/6613968) <comment242698> Glad it helped.. <comment341979> Perfect. Thanks! <comment370510> Something new in Terminal Preferences (Terminal 2.7.3, Sierra) next to that checkbox is a message indicating that Num Lock (which is mapped from Keypad Clear by default) can be used to enter digits while application mode is active.
