Why does my MacBook only connect to bluetooth headset when it's just been turned on? <body> I run 10.10.4 on an Macbook Pro 9,2. When my bluetooth headphones are on and I try to connect with them, nothing happens. I then need to turn off the headphones and turn them on again, at which point they automatically connect (provided the two devices have been paired). When i codeDisconnect/code the device and then try to reconnect, nothing happens. Why is this so? Why is there a codeConnect/code option for each paired device if it does not work? Can the problem be at the headphone's end?  <comment252298> I would guess that it is on the headphone's side. Do the headphones work normally on other devices? Do other bluetooth devices show the same behavior when paired to your MBP? <comment252303> I need to try with other bt devices, but I experience the same with my iPod touch and the headphones so you may be right. <comment252323> Do they pair if you turn restart the bluetooth on your MBP? Might be a workaround to make an automator service doing so.
