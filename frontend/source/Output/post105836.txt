GIF super slow on Quick Look <body> Mountain Lion got animated GIF support for Quick Look, but the animations show as slowmotion. It renders very slow even if the GIF has a fast frame rate. Is there any way to improve this or replace the Quick Look functionality with something that works better?  <answer115197> OS X Mavericks, somehow, solves this issue.  <comment124434> With which mac do you get this kind of behavior ? <comment124435> Any. I have used 13 and 15 MacBook Pro (different models), also MacBook Pro Retinas and my own MacBook Air 13 (this year's model). <comment124473> Could you attach such a GIF for us to test? <comment124488> He's right, compare gif between QuickLook and a web browser. They are significantly slower on quicklook. (Running on a late 2012 iMac) <comment124760> Yes, I'm not talking about a particular GIF but any GIF. They all look quick and smoth on any browser, like Safari or Chrome, but really really slow on Quick Look. <comment124761> By the way, great news! OS X Mavericks fixes this behaviour.
