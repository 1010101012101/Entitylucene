System Preferences saving where you last clicked? <body> I was wondering if this behaviour is present on anyone else's Macbook.   Every time I've set up a new fresh install, I check that all the Sharing preferences are disabled one by one, and I leave it highlighted over Bluetooth Sharing when I've done going over all of them, all the time. 100%. I actively make sure to do this. So it should look like this when I exit out of Sharing preferences and then check them again:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gH4o6.png" alt="enter image description here"  However, I've noticed when I periodically check to ensure that they're still unchecked, another option will be highlighted. I just checked then, and Printer Sharing was the option that was highlighted. So it looked like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dfrZl.png" alt="enter image description here"  I've got two questions:  (1) Has the option highlighted in sharing prefers (and more broadly, the security &amp; privacy tab) changed from what you previously had left it highlighted on? Is this normal behaviour or a sign of compromise (esp since it's sharing preferences)? From my own investigation I know from some system preferences, it automatically reverts to the first tab you'll open (e.g. displays, Spotlight) regardless of which tab/option you leave it on, but it seems like for sharing, it doesn't.  (2) Is this evidence that someone has access to this Macbook (through a RAT, not physical - no one else has physical access to this Macbook)?  <comment263912> Are we discussing Yosemite, or El Capitan - which I notice to be more methodical, more stable. In Yosemite I had a great deal of this ghosting - preference boxes checked, etc. Highly doubtful anyone can access my machine - and sure enough, the janky behavior stopped in El Capitan. <comment263949> @@Zo219 - oh no. This is on an El Capitan set up! I mean, this happens every time I've been on the internet only to change passwords to my email/social networking/banking accounts. I would like to think the chances of it being a RAT are low because I no longer torrent/engage in risky internet surfing behaviour. Unless of course one of the sites I have an account with has malicious code uploaded to it due to a compromised server and I'm being hit with something every time I visit the page?
