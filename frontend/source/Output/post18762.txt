How can I find out which generation my iPod belongs to? <body> I have a iPod Classic 160 Gb. I have forgotten the generation. Is there any way by which I can find out the generation of the iPod?  <answer18766> See Apple's note on identifying which iPod model you have.  <answer18833> Check out MacTracker.  It's a free app with information on pretty much everything that Apple has ever made.  <comment20603> http://support.apple.com/kb/ht1353 <comment21295> Well, I dont have a mac, but thanks.
