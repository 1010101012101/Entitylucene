How to run `xterm` without getting a “Can't open display” error message? <body> On OS X 10.9.2 with XQuartz installed, I get the following message whenever I try to launch an xterm from strongTerminal.app/strong:  precode$ xterm xterm: Xt error: Can't open display: :0.0 /code/pre  How can I run codexterm/code properly?  <comment148350> What does “I get” means? Do you mean that, in a terminal from Terminal.app, you type `xterm` at the prompt and get that message as an answer? <comment148394> yes, exactly, something like   " xterm -e ssh  aaa@bbb.ccc" <comment148421> Have you tried running XQuartz directly from the **Applications  Utilities** folder? <comment148752> yes, than it runs for a couple of days, even saying in a terminal xterm -e ssh aaa@bbb.ccc after that I have to kill XQuartz, restart it, can open via Xquartz an xterminal, but not in a aterminal from Terminal.app via "xterm"
