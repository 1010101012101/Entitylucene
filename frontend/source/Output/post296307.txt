External Hard Drive no longer working <body> I am on a MacBook Pro 13 running latest Sierra. I have an external Seagate solid state hard drive that was working and out of the blue stopped working. The only thing on it was my Adobe Lightroom images/videos. Not the LR DB files. I'm sure you have all heard this woe before, so I won't dwell on that. And yes, I back up to the cloud. AWS S3 specifically. Though I am traveling South East Asia for the last year, and staying in cheap hostels. So good internet is hard to come by sometimes. I can't back it up after every export. While most of it is backed up, there is some that is not.  Moving on. The symptoms seems to change every time I plug it in. The first sign was it ejected on it's own. I plugged it in again, and it wouldn't mount. Disk Utility recognized it, so did the command line codediskutil list/code but it wouldn't mount. I rebooted and it worked for a second. Then I could only get to it from the command line. Then trying to frantically back up to my local what was not backed up to the cloud, it all failed. Basically just a codecp -R [directory] [local-directory]/code command.  After some more frantic unplugging and re-plugging plus some command line manual mounts, I finally got it to where the Disk Utility would be able to run first aid on it. It failed. I don't recall the error. So I put it in a freezer. After a few hours I tried again. It is not any better. It still will not mount. Now Disk Utility sees it, but with no partition. I can't even give me information about how much space is used on it.  I have also tried it from a Windows machine. It did not mount. I have tried other cables. No success. As well as tried my other USB port. I also have another working external hard drive exactly like the one giving me issues. It works on all cables and USB ports.  I do have Docker running with a Ubuntu container, I'm trying to think of a way to see if I can try to get to the USB from there. I also have a USB that I have thought about running a live Ubuntu on there to see if I can mount and retrieve the data or fix the SSD that way. But if it will not mount, I doubt these will work.  Can anyone else think of any other tricks I can try myself to see if I can repair this or at least retrieve the data without paying for a service or software? If not, those suggestions are also welcome.  Update: Now codediskutil list/code does not show it at all. The Disk Utility app also does not see it.  <answer296316>    ...any other tricks I can try myself to see if I can repair this or at   least retrieve the data without paying for a service or software?   Based on everything you said, there are only two conditions that exist:  ul listrongThe USB enclosure has failed./strong  This is the least bad scenario.  The "enclosure" has a USB to SATA controller that is the interface of the drive.  It's not out of the realm of possibility that it "reports" back the drive, but refuses to mount/read/write/etc.  /li listrongThe SSD drive itself has failed/strong This is the worst case scenario.  If the drive has failed, there's nothing you're going to do to force it to start working.  /li /ul  How can you find out which scenario is the one you're dealing with?  I wrote an answer to a similar question that addresses this situation exactly. It involves a cheap USB to SATA adapter to remove the enclosure from the equation.  If the drive works, it was the enclosure;  you get the added benefit of the adapter being a temp solution until you get the enclosure fixed (or another external drive).  If it doesn't work, then you know the SSD has died.    <comment374240> What's the purpose of putting an external SSD into a freezer? Condense/deposite some air humidity to lubricate/snow-cover the flash memory cells? ***"I don't recall the error."***: The error message is required, so open Terminal, enter `diskutil list` and with the device identifier of the external disk `diskutil verifyDisk diskX`. Then - if possible - verify the main volume: `diskutil verifyVolume diskXsY` (probably disk2s2). <comment374242> If it fails to mount then it would be a good idea to first verify its recognised at all. Looks that way: then make a *device copy* **before** you try to  *repair* any further. It might be tricky with SSDs but something like `dd` (from native Linux or Mac ?) might give you an image you can later scrape with various forensic tools. This is if its only a problem with the data structures. Hardware failure with SSDs cells or controller will be a lot tougher. So: state the errors (also from `cp`) and do the device copy now. <comment374345> @klanomath `diskutil list` only shows my laptops hard drive and nothing more. I can not run `diskutil verifyVolume` of `diskutil verifyDisk` because it does not see it at all. <comment374346> In addition to the possibility of the enclosure or drive being bad, you should also check the cable and port on your computer to make sure they are not the problem. <comment374347> Thank you, this was very helpful. It gives me hope. I will hunt around for this cable. Since you have mentioned it, I do suspect that it could be the electricity here. From my reading it's commonly 220-240 volts in most places around SEA. Also, I can literally feel it from the surface of my macbook when I plug it in. Then I unplug it and it stops. These external drives are not self powered, but powered by the laptop. I am not sure if this makes them more or less vulnerable. But whatever electronics inside these tiny hard drives can't be much to protect them against these voltages. <comment374348> @user128998 Thank you for pointing this out. I did try this, I will update my original post to make sure it is included.
