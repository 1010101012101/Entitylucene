Change mac menu bar color <body> Is there a way to change the color or appearance of the mac menu bar from the standard gray?  <answer46414> In System Preferences - Desktop &amp; Screen Saver - Desktop, you can check Translucent Menu Bar, which allows some of your wallpaper to show through.  http://eece.github.com/MenuBarFilter/ allows you to have a black menu bar, although last time I tried it, there were issues with full-screen apps on Lion.  <answer46417> You can use the free LeoColorBar utility. It's very simple, and seems to work very well: just choose the preferred color, change its darkness, and you're all set. As a bonus, you can change your wallpaper within the app as well, and add arbitrary text to the menu.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pNIS2.png" alt="LeoColorBar"  <answer46422> Unfortunately, there's no setting to change the color of the menu bar itself.  h2LeoColorBar/h2  As penguinrob suggests, you could set the menubar to translucent, and eminfluence/em its color by changing the color of the part of the wallpaper underneath the menubar.

All you have to do is open the app and your menubar will become grey/black.  <answer222466> In System Preferences, go to General. Check "Use dark menu bar and Dock".
