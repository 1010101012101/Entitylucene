Pictures folder on iMac has a 4 GB Photo Library <body> In my codeHome/code directory on my iMac I have a codePictures/code folder. In it is a 4 GB Photo Library named codePhotos Library.photoslibrary/code. I have iCloud Photo Library turned on, and it has been on for more than a year.  Why do I have this 4 GB photo library on my iMac? Shouldn't all photos be in iCloud? Can I delete it or should I just leave it?  <answer295127> Leave it. strongPhotos/strong still needs to download your Photos when you decide to view them. It will either download a device-optimized or full-resolution copy depending on your chosen settings.  Think of this file as a emlocal cache/em of your photo library, although it also contains other things that are not stored in iCloud, such as emSmart Albums/em and facial recognition data. If you delete this file strongPhotos/strong will need to recreate it and rebuild your library from iCloud data. In particular, it will need to re-download thumbnails for all of your photos.  The idea is that if you do run low on storage, strongPhotos/strong will start purging photos you haven’t viewed in a while, in albums you haven’t specifically marked as codeDownload Originals to this Mac/code.  <comment372596> Phong, I don't mind the edits but some of them were not necessary. I used names as they appeared on my computer.  I wrote users directory because that is the name on my computer, Same for the pictures folder. The term I used for Photos Library.photoslibrary was a direct copy of the name.  Why change those? <comment372602> @john My apologies. Please feel free to rollback if I’ve made any mistakes. The Pictures folder is normally located under your Home folder (**/Users/your account**) rather than directly under **Users**. The **Pictures** folder is capitalized on a default install, which is why I changed it. I didn’t realize it was different on your system. As for the last one it was only a formatting change, and if you dislike that once again I apologize. <comment372617> No problem. I'll just leave them.
