What is the 'microcontroler' setting under 'networks? <body> I was looking through the network settings on my 2015MBP and I came across this.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/SvKt9.png" alt="enter image description here"  What is the microcontroler? It looks like it can be used to make telephone calls from the Mac as shown here  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qsBXh.png" alt="enter image description here"  What is this, how does it work and how do you set it up?  Thanks  strongEdit/strong  Here is the output from the commands that codeRogier/codesuggested  codenetwork services/code output  pre (1) Microcontroller (Hardware Port: Modem (usbmodem1422), Device: usbmodem1422)  (2) Bluetooth DUN (Hardware Port: Bluetooth DUN, Device: Bluetooth-Modem)  (3) Wi-Fi (Hardware Port: Wi-Fi, Device: en0)  (4) Bluetooth PAN (Hardware Port: Bluetooth PAN, Device: en3)  (5) Thunderbolt Bridge (Hardware Port: Thunderbolt Bridge, Device: bridge0) /pre  codeHardware Ports/code output  pre Hardware Port: Wi-Fi Device: en0 Ethernet Address: 00:00:00:00:00:00  Hardware Port: Bluetooth PAN Device: en3 Ethernet Address: 00:00:00:00:00:00  Hardware Port: Thunderbolt 1 Device: en1 Ethernet Address: 00:00:00:00:00:00  Hardware Port: Thunderbolt 2 Device: en2 Ethernet Address: 00:00:00:00:00:00  Hardware Port: Thunderbolt Bridge Device: bridge0 Ethernet Address: N/A  VLAN Configurations =================== /pre  Note:br I have changed the MAC addresses to code00:00:00:00:00:00/code for security reasons since they can be spoofed.  If it helps I remembered I created an Wi-Fi hotspot on my Mac by clicking on the Wi-Fi menu and clicking on codecreate network/code  The 'grep' command did not display anything. (used codeusbmodem1422/code as the argument.  <answer190020> The icon indicates its strongprobably/strong a serial device (i.e. a virtual com port).   Normally you need to click the code+/code sign below (your first screenshot), then select a interface, a default name will be presented (in your case Microcontroller). You could rename the service afterwards.  The problem is once the device is added its hard to see which codeport/code its connected to. Now if you goto the codeTerminal/code and type:  precode# list all h/w ports networksetup -listallhardwareports  # list Services and their connected port networksetup -listnetworkserviceorder /code/pre  The stronglast/strong command should show you something like:  precode(1) Ethernet 1 (Hardware Port: Ethernet 1, Device: en0)  (2) Ethernet 2 (Hardware Port: Ethernet 2, Device: en1)  (x) Microcontroller (Hardware Port: xxxx, Device: YYYY) /code/pre  The device name (YYYY) you should find in your code/etc/code folder (if connected).  So, if the device is emconnected/em you should find it in that /dev folder. You can check this by going to the terminal and type:  precodels -l /dev | grep &lt;the name of the h/w port&gt; /code/pre  If you then disconnect the device and they the command (above) again, and it disappears your sure.  To answer your question: how it works and how you set it up strongdepends/strong on what type of device it is. And its hard to say just based on this information.  emApparently this device got somehow added. As Ashely states, it could be a Raspberry PI, or some other USB device (with serial port)./em  <answer190064> I have an Arduino (which has a "microcontroller" processor).  I'm no expert on "modern" devices (like this, and Raspberry Pi etc), but I have worked with older similar systems.  On my system, the Arduino instructions suggested I installed the codeCodeBender/code development software to work with the device.  That insisted on installing codedriver-installer.mpkg/code, which seems to contain codeFTDIUSBSerialDriver.kext/code, which seems to implement code/dev/cu.usbmodemfa121/code and a setting in System Preferences  Network similar to that in your screenshot.  Sadly I couldn't find any documentation from CodeBender explaining this: I had to look closely at the installation package to work this out.  On my Arduino, I believe the microcontroller has a USB wrapper around a virtual RS232 port.  It's used to send compiled code to the Arduino from the development software on the Mac, and in the other direction for the Arduino to send output back to the Mac.  In the comments, you say that the main Raspberry Pi USB port doesn't have data connections.  But perhaps the development software has installed this network/USB/RS232 port anyway.  It appears on my Mac even when the Arduino is not connected.  <comment225479> Do you use a Raspberry Pi, Arduino or similar? <comment225483> @Ashley Yes I do use an Raspberry Pi why would it make this setting show up though? <comment225528> Thing is I don't get how it detected my Raspberry Pi. I have only plugged it in to my MBP for power. The micro USB for power on the Pi does not have data connections. How would my MBP have detected it then? <comment225530> Well maybe its not your Rasberry, thats my point (we can't be sure). You should run the command and check which port the 'Microcontroller' is attached to. <comment225535> I have not installed any software for my raspberry pi. All I have done is use an VNC server, ssh and sftp (connected to ssh and sftp via terminal) This is why I don't get it. I have no development software for it. <comment225536> Just had a thought. Could it be from when I installed `fritzzing` for doing schematics? Would this make the 'microcontroler' network because `friztzing` can be used to program the Arduino? <comment225642> Sorry, I don't know for sure, but that sounds plausible.
