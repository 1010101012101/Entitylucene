delete and restoring the .bash_profile on mac <body> I have accidentally encrypted my .bash_profile when I was trying to quit the vi (by entering capital X). Now i have problem accessing (appending and checking) my .bash_profile file.  Is there any way to get the the contents of my .bash_profile and copy them into a new .bash_profile file?  <comment349005> Can you not just reopen it in vi? <comment349012> To encrypt a file in vi you'd have to enter `:X` + enter-key + 2 times the same passphrase (each pp followed by the enter-key)! Maybe the passphrase simply is `:q!` or `:q` or `:wq`?
