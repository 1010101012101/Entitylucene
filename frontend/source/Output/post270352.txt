Automatically remove specific variable characters from file names <body> I have multiple security cameras that generate dozens of files daily. Each file has a similar name structure (as you'll see below), including a Camera Name YYYYMMDD @ HHMMSS.avi  Long story short, I wish to remove the strongseconds/strong from the name, and I have been unable to find a way to automate it so far. If possible, I would love for it to be something that I can add to Automator. Does anyone know of a solution for this? Thanks in advance!  Here are two of the file names: Downstairs 20170122 @ 1918strong16/strong.avi &amp; Upstairs 20170122 @ 1924strong00/strong.avi
