iPad - how can I limit access to only specific apps? <body> I want to restrict access on an iPad so it is only able to run specific apps (in this case, a folder of children's apps) and prohibit access to things like Settings, Gmail, full YouTube, etc.  It's unclear to me if the built-in Restrictions feature can apply to any app that is installed or if it is only limited to a set of native apps and functionality.    Ultimately, is there any native functionality in iOS where I can lock the device down to only access specific apps, either by individual app or by a folder even?  Or do I need to search for a 3rd party parental control tool or something?  <comment321707> Have you tried [parental restrictions](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201304)? <comment321709> I don't have the device in front of me at the moment, but it wasn't clear to me from the documentation on Apple's site.  Do *all* installed apps show up in the built-in parental restrictions or is it just a selection of native apps by Apple (Safari, iTunes, etc.). <comment321712> I have not found a way to do what you are asking other than to have a dedicated "kids" iPad. iOS does not support the idea of multiple accounts with different settings and applications the way desktop operating systems do. <comment321713> Try apple's Confugurator App. Might be what you are looking for, but is not easy to deploy to devices. You kinda have to be a power user. Configurator is only availible for mac, and deploys profiles to devices. <comment321714> If you go to the site I indicated, it shows what is supported when using Restrictions.  Between what Apple provides on that page and what @bret7600 says, those are your options.
