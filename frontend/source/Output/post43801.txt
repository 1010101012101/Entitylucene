Cannot reinstall iPhoto from App Store in Lion <body> My company recently upgraded my laptop to OS X Lion and was pre-installed with iPhoto purchased under a different Apple ID. I have my own purchased version so wanted to update the app, but it asked for the other user's password.  So I decided to uninstall the app using Launchpad and try downloading it again. However, when I go to it in the Mac App Store, the button now says "ACCEPT" and when I click on it, I get this message:     These apps cannot be accepted on this computer.   Future updates of these apps can be found through Software Update.   What can I do to get iPhoto to download again?  <answer47642> I ran into the same problem and finally found the following solution on the apple support forums that worked for me:  ol liLaunch App Store/li liClick the "Purchases" tab (the price-tag icon at the top of the App Store window)/li liFind iMovie in the list/li liClick its "INSTALL" button/li /ol  <comment54692> Nice one thanks! I forgot to return here to answer the question... After contacting Apple email support, they told me to do this. I can't believe I missed the Purchases tab! Having said that, it seems a bit silly that the App Store doesn't suggest you do this or do it automatically itself!
