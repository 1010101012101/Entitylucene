To get newer man pages in OSX? <body> I noticed that my manuals are very old in my system although all updates done.  Etc codeman cmp/code tells about the flag code-l/code  precode-l  --verbose           Output byte numbers and values of all differing bytes. /code/pre  while Wikipedia is about more fully     Output the (decimal) byte numbers and (octal) values of all differing   bytes, instead of the default standard output. Also, output the EOF   message if one file is shorter than the other.   The last sentence was critical in my understanding of the output.  I would like get more fully manuals to my system.

Assuming that you have not hard coded codeMANPATH/code then codeman/code would determine the manual with your codePATH/code and codeman.conf/code. If you are installing your own tools then possibly codeman.conf/code may need to be configured with your installation prefix.   If you have duplicate tools installed then the manual for the command first in your PATH is presented. You can read another manual by pointing codeman/code to the directory in which that man page resides.  precode    man -M /path/to/share/man COMMAND /code/pre  You can read all the manuals of a particular command.  precode    man -a COMMAND /code/pre  <comment234366> What is the best way to go about seeing if you do have multiple versions of shell commands and which ones are actually referenced when they are executed? Thank you. <comment234374> Choose a shell command then type `type -a COMMAND` this will list all of the COMMAND names in your PATH , the top one would be executed.
