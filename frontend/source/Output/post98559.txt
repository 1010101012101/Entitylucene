Missing notes on MacBook Air <body> I cannot see some of my notes I created on MacBook Air. When I check in Spotlight it says (null).  What does that mean?  Where are my notes?  <answer98562> You might be able to see or recover some of your lost Notes.  Open Terminal and paste this:  precodecd ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.Notes/Data/Library/Notes strings NotesV1.storedata | grep body | open -f /code/pre  That should show you all your notes in text file, from where you can copy the missing one.  emTerminal is a application located in the Utilities Folder under Applications./em
