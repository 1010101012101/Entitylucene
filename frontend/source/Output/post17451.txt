Remote Desktop Connection for Mac not being able to connect? <body> I have the latest version of Remote Desktop Connection client form Mac (2.1.1), the one that is also included in Office 2011 but I am not able to connect to the Windows machine.  I checked the logs on the Windows machine and found nothing.  It keeps asking me for user/password/domain... and I am entering them properly.  FYI, the computer is on domain.  <answer17452> Solved the problem by leaving the domain, joining it back and rebooting the machine (Windows).  <comment19045> Tried with CoRD and I got an interesting error "The trust relationship between this workstation and the primary domain failed."
