Option to "open with..." on folders in finder <body> Is it possible to add the "Open with..." option to Finder, when you do a secondary click on a folder? I want the same behavior as when I'm secondary clicking on a file.  strongEdit/strong  I do not want to open the contents of the folder with the application, but simply just the folder.  Try dragging one of your folders over all docked applications. Some of them will show that they can open a folder.  Example:  ul liBBEdit - Allow you to browse the contents of the folder in the sidebar and edit each file inside it./li liiTerm - Starts the command line inside the opened folder./li /ul  <answer41688> Folders will always open in Finder, an Open With option appears when you right-click on a file.  Is this what you mean or was there a particular program you wanted to interact with an entire folder with?  <comment47265> How would an application open a folder? Do you mean "Open the contents of this folder withâ€¦"? <comment47302> @TimothyMueller-Harder This is not that esoteric as you might think. Folders have metadata also which could be changed by an application, or think about indexing applications... <comment47311> There wasn't a particular program I wanted to open the folder with, as I might want to open the folder in different programs, depending on what I want to do. Therefore it needs to show the "Open With..." so I can choose the correct program myself. I still want finder to be the default folder-opening application. <comment53030> Do you mean to open an Application like iPhoto or what kind of folders are you aiming for? <comment53111> @Michiel I have never used iPhoto, so I can't tell you that.
