OS X 10.8.5: Can I move icons around in the dock and not have them stay there when the apps are closed? <body> Whenever I drag an open application's icon in the dock to another place in the dock, it thinks that means I want it to stay in the dock even if the app closes.  Is it possible for me to change this behavior? I like to arrange my icons in a certain way, but I don't like icons in the dock whose apps are not open.  <answer104583> You can remove all emclosed/em apps from the Dock (even if they are set to 'Keep in Dock') with the following command:  precodedefaults delete com.apple.dock static-only /code/pre  You can assign a hotkey to run this, or set up a launch agent to run this regularly.
