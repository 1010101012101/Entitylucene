OSX Open Atom from terminal <body> I am trying to implement my own dotfiles. I am using zsh as my default shell. When I try to launch Atom from terminal I get this error     FSPathMakeRef(/Users/agusgambina/Applications/Atom.app) failed with error -43.   To start the application I am executing in the terminal  precode$ atom . /code/pre  I am not sure what I have changed that broke this, but everything else that is similar seems to be working.  Thank you  <comment247616> How do you launch Atom? i.e. the full command you use <comment247617> `fnfErr                        = -43,  /*File not found*/` - How are you attempting to start this bundled application? <comment247618> @fd0 thank you for your quick answer I just wrote it in the post <comment247620> @agusgambina -Well, I'm not going to go thru your dozen or more dot files. I'd say that the . `dot` after the atom command is not interpreted by the shell as a valid path. <comment247637> @fd0 Thank you for your answers, I realised that was my mistake, I was overwriting the ATOM path and that was my mistake. I will delete the question since I think has no point because was a silly mistake of mine.
