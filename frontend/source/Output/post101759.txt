How to record a FaceTime call on OS X? <body> How can I record a FaceTime call and save the video on my Mac?  supI am using a MacBook Air 11" with OS X 10.8./sup  <answer101760> Facetime does not include this functionality directly.   One of the possibilities you have is using QuickTime X's screen recording feature.   <answer157621> There's finally an app for this! Call Recorder for FaceTime is a Mac app that was just released today:  https://www.ecamm.com/mac/callrecorderft/  This product is a plug-in that adds recording controls to the FaceTime app. Recording can be started manually, or it can be configured to record automatically. It creates internet-ready QuickTime movies.  Another great use is recording phone calls that come through the Mac via Yosemite's new Handoff feature.   (full disclosure: I work on this product!)  <comment119877> That's a little complicated, Sir <comment119878> Why do you say it is complicated?  Are you talking about the sound <comment119993> @markhunte I am talking about the video. <comment120000> This feature quite easy to use imho. <comment120005> It is not complicated to set up. But I meant also recording the sound. Which could be a little bit fiddly the first time and may require a third party app. Or you looping a cable from you headphone jack to your mic jack. <comment185332> There's finally an app for this!
