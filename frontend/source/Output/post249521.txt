How can i disable iTunes autoplay when bluetooth device is connected? <body> I don't know exactly when it began but for few months i have problem with bluetooth speakers. When they connected to mac iTunes starts to play music from it's playlist. How can i disable this function?  Also when my mac is in sleep mode and bluetooth speakers are connected, mac suddenly wakes up and start to play music from iTunes.  <answer249529> This is a common issue on Mac. Here is the tutorials that works fine on my rMBP with OSX 10.11:  1) Open a Terminal Window   2) Rename iTunes.app to MyiTunes.app   3) Create a DoNothing.app using the AppleScript Editor   4) Copy the DoNothing.app to the Applications folder  5) Connect a bluetooth device to get the "Where is iTunes?" window prompt and Select DoNothing.app as what to auto-launch instead of iTunes 6) Closing thoughts about updates etc.  Resource: https://discussions.apple.com/message/25425864#message25425864
