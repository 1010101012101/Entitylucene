Can i remove OS X completely and install Windows? <body> Can I completely remove Mac OS X from my system and install Windows 7 or 8 on it?  I do not want to use Bootcamp or create VM's. Is there any way at all?   The problem here is that i want to ditch OSX and install Windows on my mac machine forever.  hr  Will I have to buy a Windows PC?  <answer123565> No you don't need PC hardware since Yes you can delete OS X entirely after getting the drivers installed from Boot Camp on OS X.  Follow the directions for creating the bootcamp USB key that comes with bootcamp (you'll need an 8GB key). When you boot from the bootcamp key and it gives you disk utility just delete the OSX partition (I believe this is an option, it's been a while) And make the whole thing Winders.  The Mac strongIS/strong an Intel PC and Bootcamp is only the drivers and whatnot to create the bootable windows installer with the Mac drivers in it.  Hold onto that key, it's your repair disk and Windows re-installer should you need to sometime in the future.  <comment363432> Though I usually shrink the OS X partition, but leave it there, just in case of problems I'll have a bootable OS
