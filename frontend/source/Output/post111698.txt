AppleScript Editor : comment line shortcut? <body> Is there a keyboard shortcut to comment lines in AppleScript Editor ?   The common kbdCmd/kbd+kbdshift/kbd+kbd//kbd does not work here.   <answer111749> I have used FastScripts to assign a shortcut to this script:  precodeset text item delimiters to linefeed tell application "AppleScript Editor" to tell document 1     set input to its text     set {c1, c2} to character range of selection     if c1 is 0 then         set {p1, p2} to {1, 1}     else         set p1 to count paragraphs of text 1 thru c1 of input         set p2 to count paragraphs of text 1 thru c2 of input         if p1 is not p2 and {return, linefeed} contains item c2 of input then set p2 to p2 - 1     end if     set selection to paragraphs p1 thru p2     do shell script "input=" &amp; quoted form of (paragraphs p1 thru p2 of input as text) &amp; " if [[ -z $(sed -E '/^[[:space:]]*($|#|--)/d' &lt;&lt;&lt; \"$input\") ]]; then   sed -E 's/^([[:space:]]*)(#|--)[[:space:]]*/\\1/g' &lt;&lt;&lt; \"$input\" else   sed -E 's/^([[:space:]]*)/\\1--/g' &lt;&lt;&lt; \"$input\" fi" without altering line endings     set contents of selection to result end tell /code/pre
