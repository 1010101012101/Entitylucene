Energy saver 101 : sleeps after or when battery is at x hours? <body> Using Mac OSX on a macbook pro. in energy saver - battery tab : if i have sleep at 1 hour, does that mean the computer will sleep after an hour on battery OR when there is a about an hour of battery remaining?  If its the former - is there a way to make it the latter? I want the computer to sleep when battery has about half an hour left.   Can use terminal or preferences or put a well known freeware.  <answer114400> It means the computer will sleep after an hour.br The computer (if it's a laptop) will automatically hibernate when the battery is very low (this is hibernatemode 3). Is that sufficient or do you really want the computer to sleep when there's 1 hour of battery left?   <comment134069> Thank you, and is there a way to change it so : the computer sleeps when battery has about half an hour left ? <comment134087> @tgkprog, that seems like it could be kind of awkward if you were working on something at the point when the computer decides it has 1/2 hour battery left and then sleeps.
