Headphones with inline mic mute button hangs up the call Any way to mute instead? <body> I just have a cheap pair of wired headphones with an inline mic with a mute button. I'm using an old iPhone 5 since I just broke my Nexus 6 screen. In Android, this button was a very quick way to mute and un-mute calls, crucial during conference calls. I just tried this for the first time on the iPhone and it hung up the call instead. Is there anyway to change this behavior to mute instead?  <answer276511> No, there's no way to change this.  I really don't like that Apple has decided the single-click on the headphone switch will disconnect the call instead of muting the microphone.  You can do what I have and go here to provide iPhone feedback to Apple to make this change.  <comment348014> there is no way to mute the iphone's mic without pressing the right button on the call screen, not even with apple earphones <comment348033> @Shanteva I've been leaving feedback about this since my iPhone 4 and they haven't changed it yet.  Hopefully, more people doing this will help convince them it's needed.  :-)
