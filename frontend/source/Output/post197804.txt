Can I remotely change home or lock screens on iPads? <body> Is there a way of remotely changing multiple iPad's locks/homescreens to the same custom image all at once over the air (not via USB)? I currently compile profiles with Apple Configurator, but changing wallpaper is apparently not possible with MDM. Isn't there a app or something that can do this?  <answer197808> This is currently not possible OTA. You must connect the device over USB to change the wallpapers.  <answer197825> You can change the wallpaper of a supervised iOS device remotely via MDM. There is a "Managed Setting" command available for this.  Here is an excerpt from the Apple MDM documentation.  precodeA wallpaper change is a one-time setting that can be changed by the user at will.  This command is supported in supervised mode only. /code/pre  iOS 9 will also introduce a restriction to forbid changing the wallpaper on supervised devices.  It's just a question if your vendor has implemented it or not.
