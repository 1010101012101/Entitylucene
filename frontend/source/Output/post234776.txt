How do I stop people reading my iMessages as they come in? <body> I don't want anyone to be able to see from whom I am receiving iMessages or text messages or the content of those messages.   Can I hide both!?  <answer234781> If you mean from the Lock Screen or Notifications Centre, thenbr Settings  Notifications  Messagesbr switch off Lock Screen &amp;/or Notification Centre  .. or if you simply want the content of the messages disabled, lower down the screen [out of sight on this image] uncheck Show Previews - though that will show who sent a message, but not the content.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/sZSH8.png" width="300"  <comment287051> Unchecking *Show Previews* seems like what the OP is looking for. <comment287055> Probably right - I'll promote it.
