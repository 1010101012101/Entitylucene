CI job running on macOS - why is a test key being added to my login keychain? <body> I am writing a cross-platform library that provides an SSL server. In order to ensure some level of quality, I have a Jenkins server set up to build and test the library on all three supported platforms - Windows, Linux, and macOS.  One of the tests uses a pre-generated RSA key and matching self-signed X509 certificate. The test passes without issue on Windows and Linux. However, when run on macOS, the test freezes and the following is displayed on the screen:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/j34KH.png" alt="enter image description here"  This is completely baffling to me. Never was the key or the certificate added to the login keychain at any point. I opened up Keychain Access and removed both certificate and key. Nevertheless, the very next time the test ran, the same thing happened.  What is causing the key to be added?  If I try to run the build in Qt Creator myself on the same machine, it sometimes succeeds and sometimes produces the prompt above.  strongMore Details:/strong  ul lihost is macOS Sierra 10.12.1/li lihere is a log from one of the failed builds/li lihere is the source code for the failing test/li liJenkins slave is running under my personal account, launched using Java Web Start/li /ul
