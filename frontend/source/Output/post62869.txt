How can I fix this?  <answer64439> There is no end time for the entry so you need to add this into the file.  precodeDTEND:20120830T155000 /code/pre  The ICS specification also states     the "UNTIL" recurrence rule parameter MUST be used to specify the           last valid onset of this observance (i.e., the UNTIL date-time           will be equal to the last instance generated by the recurrence           pattern). It MUST be specified in UTC time.   so your RRULE line should read:  precodeRRULE:FREQ=WEEKLY;UNTIL=20121212T150000;WKST=SU;BYDAY=MO,WE,FR /code/pre  <comment72528> What exactly is your question here? Are you trying to import these events into iCal and get an error? <comment72530> Am trying to add event to calendar. But the time format is wrong. it doesn't show the correct end time(in this case its 3.50 PM is correct but now it shows 3 PM) <comment72531> This doen't work correctly fo me RRULE:FREQ=WEEKLY;UNTIL=20121212T155000;WKST=SU;BYDAY=MO,WE,FR
