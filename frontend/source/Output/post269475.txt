Mac Show All Windows for an app in dock Sierra <body> When I had El Capitan, I was able to (or assigned a shortcut to) : when I hovered over a dock icon and scrolled up (with mouse or trackpad), it would show all windows of the dock application i hovered over.  i can't remember now that i have sierra how i did this ; any ideas?    <answer269507> Go with the the mouse pointer to the dock icon in question, then with three fingers go up, this will reveal all open windows of this application.  <answer269651> well this guy jon hitchcock solved it in apple forum.... it was tinkertool that has this option https://discussions.apple.com/message/31284014#31284014  <comment338679> i wonder if this command used to do it, and maybe from el capitan to sierra it no longer works.. : defaults write com.apple.dock scroll-to-open -bool TRUE;killall Dock <comment338680> this works and isn't bad if you're using trackpad, but not great if you're using a mouse
