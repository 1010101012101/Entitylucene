Copy the original when dragging a alias <body> I have i.e. a folder full with alias from everywhere on my system. Now I want to give exactly this files as the originals to an extern hard drive or what else.  Is there a way to simply strongtake these alias and copy their originals/strong into a second folder?  <answer296280> I’ve put together a little AppleScript for you. If you use the Script Editor to save it as an applet you can drag &amp; drop folders on it. The script will first ask for the destination folder and then scan the dropped folders for any aliases contained. If it finds any it will copy the original items to the destination folder specified.   Here’s the code:  precodeon open droppedItems     try         set destinationFolder to choose folder with prompt "Select destination folder:"     on error         return     end try      repeat with itemCount from 1 to length of droppedItems         set theFolder to item itemCount of droppedItems          tell application "Finder"             if folder (theFolder as string) exists then                 set folderItems to list folder theFolder without invisibles                  repeat with folderItemCount from 1 to length of folderItems                     set filename to (item folderItemCount of folderItems)                     set theAlias to ((theFolder as text) & filename) as alias                     try                         set originalFile to original item of theAlias -- is Finder alias?                         duplicate originalFile to destinationFolder                     on error                         display dialog (theAlias as string) & " doesn't seem to be an alias. Skipping."                     end try                 end repeat             else                 display dialog (theFolder as string) & "is not a folder. Skipping."             end if         end tell     end repeat end open /code/pre  It is neither pretty nor feature complete but rather meant to show you a possible way to go. I. e. it doesn’t traverse any subfolders. Also, there’s no checking of file existence before copying. Anyway, it might still be what you need. Have fun!
