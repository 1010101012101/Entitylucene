Hibernation mode shows incorrect value? <body> I'm trying to follow the steps in this article to make it so the contents of my memory aren't written to disk every time the computer goes to sleep.  I'm having trouble in the "Check the current setup" step. Before changing these settings, I want to make sure I understand it 100% so that I can revert the changes. It says that I should have a setting of code3/code if hibernate and sleep is enabled, or code7/code if hibernate, sleep and secure virtual memory are all enabled.  I'm on a standard user account, but when I go to System Preferences  Security  General, I see that Use secure virtual memory is enabled.  The problem is that when I run codepmset -g | grep hibernatemode/code, it returns code3/code instead of code7/code.  Any idea why there is this discrepancy?  <answer7228> I can say that mine also returns code3/code even though it's using the secure virtual memory. But to be honest, it doesn't really matter. Set it to code0/code if you don't want it to save to the HDD and code3/code if you want it to. :)  <answer11092> The article is outdated (it's from 2006). There is no codehibernatemode = 7/code in the pmset manual. If you dont want your macbook to write ram to disk, use codehibernatemode = 0/code (by issuing codesudo pmset -a hibernatemode 0/code).  When I want my computer to hibernate and power off I use this hibernate script.  <comment7729> I'm worried that when I set it back, my settings (e.g. FileVault) may have changed by then, so I want to understand how this setting works to make sure that I don't make a mistake when restoring this setting.
