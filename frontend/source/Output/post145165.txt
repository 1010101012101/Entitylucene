Where to install libraries such as hdf5 <body> I'm trying to install HDF5 and SZIP following http://www.ulmer.org/2014/building-hdf5-for-os-x-mavericks/[this description].  However, I'm wondering where to install it (on mavericks). Google didn't show anything, is there any space recommended as a destination directory? Please indicate for both current user and all users.  <answer145171> If you follow those instructions, the package will install everything to code/usr/local/code. This is a recommended place to install user-compiled software because it's already in your PATH, doesn't need elevated permissions, and a lot of stuff breaks if it's not in either code/usr/code or code/usr/local/code . If you open the DEST directory that's created before the pkgutil step, you'll see where everything gets installed. It's the code--PREFIX=/usr/local/code in the configure step that decides the path relative to which things get installed.  Incidentally, both those packages can be found in homebrew which, in my opinion, is a better way to manage these things and you may find more straightforward. After you install homebrew:  precodebrew install szip hdf5 /code/pre  <comment171055> I actually ran those lines and it just created everything in my current dir / DEST, which is why I was asking in the first place. home-brew was the solution, thanks. <comment171057> So when you run the pkgutil step, it takes the DEST directory and makes a package, which you then have to run to actually install it in the correct location.
