Dock indication about different application instances <body> I miss a feature of the windows taskbar; I could see each application instance separately keeping an eye on my actual open Windows and not Apps.. This is useful especially in debugging, keeping two Chrome windows open - comparing - etc etc..  Is it possible to alter the Dock in a way that will give me indication of the Instances of One app, rather than a single application icon which I have to right click in order to see how many - if at all - instances are open?  I am asking either for Add-on apps, improvements, hidden gems, settings, anything...   <answer162099> There's a Multi-Touch gesture that can show you all the instances of one app. Swiping downwards with either three or four fingers (configurable in System Preferences  Trackpad  More Gestures) opens "App Expos√©", a handy birds-eye view of all your open windows in the frontmost app. It's not the same as an indicator in the always-present Dock, I know, but I think this can be one of the best options you'll get without 3rd-party software (assuming such software exists).  <comment189405> What device do you have? <comment189407> MBP 2014 - i5,16GB <comment189410> The dock does show an icon per instance of an app - opening a window does not create a new instance. Opening an app again - note you have to do this via command line does add another icon <comment189450> Hm , I knew this one , but it requires an action... Not want I want <comment189451> Ok Mark, I guess new instance isn't the correct choice of words, but you get the picture;-)
