iPad Keynote Presentation in portrait mode <body> I'd like to use Keynote on iPad in portrait mode, so that I can use it while it's in my dock and so I can make app wireframes in it that are portrait mode apps (vertical orientation). Is this possible?  <answer105735> The only solution that I can find is to create the presentation in "normal" landscape orientation, and rotate every element sideways using codeInspector &gt; Metrics &gt; Rotation/code. If I set everything to 90Ëš then it shows up like I want it on the iPad.
