403 forbidden on Apache vHost <body> I'm using Mac OS X 10.6.8 and I'm trying to configure a vHost. I configured it and it gave me a 403 Forbidden, and I'm having trouble giving _www permission to read/write in ~/Document/workspace/dev  httpd.conf, I thought this might be causing trouble with me accessing public host, not vHost, but I'm not sure.  precode    #     # ServerName gives the name and port that the server uses to identify itself.     # This can often be determined automatically, but we recommend you specify     # it explicitly to prevent problems during startup.     #     # If your host doesn't have a registered DNS name, enter its IP address here.     #     #ServerName www.example.com:80      #     # DocumentRoot: The directory out of which you will serve your     # documents. By default, all requests are taken from this directory, but     # symbolic links and aliases may be used to point to other locations.     #     DocumentRoot "/Library/WebServer/Documents" /code/pre  I also made sure to uncomment the include on this:  precode    # Virtual hosts     Include /private/etc/apache2/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf /code/pre  And I defined these vHosts in httpd-vhosts.conf  precode    &lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;         DocumentRoot "/Library/WebServer/Documents"     &lt;/VirtualHost&gt;      &lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;             DocumentRoot "/Users/isaacbeckett/Documents/workspace/dev"             ServerName isaac.local             ErrorLog "/private/var/log/apache2/isaac.local-error_log"             CustomLog "/private/var/log/apache2/isaac.local-access_log" common              &lt;Directory "/Users/isaac/Documents/workspace/dev"&gt;                     AllowOverride All                     Order allow,deny                     Allow from all             &lt;/Directory&gt;     &lt;/VirtualHost&gt; /code/pre  And here is my /etc/hosts file:  precode    ##     # Host Database     #     # localhost is used to configure the loopback interface     # when the system is booting.  Do not change this entry.     ##     127.0.0.1       localhost     255.255.255.255 broadcasthost     ::1             localhost     fe80::1%lo0     localhost     127.0.0.1       isaac.local /code/pre  I've flushed the local cache with codedscacheutil -flushcache/code  several times and tried codechmod 755 ~/Documents/code as well, but no success. Can someone please help me figure this out?          <answer195229> This is very much off topic as it is unrelated to Apple hardware/software.  However, I wanted to point you in the right direction.  The problem that you are running into is that   ul liIn your httpd.conf, the directory permissions are not set properly/li liYour .htaccess file is not configured properly/li liThe system doesen't have the correct permissions for the directory/li /ul  The best thing to do is consult the Apache documentation about the VirtualHost directive.    The Server Fault and/or Super User boards here on Stackexchange would also be beneficial to solving this particular problem.  <comment233015> It's possible that 755 isn't enough if your files/folders are in a different group to httpd and also you've not enabled a file index in the vhost so you'll need to have a file in the folder which is listed in the `DirectoryIndex` parameter otherwise it will show a 403 error as there is no file and and you are forbidden from viewing the file listing. To enable file listings put `Options +Indexes` <comment233078> Umm, .htaccess? I saw no such file. Also, how can I correct the issue specifically. This isn't very helpful. <comment233079> The dot (.) before htaccess indicates it's a hidden file.  It's there...if not in the directory you are trying to browse, in a parent directory possibly all the way up to the "DocumentRoot."  To get specific help, I put that in my answer. <comment233080> I know it's hidden, but where is it specifically? <comment233082> Google must be broken.  I used Bing and found this for you:  http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/apache-403-forbidden-error-and-solution/ <comment233083> And Bing also gave this one from Stackoverflow (here) http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15602331/http-server-error-403-forbidden
