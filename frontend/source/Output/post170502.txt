Difference in performance between iOS devices <body> I'm developing a game for ios and notice surprising results performance-wise between my devices.  for example, my iphone 5 will perform better than my ipad mini retina.  I really have no point of reference on how the two should compare.  If they shared similar processor speeds, it would make sense that the ipad might suffer a performance problem since the textures are twice as big.. but I'm just guessing here.  When I look up processor speeds etc, I seem to find very general information (A6, or A7 processor).  I'm looking for some easily understandable performance comparisons between devices so that I can predict which devices would perform better.  <comment200437> Geekbench results: http://browser.primatelabs.com/ios-benchmarks  Your mileage will vary. <comment200474> If your game is graphics intensive the larger screen of the mini would have an impact on performance. <comment200475> I figured. I thought the Minis processing power compared to an iPhone would make up for that though
