How do I avoid Keynote reducing image quality? <body> I want to create an animation in Keynote for a proof of concept. So I create a custom 16:9 document with 1440 x 810 pixel size. Then I add an image with a 1440 x 6395 pixel size. When I first add the image it's downsized so that it doesn't stretch beyond the slide height, but I click the strongOriginal size/strong to have it fill the width (and stretch beyond the height).   The problem now is that even though I've clicked strongOriginal size/strong, I'm quite sure the image isn't actually its original size, at least not in resolution.   When I set the presentation in full screen this is part of what I see: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/By39p.png" alt="enter image description here"  When I look at the same area of the image in Finder Preview this is what I see: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/S738Y.png" alt="enter image description here"  So you see, the image in Keynote is undoubtedly reduced in quality.  Does anyone know how I avoid this?  <answer190742> After some research I found that this is a problem that has appeared since Keynote 6, and is probably due to iOS compatibility (limiting PNG original quality to stick up to 4096px height).  A tip however was to import your image as PDF instead, then Keynote won't downsample it.   Here's the result:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/XmxJ9.png" alt="enter image description here"
