How do I keep the Recovery HD and EFI partitions from automatically mounting on my MacBook Air? <body> I've set Finder preferences on my MacBook Air running OS X 10.9.1 to show everything on my desktop:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jU6pH.png" alt="Finder Preferences screen shot"  I've noticed that storage partitions called strongRecovery HD/strong and strongEFI/strong appear there:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DxMDA.png" alt="screen shot of storage partitions on my desktop"  What are they? Is there a setting I can use to hide them?  I've noticed I can eject them, but they will reappear later, such as when I wake my MacBook Air after sleeping.  strongUpdate:/strong I'm using Mountain (which I recommend), and it turns out either the "Mount all unmounted volumes on wake from sleep" setting was on by default, or I didn't remember setting it.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/OWpUD.png" alt="enter image description here"  Since I turned it off those partitions have stopped mounting automatically.  <answer121461> They are hidden partitions in OS X. Showing all partitions in Disk Utility also shows the partitions in the list:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gi3At.png" width="194"  …and codediskutil list/code:  precode1:         EFI EFI          209.7 MB   disk0s1 2:   Apple_HFS Mac SSD      150.0 GB   disk0s2 3:  Apple_Boot Recovery HD  650.0 MB   disk0s3 /code/pre  They are usually not mounted by default and therefore not shown on the desktop regardless of your settings in Finder.  Try resetting your NVRAM (boot with ⌘⌥PR until the emsecond/em boot chime).  <answer157800> Your computer is currently set to mount and show hidden partitions, which is unusual. To get control of this feature, you need to activate the Debug menu in Disk Utility which then gives you the option of viewing and mounting hidden partitions, or indeed, making them hidden again.  ol liIn Terminal, run the command  precodedefaults write com.apple.DiskUtility DUDebugMenuEnabled 1 /code/pre/li liLaunch (or relaunch Disk Utility)/li liIn the Debug menu, uncheck Show Every Partition./li /ol  <comment141645> Resetting my NVRAM didn't work. The partitions mounted again after waking from sleep. <comment166930> The Mountain setting did it for me, Thanks.
