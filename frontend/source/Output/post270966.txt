Why is this item bold in the Bluetooth menu? <body> Can anyone tell me what the bold text means in this image of my Bluetooth menu?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/afzTW.png" alt="Bluetooth menu"  It seems that the mouse might be interfering with my keyboard, and I'm wondering if this is trying to say that?  <answer270977> It means that particular device is active (in this case it's your Logitech mouse).  <comment340595> Your Bluetooth menulet tries to indicate that (a) M720 Triathlon (mouse) is paired and connected. <comment340596> Wow. They could have made that a lot more obvious! <comment340597> The other two are paired but not connected (e.g. after removing the batteries)
