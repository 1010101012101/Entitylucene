How can I rebind keyboard keys in OS X? <body> I need a custom keyboard shortcut for back slash kbd\/kbd.  I have created code~/Library/KeyBindings/DefaultKeyBinding.dict/code and put this in it:  precode{     "@ö" = ("insertText:", "\\"); } /code/pre  It is supposed to trigger back slash when pressing kbd⌘/kbd + kbdö/kbd  em(Yes, I have an "ö" character on my keyboard)./em  When trying to codesource/code the file, I get this error:  precode-bash: DefaultKeyBinding.dict: line 2: syntax error near unexpected token `(' -bash: DefaultKeyBinding.dict: line 2: `    "@ö" = ("insertText:", "\\");' /code/pre  What's wrong with the syntax? Is there a better way?  <answer220396> Why don't you use Karabiner ?     A powerful and stable keyboard customizer for OS X.      ul   liYou can easily customize from prepared settings. /li   liYou can also add your own settings by XML./li   /ul   https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/  <answer220412> To enable kbdCmd/kbdkbdÖ/kbd - kbd\/kbd just remap the key combo with Karabiner. The shortcut you need isn't pre-defined so you have to write your own:  ol liDownload, install and open Karabiner/li liOpen in the menulet Karabiner - Preferences/li liOpen the tab emMisc &amp; Uninstall/em/li liHit the button kbdOpen private.xml/kbd/li liOpen the file private.xml with an appropriate editor/li liEnter the customized keycode  Example 1 (kbdcmd/kbdkbdÖ/kbd - kbd\/kbd):  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt; &lt;root&gt;     &lt;item&gt;       &lt;name&gt;Command-Ö to Backslash&lt;/name&gt;       &lt;appendix&gt;(Change Command-Ö to \)&lt;/appendix&gt;       &lt;identifier&gt;remap.command_ö_to_backslash&lt;/identifier&gt;       &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::GERMAN_O_UMLAUT, MODIFIERFLAG_EITHER_LEFT_OR_RIGHT_COMMAND, KeyCode::KEY_7, ModifierFlag::SHIFT_L | ModifierFlag::OPTION_L&lt;/autogen&gt;     &lt;/item&gt; &lt;/root&gt; /code/pre  Example 2 (kbdcmd_R/kbdkbdÖ/kbd - kbd\/kbd cmd_R is the right command key only, kbdcmd_L/kbdkbdÖ/kbd doesn't have an output!):  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt; &lt;root&gt;     &lt;item&gt;       &lt;name&gt;Command_R-Ö to Backslash&lt;/name&gt;       &lt;appendix&gt;(Change Command_R-Ö to \)&lt;/appendix&gt;       &lt;identifier&gt;remap.command_r_ö_to_backslash&lt;/identifier&gt;       &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::GERMAN_O_UMLAUT, ModifierFlag::COMMAND_R, KeyCode::KEY_7, ModifierFlag::SHIFT_L | ModifierFlag::OPTION_L&lt;/autogen&gt;     &lt;/item&gt; &lt;/root&gt; /code/pre  Example 3 (kbdcmd_R/kbd - kbd\/kbd you can't use the right command key for any other purpose then):  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt; &lt;root&gt;     &lt;item&gt;       &lt;name&gt;Command_R to Backslash&lt;/name&gt;       &lt;appendix&gt;(Change Command_R to \)&lt;/appendix&gt;       &lt;identifier&gt;remap.command_r_to_backslash&lt;/identifier&gt;       &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::COMMAND_R, KeyCode::KEY_7, ModifierFlag::SHIFT_L | ModifierFlag::OPTION_L&lt;/autogen&gt;     &lt;/item&gt; &lt;/root&gt; /code/pre  Example 4 (kbdcmd_R/kbd - kbd\/kbd similar to example 3 but you can use the right command key as normal command key- hitting kbdcmd_R/kbd yields \ but kbdcmd_R/kbdkbdS/kbd saves files):  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt; &lt;root&gt;     &lt;item&gt;       &lt;name&gt;When you type Command_R only, send Backslash&lt;/name&gt;       &lt;appendix&gt;(Change Command_R lazy to \)&lt;/appendix&gt;       &lt;identifier&gt;remap.command_r_lazy_to_backslash&lt;/identifier&gt;       &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyOverlaidModifier__ KeyCode::COMMAND_R, KeyCode::VK_LAZY_COMMAND_R, KeyCode::KEY_7, ModifierFlag::SHIFT_L | ModifierFlag::OPTION_L&lt;/autogen&gt;     &lt;/item&gt; &lt;/root&gt; /code/pre/li liSave the file/li liOpen in the menulet Karabiner - Preferences the tab emChange Key/em/li liHit the ReloadXML button/li liEnable the remapping.

It's strange because a number of answers on StackExchange recommended this method for creating custom key bindings in OS X – that's why I got involved with it in the first place. <comment266901> Thanks very much for this! I especially found it powerful to bind `cmd_R` per your suggestion. <comment266904> @Winterflags By accident I made a forward_slash instead of a back_slash in all of the appendix sections. I amended that. It's only a cosmetic problem though. <comment321272> Note that Karabiner doesn't work on macOS Sierra, and the authors have indicated that substantial changes will be necessary before it will work on that OS. <comment321532> @Peter "answered Dec 21 '15" - Sierra September 16 <comment321816> Thanks MrMojoRinsin - I've always wondered what these "date" things were.  Seriously though, I was pointing this out so that anyone today (or in the near future) who might stumble across this post would know that your answer doesn't apply for macOS Sierra (yet).
