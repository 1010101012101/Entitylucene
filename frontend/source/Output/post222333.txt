pygame installed through homebrew does not work? <body> I ran codebrew install pygame/code, it installed it together with all the dependencies. Python v2.7.10 / OS X version 10.11.2  Whenever I codeimport pygame/code in a script it says this  precodeTraceback (most recent call last):  File "~/Documents/test.py", line 1, in &lt;module&gt; import pygame, random, sys ImportError: No module named pygame /code/pre  How do I fix this?  <answer222350> Have you checked which python are you running - the system python or the one you installed via homebrew?  I suspect the first.  As a test, try running  precode/usr/local/Cellar/python/2.7.10/bin/python /code/pre  and typing  precode&gt;&gt; import pygame /code/pre  If this works, you can make the brew version the default by using:  precodebrew link python /code/pre  <answer223434> After installing codebrew install pygame/code myself, it spit out this message:  precode==&gt; python -c import setuptools... --no-user-cfg install --prefix=/usr/local/Cellar/pygame/1.9.2a0 --single-version-externally-managed --record=installed.txt ==&gt; Caveats Python modules have been installed and Homebrew's site-packages is not in your Python sys.path, so you will not be able to import the modules this formula installed. If you plan to develop with these modules, please run:   mkdir -p /Users/packrd/Library/Python/2.7/lib/python/site-packages   echo 'import site; site.addsitedir("/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages")' &gt;&gt; /Users/packrd/Library/Python/2.7/lib/python/site-packages/homebrew.pth /code/pre  which apparently meant "we installed this, but your python won't be able to use it"  The oddness here appears to be that if you do codebrew install pygame/code it doesn't install python, just pygame (for dependencies to use?)  So either follow those directions (as printed on your screen) then it works, or do codebrew install python/code and use that python instead (/usr/local/bin/python instead of /usr/bin/python).  <comment269421> I hadn't even installed it through homebrew, I didn't see any such requirements when reading about it. But thanks! <comment269433> If you're going to install pygame through homebrew, using the homebrew python as well simplifies your life and setup effort greatly.
