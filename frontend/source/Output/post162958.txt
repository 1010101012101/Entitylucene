I can't disable find a phone on my iphone 5 <body> My iphone got wet and although it is switched off and the sim card is removed, it is still showing as online on icloud so I can't disable the find my phone to enable me to claim on the insurance.  If I erase the phone from icloud, (by clicking on the x next to the device) what does that mean to my data on my phone when I replace my phone?  Does this action of deleting the device from icloud just mean that I have only disabled the find my phone app?  <answer162959> When you are not able to remove the iPhone from Find my Iphone in iCloud, try turning on the device and then try to disable Find My iPhone with a mac or pc.

My old phone is still on my list, so i could compare. *Edit:* ahh… follow instructions for "Remove an iOS device you no longer have"
