System failed to reboot and stuck at gray screen <body> I have an early 2011 MBP that came with Snow Leopard. I have now upgraded it to Yosemite. Yesterday, when I tried restarting the computer it did not recover from gray screen (kernel panic?). I tried the SMC reset, PRAM reset. Safe reboot does not work. I went into the recovery mode and tried to do disk repair. I get an error message which states that the disk cannot be unmount. When I try reinstalling OS X (through Internet) I get an error saying OS X failed to download. Any suggestions?  <comment191244> Have you tried reinstalling the last OS that worked? You can search for "how to make Mavericks installer USB" to get instructions (obviously replace Mavericks with the OS you want to install, but the instructions are essentially the same.) <comment191245> Thanks for your comment. I have been using Yosemite for the past month and it was working well till yesterday. <comment191252> Are you certain it's a kernel-panic? That would have several languages telling you how to switch off the computer. Otherwise, it's a drive issue, which may show the Apple logo with a partial line underneath, or a grey 'no entry' sign. <comment191254> Initially the system was rebooting itself repeatedly with the message in several languages. Then I went into the recovery mode and tried repairing the disk, which failed. However, the next time I tried booting the machine back on again I encounter a complete gray screen (NO "no entry" sign). <comment192070> Have you tried reinstalling Yosemite? I also personally recommend that you keep a backup of your computer's contents.
