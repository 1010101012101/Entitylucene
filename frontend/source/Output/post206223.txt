"Computer admin" vs active account? <body> So someone stole my mac and I just got a new used one and am setting it up and I can't figure out how to get it back to the way I used to have it.  The way it was before, I was a user with no password-- I didn't have to login when the mac started. But whenever I wanted to make significant changes, like installations or settings adjustments, I would have to give credentials.  How do I get back to that? Is it simply a matter of having a normal account and an admin account, and only using the normal account for day-to-day things? I never deliberately made two separate accounts on the previous computer.  <answer206226> The best way to solve this is to have one user who is an Admin and has a password.  In strongSystem Preferences/strong navigate to strongUsers &amp; Groups/strong.   ul liEnsure you only have one active user./li liEnsure that user has a password./li /ul     strongNote/strong: You might need to click the strongLock/strong button to make changes.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0xxw7.png" alt="users and groups"  Then click strongBack/strong in strongSystem Preferences/strong. Navigate to strongSecurity &amp; Privacy/strong. Click the strongLock/strong button to make changes. strongUncheck/strong all three checkboxes:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/BJDCw.png" alt="security and privacy"  Now you will be able to turn on the computer without logging in. OS X will launch directly to the desktop. If you need to perform a Administrator level operation like using codesudo/code in Terminal, you will be prompted for the password. Magic! :)
