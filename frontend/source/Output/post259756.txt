Screen flashing colors while trying to boot Windows 7 from a USB <body> I was trying to use Windows 7 on my Macbook Pro (Late 2011, Lion 10.7.5), so I did all the steps, created a partition, installed Windows 7 in my USB, and when I restarted it, the USB wouldn't show up. I installed rEFIt, and now it showed up, but when I selected "Boot Windows from WININSTALL" and pressed ENTER, the screen started to flash various colors, and different shades and gradients of gray. Wth is happening?
