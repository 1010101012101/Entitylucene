How to copy a book from iBooks with highlighting? <body> I have a book on my iMac at work which has highlighting all over the book. But when I put the book in my Dropbox and open it on my MacBook at home there are no highlights. Is there a way to preserve the highlighting?  iBooks is the app that I use and I made all highlights with it.  iBooks version 1.5 on iMac 1.6 on MacBook  The book is .epub file  <answer295161> I assume you added an ePub file to iBooks.app on your iMac and added highlightings there.  Yes, you can in fact sync your highlightings/notes/bookmarks between multiple devices running macOS and/or iOS.  hr  Please follow these steps to sync your highlights:  strongPrepare iMac/strong  ol liOn your iMac go to codeSystem Preferences &gt; iCloud/code./li liMake sure that you are stronglogged into/strong your strongiCloud/strong account.

You can't use another cloud storage provider for this.  Unfortunately there is no other way to sync them other than to re-add your edits by hand.  <comment372546> Please let us know which version(s) of macOS / OS X you use. Also, is the book you added highlights to an ePub? <comment372554> Even though I can't make it like you described it. I voted you up because it's a good answer if you have the same apple account on both devices. <comment372557> You will find a lot of useful info regarding your question here: https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/154561/how-do-i-collect-all-of-my-notes-and-highlights-from-ibooks
