How to automount UDF partition with strange partition ID <body> I have two partitions on my usb hdd:  precode #: id  cyl  hd sec -  cyl  hd sec [     start -       size] ------------------------------------------------------------------------  1: AF 1023 254  63 - 1023 254  63 [         2 - 2927108416] HFS+          2: 06 1023 254  63 - 1023 254  63 [2927108419 -  979855037] DOS &gt; 32MB   /code/pre  The first one is formatted to HFS+, the second to UDF. The partition ID (codeDOS &gt; 32MB/code aka code0x06/code) comes from several manuals and required to make one weird OS tom recognize the partition. The problem is that the UDF partition is not [un]mounted automatically, I need to codemount /dev/disk3p2 /some/path/code / codeumount /dev/disk3p2/code manually as root and it works fine.  Is it possible to make it mount automatically?
