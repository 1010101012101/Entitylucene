Prevent iMac from sleeping, for VPN login? <body> We have an iMac in the office, and I have been getting inconsistent access when trying to log in to it. The firewall isn't going down, since I can connect to the VPN. After discussing it with the people at the office, we suspect that the iMac is going to sleep.   Is it possible to keep the iMac "awake" 24 hours a day? How do I instruct the people at the office to configure the iMac? What settings should be changed? The iMac is running OS X Lion 10.7.3.   <answer44963> There are two main things that would make connecting to the iMac difficult over VPN, the machine going to sleep being one and being assigned a different IP address over DHCP being the other.  The settings for sleep are stored in the Energy Saver preference pane in System Preferences.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/z7O8D.png" alt="Energy Saver"  There is a slider for Computer Sleep, slide this to 'Never'. This will mean the machine will never sleep automatically.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/tmKOF.png" alt="Never sleep"  There are options for waking over LAN too if you desperately need things to sleep.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fTZl3.png" alt="Wake on LAN"  hr  If you still experience issues after this you may find that you need to configure a manual IP in the firewall and in the Network preference pane, again in System Preferences.  I don't have a 10.7 system here for screenshots otherwise I'd add some. If someone edits with some or if I get home to grab some that would be ideal.  <answer44986> You can disable sleeping in the codeEnergy Saver/code preference pane of codeSystem Preferences/code.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LWdGL.png" alt="enter image description here"  hr  Alternatively, you can use a free app called strongCaffeine/strong to easily prevent your Mac from sleeping just with a click of the mouse.  Both work exactly the same, but Caffeine makes it easier to dynamically switch between the two settings.  <answer148225> If you need more control over when to or not to sleep, take a look at Wimoweh. It allows you to never sleep when: specific apps are running, system conditions such has high CPU usage, network connections, etc. $1 on the Mac App store
