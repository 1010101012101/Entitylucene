How to do a clean OS X 10.11 reinstall when shift key stuck <body> My left shift key is stuck down (wiring-wise, not just mechanically stuck) - fine, I changed my password to be all caps and once I'm logged in I use Karabiner and Seil to disable the key, and because my left pinky muscle memory still thinks there's a shift key over there, I've got a plastic lever that depresses my left control key when I go for the shift key and have that remapped to shift.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dhRSBs.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Yesterday I had to upgrade from OS X 10.9 to install Xcode without a developer account. But I wasn't paying attention - now there's an even new operating system, OS X 10.11, which I accidentally installed instead!  I'd ideally like to do a clean install of OS X 10.10, or at least a clean installation of OSX 10.11 instead of the migrated one I have now. How install either of these with a stuck shift key?  ul liI can't use any startup key combinations besides safe mode, and normal mode by holding another key during startup/li liThe system preferences "Startup Disk" panel doesn't show a recovery partition, netboot, or a bootable USB stick that I made with codecreateinstallmedia/code (though I believe the recovery partition exists)/li /ul  Similar question from 2011: Ideas for reinstalling Mac OS X on a 2009 Macbook Pro whose shift key is constantly stuck down?  <comment256473> Replace your keyboard. <comment256495> If you turn on caps lock, the behavior of the shift key is inverted. Perhaps that will help
