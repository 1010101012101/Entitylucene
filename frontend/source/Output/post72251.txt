Command-W not working correctly on Safari <body> kbd⌘/kbdkbdW/kbd always worked in my Safari like this:   ol liit closes all tabs/li liif there's no tab, it closes the window./li /ol  Now, #2 is not working anymore.  Any clues?  <answer72283> Go to your codeSystem Preferences…/code application, and select the codeKeyboard/code pane.  Hit the codeKeyboard Shortcuts/code tab on top, and codeApplication Shortcuts/code on the left. Is there an entry for codeClose Tab ⌘W/code or an entry for codeClose Window/code that's set to something else? If so, remove it with the +- widgets at the bottom of the window.  Without knowing what other applications you're running, that's the first place I can think of to check what might be intercepting it.  <comment83893> Did you try without any extensions enabled? <comment83907> yes, no change at all. <comment83914> So you have one Safari window open, with one tab, press Cmd-W and nothing happens? <comment83940> yes. Nothing happens. <comment83942> When I first detected this problem the behavior of safari was this: CMD W did not close any tab or window. THen I went to this window and added an entry for Close Tab as CMD W. Now If I have a safari window with multiple tabs, CMD close the tabs. When all tabs are closed and I am with just one safari window without tabs, CMD W does nothing. In the past, CMD W would close all tabs than the window where there was not more tabs to close. <comment83945> AHA! That phrase of yours "applications intercepting it", lighted a bulb in my brain! That's it. I have installed an upgrade of Better Touch Tool that was using CMD W and crapping Safari!!! /&%#/&%#$!!!!  Thanks
