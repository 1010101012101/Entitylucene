Changing the default keyboard shortcuts in iTerm2 <body> In iTerm2, kbd⌘W/kbd will close the current shell. In Vim, kbdCtrl W/kbd, by default, sets you up for a window command (e.g., kbdCtrl W/kbdkbdh/kbd moves to the window on the left, etc.)  I am new to using a Mac and haven't got completely used to the Command key, yet. As such, I am emregularly/em closing my terminal session accidentally. (Fortunately, I'm running tmux, so my session is preserved, but it's nonetheless getting pretty annoying!)  Is there a way to change keyboard shortcuts in iTerm2? I realise it's probably unlikely and easier to change the Vim keybindings, but I don't want to change what I'm used to.  <answer155725> Just tested this in Yosemite. If you re-map the keyboard shortcut for "Close" in the System  Keyboard  Shortcuts, then that changes the kbd⌘+W/kbd behavior.
