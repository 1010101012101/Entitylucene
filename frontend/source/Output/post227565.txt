Might have spoiled the flash drive while trying to create a bootable disk on Yosemite <body> Basically I was following the steps given in the following site: How to create a bootable USB stick on OS X  I did not get a screenshot of the terminal, but when going through step 8, it was successful. But I believe I pulled the drive out without ejecting. It showed "THE DISK YOU INSERTED WAS NOT READABLE BY THIS COMPUTER" thereafter and it keeps showing the same message every time I connect it now. It gives options " Initialize or Ignore or Eject". What should i do?  Now the drive doesn't open either in Mac or PC. I had formatted it earlier in exFAT. And this is what Disk Utility shows when I connect it:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4bTyR.png" alt="new partition?"  I don't understand where this partition of 2.3 MB came from. I don't mind losing data, but I need the drive to work properly again.  <comment277400> Change Partition Layout to 1 Partition & see if it will erase, then start over. If you were really unlucky you may have triggered the firmware write protect which makes it a nice new door-wedge. <comment277405> oh my god..it actually worked! thanks a ton :)
