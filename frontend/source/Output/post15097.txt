What is the best Homebrew version for an iBook running Tiger? <body> I have an old iBook running Mac OS Tiger, and I want to install the Homebrew package manager on it. Which branch should I choose ?  ul liThe Tiger one?/li liThe PPC one?/li liAnother one?/li /ul  <answer15099> Looks like they add PPC support on the Tiger (see this commit), but the default behavior was to redirect to the PPC branch.  So I'd say stronggo to the PPC branch/strong to be safe.  hr  You might want to contact the developer, too. They're usually eager to help in those kind of community (Github) and he's on Twitter.  You have two choices : the one who made the fork or the original developer  <answer15136> According to this issue, it seems like the Tiger branch is the most exactly accurate in that case.
