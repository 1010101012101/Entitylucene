Customize opening state of Character Viewer <body> When I open the Character Viewer, there is a button on the top right corner that allows shrinking the viewer to a smaller size (and more compact organization).  I'd like the Character Viewer to open in this compact state by default. Is there a way to customize the app for that behaviour?   More generally, where can one find information on ways for customization of Apple OSX apps that go beyond the menus offered in the Preferences tab? These menus are very pretty, but very limited in term of number of options they offer.  <comment260441> If you open it with Command-Control-Space, it should show up using the last view mode. Is that not working for you? (I have had trouble in the past with similar situations but never found a fix) <comment260443> @0942v8653: Great! This works for me. Don't know why but it works :-) How does one find such keyboard shortcuts in a systematic way?
