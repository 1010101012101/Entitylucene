Python launching problems OS X <body> I'm trying to install python on mac OS X 10.7.5. I installed it from MacPort and I think before I did, I screwed up code$PATH/code somehow. It seems to install fine but then when I try to run codeipython/code I get   precode-bash: ipython: command not found. /code/pre  I thought it had something to do with the path and when I do code/bin/echo $PATH/code I get something that seems really weird to me:   precodeopt/local/bin:/opt/local/sbin:/opt/local/bin:/opt/local/sbin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/X11/bin /code/pre  <answer89143> You need to install ipython in addition to python:  precode$ port search ipython  py-ipython @0.13.2 (python) An enhanced Interactive Python shell /code/pre  With  precode$ sudo port select --set ipython ipython24 /code/pre  you can then select the version you want.  It ill be installed in  precode$ type ipython ipython is /opt/local/bin/ipython /code/pre  Check that your codePATH/code begins with code/opt/local/bin/code and not with codeopt/local/bin//code (notice the beginning code//code)  <comment104552> What exactly do you consider wierd in PATH?
