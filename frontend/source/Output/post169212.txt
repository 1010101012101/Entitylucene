What is the differences between Dreamweaver_14_LS20.dmg and Dreamweaver_13_LS20.dmg? <body> I find that there are two versions of Dreamweaver CC for Mac OSX, one is Dreamweaver_14_LS20 and another is Dreamweaver_13_LS20. Can anyone tell me what is the exactly differences between these two versions.  By the way, Where can I download the full installer of Adobe Software on the official web? I only find the codeCreativeCloudInstall/code which will download the others later.  <answer169215> The number refers to the strongversion number of Dreamweaver/strong. For a changelog, see:  ul lihttp://helpx.adobe.com/dreamweaver/using/whats-new.html/li /ul  <answer169216> Dreamweaver CC came in two major versions: the initial CC release (v13) and the CC 2014 release (v14). From the file names, you can infer which is which.  As for a "full installer", there is no such animal now. You install CC apps individually through the Creative Cloud Manager which downloads and installs the selected app(s).  <comment198701> Is there any differences between v13 and v14? <comment198703> Honestly I haven't used either of them to offer an opinion. <comment199773> After the tries of the two version, It is exactly two different versions, and there are no relationships between these versions. Thanks for your answer!
