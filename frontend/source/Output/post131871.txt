How can I set the camera to default to HDR on? <body> I'd like to set my (iOS7) iPhone's camera to always default to HDR strongon/strong. I do enable HDR when I'm taking pictures, but it always seems like the iPhone forgets the setting and goes back to HDR off.  <answer131875> This depends on the "Flash" settings you select:  ul liFlash-Auto : HDR - Auto/li liFlash-Off : HDR - On/li liFlash-On : HDR - OFF/li /ul  emSo, whenever you force the Flash ON, HDR reverts to OFF. Alternatively, turning Flash OFF retains the HDR ON setting/em   <answer131938> On a stock (non-jailbroken) iPhone running iOS 7, this appears to not be possible (see for example https://discussions.apple.com/message/23530580#23530580#23530580). Yes, turning on the flash will automatically disable HDR, but even if the flash is left off the camera will eventually revert to non-HDR mode.
