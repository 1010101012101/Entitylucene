Battery lasts a month on an iPad? <body> iMac power supply died, and I decided to replace instead of fix.  The day after I ordered the replacement, my iPad screen failed to light the screen.  That I intend to fix, but I didn’t want to touch until I could load the backups form the old disk drive onto the new computer.  Took nearly a month (long story) for the new computer to arrive, during which the iPad has been untouched on the coffee table.  Every once in a while, including today, it makes the new mail sound.  And I just confirmed with the iPhone that it is still online and reporting its location.  When it was in full use, it was down to 20% or less every night.  I expect sleep to use less power, but that really surprises me.  strongIs that big a difference typical?/strong  <answer125543> It sure is!   http://youtu.be/GX2hy-L94T0?t=9m13s Here's a video of Steve Jobs talking about the original iPad's battery.   All iPads have 10 hours of battery life but 1 month of standby time.   <comment146808> I guess the screen really accounts for most of the energy usage. <comment146930> Wasn't that before push notifications? I'd expect a large drop in battery life with notifications running. <comment146943> Even if standby includes downloading lots of mail and reporting it’s location for Find My iPad?
