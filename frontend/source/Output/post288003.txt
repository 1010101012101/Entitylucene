How to move mouse with 2 fingers on trackpad? <body> How can I change the default behaviour for the two-fingers gesture from scrolling to mouse movement?  <answer288010> There are a couple of apps that I know of that does this kind of thing:   ul liBetterTouchTool/li liMagicPrefs/li /ul  Screenshots from BTT (left) and MP (right)   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/w37ibm.jpg" alt="enter image description here" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jyaOom.png" alt="enter image description here"  emDisclaimer:  These are not tools I use personally (no need) so I cannot vouch for them. However, BTT has a trial and MP is free./em  So, your risk is minimal if you want to test either of these out.  <comment363672> MagicPrefs doesn't work for what I want, and i can't find an option in BetterTouchTool
