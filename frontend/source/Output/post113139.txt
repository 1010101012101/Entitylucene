Where is Preview.app's .savedState? <body> Since Mac OS X Lion introduced the Resume feature, where applications save their open windows and document states, compatible applications have stored their window states to disk in the directory code~/Library/Saved Application State/code, in directories like codecom.apple.finder.savedState/code.  However in my codeSaved Application State/code directory, there is no codecom.apple.Preview.savedState/code. When I launch Preview.app, it does remember all its open windows and their states, but I cannot find where the state is stored on disk. It does not appear in the usual location. Can you help me find where Preview.app is saving its window states?  <answer113141> A Finder search for codecom.apple.preview/code with system files "are included" revealed the location of the file:   code~/Library/Containers/com.apple.Preview/Data/Library/Saved Application State/com.apple.Preview.savedState/code.  Thanks.
