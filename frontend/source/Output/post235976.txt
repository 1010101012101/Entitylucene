Unable to account for 23.6 GB of disk space <body> I have a 13-inch MacBook Air, and have been using it for about a year now. There are 23.6 GB of memory that appear to be missing from my hard drive. About This Mac - Storage shows 91GB of files, of which 61GB are "Other": img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/SQSr0.png" alt="I can account for the files that are not under &quot;Other&quot;."  The command codedf -h/code agrees, showing 91GB used (command output shown below):  precode    Homes-MacBook-Air:~ BrandonWork$ df -h Filesystem      Size   Used  Avail Capacity  iused   ifree %iused      Mounted on /dev/disk1     112Gi   91Gi   21Gi    82% 23864730 5456996   81%   / devfs          188Ki  188Ki    0Bi   100%      651       0  100%   /dev map -hosts       0Bi    0Bi    0Bi   100%        0       0  100%   /net map auto_home    0Bi    0Bi    0Bi   100%        0       0  100%   /home /dev/disk0s3   620Mi  548Mi   72Mi    89%   140256   18434   88%       /Volumes/Recovery HD /dev/disk3s2    16Mi  9.8Mi  6.2Mi    62%     2503    1581   61%       /Volumes/Disk Inventory X /code/pre  However, here the problem arises, as when I examine the disk, only 67.4GB are actually used: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0TiAo.png" alt="What the hell?"  I have six user accounts on this laptop due to my family borrowing it repeatedly, and have run Disk Inventory X on all of them, as I was told that other users' files could account for it, as they are not visible to non-admins. None of them had more than 2GB of files. I have also used OmniDisk Sweeper, with similar results. I have seen all of the following possible problems and solutions, to no avail:  ol liSwap files (they are seen by Disk Inventory X)/li liTemporary caches (restart your computer; didn't help)/li liFalse volumes in /volumes (checked; don't have anything weird there)/li liViruses (multiple scans with different programs turn up nothing)/li /ol  On a previous computer, I had a similar problem with eaten memory; turned out to be WinRAR generating huge .txt files, and these could be found with Disk Inventory X.  <answer235980> Both About this Mac and codedf/code seem to agree that you have 91GiB used, 21GiB free on code//code, which adds up to the volume of your 112GiB (120GB) hard drive.    The problem must be with the list of files Disk Inventory X scans.   Run codedu -s/code as a superuser starting from code//code and then going deeper into the filesystem to get a more accurate picture of your disk space usage.    hr  Keep in mind:br About this Mac and Finder display space in GB (base 10, 1GB = 1000MB)br codedf -h/code and codedu -h/code show results in GiB (base 2, 1GiB = 1024MiB)br codedf -H/code and codedu -H/code show results in GBbr Many GUI tools display file size in GiB while labeling it as GB  <answer294157> Half a year later, turns out this was a known issue with OS X Yosemite and Spotlight indexing. Upgrading to Sierra fixed it.  <comment288659> If you run a command like `sudo du -sm /Users/*` that will let you know all the allocations on user home folders. You can run that from Recovery HD to avoid false reporting or external mounts - but that's an oddball situation. Are you averse to using a tool like DaisyDisk that can run as administrator / root so that you can get a better picture with one scan than needing to juggle 6 runs of the program you are using <comment288672> The "About this Mac" storage summary is somewhat unreliable. It always show weird figures.
