Email account deleted and 2.69 GB still showing up <body> I deleted my email account on my iPhone 6 because it has 2.69 GB of mail and attachments. The 2.69 still shows up with the deleted email account. What can I do to regain the storage?  I also rebooted the phone. It acted up when I shot an 11 minute video and tried emailing it.  <answer268739> Have you checked your Drafts folder? The email draft with the video attachment should be there. Try to delete that specific email draft.   <comment337509> Try restarting your phone. This may help clear out the data.
