Naming conventions for naming files that would start with a dot usually <body> How should i name music artists beginning with a dot (such as .38 special https://musicbrainz.org/artist/0330a83d-f61e-4989-adb3-afce3943c3ba ) so that they are not hidden from Finder because of the dot.  I realize that just removing the dot does the trick, but I'm looking to see if there is a for sensible naming convention for this.  <answer144939> You could try some Unicode 'dot equivalent' likebr · [Unicode U+0087 UTF-8 C2 B7] orbr ․ [Unicode U+2024 UTF-8 E2 80 A4] orbr ⠠ [U+2820 UTF-8 E2 A0 A0]  Try the Character Viewer in System Prefs  Keyboard  Keyboard. Type 'dot' &amp; see what may work  <answer144959> If this is in iTunes you do not need to worry as iTunes will automatically use an underscore in place of certain characters. For example, the artist folder for code.38 Special/code will be named code_38 Special/code and the folder for code“Weird Al” Yankovic/code or code"Weird Al" Yankovic/code em(curly or straight quotes)/em will be named code_Weird Al_ Yankovic/code  <comment170808> Ah thanks its not directly iTunes but it is Music so seems like a sensible to follow that naming convention <comment170809> Thanks that a good idea, but because its Music related Im going to go with the iTunes naming conventions answer.
