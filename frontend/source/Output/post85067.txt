Alt-. and vertical bar (pipe) on terminal <body> On linux consoles I always use kbdAlt/kbd + kbd./kbd to get the last argument of the previous command in history.  for example if I had  precodels /tmp/test /code/pre  as last command, and if I type   precoderm Alt - /code/pre  this will result in   precoderm /tmp/test /code/pre  On an strongApple terminal/strong, this doesn't work by default but I found an answer here:  Equivalent to alt-. in terminal     You have to change the Terminalâ€™s behavior to the alt key acts as a meta key   Now there is a new problem: I cannot strongaccess the pipe kbd|/kbd/strong anymore (kbdAlt/kbd + kbd7/kbd)  How can I use both?  <answer85152> esc+. inserts the last argument by default.  iTerm can change just the other option key to meta:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/F5oZf.png" alt=""  Or if you change to the US layout, it doesn't have any ASCII characters under option.  For example code\e7\e./code normally inserts the seventh argument of the previous command, so there isn't really any way to get both.  <comment97992> What keyboard layout do you have? On the US layout the pipe character is underneath the delete key <comment98136> I use the german QWERTZ Layout, as I said,| is on Alt+7 normally <comment98162> esc + . works, thanks
