OS X Calendar email alerts â€” send via Outlook? <body> I'm using Mac Outlook as my primary email program (my company uses Exchange and it's the "supported" program on Mac), but I've configured Contacts/Calendar to also talk to the Exchange Server.  I like the way Calendar handles alerts, and the fact that it can send ememail/em reminders, but I'd need them to be sent via Outlook as I'd rather not have 2 copies of my Exchange Inbox on the disk (to save space).  Is there a way to tell Calendar to use Outlook for outgoing email? For now, it asks me to configure Mail.app every time I set a reminder to send email.  <answer112595> ul liEither you dummy configure Mail so you can access strongPreferences/strong from the strongMail/strong menu and set in the strongGeneral/strong" pane your default email reader (if not working from Outlook preferences)./li liOr you may type in the following in Terminal:  precodedefaults write com.apple.LaunchServices LSHandlers -array-add '{ LSHandlerURLScheme = "mailto"; LSHandlerRoleAll = "com.microsoft.Outlook"; }' /code/pre  This should add an entry to the "strong~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.LaunchServices.plist/strong"  Using Xcode you add a dictionary item with the two following items:  precode&lt;key&gt;LSHandlerURLScheme&lt;/key&gt; &lt;string&gt;mailto&lt;/string&gt; /code/pre    precode&lt;key&gt;LSHandlerRoleAll&lt;/key&gt; &lt;string&gt;com.microsoft.Outlook&lt;/string&gt; /code/pre/li liUsing strongRCDefaultApp/strong could do the trick but since it hasn't been update since 2009 I'm not sure it's still working./li /ul  <comment132321> Thanks for the suggestion, but it seems that mailto: is already configured properly as typing "mailto:address@example.com in the address bar of the browser (or running the command "open mailto:address@example.com") gets me a blank Outlook message with the address in the to: field... <comment132322> I've also configured a dummy account in Mail to get to the pref pane and the default Email reader is set to Outlook <comment132323> To top it off, leveraging your suggestion, I've run the command `defaults read com.apple.LaunchServices LSHandlers` and the result for mailto: is already what you suggested as a value:         {         LSHandlerRoleAll = "com.microsoft.outlook";         LSHandlerURLScheme = mailto;     },
