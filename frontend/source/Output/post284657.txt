My current iOS version is strong10.3.1/strong from more than a month.  Any help or suggestion to get back my backup would be highly appreciated. what should I do now?  Thanks million  <comment358977> Did you read and follow https://support.apple.com/en-au/HT201351 before  giving your iPhone away? <comment359100> I didn't read, but I've followed the same procedure except "Backup your device" and I don't need to erase the whole data coz I've given it to my friend only.  How come this effects my problem? I didn't face this issue earlier, with the same procedure followed.
