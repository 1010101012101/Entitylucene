Armenian HM QWERTY keyboard - where's Շշ (sh)? <body> Here's screenshot of available keys in Armenian HM QWERTY keyboard:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2ICYx.png" alt="enter image description here"  The thing that bothers me a lot - I can not find the "Շ" letter ("sh"). For instance, here's screenshot of the second keyboard available - Armenian Western QWERTY (Շ is marked with red dot):  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/EnI3W.png" alt="enter image description here"  So, the question is, how should I time sh on HM QWERTY?  <answer141041> Շ is at option + shift + s on HM Qwerty.  շ is at option + s.  You can use Keyboard Viewer to find such things  http://support.apple.com/kb/PH13746  <comment166187> Wow! Quite strange since sh is quite common in Armenian. Thank you for the tip. <comment166194> @shabunc  Is there perhaps a dialect where this character is a lot less common?  It seems odd to have two qwerty keyboards, one called "western", for this language. <comment166204> indeed, there are two major dialects, Western and Eastern but sh is used in both with the same frequency. OK, may be just some historical reasons. <comment166218> It would be fairly simple to make a custom layout which puts that character in a better place using http://scripts.sil.org/ukelele
