iTunes store has not registered some of my purchases <body> Some of the songs in my iTunes library have problems: Most of the songs I purchased work fine, but I have several songs purchased from iTunes a while ago, which are noticeable on my iTunes library on my mac, but I am not allowed to play them as the system says I already have authorized 5 computers for this item. I have been in contact with iTunes support. All other computers have been de-authorized by them. I have then authorized the one mac I am using. iTunes store tells me I have only one authorized computer, but has no record of these particular purchases, and the problem persists. Whenever I want to play these songs I am denied by the error stating that I already have 5 computers authorized. iTunes support suggested that I delete these songs and redownload via iCloud. When I did this, the result was that the song was lost, since it was not in the iCloud iTunes library. Seems that the only way to get these songs that i already paid for is to pay again. Or is there any alternative?  <comment114107> Is it possible you bought those songs with a different iTunes account? <comment114130> DonÂ´t think so: I have only had one iTunes account, and the info on the songs says they were bought with my regular iTunes account
