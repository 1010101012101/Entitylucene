Can I have an iTunes library on a hard drive connected only to my wi-fi router? <body> I have both Windows and Mac laptop computers with hard drives that are too small to fit my music collection or backup iPhones.  I would like to purchase a hard drive that I can connect to my wi-fi router which can include parts of my iTunes library not on my laptop, and could be a place for me to backup my phone.  For example I was thinking about the Seagate Central 3 TB Shared Storage Ethernet External Hard Drive.  Does anyone know of a way to do what I want with this or any other product?  Thanks.  <answer104360> Yes, you can store your iTunes library on shared drive. Its not really any different than an external drive attached via USB or the like.  Apple KB: iTunes for Mac: Moving your iTunes Media folder  If you are looking to run home sharing, or stream to an AppleTV or the like you still need a computer to handle that.
