How To Check iPhone 6s' Chip Manufacturer Without Openning the Case <body> There is a discussion on the Web about the relation between a Samsung chip and battery life in iPhone 6s models.   I can not find an app that sees if my iPhone 6s does have a Samsung chip or not. Is there anything I can do to find out, through my Mac connection for example?  <comment253293> I'm not even going to link to the app I found that purports to measure just the CPU type and log that to the internet since it is developer signed for enterprise use and those have recently been linked to spyware and malware. caveat emptor and do measure your devices battery life - if it's not running as advertised, you can surely ask Apple to have a look at it regardless of what internals might have been used to make your iPhone.
