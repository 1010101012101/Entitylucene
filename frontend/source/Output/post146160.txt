Hibernate/Sleep problem <body> Whenever my MBP 9.1 is in sleep mode and plugged in and I unplug the charger, machine turns on and stays on for about 2 minutes and then gets to sleep again.  Is there something I can change so when it's in sleep mode and I unplug or plug charger, stays at that state and doesn't hibernate or hybrid sleep or whatever it's name is given by Apple?  I basically want to disable hibernate altogether by automatic means.  My OS X version is 10.9.4.  Thanks.  <answer146161> Go to System Preferences  Energy Saver. Change the sleep settings for both on Battery and While charinging. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qVxTJ.png" alt="enter image description here"  Alternatively you could use NoSleep to make sure your MBP never goes to sleep.  <comment172257> I do want the machine to go to sleep, I don't want it to go to hibernate mode, i.e. writing memory's content on hard disk, which takes a lot of time and prevents me to unplug the machine and be good to go. <comment172297> @user3249323 check your mode by running this command on terminal  pmset -g | grep hibernatemode <comment172558> It returns 3 which as I searched is default for modern MBP's.  So how can I have sleep when I close the lid but no hibernation or basically any activity that writes memory content on hard disk? hibernate mode 0?
