directory structure between mac osx and linux <body> I found that there are some differents between Max osx and linux jsut like ubuntu, etc. is there any introduction about that, or is there any one can make a introduction.  for example:  ol liubuntu: /usr/lib//li li10.8.2 osx:   ol li/usr/lib/li li/usr/libexec/li /ol/li /ol  <answer79518> While you can shove libraries anywhere you want, and use OS X very similarly to Linux, I suspect you are after information on "the OS X way" of doing things, in which case:  Your question is too broad. While similar in some ways, there are many fundamental differences than between software packaging on OS X and something like Ubuntu - well beyond "stuff goes here on Linux, and here on OS X".  For example, libraries typically live in "bundles" rather than folders like in code/usr/lib/code - either as code.Framework/code bundles which live in code/Library/Frameworks/code or code~/Library/Frameworks/code (the framework bundles include headers, support versioning etc). Or shared libraries may live in application bundles... etc - each of these is a big topic by itself.  Without a more specific question, any answer shorter than a small book may not be very informative..  This article explains some of the basic locations, and their Linux-equivalents  Apple's documentation on this kind of stuff is extensive (e.g the intro to Frameworks)  <comment91799> Even better Apple doc is [FileSystem basics](http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/FileManagement/Conceptual/FileSystemProgrammingGUide/FileSystemOverview/FileSystemOverview.html) <comment91815> Thanks guys! I'm gonna check those out too +1 to you both.
