Screen sharing between a MacBook Pro and an iMac <body> I have an iMac 21.5" and a MacBook pro. How can I connect the macbook pro to use the iMac's screen?  <answer25915> All you need is a mini display to mini display chord; one end goes in your iMac &amp; the other end goes into your MacBpook Pro  This video shows exactly what you need &amp; how to do it  <answer89897> You can simply use the screen sharing feature in OS X - it's really easy to use. I've written an easy to follow tutorial about how to use it:  http://machow2.com/how-to-share-screen-on-mac/  <comment29453> Which models, when were they purchased? As far as I know only the 27" can handle it, but if you can specify which one it might make it easier to work out. <comment29470> Answers on Ask Different need to be more than just a link.
