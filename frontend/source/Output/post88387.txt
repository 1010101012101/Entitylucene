Why isn't my ipad saving videos I was emailed? <body> I have an ipad mini and a freind recently emailed me a video. When I go into the corner and click save video it then does not appear in any of my photo albums.I have been trying for ages and it is very important at I save this video.  <answer88393> Perhaps saving it differently will work for you:  ol liTap and hold on the video thumbnail (in the email message) that you would like to save./li liSelect "Save to Camera Roll"./li liOpen Photos.app./li liSelect the "Albums" tab. /li liSelect "Camera Roll"./li liThe video should be the last one in there./li /ol  If this doesn't work, try sending the video to yourself.   <answer88401> Did you check in the Camera Roll? It isn't going to be in an album if you save it on your iphone from your iphone.
