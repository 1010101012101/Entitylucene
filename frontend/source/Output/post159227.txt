The older question was before iOS 8 and was about mixing iMessage accounts and the lack of an opt out for the mapping of SMS to iMessage. This is a new issue enabled on iOS 8 whereby SMS and phone calls can be received on other OS X and iOS devices that are not cellular devices themselves. <comment187154> @bmike sure - I was assuming iMessage rather than SMS, though it's not truly clear from the OP.
