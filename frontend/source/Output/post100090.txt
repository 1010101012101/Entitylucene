Suppress event times in week view? <body> Within codeiCal/code the preferences settings let choose the use of event times in month view.  I would like to obtain the same choice for the strongweek/strong view.  I'm actually using iCal on Snow Leopard, which I will shortly upgrade to Lion and Mountain Lion. Is this choice possible within iCal on these different OS X versions? Is there any progress on this possibility through these versions of the OS (this will be a key incentive to accelerate the OS X upgrade in such a case).  Additionally, is there any documentation about this level of tuning for iCal.  <answer102694> Yes. It is possible from the codePreferences &gt; General/code menu of codeCalendar/code to activate the display of event times within the emweek/em view too:  precodeShow event times /code/pre  <comment117829> I looked at `defaults` and it's not an option there.
