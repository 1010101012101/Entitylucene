Homebrew - brew docter command not working <body> When I installed wine I followed all the instructions, but then when I went to type 'brew docter' into terminal a error appears saying Error: Unknown command: docter I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling it but the same appears. what should I do?  <answer156480> Check your spelling  it is not "docter"  it is "doctor"  So, you can try /usr/local/bin/brew doctor  <comment183954> Are you sure it's not `brew doctor` ? <comment184025> Wow I am so stupid, thanks for the answer. <comment184091> just a honest mistake :), you should see my spelling before the spellchecker corrections.
