In iTerm2 Command Click on URLS does not work when inside a tmux session <body> When not inside a tmux session, codeCommand-Click/code on URLs works flawlessly.  How can I make links clickable in strongiTerm2/strong when inside a tmux session?br When hitting codeCommand/code the mouse pointer changes to the img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vAuiS.png" alt="hand pointer" icon, but when clicking on an URL, nothing happens.    Note I have the following settings inside my code.tmux.conf/code   precode[...] # Enable mouse mode set -g mode-mouse on set -g mouse-resize-pane on set -g mouse-select-pane on set -g mouse-select-window on  # Mouse pane switching set-option -g mouse-select-pane on [...] /code/pre  Disabling them and then reloading code.tmux.conf/code does not resolve the issue.  iTerm2 Version is codeBuild 1.0.0.20140629/codebr tmux -V 1.9a  <answer147129> To use the normal mouse behavior in codetmux/code you have to keep codealt/code pressed. So click on the link while pressing codecmd/code+codealt/code. The same applies when selecting text.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gSPsf.gif"  <answer267618> The top answer may work when using regular tmux, but it will not work when using iTerm2+tmux integration with the code-CC/code option. For Cmd+Click to use your "Semantic History" Profile Preference, you have to install iTerm2 Shell Integration. Also I have found it best to create a seperate code.tmux.conf.iterm/code with tmux integration, then create aliases for creating and attaching integrated sessions.  precodealias tcs="tmux -f ~/.tmux.conf.iterm -CC new -s" alias tca="tmux -f ~/.tmux.conf.iterm -CC attach -t" /code/pre  The only think in my code~/.tmux.conf.iterm/code file is codeset-option -g default-terminal screen-256color/code  <comment173448> Thank you for trying to help, but your suggestion does not work for me. <comment173459> Ah, I only figure it out now. You have iTerm2 1.0. That's probably why it doesn't work for you. I'm using 2.0. <comment173461> If you upgrade to 2.0 this works. <comment173464> I just realized that it does now! Thx for the gif! I have no clue what is different now though. :) <comment173465> What software did you use to create the gif? <comment173551> @elementz I used [this script](https://github.com/jclem/gifify). <comment173555> good to know. thx.
