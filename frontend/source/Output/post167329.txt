How can I get Terminal to accept mouse clicks the way PuTTY does (eg inside elinks)? <body> When running ncurses-based tools like elinks, PuTTY (for Windows) allows you to click on links.  However, in Terminal, you need to navigate via keyboard.  Is there a way to get Terminal to pass-through clicks the way PuTTY does? If not, is there a terminal emulator for OS X that will do that?  <answer167341> I don't think this is possible on Terminal app. But, if you want this functionality you should try a Terminal alternative like iTerm2, where you can do it with kbd⌘/kbd + click.  <answer167347> Terminal App support open default App locally, kbd⌘/kbd + Double Click on a URL in Terminal.app (OS X 10.5: kbd⌘/kbd + kbd⇧/kbd + Double Click).  @jherran is right, iTerm2 provide the feature you want and even support trackpad scroll gesture  <comment196172> I'm not sure I understand the question (I don't know PuTTY). Do You want to click on the links/URLs? Or You want to place Your text cursor in the place You clicked? If You mean the secon option, try `ALT`+`Click` <comment196188> @MateuszSzlosek - PuTTY lets you click on the links in elinks (and lynx, and some others), and then elinks processes it as if you had keyboard navigated to the link and pressed enter <comment196190> I don't want to open it *locally* - I want to open the link in elinks which I already have running side my ssh session :) <comment196195> oops I made a mistake, sorry. iTerm2 native support it and even support trackpad scroll gesture <comment196197> I will change my answer <comment196199> though the ⌘-doubleclick is a neat trick I'd not known before (and this after being a Mac Guy(tm) for the last nearly 30 years!)
