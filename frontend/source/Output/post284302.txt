how to install newer Apple gcc while keeping an outdated version of Xcode <body> Is there a way to install newer Apple gcc without upgrading Xcode? I'm running mountain lion and for some reasons I don't want to upgrade the OS to a newer one. However, codebrew install/code often gives me errors about clang and it seems the culprit is the outdated Xcode and Xcode command line tools.  The Xcode and Xcode command line tools I'm currently using is the latest version among the ones available for my outdated os:  precodeXcode 4.6.2 Apple LLVM version 4.2 (clang-425.0.28) (based on LLVM 3.2svn) /code/pre  according to code/usr/bin/xcodebuild -version/code and codegcc_lion -v/code.  Aside from this version of gcc, I installed via Homebrew the latest gcc, which is      Using built-in specs. COLLECT_GCC=gcc   COLLECT_LTO_WRAPPER=/usr/local/Cellar/gcc/7.1.0/libexec/gcc/x86_64-apple-darwin12.3.0/7.1.0/lto-wrapper   Target: x86_64-apple-darwin12.3.0 Configured with: ../configure   --build=x86_64-apple-darwin12.3.0 --prefix=/usr/local/Cellar/gcc/7.1.0 --libdir=/usr/local/Cellar/gcc/7.1.0/lib/gcc/7 --enable-languages=c,c++,objc,obj-c++,fortran --program-suffix=-7 --with-gmp=/usr/local/opt/gmp --with-mpfr=/usr/local/opt/mpfr --with-mpc=/usr/local/opt/libmpc --with-isl=/usr/local/opt/isl --with-system-zlib --enable-checking=release --with-pkgversion='Homebrew GCC 7.1.0' --with-bugurl=https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/issues --disable-nls Thread model: posix gcc version 7.1.0 (Homebrew GCC 7.1.0)   according to codegcc -v/code.  I attempted to install clang via installing llvm from Homebrew but it failed with errors. This happened even before I installed the newer gcc as I remember.  I also tried following  this instruction but also failed with errors about libatomic.  And upon reading further, it seems I need newer version of xcode + xcode tools, which has updated version of llvm and clang to remove these problems. And I'm assuming it's essentially Apple gcc...?  So if there was an obvious workaround (other than upgrading the OS) to this problem, I don't mind even if it's not Apple gcc in particular but otherwise, how can I install newer Apple gcc? I want to keep using the current, outdated Xcode in my desktop because I don't believe any newer version of Xcode is compatible to mountain lion.   <comment358533> Just to clarify, clang and Apple gcc are completely different programs. Apple has abandoned gcc a couple of years ago. <comment359403> You could use macports which keeps compatibility with older versions of OS X I think it goes back to tiger
