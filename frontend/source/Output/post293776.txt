iMac hard drive probably crashing. How to copy apps <body> Running OS 10.12.5 on an older iMac. Apple tech said it is not the software, probably hard drive crashing. Ran disk utility - no help. I have files backed up on Time Machine, but is there an easy way to back up apps online before it dives to the dust? Simple words, please.  <comment370724> did you check your download folder for the app's "installers" <comment370730> "Ran disk utility - no help" is actually no help to us either... you need to be specific. "Apple Tech" ought to at least have the sense to run SMART checks & report the results. Those results would also be useful... <comment370738> No, they and I didn't run SMART checks & report the results. The disk utility showed plenty RAM and space, and no issues. <comment370788> Time Machine should back up Applications unless you tell it not to. You can look at time machine to see if your apps are there. <comment370792> time machine tends to back everything up, including apps. Personal experience speaking : you should be good, but suggest you change your disk while you can plan for it before it really dies. "apple tech" = genius bar? they run thorough hardware tests free, more advanced tools than OS-level utilities. <comment371080> If your "Apple Tech" didn't do the bare minimum to differentiate where the problem lies... find a new Apple Tech.
