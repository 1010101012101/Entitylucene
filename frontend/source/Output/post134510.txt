Dock background disappears. Bug or trouble? <body> It's already the second time that this occurs. I switch from one user to another and the dock has no background. It looks pretty cool but I don't understand if there's a problem on my hard drive setup or if it's a bug.  I have 10.8.5. Has anyone else experienced this behavior?  This only happens with the new account that I start up as a switch from the old one. The installation is rather new on new hardware.   Note: if I kill the dock from a terminal window, the background comes back. Still...  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DF3YR.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment159188> Kill applications one by one to start troubleshooting. <comment159191> both ways or one account specific ? <comment159194> @Buscarì›ƒ: one account, the new one that I start up as a switch from the old one.
