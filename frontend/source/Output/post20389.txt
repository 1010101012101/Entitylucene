Prevent Apple Double Format Files on Remote Share/Disk <body> I have a web application on a local Linux Apache server that scans a folder for new files and then processes them.  I have an SMB share to this folder and I use Path Finder to copy files over from my Mac (10.6).  The problem is that when I copy files over a whole lot of "._filename" resource fork files get created on the share and then the web application gets confused when it encounters them. I could fix the web application to be a bit smarter and ignore them, but this is also annoying when archiving and copying to external drives.  I have managed to turn off .DS_Store files and I did see a similar question with an answer, but it seemed to be dealing with NTFS Streams and a nsmb.conf file.  <answer20478> There is an application called BlueHarvest that fully automates the clean up of these files.  http://www.zeroonetwenty.com/blueharvest4/  Alternatively, you can use terminal:  cp -X /sourcedirectory/ /volumes/destinationsmbshare/  <answer57833> Adapted from https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/57832/8546  hr  h1Finder/h1  Finder does much to ensure integrity of data, and to make its results compatible with a broad range of Apple operating systems.
