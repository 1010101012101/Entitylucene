Google chrome disable autoupdate <body> How to disable autoupdate on Mac OS X without removing any files or changing permissions?  <answer148157> Google has shared knowledge how to disable it correctly. You don't need to remove or mangle any files you have on your system.  You should set check interval to zero like this:  codedefaults write com.google.Keystone.Agent checkInterval 0/code  After you done you can update google products from command line or Finder by running codeCheckForUpdatesNow.command/code command which can be found in one of following locations:  ul li/Library/Google/GoogleSoftwareUpdate/GoogleSoftwareUpdate.bundle/Contents/Resources//li li~/Library/Google/GoogleSoftwareUpdate/GoogleSoftwareUpdate.bundle/Contents/Resources//li /ul  <comment174619> @JashJacob 2 days delay.
