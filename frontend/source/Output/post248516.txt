List of all installed packages in a defunct Homebrew installation? <body> I have an old codehomebrew/code installation that is now not in use on a backup drive.  I'd like to list all of the packages that were installed when it was in use, how can this be done without mv'ing it back over to code/usr/local/code and making it operational again?  <answer257455> According to the Homebrew terminology, we have the following definitions :     Cellar :  All Kegs are installed here       Keg :      The installation prefix of a Formula      Formula:   The package definition      Homebrew installs to the Cellar it then symlinks some of the installation into /usr/local so that other programs can see what's going on.    As said in the comments, to list all packages previously installed on a backup drive you can do :  precodels -1 /Volumes/*/usr/local/Cellar /code/pre  If you want to have a better understanding of Homebrew paths, I recommend the reading of the following article : The Path to Homebrew.  <comment307940> What does this command produce?  `ls -1 /Volumes/*/usr/local/Cellar` <comment307941> That seems to do the trick, thanks!
