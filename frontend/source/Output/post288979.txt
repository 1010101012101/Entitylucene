What to do When Two-Factor Authentication and Activation Lock are both an issue <body> Ok, so I received a call today from a friend whose wife's phone was in activation lock, so it was unusable.  Unfortunately, she had also recently turned on Two-factor authentication, so we could not even use the AppleID website to reset the password.  I was reluctant to tell them to go into Account Recover, because they really need access to their AppleID info (contacts, notes, files, etc.) in less than "a few days".  At this point, is Account Recovery the emonly/em solution, or is there a way to register another number to receive the Two-Factor Authentication verification code?
