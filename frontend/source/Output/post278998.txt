When I try to open System Preferences from the dock it opens directly into the iCloud pane <body> I would like to open directly to the System Preferences pane, but instead it diverts to the iCloud pane. I have tried deleting the UsersLibraryPreferences.com.apple.desktop.plist file, but this doesn't exist--instead I only see .com.apple.dock.plist. Will this do just as well to delete?  <answer280096> Does system preferences have a badge (red 1) on it? This might indicate that iCloud is prompting you to turn on two-step authentication. If that is the case got to system preferences  iCloud  and where it says "Two-step authentication" click continue to the right of it and then select your preferences. https://discussions.apple.com/thread/7906794  I would recommend doing research into multi factor or multi step authentication before turning it on. It is a high level of security that comes with greater responsibility for you to go through the steps to validate trusted devices - all of which use iCloud and need manual steps.  ul lihttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204915/li /ul  <answer281778> Do the two point verification and system preferences goes back to normal  <answer282462> System Preferences is a pain the butt unless you set up two-factor identification and iCloud preferences.   <comment352416> Thank you for sharing this. When I enter the iCloud part of System Preferences, the only option I have is to enter my  Apple ID password to continue to iCloud--however, when I do this (and it is the correct password), the system keeps on spinning indefinitely. IN short, there is no option I can enter once I get into the iCloud part of System Preferences at present. <comment354627> Welcome to Ask Different!

It required my doing the whole two-step verification in iCloud to get rid of both the red flag and the pane. Now System Preferences is back to normal.
