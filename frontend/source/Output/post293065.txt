How do I install Windows 10 on Mac without removing the existing Linux partitions? <body> I have a MacBook Air (El Captain) with Kali-Linux dual booted. Well, kind of. It's a 4 GB partition for live and a 15 GB partition for persistency.   So, all I wanted to know is, do I have any possibility of adding Windows onto my internal SSD too?  <answer293076> As far as I know, you can do it, but the order of installation should go like these:     ol   liInstall Apple's Bootcamp and use it to install Windows 10/li   liUse Windows 10 to shrink the Bootcamp partition, freeing up space to /li   liInstall Linux/li   liInstall rEFInd as a Boot Manager for all 3 OSes/li   /ol   All details are provided by Rob Pickering:  https://robpickering.com/triple-boot-macbook-pro-macos-windows-10-linux/
