How can I change the VoiceOver language for a song on my 6th gen iPod Nano? <body> Is it possible to change language used for reading song album/artist/title for certain songs? I.e. when I use slovak as default iPod nano language, but I have songs with english titles, I would like to hear those in english. I think this was available for previous iPod nanos, but I cannot find it in iTunes when syncing songs to 6th gen nano.  strongUpdate:/strong This is how Options panel looks when I right-click on song stored on my iPod Nano (6th gen):  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4sL3p.png" alt="iTunes Options panel"  VoiceOver language is not there :-(  <answer4280> Right click on the song (you can select more than one), select "Get Info", choose the Options tab, and pick English for the voice over language.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZBIeT.png" alt="Screenshot of the Get Info panel"  If you don't see this in your info panel it means that the VoiceOver Kit is not installed: Follow the instructions on this KB Article to download and install it.  However those instructions do work on the Shuffle and the 5th generation Nano, but I just tried my daugther's 6th generation Nano and the check box is not there. Sorry.  <comment4095> Thank you. This is exactly what I remembered, unfortunately there isn't "VoiceOver Language" field in my iTunes. See my updated question for screenshot. <comment4096> VoiceOver still works fine though, it just isn't enabled in iTunes anymore, but inside iPod Nano itself. I think new iPod Nano 6th gen now generates voice messages on the fly. <comment4107> Do you have the "iPodVoiceOver.framework" in "/Library/Application Support/iTunes"? I've added instructions on how to install the VoiceOver Kit. <comment4108> Sorry, just checked with a 6th generation Nano, the checkbox to enable voice over is not there. Worth a try maybe is to plug an iPod that support voice over to force install the kit and see if the individual song selection shows up and works with the Nano... <comment4111> interesting idea. Will try that when I have a chance.
