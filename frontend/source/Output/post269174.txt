Disable the sleep function of the macbook touch bar <body> I got the new Macbook Pro and i found out that the touch bar goes to sleep after 75 seconds of inactivity. This function is quite annoying to me.  Is it possible to disable the sleep function of the touch bar for the 75 seconds of inactivity? I have googled it, but i didn't find anything.   <answer269209> You can use my script until Apple will adds a preference for the Touch Bar.   It presses the fn-key every 60 seconds to simulate keyboard activity. You should not notice it if you type. Keep in mind, however, that it will prevent display sleep / system sleep as well.  Copy and paste the following code into the "Script Editor" application on your MacBook:  precode(* 1. Save as an Application: Script Editor &gt; File &gt; Exportâ€¦ &gt; File Format: Application 2. Check "Stay open after run handler" 3. Run the app or add it to your login items: System Preferences &gt; Users &amp; Groups &gt; User &gt; Login Items &gt; Press the "+" button  # http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/269174/disable-the-sleep-function-of-the-macbook-touch-bar *)  on idle     tell application "System Events" to keystroke (key code 63) -- press fn key     delay 60 end idle /code/pre  Please let us know if this solves your issue.  <comment338121> Did you try the preference pane? I think it is in System Preferences  Energy Save. You could also search the System Prefs. pane in the top right corner, try searching there for something like "Touch Bar" <comment338126> Yeah, but there isn't a property to disable the sleep function and the search does not show viable results. <comment338297> I want this too, but is there any risk of burn-in on the display if it's always on? I saw an apple watch that was pretty badly burnt in in an Apple store. So if it's the same type of display, then it might be bad to keep it always on. <comment338448> I think it could be possible, but otherwise, if you are working the whole day with the Macbook the Touch Bar does not go to sleep. I think the risk for a burn-in is very low, but i'm not sure. <comment338449> It seems working :-) Thanks :-)
