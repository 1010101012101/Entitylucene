Missing app icons on Apple Watch <body> I've got a problem in that some app icons on my Apple Watch seem to be missing their artwork. This only happens to a few apps at a time, seemingly randomly and I haven't noticed a specific trigger. The apps otherwise work normally and the icons strongare/strong present if I look at the list of apple watch apps on my iPhone.   If I uninstall and reinstall the app, that usually fixes it temporarily at least but I was wondering if there was a quicker/easier way to fix it or prevent it from happening in the first place.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ftI4M.jpg" alt="missing-icons"  <answer233630> The only way I found to fix, is to use the Apple Watch Application on your iPhone.  Remove the application (slider off "Show App on Apple Watch"), once it's uninstalled, reinstall it (slider a=back on "Show App on Apple Watch").   Not a great solution, especially when you have 8 or more apps missing their artwork, like I did; However it works.  <comment279697> I have the same issue, any solutions? <comment350638> Didn't seem to work for me.
