lshw or lspci for Mac OS X <body> What's the closest alternative to something like codelshw/code or  codelspci/code on  Mac OS X?   The closest thing I know of is codesystem_profiler/code but it spits out way too much unnecessary information.  <answer240237> Try parsing the output of the codeioreg/code command.  I tried codeioreg -l | grep PCI/code and got a bunch of info.   <answer276146> You might want to try strongemcodedspci/code/em/strong console utility from the open-source DPCIManager project. strongI must warn you/strong though, that the software is coming from the Hackintosh/OSx86 world and the DPCIManager.app offers extra functionality in addition to listing PCI devices that is strongnot at all safe to run on a real Mac/strong, so please avoid using anything from that package except the strongemcodedspci/code/em/strong utility which only does listing PCI devices in your system (like emcodelspci/code/em in Linux).  <comment286600> Have you tried `sysctl`? I think `sysctl machdep` gives some information pertaining to your machine. <comment287581> @perhapsmaybeharry Nice suggestion with `sysctl`. Not quite what I'm looking for though. <comment295387> Thanks for the suggestion. I will try it out and let you know how it goes. <comment347472> Why not `awk | grep | sed ` out the undesired information? `system_profiler` and `ioreg` are the canonical tools to enumerate hardware details on macOS. <comment347477> That sounds like it would be good; if it was native. I think you're kind of on the right track, though. Thanks for the suggestion. <comment347478> FYI: `lshw`, `lspci`, `lsusb`, etc. are all available from external sources too. <comment347514> @tjt263, right, there are both macOS ports of pciutils and libusb (I suspect that `lspci` and `lsusb` are included in the respective source trees as examples/handy utils). There are also wrapper shells available that use e.g. `system_profiler SPUSBDataType` as a datasource and try to behave like `lsusb` or whatever. <comment347617> That's right. I do recall the `lsusb` package distributed via `brew`, basically being just a wrapper, clone, or alias for something like `system_profiler SPUSBDataType`. <comment353002> @bmike I do, for the most part, or when I need to. <comment367273> @tjt263 brew says :   ```No formula found for "/pciutil/". No formula found for "/lshw/". No formula found for "/lsusb/". No formula found for "/lspci/".```   Where ? Can you please be more precise and give URLs ?
