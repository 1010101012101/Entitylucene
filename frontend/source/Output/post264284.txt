Is there a way to have an encrypted folder on macOS with fast read/write operations? <body> I've tried and used Disk Utility to create an encrypted image, so I can store data in it securely. However, when I tried to write files to this image, the write operation was too slow (to write ~50 GB of data, it would take 1 day as estimated).  My question: is there a robust alternative that allows creating an encrypted space in the hard disk to store data with fast read/write operations?  strongDevice :/strong  Apple MacBook Pro (15-inch, Mid 2012)  ul liProcessor : 2.6 GHz Intel Core i7/li liMemory : 8 GB 1600 MHz DDR3/li liHard drive : APPLE HDD HTS547575A9E384  ul liRotational Rate:  5400/li liPartition Map Type:   GPT (GUID Partition Table)/li /ul/li liOS version : 10.12.1/li /ul  I am transferring data to an encrypted image on the hard drive.

Additional factor would be how full the HD is & how fragmented. 50GB of free contiguous space would be unusual on a 4-year-old 750GB boot drive. <comment331163> I'd suggest replacing your internal HDD with an SSD. This will not only speed up your data transfer rate but help speed up everything you do on the computer.
