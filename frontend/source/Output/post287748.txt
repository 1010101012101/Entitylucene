Download iOS apps no longer availble <body> I do know that this question has been asked in many different places, with many different little variations, but I still haven't managed to find a satisfactory answer.  I'm trying to build an iPad video wall, very similar to this YouTube video: I Need a Bigger Screen out of a whole bunch of iPad 2s that I have access to.  I've been researching how to do this all day, and the best answer I've come up with is using the app that was featured in the YouTube video mentioned above.  This app is called The Matrix and I had hoped it would be a simple download and test, however, after looking into it, this app has been removed from the iTunes store.  Is there any way that I can find this app somewhere?  <comment363349> You should just contact them dude.
