What is time machine backing up? <body> Is there a way to find out what time machine is backing up?  My time machine has been running fine, but it suddenly started to back-up 20GB a few days ago when I have not changed that much since last back-up.  This morning it started to back-up 14Mb, but I have not used it since it's last back up at 00.01 am.  Thanks,  Linda  <answer2348> TimeTracker is a quick-and-dirty application that displays the contents of your Time Machine backups, and shows what's changed since the previous backup.  <answer19464> There are two tools I know of that do this: (1) BackupLoupe (which is a GUI application) and (2) timedog (command-line Perl script).  <answer20036> h1Mobile Time Machine and Time Machine in Lion: using Terminal to view activities/h1  h2At any time/h2  A command such as this will present a lightweight overview:   codetail -f /private/var/log/system.log | grep -E 'backup|mtm'/code  h2During a backup/h2  A command such as this will present detail:   codesudo fs_usage cmd backupd/code  h2When you have finished/h2  To interrupt a running command:  kbdcontrol/kbdkbdc/kbd  h2tmutil/h2  From the manual page for codetmutil/code in Mac OS X 10.7 (Build 11A511), the description:      tmutil provides methods of controlling and interacting with Time Machine, as well as examining and manipulating Time Machine backups. Common abilities include restoring data from backups, editing exclusions, and comparing backups.   Expect Apple to publish that manual page, and others for 10.7, at:   ul liAPIÂ Reference: Mac OS X Manual Pages/li /ul  <comment24429> BackupLoupe is stellar in presenting the changes so you can see which are taking the largest incremental space. It is visually stunning as well. +1 indeed <comment24433> Some of these answers are reported as not working on Lion - you might look here as well - http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/15717/how-to-see-what-files-were-changed-in-timemachine <comment269839> BackupLoup is now located at http://www.soma-zone.com/BackupLoupe/ <comment300868> I've tried that in El Capitan but I mostly see entries like `01:48:38    THROTTLED    0.024550   backupd` and no actual paths. <comment343415> I'd suggest BackupLoupe over TimeTracker; it's a bit more polished and probably would be less buggy
