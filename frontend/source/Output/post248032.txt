How to manage malformed PDFs <body> This 1345-page PDF (direct link, 28.2 MB) seems to be malformed :  ul liI regularly encounter problems when viewing it (Preview freezes so I have to force quit&amp; restart it ; by the way I downloaded and saved it first, of course)/li liI tried to split it into smaller chunks with codecpdf/code or Preview tools,  but that also fails ; codecpdf/code gives me error messages like this :  precodePdf.PDFError("Could not read object whilst reading file big_one.pdf at position 22692185") Pdf.PDFError("No /Root entry whilst reading file big_one.pdf at position 28182065") /code/pre/li /ul  Any ideas on how to fix this ?  <comment306077> Have you tried using [Adobe Reader](https://www.adobe.com/support/downloads/product.jsp?platform=macintosh&product=10)? Adobe's tools tend to be better when dealing with damaged or malformed PDFs. <comment306142> Opened fine on iPad Air in safari. Not sure why doing on OS X. <comment306165> Use Acrobat Pro, which would allow to extract working blocks. It has pretty good repairing capabilities, but if the file is messed up, chances are not too good. BTW, how was that file created?
