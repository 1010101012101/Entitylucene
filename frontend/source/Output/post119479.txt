Set Time Machine to backup once per day instead of once an hour <body> I use Time Machine to backup my Mac (running Mavericks 10.9.1). The backup process runs at the standard once per hour. This often slows down my machine while I'm trying to work on it. Understanding that it will provide less protection, is it possible to adjust Time Machine to backup at a different interval (e.g. once per day) instead of once per hour without installing third-party software?  <answer119486> No.  Given that there are several third-party utilities that provide this functionality (and nothing else), like TimeMachineEditor, it seems highly unlikely that there's a built-in way to do it.  <answer119488> or like this http://www.klieme.com/TimeMachineScheduler.html  works nice for me under Mavericks, ML and Lion  <answer154469> for once a day I just do it manually, with the Time Machine turned off in the System preferences.  <comment139383> Hi welcome to AskDifferent, I find if a question is worth answering it is worth upvoting.
