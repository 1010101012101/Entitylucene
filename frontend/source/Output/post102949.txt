iOS 7 change folders' background <body> I'm on iOS 7 and I'd like to make the folders' background transparent so I can see the wallpaper behind it. Is there a way to do this?  <answer102951> No, there is no setting to customize any aspect of how folders look or behave.   <answer102952> Without a jailbreak : No.   With a jailbreak : Not possible either. There is no jailbreak for iOS7 yet.   <answer102965> You may have turned on codeSettings &gt; General &gt; Accessibility &gt; Increase Contrast/code which increases the contrast for areas including Unlock Screen/Notification Center/Control Center/Dock/Folder Backgrounds.
