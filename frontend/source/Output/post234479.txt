What is the name of the 'corner swipe' to change motion animations on the Apple Watch? <body> I've got the jellyfish motion animation on the face of my Apple watch. This has multiple different jelly fish.  I've found I can jump to the next jelly fish by doing a 'corner swipe'. This is swiping along the top left hand corner of the watch.   I've never heard of a 'corner swipe' idiom. Does anybody have any information on it? I need to know the 'name' in order to find out more.   My question is: strongWhat is the name of the 'corner swipe' to change motion animations on the Apple Watch?/strong  <answer234480> From what I can tell, what makes the watch face advance to the next jellyfish is a strongtap/strong. Your "corner swipe" must be just along the sensor in a way that it looks to the device like a tap.
