6hr 33 min to charge last 6% of battery - is this normal? <body> Exactly as asked - I couldn't figure out why exactly this is happening?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7xj8C.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer170459> No, it is probably not normal.  You can hold the codealt/code key and click on your battery icon. Then click codeCondition: X/code.  What is your X? You can read some more information based on the window that popped up  By the way, does it really take 6.5 hour to charge to 100%? Cause it could just be some temporary mess-up with the estimation.  <comment200317> it is a calculated value, give it a moment to figure it out :) <comment200318> is it normal? no it is not, but what is the health of your battery ? <comment200390> The health of my battery is Normal right now. It didn't end up taking 6+hrs to finish charging. That said, this issue has shown up more than once now. Should I be worried about it? <comment200394> So it seems that it just reports longer times than it actually takes? It is a little bit weird but I guess you don't have to worry that much about it. How many cycles has your battery completed? (`system information` - `Power`). You may also want to try this http://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201295 <comment200413> It's at 244 cycles now. I hear it's usually about 300 cycles before the battery begins to deteriorate, is that correct? <comment200415> It depends on the models. Unless you have a quite old one, it is about 1000. http://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201585 If the problem occurs regularly you an check the link I added in the previous comment <comment200703> Reinforces why I like Apple products. Well-designed and well-engineered. 1000 cycles on the Air.
