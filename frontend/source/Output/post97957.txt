13" retina vs native full HD <body> The 13" MBP with retina has a resolution of  2560x1600. Standard windows laptops often have resolutions like 1920x1080.  When watching 1080p material on fullscreen, the windows laptop can display the video natively while the MBP has to upscale. What is the tradeoff in viewing quality here? Is there any review comparing the quality?  I can imagine it going both ways: either the higher resolution makes the movie look even clearer or the upscaling introduces artefacts which unsharpens the video.  <comment114977> The quality of a display is measured in number of pixels, refresh rate ect. So what is your question here ? <comment115036> I am wondering what is more pleasing to the eye. If the source image is 1080p, is it better to watch it on a native 1080p screen or is the upscaling (which has to divide video pixels between a non-integral number of screen pixels) better, or is there no perceivable difference?
