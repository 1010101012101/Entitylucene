Why did MacBook Pro Touch ID stop working temporarily? <body> Left my 2016 MBP in coffee shop to go to the bathroom. I put my screensaver on but when I came back after a few minutes it required my password instead of Touch ID so I logged in and then put the screensaver back on and it still didn't work.  Toggling Touch ID fixed it but I'm wondering if this is just a bug or something else.  <comment348078> You don't give us much information.  We need logs and even then we would probably still be guessing.  Yes I would guess it is a bug. <comment348081> @William thanks!
