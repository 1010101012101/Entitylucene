How can I change the black text in my terminal? <body> I have changed the color in my profile, but some text is still black. How can I make all black text inverted, or any color that's visible? I'm including screenshot of my preferences and the issue. The second terminal screenshot is the result of highlighting, to illustrate the problem.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jIiUu.png" alt="preferences"img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/P9sx0.png" alt="terminal" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/SDxD7.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer242355> In the second screen shot, it looks like you're looking at codeman builtin/code and the Command column, the first column, is in bold text and not visible. Looking at the Bold Text color shows it being rather dark, as dark as the Background Color &amp; Effects in the first screen shot. So, change the Bold Text color to the same color as the Text color or just a shade darker then the Text color.  <comment298095> Can't believe I didn't think to do that :) thank you!
