Is there a way to use the CMD button in the right side as a different button? <body> You know in the keyboard we have 2 CMD buttons, one on the left side of the SPACE and on on the right side.  My question is, can I make OSX treat the one on the right side as a completely different button? So I can assign different actions to shortcuts such as CMD(left) + K and CMD(right) + K.  Thank you.   <answer216818> You can use KeyRemap4MacBook (Karabiner) to remap your keyboard.  strongKarabiner/strong  precodeA powerful and stable keyboard customizer for OS X.   - You can easily customize from prepared settings.  - You can also add your own settings by XML. /code/pre  https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/
