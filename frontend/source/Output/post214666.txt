Outlook 2011 Keychain entry rewritten - prompting for password after 10.10.5 update - keychain issue? <body> After applying the Yosemite 10.10.5 update and Security Update 2015-004 (1.0), my installation of Outlook 2011 prompts me for a password every time I check for mail. I have tried repairing Keychain Access a few times (on Verify, it says there is never a problem) and deleting/recreating the keychain login entries for Outlook, but I continue to be prompted to reenter my credentials:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2BZ0V.png" alt="Prompt from Outlook after forgetting password"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/m69rl.png" alt="Adding keychain entry"  After entering the credentials, I show as connected and can send/receive all my mail. There is also a login entry displayed in Keychain Access. But the prompt still appears on every send/receive.  I have seen this solution of adding an additional backslash to the beginning of the domain (i.e. code\domain\user/code instead of codedomain\user/code ) but doing so returns a bad user/pass error.  The 10.10.5 update description says it "improves compatibility with certain email servers when using Mail" - thinking this might be a clue?  My coworker's mac (which hasn't been updated) does not have this issue, and my iPhone and Win7/Outlook 2007 installs are receiving mail from the same account with no login problems. Mail server settings have not changed (I manage it).  strongEDIT/strong  Reviewing the keychain entry after getting the wrong credentials prompts, I see that the username has been changed from codedomain\username/code to codeusername@example.com/code but the prompt keeps coming up suggesting codedomain\username/code. (Attempting codeusername@example.com/code fails with bad user/pass error.) The change to the keychain entry occurs when relaunching Outlook or after a period of time.  <answer220630> The Exchange "autodiscover" settings changes the server URL to the WSDL resource.  So, mail.domain.com becomes: mail.domain.com/EWS/Exchange.asmx everytime you check for mail.  To fix this, you have to tell Outlook to stop asking for autodiscover settings  using AppleScript editor:  precodetell application "Microsoft Outlook" set background autodiscover of exchange account "NameOfAccount" to false end tell /code/pre  emcredit: http://www.officeformachelp.com/2011/01/exchange-autodiscover-workaround-for-advanced-settings//em  <comment267591> Thanks for the advice - I actually did play around with turning on/off autodiscover but I had a few things wrong (which I will edit in my original post) - my coworker with the same setup did in fact have the same problem with her installation. The connection string changes were a red herring. The problem had to do with a public mail folder in Exchange that had some permissions issues. Known issue from M$ and they're apparently working on a patch. Only affects Exchange 2013 installs that were migrations from 2010. <comment267958> cool, glad you found a solution :)
