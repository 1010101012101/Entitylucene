SSD configuration software <body> Both Intel and Samsung supply windows only configuration software for their SSDs (Intel® Solid State Drive Toolbox, Samsung Magician Software for PC).    Is there anyway to achieve the same functionality under OS X? And/Or is this functionality actually needed?  To clarify using Intel as an example (but samsung has something similar), their configuration tool can:     Check and strongtune/strong system settings for optimal performance, power   efficiency, and endurance   (Note that this is separate from firmware updates - which both companies do seem to support for OS X systems)  <answer237685> Both of those tools seem to provide some basic diagnostic information about your drive.       The Intel® Solid State Drive Toolbox (Intel® SSD Toolbox) is drive   management software that allows you to:   - View current drive information for Intel® Solid State Drives (Intel® SSDs), including:      ul   liModel number, capacity, and firmware version /li   liDrive health /li   liEstimated drive life remaining /li   liSMART attributes (also available for hard disk   drives and non-Intel SSDs) /li   liIdentify Device information (also available for hard disk drives and non-Intel SSDs)/li   /ul   You can get this with DiskDrill or Diskwarrior.  The free versions of both can give you what you are looking for.  The "tuning" is basically enabling/disabling TRIM support.  There are 3rd party utilities out there that can do it for you, but the strongreccomended/strong way is doing it through OS X Terminal.  The linked article has a Word document that provides you the steps to to enable TRIM; I am direct linking it here  <answer237688> You can enable TRIM on the Mac, using either Trim Enabler ($10), or its newer sibling, Disk Sensei ($20), both from Cindori  Late news: Apparently, Apple have allowed you to enable TRIM on any SSD since OS X 10.11.4br Using the Terminal command codesudo trim force enable/code &amp; acknowledging the big scary warning. The system will then reboot with TRIM enabled.br Thanks to Peter M &amp; his link to Ars Technica : Latest OS X update allows you to enable TRIM for third-party SSDs - though read the caveats in the comments section.  As for the rest, the only way I've ever been able to get firmware updates onto a Samsung was by reformatting it as NTFS &amp; putting it in a PC, the Samsung app &amp; instructions were of no use at all when I tried them on a Mac :(br Whether that is because I was trying to do it on an 08 Mac Pro which won't boot from their ISO, I might never know. How you would do it from a machine without an optical drive is also subject to experiment.  I have no experience with the Intel SSDs, so can't comment.  <comment291236> You again!  Anyway it's the `**tune** system settings for optimal performance, power efficiency, and endurance` aspect that I am more interested in. <comment291239> Theoretically you now don't need 3rd party tools to turn TRIM on. http://arstechnica.com/apple/2015/06/latest-os-x-update-allows-you-to-enable-trim-for-third-party-ssds/ <comment291240> Ah, interesting news, thanks. I ought to add that to the answer. <comment291241> But take a close look at the comments.  There seems to be an issue with TRIM deleting data on various manufacturers drives.  The caveat is that I have no experience in this subject and can only refer you to what is written there. <comment291242> Oh, that sounds fun... though I've had TRIM enabled on my 840 since I got it - I guess time will tell. I do know that before I updated the firmware & reperformed it on the PC, it was already slowing down badly. It's been fine ever since. <comment291243> It's more than just enabling TRIM.  The Samsung software allows you to select between 3 or 4 different "modes": Maximum Performance, Maximum Capacity and Maximum Reliability .. http://www.samsung.com/global/business/semiconductor/minisite/SSD/global/html/whitepaper/whitepaper12.html  In hindsight these do seem to be manipulating settings in Windows rather than in the SSD. <comment291245> Yeah .. total fun.  And here I am shopping around for my first SSD and I see thing like that! <comment291247> We've got 4 here, 2 in Mac Pros, 2 in PCs, none have actually ever been any problem, other than having to clone, format NTFS, update... then back again every time there's a firmware update. There hasn't actually been an update in a long time for the 840, so all has been well since. <comment291255> Reading to the end of those comments suggests that it might be a Linux rather than SSD issue.
