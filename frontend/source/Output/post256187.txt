Update VirtualBox without losing Guest .vdi Files <body> I have strongVirtualBox/strong "Version 5.1.4 r110228 (Qt5.5.1)" installed on a MacBook Air strongmacOS Sierra version 10.12/strong. Now I got an update message: http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/5.1.6/VirtualBox-5.1.6-110634-OSX.dmg  But how can I update my VirtualBox version from strong5.1.4/strong to strong5.1.6/strong? Obviously without losing my guests installations emCentOS 7 64/em and emWindows 10 Enterprise/em.  Do I need to remove VirtualBox 5.1.4? And what happens with my Guest VDI installations?  <answer256190> Shut down all VMs and quit VirtualBox. Open VirtualBox-5.1.6-110634-OSX.dmg and double-click the installer in the mounted image. The installer will overwrite the old VirtualBox.app and some other files.  The VMs will be kept in place and won't be modified.  Later download the latest Extension Pack 5.1.6-110634 and install it in the existing VMs if necessary/possible.
