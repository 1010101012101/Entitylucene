My MacBook keeps crashing <body> My Mac keeps crashing with the same error:     a freed zone element has been modified in zone kalloc.64   Here are four crash reports I collected over a period of time.  It happens no matter what I'm doing, using the terminal, the browser, even when the screensaver is on.  I did try disabling avira real time scan (didn't exit) but that didn't stop the crashing.  This is driving me nuts, any ideas?  <answer268350> It's hard to say from the crash reports, the good news is that the issue emmay/em be related to software - a misbehaving third party kernel module may cause a kernel panic.  From you crash reports I see the following 3rd party module:  precodecom.avira.kext.FileAccessControl /code/pre  Try updating or removing avira, and see if that helps.  <comment336875> From what I'd read online i came to a similar conclusion (About it being 3rd party), hence disabling avira's active scan, I'll try an update and see if that works. <comment337309> Ok, so, my mac hasn't crashed once since I uninstalled avira, I just wish that it didn't as I kind of don't like leaving my mac unprotected.
