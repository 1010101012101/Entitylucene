Maintaining alias links when moving original files across drives <body> When I move the original file that an alias point to, the alias is still able to find the file in it's new position. But not when I move the original files across drives.  I'd like to move a bunch of files from Drive A to Drive B. Drive A also holds a bunch of alias's that point to those files. I'd like the alias's to point to the files on their new drive once they've been moved.  If I just strongcopy/strong the files to Drive B, the alias's will still point to those files on A. If I do a strongmove/strong using drag while holding down Option, the alias's loose their link and don't end up pointing to anything.  How can I allow these alias's to maintain their links?  I'm on Mountain Lion.  (It's Final Cut Pro X media that I'm dealing with. I did a little testing where I just re-generate the alias's from scratch, but it seems that FCP X didn't like that. It sensed the change and seemed to alter the metadata of the offending clips)
