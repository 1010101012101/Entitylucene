Preferences Error on IMac Yosemite 10.10.2 <body> Preferences app launches fine and all but one prefs pane work well -- the Desktop &amp; Screen Saver preference pane yields the following message:  em"Preferences Error.  Could not load Desktop &amp; Screen Saver preference pane."/em  I have tried deleting the  com.apple.systempreferences.plist file and re-starting.  I have also restored this file from a Time Machine backup.  And I repaired permissions. Nothing helped.  Any suggestions appreciated.  <answer180258> Solved.    Deleted the file desktoppicture.db  located in user/library/applicationsupport/dock.  Then re-started.  This restored the default wallpaper.  Even though my previous wallpaper displayed without issue, it apparently caused a problem for the Desktop &amp; Screen Saver Prefs.  I checked the jpg and it wasn't corrupt.    If I pick another image for my wallpaper the Prefs error returns, but at least for now everything is stable!  Many thanks to Kevin G. and Buscar for the suggestions.  <comment213770> What is it in your Desktop + Screen Saver that it does not likes? <comment213781> Good question, Buscar!  Wish I knew. <comment213783> do you have any custom stuff in screen saver? do you have any custom desktops ? Turn desktop in to solid colors. <comment213791> Try creating a new user and see if you get the issue there. <comment213813> Buscar, no custom stuff other than wallpaper, which seems to be fine.  Can't change desktop to solid color because can't get to Pref Pane. <comment213815> Kevin, guest user *IS* able to get to Pref Pane without any problem.
