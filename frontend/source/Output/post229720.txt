Could my iCloud Keychain have been hacked? <body> I just noticed an entry in my keychain that seems odd. The username is an email that is a random string of letters @telekom.de. I have no association with Telekom.de. I'm in Canada. There is no website listed for this entry. Should I be concerned?  I have bought software from a developer in Germany. Could that app be using my keychain legitimately or illegitimately?
