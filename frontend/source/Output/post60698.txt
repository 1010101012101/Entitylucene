Is it safe to delete "~/Library/iTunes/Mobile Backups"? <body> Good morning-  Is it possible to delete the contents of code~/Library/iTunes/Mobile Backups/code?  This seems to be where backups were stored in older versions of iTunes/iOS?  It appears like it is every backup of iPods, iPhones, etc. I've owned since 2003.    It seems like backups of an iPhone/iPad done locally are now stored in code~/Library/Application Support/MobileSync/code and that it would be safe to delete the contents of the other folder (code~/Library/iTunes/Mobile Backups/code) but would appreciate any confirmation that this is accurate :)    Thanks in advance for your help.  <answer60703> Yes, you are correct. The new location for iOS backups is:   precode~/Library/Application Support/MobileSync/Backup/ /code/pre  This Apple KB article was recently updated to reflect this change. Hope this helps.
