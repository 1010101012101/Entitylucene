Apple Cinema Display 2008 to HDMI connection (Raspberry Pi) <body> I just got an second hand Apple Cinema Display from 2008 and I would like to connect it to a Raspberry Pi, which has a HDMI connector.  Is there any cheap way to connect the two devices? I don't know why but the only things I can find are really expensive black boxes to make the conversion and I don't know why. Is that hard to convert from one type of device to the other.   Thanks!   <comment359328> This is a great question because there are so few answers out there on the interwebs. This is what I found after 15 minutes of searching: http://www.kanex.com/products/item.aspx?id=3662 <comment359331> Cheap way... 99$ isn't cheap.
