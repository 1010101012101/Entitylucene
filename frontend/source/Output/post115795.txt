Is the Google Translate Phrasebook Syncing not available in the iOS app? <body> Is the Google Translate Phrasebook Syncing not available in the iOS app?  I can't find my phrasebook listing. It seems the list on the iPhone is not stored online as for the web. I suspect they implement it for Android only.  <answer261940> Sorry, the Google Translate App for iOS does not synchronize with your account.  The phrasebook only synchronizes in the web and Android versions.
