How to lock a full screen application in in a certain space? <body> I want to keep the mail applicaton fullscreen in the far right space.  Every time I open a fullscreen application it moves to the far right.  How do I lock a fullscreen app in say the far right space?  <answer59897> This feature has been asked for by users many times, but unfortunately, Apple hasn’t implemented it yet.   A very ugly workaround is:  ol liAdd a new desktop in Mission Control./li liSwitch the Mail app to windowed mode./li liOpen Mission Control, and move the window to the newly created Desktop./li liSwitch to the Mail app. Right click on the icon in the Dock. In options, select “Assign to this Desktop.”/li /ol  This is a very ugly workaround and you can use Mail only in Window mode this way.  <comment68952> With windowed mode being the opposite of fullscreen, what exactly is the benefit of doing this? <comment69027> That’s what I said. It’s just a very ugly workaround. It’s not a solution.
