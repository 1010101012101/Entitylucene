Toggle between two most recent tabs in Safari <body> Chrome was my favorite browser for years, but it drastically overheats MacBook, thus my patience was finally exhausted and I decided to move to Safari as it's the most energy efficient browser for Mac.  The only thing I can't implement here is toggling between two recent tabs using kbdctrl/kbd+kbdq/kbd or any other custom shortcut. Notice that these tabs shouldn't be necessarily neighboring.   I googled a lot but still can't find extension or property which can help me to accomplish this. I'd be very thankful if you could give me a hint how I can implement this tab toggling  <comment346356> What versions of macOS and Safari are you running? <comment346366> @Monomeeth MacOS Sierra (10.12.3) and Safari v.10.0.3 (12602.4.8) <comment347287> It doesn't seem to have one - https://support.apple.com/kb/PH21483
