How can I add Trash icon to the sidebar in Mac OS X Lion? <body> How can I add the Trash icon and empty Trash from the sidebar of Finder.app in Mac OS X Lion ?   I dont have a problem to add them in the list of favorites too, but the Trash icon is not draggable.   <answer22290> First, open the trash can by clicking on it in the Dock.br In the Finder, press Command-shift-G (go to folder) and go to ~/.Trashbr In the Finder window for .Trash, click the proxy icon in the title bar of the window and drag it to the sidebar.br You then have a trash folder in your sidebar.  To empty the trash from the sidebar, open Automator and create an application. As the sole action in the application, select "Run AppleScript" and use this AppleScript:  precodeon run {}   tell application "Finder"     empty the trash   end tell end run /code/pre  Save the application as "Empty Trash", and drag it to the sidebar.  <answer280102> If you have iCloud enabled you may need to tweak the path offered by Daniel to   precode~/Library/Mobile\ Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/.Trash /code/pre  <answer287796> According to this article, each partition has its own trash folder, so dragging one to the sidebar is not a global trash. This script is:  precodeon open   tell the application "Finder"     move the selection to the trash   end tell end open  /code/pre  Save the script as an application, give it an icon, and drag it into the sidebar.  I think that looks dangerous, though; what if you simply want to see the trash content while having a file selected? This answer looks safe:  precodeon open input     repeat with i in input         tell application "Finder" to move i to the trash     end repeat end open  on run     tell application "Finder" to open trash end run /code/pre  <comment24652> Good question, can you confirm which OS level you are using tho? <comment24653> @stuffe I am using Lion. I will update the question itself to avoid confusion <comment24718> The answer is great, but is it possible I could customize it to get something like an eject button when external disks are mounted in order to empty the trash ? <comment24719> You could Go to Folder "/System/Library/CoreServices/Menu Extras/Eject.menu/Contents/Resources", open the file "Eject.pdf", Go to File, Export, and save it to the desktop as a png file. Open the PNG in Preview, Command-A , Command C. Then select the Empty Trash application, Get Info, highlight the icon in the upper left, and paste the eject image to change the icon to an eject symbol. Then re-drag the eject application to the sidebar. <comment66238> Thanks for the awesome tip automator rocks as I have used it for so many missing features. Another tip as well is to drag the application icon to the Finder toolbar. This way it is at the top, and it keeps it's icon. <comment150802> I couldn't figure out what was meant by "proxy icon" above, but figured I could see the Trash folder if I switched to column view as this allowed me to see the parent folder including the hidden trash folder.  I could then drag this to the sidebar and *voila*. <comment150903> @dunxd In the title bar of a Finder window, next to the name of the folder, there is a small image of the folder's icon (this is not limited to the Finder; in many programs, you find a similar icon in the title bar of the window that refers to the file the window represents). This is the proxy icon. Dragging the proxy icon has the same effect of finding the icon for the folder (or file) in the Finder and dragging it somewhere.
