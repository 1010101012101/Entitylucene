Sending email with images on iPad? <body> I've just realized I can't send images from Mail on Ipad.  When a create a new draft there is not add image functionality, so I guess the only way is to email images from Photos.  However, what if I want to send an email with more than one image ?  thanks  <answer14234> From the Photo app you can select up to 5 images and hit codeShare -&gt; E-Mail/code. Maybe it's possible to mail more then 5 images when you select 5+ and the codeCopy/code them and codePaste/code them in your E-Mail.  See this guide for reference: Send multiple photos at once on the iPad and iPhone  <answer14254> Tapping on the icon will display more options, such as bulk copy or delete.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Y1w5T.png" alt="Copy option"  Note: I reply becoz I can't add images to @timbooo comment.  <comment20311> It's worth noting that using the email option will limit you to 5 photos while using copy/paste will get you around that limitation. And I've read somewhere that the email option compresses the image, while copy paste will not.
