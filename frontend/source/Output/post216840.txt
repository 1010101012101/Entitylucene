Mac adapter 60W weird behavior/not charging <body> I have a macbook retina pro that I bought from the USA and using in India. My magsafe 2 adapter 60W has recently stopped detecting. I can feel the current and the ground noise in the laptop but the device is not charging. I used my friends magsafe 45W adapter and it worked which means my laptop charging point is not broken. My adapter has no visible signs of damage and I'm at my wits end as to what to do?  <comment262123> What do you mean by "can feel the current and the ground noise in the laptop"? <comment262128> @patrix I feel a vibration when I touch the laptop, a buzzing kind of a thing and also get mild shocks on touching the edges or the near the apple logo (I guess the electricity is not earthing and flowing over the aluminum body)
