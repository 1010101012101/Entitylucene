Non Stop Kernel Panics on Mavericks <body> I've been facing a really hard kernel panic problem. I bought this macbook pro 17" about 5 months ago and at that time I had a few kernel panics but didn't event bothered cause I could still use it anyway.  A month from now I couldn't even work cause there would be kp's every 5 minutes. I'm from Brazil and there's no Genius Bar over here so I sent to the authorized support guys in my city. It stayed there for about 2 weeks and they couldn't map the problem. I was told to try and send it to a different city via mail but i'm really afraid something would happen to the machine.  The thing is I have no more warranty and the support couldn't fix it. The only way to get pass the problem is to log in safe boot, which is what i'm doing now so that I can write.  The log is below and I'm not really sure but apparently they're different every time. I still believe it can be something I can solve at home due to the fact that in safe boot it works properly for as long as I want so I don't think it's hardware related, hopefully.

Thanks for now!  <answer136048> It indicates that your Web kit is the creator or the problems.  That is why the service guys could not reproduce the problem (different Network set up).  Try operating for a while without been connected to the Web.  Here are some trouble shooting steps I would recommend:  In Safe mode the AMD graphics card is Disabled (so are also all 3d party applications). I have a problem her: Your model should have the AMD Radeon HD 6750M!.  But the driver loaded is the com.apple.AMDRadeonX3000 1.2.2  ul liTo disable the AMD graphics (temporarly to prvoe it is it doing ot):  Boot into Single-User mode Execute the following commands:/li /ul  pre /sbin/fsck -fy /     /sbin/mount -uw /     mkdir /Disabled_System_Library_Extensions     cd /Disabled_System_Library_Extensions     mv /System/Library/Extensions/ATI* .     mv /System/Library/Extensions/AMD* .     touch /System/Library/Extensions     exit /pre  ul liUnder Apple About This mac, look up what you actually have as Graphics chip./li /ul  Hardware:  First check I/O errors (disk or memory) by opening console (in your utility folder) and typing I/O in the filter window.  That model of yours will have the Apple Hardware Test installed, use it to do more hardware test.  Software:  ul liTry different user to see if problem persist/li liIf no problem with that user, repair your User account. Reset ACL's./li liUse Console after system crash/lockup, remember the time, and find in Console the activity before the crash./li liupdate your EFI and SMC to latest./li liLast not Least,- If you have saved the Mavericks installer use it to reinstall, if not use the Internet recovery./li /ul  Most important is to get the information from Console at the time stamp of the crash to see what lead to it.  Your system information of relevance:  Mavericks 10.9.3 (Mac OS version: 13D65)  Graphics AMD Radeon HD 6750M  <answer136183> There are several Apple support pages on Kernel Panics.   "When your computer spontaneously restarts or displays "Your computer restarted because of a problem."' -- http://support.apple.com/kb/TS4636  "Mac OS X: How to log a kernel panic" -- http://support.apple.com/kb/ht2546  See the links on these pages if you want to go deeper.  <comment161306> The easiest way is probably to backup using timemachine or manually and then reinstalling (via recovery partition or a usb drive) and restoring your personal files (or user), reinstall applications from scratch if possible. If it still happens, try using a different user (or even reinstalling without restoring the backup at first - if it still happens than it's a hardware issue, there are things like TechTool to check (some) hardware yourself, otherwise an Apple Repair Center should do a hardware check on it) <comment161718> You mentioned it's a 17".  Is it by any chance an early 2011 MacBook Pro?  That model has known issues with the discrete graphics chip burning up.  That could easily cause a kernel panic.  The faulting thread being WebKit makes sense.  That's Safari right there.  If you go to a web page that requests video acceleration, your kernel would try to switch to the discrete graphics chip, and BAM! Kernel panic.
