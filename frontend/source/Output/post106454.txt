When I click on Install App, nothing happens <body> I am trying to install Mavericks on my 2009 Macbook Pro running OS 10.7.5.  When I click on Install App in the App Store, Mavericks doesn't install. Either nothing happens, or a spinner briefly appears at the top and then disappears.  An I doing something wrong here? I've never used the App Store before, so maybe there's something I'm missing. The first time I was prompted for my Apple password, which I put in.  Here's a video I made of what happens.  <answer106575> I solved this issue by doing the following  ul liTurn on the Debug Menu in the App Store using  precodedefaults write com.apple.appstore ShowDebugMenu -bool true /code/pre/li liUsing the Debug Menu, clear cookies and reset the application/li liOpen the Downloads directory and delete the com.apple.appstore folder/li liQuit the App Store and kill the storeagent process/li liTry to install again/li /ul  I had to do the above steps a couple times before I got it to work.
