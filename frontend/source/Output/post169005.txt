How do you delete a book on iBooks <body> My brother downloaded some books on my iBooks account and I want it permanently off my purchased and all books thing. I have iOS 8.1.2 so none of the answers in the previous question.   <answer169012> Touch on "select" button  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dnDKA.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Select the book and touch on "trash" button  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/R9pVV.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Or you have a similar question to completely delete an iBook :  Is it possible to COMPLETELY delete a Book from my purchased books?
