Reverse Resume Functionality for Safari <body> I would like to reverse the resume keys for Safari. i.e.; Command-Q should quit and not save any tabs (since that is what I normally want to do). Cmd-Opt-Q should save windows.  I know I can disable resume system-wide.  I know I can use   precodedefaults write com.apple.Safari NSQuitAlwaysKeepsWindows -bool false /code/pre  or other trickery (locking the saved state folder) to disable Resume per application.  In this case, I don't want to disable Resume for Safari, I just want it to reflect that 90% of the time, it isn't what I want to do.  <answer25717> This is easily done using the normal strongKeyboard/strong system preference.   Go into the strongKeyboard Shortcuts/strong section, then Applications, then Safari  Add the last two and you should be good to go...  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/UE9HT.png" alt="enter image description here"
