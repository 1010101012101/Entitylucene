Communicate with Siri via text (command line) not speaking <body> I use macOS Sierra beta. It's the first time I play with Siri. I enabled always iOS and macOS privacy/security options, nevertheless Siri knows very much about me.  Is it possible to input text for Siri and the output also text only? It's annoying for my family to hear me speaking with Siri.  This feature not implemented? I wish also a command line interface.
