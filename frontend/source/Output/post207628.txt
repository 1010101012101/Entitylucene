Audio is deactivated after each reboot on Yosemite <body> After clean installing Yosemite and rebooting my MacBook Pro, audio seems to be deactivated, although the sound is active and I can use it. But I can't change the volume. The icon in the menu bar is grayed out:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uIjc6.png" alt="enter image description here"  If I run  precodesudo killall coreaudiod /code/pre  in the terminal, it is activated and I can use it as usual again.  What could cause the problem and how can I fix it?  <answer207658> Have you tried a NVRAM and SMC reset?  <comment250622> Yes, no luck. I even tried another clean install. Same problem.
