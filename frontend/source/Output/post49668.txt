How do I move a row between two rows in Numbers? <body> Simple question. In iWork's Numbers, is there any way to move a row of data between two rows, as opposed to just plopping it on top of existing data? You can easily do this in Excel if you hold down the kbdShift/kbd + kbdCommand/kbd key or some simliar combination when moving a row or even a group of rows.  <answer49682> Click on the row in which you want your copied or cut (moved) line to be placed and select "strongInsert/strong" from the menu bar and select "strongCopied Rows/strong"   hr  For something similar to a strongkey combo/strong you may want to try the following  ol likbdOption ⌥/kbd + kbd↑/kbd on the row you want to move your info to./li likbdCommand ⌘/kbd + kbdV/kbd to paste your info to the new row./li /ol  <answer50868> ol liClick and release in the column header/li liDrag the column header.

That will replace the column you drag to.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/AzpZk.jpg" alt="enter image description here"
