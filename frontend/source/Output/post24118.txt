How to download Bootcamp drivers without Bootcamp assistant? <body> I'm setting up my MacBook Air for a Windows-only boot setup.br This was easy enough. It already had rEFIt on it, I just connected a Windows 7 boot thumb drive, and away I went.  However, it seems Apple strongdoes not let you download Bootcamp drivers outside of their assistant tool/strong. Reinstalling OS X just for the drivers is ridiculous.  emThis laptop no longer has OS X on it at all./em How do I get the required drivers? I cannot find them anywhere on Apple's support pages.  supEvery other manufacturer has their drivers available for download. /sup  How do I download the Windows drivers for my 2010 MacBook Air strongwithout/strong the BootCamp Assistant?  <answer24137> Try this: Apple DL1443: Boot Camp Software Update 3.3 for Windows. It's called an update, but I suspect it doesn't require any pre-existing installed drivers.  That said, it's probably worth your while to keep a minimal OS X install, even if it's just on a spare external drive (you could probably get away with a 16 GB USB drive even). It gives you a good recovery option if anything goes wrong, and it also gives you a way to get the occasional firmware updates, which you can't install from Windows.  <answer59079> Yes, It is possible to download the Bootcamp drivers outside of the Bootcamp tool:  strongUpdated/strong:   ul litimothy-sutton's answer will make your life so much easier, go there first/li liFor Windows Vista through 8.1, Apple have published a table of 'which download you need for which model' at https://support.apple.com/kb/HT5634/li liFor WinXP, see robmathers' answer./li liThe hard way which follows here, taken from  http://www.cafe-encounter.net/p682/download-bootcamp-drivers is your fallback if you want or need to work it from scratch.  ol liDownload from Apple the http://swscan.apple.com/content/catalogs/others/index-lion-snowleopard-leopard.merged-1.sucatalog file.

The page was aimed at people struggling with BootCamp, but either way, it gets you to the BootCamp.pkg file, which contains the drivers.   You still need open the OS X installer pkg file to get the the contents out, and to open a DMG file. If you are already in Windows, 7-zip will open it: http://www.cafe-encounter.net/p860/opening-a-bootcamp-driver-download-on-windows-7-or-8-with-7-zip  <answer80295> This 'Apple DL1443: Boot Camp Software Update 3.3 for Windows' is definitely the required Update.  I have a 2010 Macbook Pro with Snow Leopard (10.6.8) installed and couldn't get the right Boot Camp upgrade using any of the Apple download software from within the bootcamp Application. After installing this Update/Upgrade suddenly all of the required drivers appeared in the Windows 'Device manager' and everything started working perfectly  <answer85640> Found a quicker answer for myself...  I figured out that only the URL to the pkg is HTTP.  So I just start the download with Wireshark capture active, and use the "follow TCP stream" option to get the URL when I see an IP address show up lots of times during the download.  Add host and URL together and you have your Mac's specific URL.  <answer121638> Either Chris F Carroll needs to update his answer, or mark mine as correct!    Answer: http://support.apple.com/downloads/#macoscomponents  P.S.  Perhaps I'm a bit of a 'paranoid ready-for-the-end-of-the-world' type, but anyway you look at it (or me) - I wouldn't recommend trusting third party downloads of drivers, unless you have the inside scoop on what goes into making them (which you don't).  Why?  They are not responsible to you for supporting issues that occur, and they COULD contain malicious code.  <answer126521> A link to a reference table of which download is intended for which Mac is provided in the first paragraph of each download page.  <answer235324> I have written a tool that helps me deploy Boot Camp in an organization where we manage a dual-boot lab environment, and one of its features is that it can download the driver package for arbitrary models:  https://github.com/timsutton/brigadier  Either git clone or download an archive of the repo, then within the root of the repo (using an iMac15,1 here as an example):  code./brigadier --model iMac15,1/code  The code--model/code option can be omitted and it will download the latest version for the current model. In cases where multiple installers exist on Apple's software update server, you specify an alternate package.  It runs on both OS X and Windows. For Windows I provide a compiled exe so that a Python installation isn't required.  <comment68094> It would be nice when the procedure from http://www.cafe-encounter.net/p640/bootcamp-4-lion-drivers-download was inlined in the answer. <comment68275> Inlined for you, at least as soon as my edit gets approved. <comment72081> the file for mountain lion can be found here: http://swscan.apple.com/content/catalogs/others/index-mountainlion-lion-snowleopard-leopard.merged-1.sucatalog <comment81594> This seems to be dead - did apple change something for windows 8? <comment82738> Really? The page at http://www.cafe-encounter.net/p682/download-bootcamp-drivers is still working, even updated for late 2012. <comment83715> Thanks for the update, it was a life-saver. <comment98697> Oh and I found that if you run through the installer, /Library/Application Support/BootCamp/WindowsSupport.dmg is where I found it with a default installation. <comment145741> To be fair, the question was asked 2 years ago!  Also, please note, my website does NOT give you third party downloads: The links are all to URLs on http://swcdn.apple.com/. The hard work -- and Apple is *still* not helping with this -- is working out which download link you need for which older model of Mac. The new apple bootcamp links at http://support.apple.com/downloads/#bootcamp are great but still only name a handful of models; for the rest you are left guessing which download you need. <comment148239> Which download page are you referring to here? <comment331106> As of late 2016, this should be marked as the answer. The link above, http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5634 , does not offer downloads for Windows 8.1 or 10. <comment332330> I am so impressed with this, thank you Timothy <comment335275> I think that's the required update for WinXP but not for Vista or 7 or later?
