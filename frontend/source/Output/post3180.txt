Why do X11 applications start but their windows stay invisible? <body> After using a fresh OS X system for a while, I regularly hit the point where X11 clients start and run, but their windows do not show up anywhere.  I suspect it has something to do with Mac port paths, but i am not sure. Has anyone else experienced this?  <answer4781> It might be a bit of a workaround, but you could try installing XQuartz, a newer version of X11. It bypasses X11 rather than replacing it, so you should be able to uninstall it again if you want Apple's X11 back.  <comment2945> I have recently installed ghostscript and for some reason X11 starts whenever I use gs, but no windows appear. Not sure if my issue is related to yours, but I'm interested in a solution as well :-) <comment2987> This sounds similar, indeed.
