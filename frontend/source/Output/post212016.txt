Weird screen problems---iPhone 5S, iOS 8.3 <body> I was using the "Alien Blue" reddit app on my iPhone when suddenly the app closed out and my phone turned off.  After turning the phone back on I was greeted with a flickering backlight in both lock screen and home screen. After a few soft resets, the screen flicker has gone away, but now I can not open any app. They all force quit/crash immediately. Has anyone else encountered something similar? The phone is in a LifeProof case and has never been washed, dropped, or damaged in anyway.

Still didn't need to upgrade to 9.0.2.
