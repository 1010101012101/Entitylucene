Change Finder window text size via AppleScript or shell? <body> I would like to create shortcuts to "zoom" my Finder window text size.  I have tried in AppleScript  precodetell application "Finder"     if text size of list view options of front window = 10 then         set text size of list view options of front window to 16     else         set text size of list view options of front window to 10     end if end tell /code/pre  which works but I cannot see the change until I "refresh" the window by closing and re-opening it.  I tried adding  precodeupdate items of front window /code/pre  but this does nothing.  Any way to do this elegantly?  I'm on El Capitan.  <comment314833> What Apple OS version are you using? Also, please edit your post to include enough of the _code_ to easily reproduce, so as to test with what you actually have, which is certainly more then what you've posted since the first line that you did post contains an uninitialized variable as provided. <comment314878> The last version of OS X that worked in by itself was OS X 10.8 and since OS X 10.9 it has been an issue. The only other option I can think of would be a UI type approach where you brought up the View Options floating window and manipulated it there. That said, I'd opt for programmatically closing and reopening the target window.
