bi-directionally sync Google Photos on external drive <body> I see in this post (Any way to auto download or sync all Google+ photos to my Mac?) that there's a good solution to bi-directionally syncing photos between my laptop and my Google Photos account (which would also sync photos uploaded from my phone, which occurs automatically).  B/c this storage can potentially become a bit large, I'd like to store my Google Photos on a 256GB SDHC card that is always plugged in to my computer.  The problem is, it appears I need the Google Photos folder to reside within my Google Drive folder, which is not on this external storage.  Is there a good way to point my local Google Photos folder to external storage without messing up my other Google Drive folders?  <answer202681> ol liMove Google drives folder to the new drive/li liIn Google Drive's settings, you should be able to select another directory./li /ol  I'm not completely sure if this works, as I've only done it this way:  ol liSign out of drive/li liResign-in, and during the setup process, select advanced, and choose the folder location/li /ol
