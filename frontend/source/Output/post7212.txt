Why is Push notifications required for GPS to work? <body> How are they related? How is Push notifications used in iPhone Maps application?   After jailbreaking my Push notifications and GPS are not working. I know I can install Pushfix from Cydia but it costs money but my question is why? Why should I fix Push for GPS to work.  iPhone 3G on iOS 4.2.1 unlocked with iPad baseband 6.15.00  <answer7421> As far as I know, they are not related. If I turn off push, either on my jailbroken iphone or my girl's unjailbroken one, GPS and maps keep on working just fine.  strongedit:/strong Reading little bit more on pushfix I'll try to explain what became clear to me.  Push and Maps or GPS are still unrelated.  Jailbreaking is a legal procedure to make your iPhone free from "apple locks". That's where the name came from.  With that, a jailbroken iPhone can do things apple doesn't allow, but without a proper tool installed "jailbreaking" does nothing.  strongpushfix/strong is a tool to fix a problem on the push notifications brought by activating the iphone without an authorized SIM (a.k.a. Hacktivated iPhone). empushfix/em was further improved to fix other problems, probably brought by the same Hacktivation, such as Wifi and GPS.  I emhighly/em recommend you do a lot more research and get familiarized with the terms and issues related to iPhone (yes, that's stronga lot of reading/strong and quite complicated) or just get an Android! ;)  Here are some good starting points (other than the link already provided):  ul lihttp://www.google.com/search?q=iphone+jailbreaking/li lihttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS_jailbreaking/li lihttps://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/jailbreak+iphone/li /ul  And some good sources:  ul lihttp://thebigboss.org/jailbreak-now/li lihttp://blog.iphone-dev.org/ (very technical and complicated)/li /ul  <comment7701> Or, you could undo the jailbreak and have it all working. At no cost. <comment8038> Can't. I am using it in India. I can use it only after unlock. <comment8039> Then, why do people install Pushfix to have working GPS after jailbreaking? <comment8061> @Manish my point on the answer is that I never heard of such thing and I agree on your awkwardness about it. They shouldn't be related as much as they seem to not be related to me, from everything I ever saw about iPhones. ... (some time passed) ... Reading about pushfix on http://www.pushfix.info/notifications I can see now your problem is about hacking iphone activation and that "pushfix" is a generic tool that fix that along with issues that hacking brings.
