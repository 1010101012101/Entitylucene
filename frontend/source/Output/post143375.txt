Can I swap the SSD from mid-2013 Macbook Air and mid-2014 Macbook Pro? <body> I bought a Macbook Air with a 256 GB in mid 2013.  I bought a Macbook Pro with a 128 GB in mid 2014.  I'd like to swap the SSDs if possible. Are the parts compatible?  I'm looking at these two guides on iFixit.  ul liMacbook Air 13" Mid-2013 SSD replacement/li liMacbook Pro 13" Mid-2014 SSD replacement/li /ul  The parts stronglook/strong compatible, but I'd like to a little further confirmation before dissecting both of the laptops.  hr  strongAdditional info/strong  I just did a speed test on each drive.  precode                  Model      Read        Write       Vendor Macbook Air 13"   Mid-2013   ~750 MB/s   ~700 MB/s   Samsung/Samsung Macbook Pro 13"   Mid-2014   ~750 MB/s   ~350 MB/s   Sandisk/Marvell /code/pre  The Macbook Air's SSD has strongdouble/strong the write speed! So if it works, I have even more (than disk capacity) to gain from making the swap.  Makes me really sad that Apple isn't more specific with these details on their website.  strongTools required/strong  precode              Security Bits Macbook Air   P5 Pentalobe, T5 Torx Macbook Pro   T5 Torx /code/pre  I ordered the iFixit 54-Bit Driver Kit which includes the tools I'll need to try this.

When I put the 256 GB drive in my Macbook Pro, it doesn't boot and displays this image  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/y8ULs.jpg" alt="cannot boot"  I tried holding down kbdopt/kbd to boot to a usb drive and do a fresh install of Mavericks on the drive.  When I attempt to boot from the USB drive, the crossed out circle image is displayed again.  I've also tried holding down kbdshift/kbd during boot to boot into safe mode. The neutral gray screen displays for a longer time, but eventually the crossed out circle appears again.  <answer170247> how is it going? I hope you were able to fix the issue you were experiencing, I'm sure you didn't push the SSD all he way in. I swapped the SSD between the two Macs myself and it was very smooth. Hit me up if you need any help.  <answer246367> Restart computer hold CMD+R it will boot into recovery  Click reinstall OS X  <comment200245> Which two models did you swap between?
