Apply display settings for a folder recursively <body> h2Question/h2  When I change the display settings in Finder, it is only applied for the current folder that I'm in.  strongI want to apply a display settings for all (sub-)folders in/strong code~/Pictures/code.   Since it's only for code~/Pictures/code, using the option 'Use as Defaults' will not help me. How can I do this?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ITJTq.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  h2Solution (thanks to @hobs)/h2  The following tutorial uses an automator workflow. The workflow has to be run again when you add a new subdirectory to code~/Pictures/code.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/SE52g.jpg" alt="enter image description here" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zS3Hx.jpg" alt="enter image description here" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kRV3x.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer32139> I think your question fits with this thread and my answer to it: System-wide finder view preferences  Short answer, it isnt that easy, but if you are willing do to some work you can make it happen.  <answer32157> Laborious but should do what you want: open each subfolder, set the display settings you want to use, then check “Always open in * view” at the top of the display settings inspector panel. This will save all the defaults.  <comment36883> Worked like a charm! Thank you. However, once I added new folders, the settings were not inherited. But then you can save the workflow.
