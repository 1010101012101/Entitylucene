Disassociate an Apple ID from a computer <body> There's a work computer (iMac) I'll soon stop using, which might be used by other people in the future.  While I've mainly used a separate work-only Apple ID on the computer, I suspect I may have used my personal Apple ID on the computer from time to time.  I want to make sure that my personal Apple ID isn't used in the future on the work computer. How do I ensure this is the case?  <answer161944> Go to System Preferences, and check "iCloud" and "Internet Accounts". Sign out where necessary, and once neither of them list your personal account, you're good to go.  You may also want to make sure your web browsers don't remember any of your passwords.  <answer161954> strongRemoving an associated device or computer from an Apple ID/strong  To remove a device or computer from your Apple ID:  ol liOpen iTunes./li liSign in to your Apple ID by choosing strongStore/strong  strongSign In/strong from the strongiTunes/strong menu./li liChoose strongStore/strong  strongView My Account/strong from the iTunes menu. /li liFrom the Account Information screen, click strongManage Devices/strong./li liClick the strongRemove/strong button next to the device name you would like to unassociate. /li /ol  strongNote/strong: Removing a device from your Apple ID does not override the 90-day timer.

For instance, the next user who tries to sign in sees your AppleId by default, and certain apps like FaceTime appear to retain info (like recent calls) even though you are logged out.
