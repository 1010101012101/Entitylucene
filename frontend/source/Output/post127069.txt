networksetup -disconnectpppoeservice not working <body> I love doing stuff on terminal, a lot. Thats how I found this command to connect to my PPP service:  precode$ networksetup -connectpppoeservice HUAWEIMobile- /code/pre  And its works successfully to connect my PPP service. But, when I'm trying to disconnect my PPP using   precodenetworksetup -disconnectpppoeservice HUAWEIMobile- /code/pre  It's not working. Is there something with my command?  <answer127076> I am going here on a hunch !  precodesudo networksetup -disconnectpppoeservice HUAWEIMobile-  sudo networksetup -showpppoestatus HUAWEIMobile-  /code/pre  You confirmed it says      connected   I further assume when you activate the PPoE service it will respond with user + password request.  Since that information was not supplied it will wait for it and refuse your disconnect request.  So we can try the activate with user name and password, then do the disconnect, you can find the appropriate command set here.  <comment148860> stupid question, do you need root or admin privileges to do it ? <comment148861> No, I don't need admin priviliges. I even tries using sudo but it doesn't work. <comment148864> First command say nothing. Second command say `connected`. <comment363253> Nope, I'm having this issue and it's definitely connected. All other commands work fine, just this one does nothing.
