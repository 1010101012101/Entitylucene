Unable to install Chrome or Safari extensions after creating new user account <body> emMac OS X El Capitan/em   This ordeal began when I was unable to connect Time Machine to a newly purchased Time Capsule; it still wanted to hang on to an older external drive which had died. I called Apple and they instructed me to create a new user account and try connecting the Time Capsule. This worked and I was able to back up to Time Capsule.  But. Reinstallation of Google Chrome extensions fails. First I see a dialog box I didn't see before:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4P0kM.png" alt="Chrome extension download dialog box"  Then when I click 'Save', it displays this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lVOeZ.png" alt="Error has occurred; download interrupted"  And in the download bar, the item is tagged "Failed -- insufficient permissions".  Extension installation fails for Safari also.   I tried booting into the recovery partition and repairing the user permissions, but that did not solve the problem.  Any ideas?  <answer296402> Every one  I know the question is too old to answer now, But I think my answer will save any ones time some day, anyways here is a solution of this problem.  For fixing chrome "Insufficient Permissions" error issue, solutions as follows  In terminal fire following command   precodesudo chown -Rf &lt;YOUR USER ACCOUNT NAME&gt;:staff ~/Library/Application\ Support/Google/Chrome /code/pre  This will allow chrome to write down new extensions files to your system.  <comment374358> OP here. I can't remember how I solved this. It may have had something to do with SIP. Or maybe I upgraded to Sierra. Anyway, thanks for the answer.
