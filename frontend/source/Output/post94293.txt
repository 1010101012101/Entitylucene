How to export files from hard drive in Snow Leopard CD? <body> I have a macbook 5,1 that won't startup. I'm going to reinstall Snow Leopard with the CD, but is there a way to export some of the files that are in it? I can't seem to gain access to them through the terminal in the SL CD:  codecd Desktop/code outputs  codeNo such file or directory/code  and  codepwd/code outputs  codevar/root/code  if I codecd ~//code then codels/code, there is only a Library folder, and no Users folder etc.  <answer94461> Keep in mind that you are booted to a different volume/system when you boot to the installer DVD.  With that in mind you can use codels /Volumes/code to get a list of volume names.  Presumably you will see Macintosh HD (or different name if you renamed the internal volume) listed, if so you can use codecd /Volumes/Macintosh\ HD/code to switch to the internal drive. If your internal drive is named differently then keep in mind that spaces should be replaced with code\/code (a backslash followed by a space) in Terminal. Once you're in the correct volume your earlier commands should work as expected.  That same codels /Volumes/code command should show the path of your external hard drive as well.  You could copy the files using something along the lines of codecp /Volumes/Macintosh\ HD/file1.jpg /Volumes/Backup\ Drive/Folder1/code.  If you are attempting to copy everything from the hard drive you can use the following command to force a copy of everything, skipping over corrupted data that would otherwise cause the process to hang or stop...  precodecp -Rfv /original/data /destination/drive /code/pre  or, following my previous example  precodecp -Rfv /Volumes/Macintosh\ HD/ /Volumes/Backup\ Drive/ /code/pre  <comment110536> Keep in mind that you are booted to a different volume/system when you boot to the installer DVD.  With that in mind you can use "ls /Volumes" without the quotes to get a list of volume names.  Presumably you will see Macintosh HD (or different name if you renamed the internal volume) listed, if so you can use "cd /Volumes/Macintosh\ HD" to switch to the internal drive.  If your internal drive is named differently then keep in mind that spaces should be replaced with "\ " in Terminal.  Once you're in the correct volume your earlier commands should work as expected. <comment110575> You might want to take out the HDD and attach it to a working computer with an USB connected HDD chassis or similar. <comment110662> @MrRabbit, thank you so much, that worked. I can see the files. Now I just have to figure out how to copy them to an external drive. <comment110748> @JackStewart No worries.
