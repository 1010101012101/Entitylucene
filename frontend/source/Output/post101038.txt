Automate opening multiple tabs when starting Terminal <body> I am trying to automate opening of multiple tabs, naming each tab (codeprintf "\e]1;${TAB_NAME}\a"/code) and doing a codecd/code and maybe something else in each tab.  Can that be done either in a startup script or, better yet, configured within Terminal itself?  <answer101040> You can try this. strongUPDATED/strong  You can use the Terminal Profiles to give each tab its own profile. This way you can set the shell command for each Tab individually.  And you can save the widow group (tabs) so they will open on Terminal launch.  ----------Example of set up  Set up your tabs in a window, I.e cd to the directories in each Tab as desired.  Then go to the Terminal Preferences and to  strongSettings/strong Tab menu:.  ol liSelect the Basic Profile/li liclick the + button at the bottom. This will duplicate the profile./li liname the new profile (example strongemhome/em/strong) Repeat steps 1 -3 as many times as your count of tabs. And name them with individual unique names/li /ol  My example I will have 'home' and 'work'  Now for my 'home' profile I will:  4, Select the Shell tab.  5, check 'Run command'  6, set the command string to  emcd ~/em  7,  check 'Run inside shell'   For each profile I will repeat steps 5-7 changing the cd command accordingly img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/f7YO2.png" alt="enter image description here"  In my tab named 'Home Dir' I will:  ol licrtl + click on the window to get the contextual menu, and select 'Show inspector'/li liselect the 'settings' tab/li liset it's profile to the 'home' profile./li /ol  For each Tab I will repeat steps 1-3 changing the profile accordingly.  Now my Home tab's profile should be the 'home' profile and my tab named 'Work Dir'  profile should be the 'work' profile   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/g9enL.png" alt="enter image description here"  Now using the using the Windows Menu "Save Windows As Group"  Check the checkbox  - "Use window group when Terminal starts"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qFuCn.png" alt="enter image description here"  I have tested it as best I can and this set up works.  Each Tab opens in the cd's to it's own directory. And does so on Terminal start up.  I like this so much, I am going to use it myself.  <comment118957> Hi I have updated my answer with something that works
