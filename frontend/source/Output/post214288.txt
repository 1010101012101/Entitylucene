Change Preview Highlighter color <body> is there a way to change the highlighter colors back before capitan update? better yet, choose your own colors  i loved the vibrant colors used prior. now the new colors are boring, "lowlighters".  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/RWNW9.png" alt="highlight colors, upper before update, lower after update"  Can I crank up the intensity of the notes in any way?
