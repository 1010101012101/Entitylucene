Can I retrieve my notes from my iCloud without the phone? <body> Recently my phone broke and it doesn't turn on anymore, and I have been wanting to retrieve my notes on iCloud but only found that the ones that were backed up on the iCloud were some useless ones that I don't really needâ€¦ so my question is: is there a way to retrieve all notes from my iCloud from my computer without the phone?  <answer259846> All your iCloud notes are accessible from iCloud.com/#notes2. If the notes you're looking for are not listed here, they are not stored in iCloud.
