Can I download the Yosemite install "app" on a MacBook Air, move it to an install USB drive, and install it on a MacBook Pro? <body> That is, is there a difference between the Yosemite install "app" that I would get on the Mac App Store, between the one I would get on a MacBook Air vs. on a MacBook Pro?  Trying to download it on my Air and install it clean on my Pro.  <answer162532> The Install App that you download from the Mac App Store is a universal installer that isn't tied to a specific model/build.  Similar to the retail installation discs from earlier operating system releases.  It will install properly on any supported systems that meet the requirements.  So yes, as long as the installer is from the Mac App Store then you should be able to copy it to a thumb drive and install it on any supported Macs.  <comment190094> does the MBP qualifies for 10.10 ? <comment190129> Yes, it does. Thanks. <comment190171> That is all correct. Here's some info on how to get Yosemite into a drive just in case http://osxdaily.com/2014/10/18/clean-install-os-x-yosemite/ <comment193210> You can use the install app on any compatible mac. But the app requires an existing installation of a compatible and functioning OS X to install the new version. If you need you can create Bootable USB drives to install or to fix disk problems following [this procedure](http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/106112/11600)
