command not found for shell script <body> I created the following bash script in OS X 10.7.5:  precode$ cd ~/Documents/github/scripts $ vim hello_world.sh   #!/bin/bash  clear  echo "The script starts now."  echo "Hi, $USER!"  echo "I will now fetch you a list of connected users:" echo w echo  echo "I'm setting two variables now." COLOUR="black" VALUE="9" echo "This is a string: $COLOUR" echo "AND this is a number: $VALUE" echo  echo "I'm giving you back your prompt now." echo /code/pre  Then I make sure it is executable:  precode$ chmod ugo+rwx hello_world.sh $ ls -l -rwxrwxrwx  1 GuardDog_02  staff  325 Mar 13 18:51 hello_world.sh /code/pre  Then I add the directory to the contents of the PATH variable:  precode$ vim ~/.profile export PATH=/Users/GuardDog_02/QtSDK/Desktop/Qt/474/gcc/bin/:/opt/local/bin:/opt/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/opt/X11/bin:/usr/X11/bin:/usr/local/mysql/bin PATH=$PATH:/Users/GuardDog_02/Documents/github/scripts export PATH /code/pre  I then run the following to have the effect applied:  precode$ . ~/.profile /code/pre  Then I open a new controlling terminal window, and I run hello_world.sh, but get command not found:  precode$ hello_world.sh -bash: hello_world.sh: command not found /code/pre  Why isn't the shell script recognized from the interactive bash shell in the controlling terminal? I tried the same thing in Ubuntu and it worked just fine.  <answer124274> Do you have a code~/.bash_profile/code? If so, then that will be preferred over the code~/.profile/code startup script. Next, verify the setting of your path (codeecho $PATH/code). Also (and this may be a dumb question) are you actually logged in as GuardDog_02? In other words, is code~/code emidentical/em to code/Users/GuardDog_02/code?  <comment255545> Nice. Also if people need more help, see http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/208425/5472
