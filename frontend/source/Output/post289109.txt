chrome - element close when inspect element <body> I try to 'inspect element' in chrome.  The element has a JS trigger that hide the element when mouse out.  When I try to 'right click' + 'inspect element' the element disappear and the inspector is showing the wrong element - the element that was covered by the actual element.  The same procedure works in chrome+win10  How can I inspect the correct element on chrome+mac?
