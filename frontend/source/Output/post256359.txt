Macbook restarting in a loop. Stuck on "OS X Utilities" when trying to fix it <body> I have a 2008 MackBook that cannot be turned on. It keeps restarting in a loop. It displays the Apple logo and a loading bar and then some text with a black background before restarting again.  Among other things it shows: "Debugger called: "  Here is what I have tried so far:  ol liStarted in Single User mode using CMD-S and tried repairing the hard disk using /sbin/fsck -fy I didn't get any errors. I got a message that says disk was modified./li liReplaced the RAM since I had some spear RAM bars./li liStarted in Safe Mode using the Shift key. /li liStarted from the recovery partition. I get to the "OS X Utilities" with the 4 options. I tried all of them and no one works. I can move between them using the tab key. But when I click twice on any of them or select "Continue" nothing happens./li liTried Internet recovery but got the same result as in step # 4./li liStarted from the Snow Leopard installation disk. It takes a long time to start but then the farthest step I can get to is the screen where I have to click on 'agree'. I can move between the agree and the 'back' options but nothing happens when I click on 'agree'./li liTried installing Yosemite from a USB drive but got the same result as in step # 6./li /ol  I don't know what to try next. Any help or suggestions would be much appreciated.  <comment319704> The first thing you should do is boot in [Verbose Mode](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201573) by holding Cmd-V.  See what errors it gives you before it restarts.  You will also want to run [Apple Hardware Test (AHT)](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201257).  Hold the D key while booting from a powered off state with the AC adapter connected.
