Using the "find -name" command on OS X <body> In the command codefind/code theres a switch called name but it doesn't exist in OS X, whats the equivalent switch for OS X?   <answer41014> Actually you can use the find command as in unix e.g.: find . -name "*.log"  At least on all of my mac systems works this.  see 'man find':  precode-name pattern          True if the last component of the pathname being examined matches          pattern.  Special shell pattern matching characters (``['',          ``]'', ``*'', and ``?'') may be used as part of pattern.  These          characters may be matched explicitly by escaping them with a          backslash (``\''). /code/pre  <comment46423> It's the same. Use "find . -name ..." -- you need to use directory where to search before other expressions like -name. <comment46424> My mistake kept thinking it was like a switch not an option so was putting my directory after it causing it to error. <comment46427> You should have provided this as an answer Peter
