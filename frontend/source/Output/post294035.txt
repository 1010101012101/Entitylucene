System Information Recognizes iPhone, Xcode/iTunes Does Not <body> Following the directions outlined by Apple here, i can confirm that the system itself recognizes my device, but iTunes and (more importantly) Xcode refuse to. I made sure to update everything i could; and since this is a vanilla install, I can think of no "third-party security software" that would conflict. How does one troubleshoot this?  strongPhone Type/strong: iPhone 6  strongmacOS version/strong: 10.12.6  strongiOS version/strong: 10.3.3  strongFull Output of codesystem_profiler SPUSBDataType/code/strong: here  <answer294377> This sounds like a problem with the iTunes Helper. Try reinstalling the latest version of iTunes, just in case something broke along the way.
