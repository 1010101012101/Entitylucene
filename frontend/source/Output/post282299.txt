sudo: command not found <body> Every time I try to use a sudo or ssh command, it returns with this error:  precodewhen:~ jackson1442$ sudo [insert any command here] -bash: sudo: command not found /code/pre  I was messing with Python installs, and am not sure what I did to cause this. How can I permanently fix this?  macOS Sierra 10.12.4 16E195 br MacBook Pro 2016 br 13" Touchbar  EDIT: here's the path:  precodewhen:~ jackson1442$ echo $PATH ’/usr/local/bin:?? /code/pre  Here is code.bash_profile/code  precode# Setting PATH for Python 2.7 # The original version is saved in .bash_profile.pysave PATH="/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/bin:${PATH}" export PATH  # Setting PATH for Python 3.6 # The original version is saved in .bash_profile.pysave PATH="/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.6/bin:${PATH}" export PATH  # Setting PATH for Python 3.5 # The original version is saved in .bash_profile.pysave PATH="/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.5/bin:${PATH}" export PATH export PATH=’/usr/local/bin:�� /code/pre  <answer282482> Your PATH is hosed!  First check your .bash_profile file with:  precode/usr/bin/nano ~/.bash_profile /code/pre  Prepend lines containing something like codeexport PATH="/... "/code with a code#/code to comment them out. Save the file with kbdctrl/kbdkbdO/kbd and exit nano with kbdctrl/kbdkbdX/kbd  Then check /etc/paths with: code/bin/cat /etc/paths/code.  It should look like this:  precode/usr/local/bin /usr/bin /bin /usr/sbin /sbin /code/pre  You can edit the file with code/usr/bin/sudo /usr/bin/nano /etc/paths/code if required.  If everything is fine enter codesource ~/.bash_profile/code or close the Terminal window and open a new one.  hr  Now sudo should work again. Then check all code#export PATH=.../code lines in your .bash_profile for potential errors. You may add them to your question to get help here.  <answer282485> sudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.locate.plist  <comment355840> @klanomath sorry about the delay Here it is: when:~ jackson1442$ echo $PATH ’/usr/local/bin:?? <comment355842> @klanomath is there a quick and easy fix to this? I'm pretty much a noob so any detailed instructions are much appreciated <comment355844> There is nothing in `.bash.profile` <comment355847> Thanks, my bad. I just had to quit terminal after commenting out that last funky line. <comment355849> After commenting out or removing the last line and sourcing your profile the PATH should be at least `.../3.5/bin:.../3.6/bin:/.../2.7bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin` now (I omitted each `/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/` here). <comment355853> @klanomath affirmative. It works! Not sure how that one at the end got there... <comment355854> If the OP states: *sudo [insert any command here] -bash: sudo: command not found* why should another command starting with `sudo ...` suddenly help/work?
