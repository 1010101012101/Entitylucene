Need a cli to check the sha256 hash of a file <body> To check the sha1 of a file I would use codeopenssl sha1 &lt;file&gt;/code I'm not sure what to use to check the sha256 hash of the file however, what would you recommend?  <answer230919> You can use codeopenssl sha -sha256 &lt;file&gt;/code or codeopenssl sha256 &lt;file&gt;/code.  To check command line options for the openssl sha command: codeopenssl sha -help/code.  <answer230920> OS X ships with a shasum command.  precode&gt; which shasum /usr/bin/shasum /code/pre  You can use:  precode&gt; shasum -a 256 &lt;file&gt; /code/pre  More details:  precode&gt; shasum --help Usage: shasum [OPTION]... [FILE]... Print or check SHA checksums. With no FILE, or when FILE is -, read standard input.    -a, --algorithm   1 (default), 224, 256, 384, 512, 512224, 512256   -b, --binary      read in binary mode   -c, --check       read SHA sums from the FILEs and check them   -t, --text        read in text mode (default)   -p, --portable    read in portable mode                         produces same digest on Windows/Unix/Mac   -0, --01          read in BITS mode                         ASCII '0' interpreted as 0-bit,                         ASCII '1' interpreted as 1-bit,                         all other characters ignored  The following two options are useful only when verifying checksums:   -s, --status      don't output anything, status code shows success   -w, --warn        warn about improperly formatted checksum lines    -h, --help        display this help and exit   -v, --version     output version information and exit  When verifying SHA-512/224 or SHA-512/256 checksums, indicate the algorithm explicitly using the -a option, e.g.    shasum -a 512224 -c checksumfile  The sums are computed as described in FIPS-180-4.  When checking, the input should be a former output of this program.  The default mode is to print a line with checksum, a character indicating type (`*' for binary, ` ' for text, `?' for portable, `^' for BITS), and name for each FILE.

I bet I got with the Xcode Command Line tools. Argh. I really wish Apple wouldn't pollute `/usr/bin` with optional stuff. I'll have to verify this is the case later today. Will update answer if it indeed came from the XCL install. <comment368161> `shasum` returns a different hash than `openssl sha -sha256 file`(with the latter being the correct hash). Any idea why? <comment369208> @ws6079 `shasum` is a perl script, uses `Digest::SHA` to compute the hash value. For the same file I get the exact same SHA using either `shasum` or `openssl` for a `SHA-256` hash computation. See: https://gist.github.com/ianchesal/82a064b8971eb5e717ce84f3ded6dbfd
