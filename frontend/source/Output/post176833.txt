Keynote exits presentation mode instead of advancing? <body> For some reason, while connected to a projector, when i use any of the obvious means to advance my slides (space bar, click track pad, right arrow key), the keynote presentation instead exits the presentation mode, remaining on the first slide. Why? How can I advance the slides?  <comment225867> In **Preferences** has presenter display been ticked?
