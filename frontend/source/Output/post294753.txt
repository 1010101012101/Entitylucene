How does a misspelled city name get fixed in Maps? <body> Apple has been misspelling the city "West Des Moines" as "West des Moines" (no capital "strongD/strong") for quite some time now. I tried reporting this issue a number of times through the Maps application during the past few years, but it has still not been fixed.  How do I go about getting the city name fixed? Who does Apple get the data for its cities on its Maps application? I'm guessing Apple's map provider or providers need to fix this at their level.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Q4cdI.png" width="360"  The same issue occurs when I take a pic in West Des Moines. The Photos app lists the location as "West des Moines".  <answer294845> I would send Apple this name change request through the feedback page Maps for iOS or Maps for Mac.

Because that one's showing with a capital D for me. <comment372036> @Phong No. Search for a location in West Des Moines, say Methodist West Hospital. Scroll down to below the phone number and web address (see photo). <comment372038> The city itself is spelled correctly, but the street mapping data doesnâ€™t want to capitalize the D. Something, something Rodney Dangerfield. <comment372210> I tried it. Can't hurt. I linked them to this page.
