Do I need to have system administrator permissions to install from the Mac App Store? <body> Where does the Mac App Store install its applications to? Is this a system-wide location, or somewhere inside my Home directory? Is it possible to use the App Store on machines where I am not a System Administrator (just like I can currently install almost all applications I manually download by putting them in code~/Applications/code instead of code/Applications/code)?  <answer6066> Yes.  Apps are installed to the usual code/Applications/code folder. Non-admin users can browse the store, but they will need an admin username/password to install apps.

However, you cannot delete them without an administrator's username and password.  <answer186691> Non-administrators can be added to the _appstore group:  http://darenhunter.com/how-to-allow-non-admin-mac-user-to-use-app-store/  <comment6298> Corollary: Does it support multiple users with their own iTunes accounts on the same computer? <comment6301> That's what I was afraid of. Can you still have applications from multiple users (with multiple iTunes accounts) on a shared computer (assuming they all have the admin password)? <comment6303> @Thilo: I haven't seen this specified. I'm sure people will test this, and we'll see reports soon enough.
