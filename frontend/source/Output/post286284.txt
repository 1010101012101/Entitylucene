How can I stop having to reconnect USB devices to my macbook? <body> About a month ago, I accidentally spilled some water on my macbook. After taking it to an Apple store, they reset some hardware settings and it seemed to boot fine.  But ever since then, when it goes to sleep, I have to reconnect USB devices after wake.  Is there something I can do to fix it?  <comment361170> Sounds like a hardware issue probably. Have you tried booting into safe mode? <comment361246> No. Is there something I can check in safe mode? <comment361253> Safe mode disables non-critical software; there's a chance that whatever issue might go away, but I doubt it.
