Where is "`" key on a physical Finnish keyboard using English layout? <body> My Mac-Pro uses a Finnish keyboard by "hardware".  When I switched to the US keyboard layout, I cannot type "`" anymore.  The place where kbd`/kbd usually appears (below kbdesc/kbd) gives  kbd§/kbd or kbd±/kbd (when kbdShift/kbd is pressed).  How to type "`" in my case?  <answer250672> Try the key to the left of the z.
