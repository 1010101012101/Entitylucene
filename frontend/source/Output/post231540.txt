Configure an always on proxy on a mac <body> I am trying to pass some network traffic on my mac to my arduino. I am currently making a Li-Fi system and I thought that the easiest way to this was to use a local proxy. I have made the proxy but have just realised that Mac can only connect to a proxy when a network interface is active. Is there a way to make another loopback interface and configure a proxy on it or force a network interface such as wifi, ethernet to be up.
