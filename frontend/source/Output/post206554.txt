Use diskutil without firmware password <body> Diskutil found some problems on my drive that need to be fixed in recovery mode. However the it department installed a password in the firmware. Is there anyway to start diskutil without the firmwarepassword? It only needs to fix some issue is in the partition table.  I tried to launch in single user modus. But apparently this only works if you don't install a firmware password.  <comment248972> The IT department probably set a firmware password for a reason. Why don't you reach out to them for help? <comment248973> @patrix they often do weird things with macs, that cost a lot of time to fix. Like installing software that cannot be updated. Setting this password was smart for most users though. <comment248980> If it is company hardware, have them solve the drive problem as well :-)
