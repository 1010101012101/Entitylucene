Large Library/Containers directory <body> The directory ~/Library/Containers has size 39GB on my system. This is huge. I guess that the directory contains some files created by running various apps. So the more applications I use, the more is being processed within the directory. It thus seems to be a cache-like directory. Can I safely just delete it?  strongPS./strong It turned out that majority of the space (37GB of 39GB) is taken by a single app â€“ CamWiz Webcam Recorder. But still, 2 GB are in the other files, so I should be able to do a cleanup and delete most if not all of the files there.  <comment282324> Depends on the app - they copy data to keep as well as caches <comment282376> Yeah, I'd leave it alone. Throw out a movie instead, you'd save more space, with less unintended effect.
