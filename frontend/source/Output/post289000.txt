Can you access SIRI search querys from an app that runs in the background? <body> Lets say i install a app on my phone which runs in the background, now every time i open SIRI and start with the word "BOX" as a example "box whatever" it will open a specfic website (like www.box.com) and use the words after box as a specific search query something like (www.box.com/search/whatever).  Essentially can a IOS app add functionality to SIRI to redirect specific commands to the app which then builds a URL (or whatever it needs to do)?  <answer291628> strongNo./strong  Siri has very specific Human Interface Guidelines. In order to follow such guidelines, your app can only do the following:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/e4TxJ.png" alt="Siri human interface guidelines"  These are provided by Apple.
