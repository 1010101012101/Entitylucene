Filter by group with pfctl <body> I'm using this example on 10.10.5 but I can't get my packets filtered correctly using pfctl:  precodedummynet out proto { tcp,udp } all group throttle pipe 1 /code/pre  Based on the codeman pfctl/code (see here):  precode   group &lt;group&gt;           Similar to user, this rule only applies to packets of sockets owned by the specified group. /code/pre  but absolutely everything gets marked because all of my traffic gets throttled.  Any tips on how to craft a correct filter statement?
