How can I easily toggle the cursor size back and forth between normal and largest? <body> I'm using Mac OS 10.8.3.  I have a huge display and bad eyes, so I like to have the mouse cursor be the largest possible size. (under emSystem Preferences/em: emAccessibility/em: emDisplay/em: strongCursor size/strong.  However, I also do a fair amount of video editing, for which I use Final Cut Pro X.  Unfortunately, the UI designers who made the Final Cut Pro X interface didn't properly take into account larger cursor sizes, so when I click a button in the program's interface with the "tip" of a large cursor, it won't register.  To remedy this, when I'm using Final Cut Pro X, I change the cursor size back to normal.  However, doing this is fairly time consuming, as I have to do it a few times every day.  Is there a way to somehow do this automatically?  <answer88270> The fastest way I know of is to kbdCommand/kbd+kbdOption/kbd+kbdF5/kbd and then click on strongPreferences/strong to adjust.  A note about large cursor: Changing the cursor size has no impact on the click focus, the point of the cursor remains the same. Which means that you have only magnified your cursor, so the active click point has moved and it is no longer exactly at arrow tip.   In English....try clicking not with the tip of large cursor but more in to it.  You might like the pointer from Mouseposé. It cost $5 and you will not have to switch back and forth.  <answer88276> Perhaps this is too emexcessive/em but you could create an strongAppleScript/strong which would toggle the size of the cursor. To do so just:  ol liGo to strongSystem Preferences / Universal Access/strong and emcheck/em strongEnable access for assistive devices/strong, this will let you use AppleScript to query and control the user interface of most Applications./li liGo to strong/Applications / Utilities / AppleScript Editor/strong and paste this code and save it as Application:  precodetell application "System Preferences"      set current pane to pane "com.apple.preference.universalaccess"      tell application "System Events"          repeat until slider "Cursor size:" of window "Accessibility" of process "System Preferences" exists         end repeat          set theSlider to slider "Cursor size:" of window "Accessibility" of application process "System Preferences"          set stash to value of theSlider         if value of theSlider is 1.0 then             set value of theSlider to 2.2         else             set value of theSlider to 1.0         end if         stash      end tell end tell /code/pre/li /ol  <comment103295> Did you try different type of cursor? <comment103300> @Buscar웃 No, I'm using the default OS X cursor. <comment103302> If mousepoint just highlights the cursor, then it is similar to the free OmniDazzle but it does make finding the cursor easier but it still has the issue that the OP asks in some cases you need the smaller cursor <comment103304> This also is a problem with the text insert cursor as the active point is not at the tip so you constantly have to make a small adjustment with the large cursor, and some apps (I think non Cocoa ones) don't show the cross piece <comment103306> The sole reason for large cursor is to find/see it. The suggestion for Mousepose is to use alternative method rather than switching and it does not make the original cursor larger. Thanks for "free" Omnidazzle hint. <comment103309> I had no idea that you could do this in AppleScript.  Actually, what I really wanted to do was toggle back and forth between cursor sizes, so I updated your answer to show how to do that. <comment103310> @Mark You can use the script to toggle.  It's not global, but if you bind it to a hotkey using Alfred or a similar app, you can get a pretty close approximation. <comment103312> Even with Omnidazzle or Mouseposé you need the large cursor, this is from my own usage. The program allows you to see where it is on the screen but is distracting, to do work you need just the cursor and it needs to be big to be seen. This could be different for other users <comment119686> @PatrickKenny my preference is to create a Service using Automator and then set keyboard shortcut in the 'System Preferences' to use this service. I prefer to avoid third party software, such as Alfred. <comment119687> I've tried the above script but it produces this error: System Events got an error: Can’t get group 1 of window 1 of application process "System Preferences". Invalid index. Does anyone know what I might be doing wrong? <comment223952> @user56968 did you ever got it to work?
