What does the @ sign and the number next to it mean in ls -l display? <body> I got the following output when I apply codels -l/code command in my Mac OS X Mavericks for an image file:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4WU9X.png" alt="enter image description here"  I understand what does code-rw-r--r--/code mean. But what does the @ sign and the number next to it mean? Is similar feature available in Linux?  <answer137473> The "@" means that the file has extended attributes.  You can see them with the codexattr/code command.  The "1" is the number of links to that file.  In most cases, for normal files, this will be "1".  For directories, it is the number of files/subdirs + 2 (the two actually represents the directory itself, and the parent directory).
