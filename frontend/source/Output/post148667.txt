Quickly switch monitors <body> I have two monitors set up. About halfway through the working day the sun glare shines on my primary monitor. As a result I have to switch over my windows so my primary monitor faces away from the source of glare.  Is there a way to quickly switch monitor positioning? For example:  precode------------    ------------ |          |    |          | |     1    |    |     2    | |          |    |          | ------------    ------------ /code/pre  becomes  precode------------    ------------ |          |    |          | |     2    |    |     1    | |          |    |          | ------------    ------------ /code/pre  while retaining application window layouts?  <answer148713> In the absence of any other answers, I'd say 'no'. Even if you swap monitors from left to right in System Prefs  Displays, they retain their 'physical' layout, merely change which way you need to move the mouse to swap over.  Though... a thought - what if you assign each monitor to be a different Space &amp; swap Spaces for each monitor? I can't test as I don't use that method &amp; don't want to break my existing setup just to experiment.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ouUVh.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer148722> Working om @Tetsujin's idea as I have the 'Displays have separate Spaces' check.  ol liCheck the 'Displays have separate Spaces'/li liCreate at least two spaces  for each monitor./li /ol  Monitor 1:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/N1TtU.png" alt="enter image description here"  Monitor 2:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rphVQ.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  In this example  strongDesktop 1/strong on monitor 1  and strongDesktop 3/strong on monitor 2   are my main ones.  To swap a desktop space over to another monitor. That desktop space must not be the active one.  So to swap  strongDesktop 1/strong over to Monitor 2,  strongDesktop 2/strong must be the active one first.  You can then Drag strongDesktop 1/strong over to Monitor 2.  The same is for strongDesktop 3/strong on monitor 2 going over to monitor 1.  *Desktop 4** must be the active one first.  You can then drag strongDesktop 3/strong over to monitor 1.  Monitor 1:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/h0K3H.png" alt="enter image description here"  Monitor 2:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/UqBzU.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  As you can see the desktop space have been swapped and I can now use them on the displays with the windows in place.  <comment175228> Looks like this would be a good, if a little awkward solution. Thanks so much!
