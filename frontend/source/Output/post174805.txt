Does Spotlight index dotfiles (OS X Yosemite)? <body> I want to create an Alfred workflow with some dotfiles (i.e. zsh config files).   Long story short, in Alfred, I only can play with files indexed by Spotlight.  Apparently, Spotlight doesn't index dotfiles as I can't get any dotfile in my Alfred results.  Any of my Spotlight setting that would force Spotlight to index dotfiles index is checked.   So, my question is there a way to force Spotlight to index dotfiles, dotfiles of a specific directory, a specific dotfile?    <answer174807> Using the mdfind command which queries the Spotlight Database I have to say no because the tests I performed would indicate so.  In a Terminal using codemdfind -name .bash_history/code as well as subsequent commands changing the code.filename/code portion of the command, codemdfind/code did not return the specific file names while only returning filenames that contained the code.filename/code portion within where applicable.  <comment205919> Thank you for your time and your fast answer. This limitation is certainly due to Apple security policy.
