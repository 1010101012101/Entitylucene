Folder action with Automator file search <body> Since a couple of years, I used the folder action successfully which is shown in the screenshot:  ol liA file is added to "Downloads"/li li"Find Finder Items" with the shown criteria is executed/li liIf the filename fulfils the criteria, the file is moved to another folder. If not, the file remains in folder "Downloads"/li /ol  Since I bought a new iMac, this action moves strongevery/strong downloaded file to the specified folder (see picture). What is wrong?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3ub0J.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer247840> The solution was to replace codeFind Filter Items/code with codeFilter Finder Items/code
