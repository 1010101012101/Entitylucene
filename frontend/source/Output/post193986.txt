To install GNU time in OSX? <body> BSD time gives this kind of output  precode9990  real    0m4.371s user    0m1.548s sys 0m2.167s /code/pre  GNU time gives then again this kind of output  precode9990 1.56s user 1.46s system 82% cpu 3.648 total /code/pre  Brew search gtime gives nothing.  GNU time is probably in some C library, however, I am not sure which.  There is no apparent package for it.   How can you install GNU time in OSX?  <answer194001> I think what you are looking for is available as...     brew install gnu-time   Which you can then call as...     gtime ...   <answer194002> GNU time is available in homebrew in package gnu-time.  <comment231310> Using /usr/bin/time gives me the results that you want. time by itself with a command is a shell keyword. <comment231312> @fd0 I do not get such an output. My time is also in `usr/bin/time`. My time version is BSD 1993. You must have different version of time. <comment231317> `time date` vs `/usr/bin/time date` produce 2 different outputs (like your examples above). But `which time` gives /usr/bin/time. <comment231318> you just beat me to it. https://gist.github.com/gregelin/9529716 <comment231319> brew install gnu-time <comment231324> @Masi the time man page states BSD June 6, 1993. I have no idea why your results are different. <comment232245> No manuals installed by this in `gtime`. How can you get manuals also with this command? I would like to get more significant numbers in timing. <comment232472> The original package from GNU doesn't appear to have a man page. However it does have an info file you can find with `info time`. <comment341343> @LéoLéopoldHertz준영 [here's an online version of the man page](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/time.1.html) <comment341344> If you want to call it as `time`, then install it as `brew install gnu-time --with-default-names`. Your original installation of bsd-time will still exist, but gnu-time will be executed by default as it appears in your PATH first.
