How to enter different whitespaces in Pages? <body> How can I use whitespace of different size in Pages? I only know simple space by hitting the codespace/code bar and the fixed space (no word wrap) using codealt-space/code.  Is it possible to get a n-, t- or numeric space (unicode code2000/code to code200A/code) using the keyboard? The only possibility I found so far is to use the emcharacter viewer/em, search for "emspace/em" and click through the results.  <answer115199> h2Unicode Hex Input/h2  You can use Unicode Hex Input to enter the characters that you want. Go to System Preferences → Keyboard → Input Sources and enable Unicode Hex Input. Then you can enter the characters by holding ⌥ and typing the Unicode code.  h2Multi-stroke Key Bindings/h2  You can edit ~/Library/KeyBindings/DefaultKeyBinding.dict and create a multi-stroke key binding for each of the characters that you want to enter.
