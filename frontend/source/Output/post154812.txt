When upgrading to Yosemite from Mavericks are there any traps with Brew and Ports <body> Currently running Mavericks. Got a LOT of things installed through Homebrew and a handful through Ports. Are these going to survive the upgrade? What is best practice in this situation?  <answer154813> If you have a lot of stuff installed in /usr/local, the upgrade will be extremely slow. It's faster to move it away before upgrading and move it back when the upgrade is done -- see here for full details.  <answer154819> For MacPorts I can say that the only problem was to re-install MacPorts from source. Ports are running fine and I have a lot. Now the package installer are avaiable:  ul lihttps://www.macports.org/install.php ul lihttps://distfiles.macports.org/MacPorts/MacPorts-2.3.2-10.10-Yosemite.pkg/li /ul/li /ul  <comment182104> I did it without concerns. No problem at all.
