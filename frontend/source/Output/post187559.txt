How to reset sounds in Yosemite 10.10.3 <body> In an earlier OSX release, the combination codealt-cmd-P-R/code reenabled sounds after a restart, but not in Yosemite.   In some version of OSX, the command codesudo killall coreaudio/code works but not in Yosemite 10.10.3 on a mid-2013 MacBook Air.  This problem occurred also in Yosemite 10.10.1 when upgrading to the new release.  I managed to get sounds back by the above procedures.   I see no audio sources in sound settings after this problem appeared, even after those two attempts to solve this problem.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZYm9c.png" alt="enter image description here"  How can you reset sounds in OSX Yosemite 10.10.3?  I can get free AppleCare support if it is the only solution, since I have 5 year insurance.  However, I do not want to do it if there is no other solution.   h1Events 23.5.2015/h1  Apple brought new updates in App Store which solved the problem temporarily (3 hours):   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/aGjBC.png" alt="enter image description here"  I used my Macbook air 3 hours, went to pause and opened the Macbook again - the same problem came back.  I do not really understand the reason of OSX bug.   The command codecd /System/Library/Extensions/AudioAUUC.kext ; ls -alt/code gives  precodetotal 136 drwxr-xr-x  245 root  wheel   8330 May  3 12:06 .. drwxr-xr-x    6 root  wheel    204 Apr 23 19:19 . drwxr-xr-x    3 root  wheel    102 Apr 23 19:19 _CodeSignature -rwxr-xr-x    1 root  wheel  57392 Mar 23 20:44 AudioAUUC -rw-r--r--    1 root  wheel    473 Mar 23 20:44 version.plist -rw-r--r--    1 root  wheel   2251 Mar 23 20:44 Info.plist /code/pre  which are rather new.

If yes, start the hunt for the bad extension.  If not, you have an hardware problem. Bring your Mac to Apple./li liCheck for extension, cache or kernel corruption:  Verify if the audio kernel extensions are actually loaded:  precodekextstat | egrep 'Index|Audio' /code/pre  You should get an output very similar (but the hex address field) to this:  precode$ kextstat | egrep 'Index|Audio' Index Refs Address            Size       Wired      Name (Version) &lt;Linked Against&gt;        95    4 0xffffff7f81603000 0x30000    0x30000    com.apple.iokit.IOAudioFamily (203.3) &lt;94 5 4 3 1&gt;       196    0 0xffffff7f82c24000 0x5000     0x5000     com.apple.driver.AudioAUUC (1.70) &lt;95 76 12 11 7 5 4 3 1&gt; $ /code/pre  If you don't have these 2 extensions loaded, you will take advantage of this default to load them in a mode where you will see what is going wrong (i.e. what is usually hidden behind the emnice spinning beach balloon®/em).  To manually reload a missing extension and to take advantage of this manual operation to better understand the origin of the bad, here is how to proceed:  precode/usr/bin/sudo kextutil -t -v 6 -b com.apple.driver.AudioAUUC /code/pre  which loads the kernel extension codecom.apple.driver.AudioAUUC/code  code-b/code identify it with its bundle name,  code-t/code print diagnostics,  code-v 6/code will be as verbose as possible about every steps of this process.  At the end of this verbose kernel extension loading, check that the kernel has loaded this extension:  precodekextstat -b com.apple.driver.AudioAUUC /code/pre/li /ol  <answer188515> It could be hardware related: plug a headphone into the computer and make sure it really connects. Disconnect it and reboot. I had a MacMini with defect audio and this helped to get it up for a while. If no startup sound appears, try the same again but let the headphone plugged in. Experiment with this.  Note: When no startup chime appears, it probably means that the audio hardware couldn't get initialized and everything software related can't change a thing since the audio driver has no connection to the hardware.  <comment221737> Do you mean so that the startup chime sounds at every boot? <comment221738> @Rajiv No. All sounds are off in my Macbook. I cannot hear anything. <comment221742> Is it possible that you're running a program that mutes all other output except itself, but the program isn't playing anything? For example, during a FaceTime call, any music playing in iTunes is turned so low that it's almost inaudible. <comment221747> @Rajiv No, it is not possible. I have had this problem many times before in several OSX and different versions of laptops: Macbook, Macbook Pro and Macbook Air. The problem is in Apple's software-hardware where they have not managed to find a solution. <comment223124> Thank you for your answer! No change after plugging in and out headphone and rebooting multiple times. <comment223125> Ok! Thank you for the feedback. BTW: I just remembered that we can set some audio properties with /Applications/Utilities/Audio MIDI Setup.app, for example you can choose what format an audio output has. Since there is no usable audio output this won't help but it is good to know that this app can do this (it has an "Audio Devices" panel and it can also test/configure the speakers).
