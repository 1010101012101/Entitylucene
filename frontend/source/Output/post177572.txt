How to Save All notifications? <body> I have IOS 8 and I want to know how to save ALL of my notifications. What I mean is, I unlock the phone and then the notification disappears and I didn't read it. I have looked all over and there's no way I've found.  <answer177607> Settings  Notifications  Messages  Show in Notification Centre  â€¦ you can set up to 10 recent items  then all you need to do is swipe your screen from the top down &amp; there they are [though if you've never used that before you'll probably need to clear a whole lot of other stuff first time &amp; trim which apps actually need to be in there.]  You can't have emall/em - only the last 10.
