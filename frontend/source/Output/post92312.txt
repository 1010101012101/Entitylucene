Can I decrypt a dm-crypt filesystem on OS X? <body> I've been an Ubuntu user for years, and I just got my first Mac. One thing I haven't yet figured out is how to decrypt my encrypted filesystem on which I store my SSH and GPG keys on my flash drive. I used this guide in the past to set it up, and have just been running the shell script to decrypt and mount it since then.  However, I cannot figure out how to decrypt it on OS X. Running codebrew install cryptsetup/code doesn't work.  <answer132360> You may try OSXCrypt which is a kernel extension and a command line utility that allows the creation, manipulation and attaching of a TrueCrypt-compatible volumes.  See also ext4fuse or fuse4x (via brew).  Or try to install a tiny linux distro (e.g. Ubuntu) in a virtual machine (e.g. VirtualBox) and then install/configure cryptsetup.  I don't know if hdiutil can handle it, but here is an example:  precodesudo hdiutil attach -stdinpass -encryption AES-256 /dev/disk1s1  /code/pre  To check how your hardrive is encrypted, try the following command:  precodesudo cat /dev/disk1s1 | strings -3 | head /code/pre  See also:  ul liPassword Cracking AES-256 DMGs and Epic Self-Pwnage/li /ul  <comment108290> `cryptsetup` isn't a brew package <comment139929> See http://superuser.com/questions/110032/how-to-mount-an-encrypted-ext3-filesystem-under-os-x and particularly this answer: http://superuser.com/a/130910/63543 <comment301295> http://askubuntu.com/questions/604554/encrypted-filesystem-shared-with-mac-os-x
