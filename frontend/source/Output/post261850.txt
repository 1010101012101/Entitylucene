iTunes too slow: how to diagnose, how to avoid? <body> I am running iTunes on different Macs connected on Ethernet to download the last iOS version (10.1.?).  Note: Wi-Fi, Bluetooth are explictly off to be sure what I am analyzing.  On these different Macs, the download is similarly extremly slow: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Wns4Q.png" alt="iTunes slow download"  The actual version of iTunes I run is:     12.5.1.21  The actual connection I am using is:  precodeMac → Ethernet:    1 Gbit/s router → Internet: 1 Gbit/s (shared by a few hundreds users). /code/pre  With the help of a codetcpdump -i en0/code I was able to diagnose I am actually downloading an Internet monstruous mammoth from:  precodedefra1-vip-bx-006.aaplimg.com /code/pre  on port 80 (= http).  A rapid ping analysis gave me:  precode••My_Mac••$ ping -c 20 -s 1992 -q defra1-vip-bx-006.aaplimg.com PING defra1-vip-bx-006.aaplimg.com (17.253.55.206): 1992 data bytes  --- defra1-vip-bx-006.aaplimg.com ping statistics --- 20 packets transmitted, 15 packets received, 25.0% packet loss round-trip min/avg/max/stddev = 27.732/28.388/28.798/0.285 ms ••My_Mac••$ /code/pre  when at the exact same time, a reference one (on the other side of the world) gave me:  precode••My_Mac••$ ping -c 20 -s 1992 -q www.cisco.com PING e144.dscb.akamaiedge.net (2.18.128.170): 1992 data bytes  --- e144.dscb.akamaiedge.net ping statistics --- 20 packets transmitted, 20 packets received, 0.0% packet loss round-trip min/avg/max/stddev = 2.868/2.990/3.121/0.063 ms ••My_Mac••$  /code/pre  This looks like a network problem on Apple side. My question is more general than the typical context of this case.  How may I test directly the Apple download server to check where the bottleneck is located and when I will be able to download this version in a normal time?  How may I avoid an iTunes download when the connection to the Apple download servers is so bad (9 hours in this case)?  <comment328022> Seems you are having package loss,send out probes with different ttl value to locate the primary package loss source. <comment328074> I think you meant packet loss :). Yes I know and analyse it. I am disappointed that a software upgrade process doesn't detect alone it is using a suicidal network connection. <comment328077> Does downloading iOS firmware from a third party source working?
