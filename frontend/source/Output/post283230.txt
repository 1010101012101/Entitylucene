How to merge contacts with same name? <body> After a real drama with iCloud, once I could configure it right again, my contacts show up triplicated. With Contacts, I used the search for duplicated and now it is just duplicated...  Problem is: for each name, one contact got a phone number with local area code, and another don't. Also the old version don't have the last "9" number added to match the new 9 numbers system. This change was made automatically by an app. Maybe instead of change the number in the contact (add the last "9" and local area code) it duplicated and linked - my guess.  I wish to physically delete those old numbers and keep only the newer ones, but there is another problem: WhatsApp got as reference the old number (8 digit version), so I am not sure of what to do now... Of course, I would like some app or script to solve this mess. Any ideas?
