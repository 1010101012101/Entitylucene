Mac-mini audio out <body> I have a Mac mini (2011) which doesn't produce any sound through the audio out. I've tried with speakers, headphones, etc,... but no sounds to hear.   What can be the problem?  <answer44992> Possible issues:  ul liVolume set too low/li liDefault audio output not set correctly/li liHardware issue, go to Apple Store if possible/li /ul  <answer45000> Open the strongSound Preferences Pane/strong in System Preferences and make sure that the settings for emoutput device/em, emOutput volume/em and emMute/em are set appropriately:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Npoh6.png" alt="image of Sound Preferences Pane"  You might want to plug in a set of headphones or external speakers while this panel is open to confirm that the hardware is registering correctly.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lsjHP.png" alt="image detailing Sound Preferences pane with headphones plugged in"  If those settings all seem to be correct, Apple has a knowledgebase article: Troubleshooting issues with no audio from built-in speakers on Macs  I have also seen instances when the settings in the strongAudio Midi Setup/strong panel (You'll find it in the strongUtilities/strong folder) are incorrect. Confirm that the settings for the emBuilt-in Output/em are 44100 Hz 2 channel-24 bit.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rJmEc.png" alt="image of Audio Midi Setup"   If all of this fails, I have seen reports of this problem having being solved by reinstalling the system software. You might want to try that before taking your computer in for repair.  <comment50461> Do you see a prohibitory sign when you attempt to adjust the volume? Can you post a screenshot of what you see in System Preferences  Sound  Output? <comment50478> Maybe you can find your answer on the [Apple Support pages](http://support.apple.com/kb/TS1574). I assume you've made sure the sound isn't on mute and you are actually playing some music? Does their happen to be a red light in the audio output by any chance?
