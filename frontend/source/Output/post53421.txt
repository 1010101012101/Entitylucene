How to make Applescript quit a specific program for all users? <body> My wife and I are set up on a single laptop and I have our iTunes libraries stored on an external HD. I'm writing an applescript to auto eject that drive when we want to take the laptop elsewhere (we normally use iPads around the house), but I'm having trouble getting the script set up to also quit iTunes for both of our accounts when run.  Here's the basic script right now which is obviously missing the magic to quit iTunes for all logged in users:  precodetell the application "iTunes" to quit  tell the application "Finder"     if disk Media exists then         eject disk Media     end if end tell /code/pre  Any suggestions?  <answer53429> The problem is that your Applescript runs in the context of the current user and can't access the iTunes running in other accounts. One way to close/terminate all running iTunes processes would be (in Terminal)  precodesudo killall -sm iTunes /code/pre  but this may leave the iTunes meta data in an inconsistant state (which means longer startup time the next time you start iTunes and potential data loss).  <answer53443> Use the codedo shell script/code directive in AppleScript:  precodedo shell script "sudo killall iTunes"  tell the application "Finder"     if disk Media exists then         eject disk Media     end if end tell /code/pre  You'll need to make sure that you can execute codesudo killall/code with no password.  <comment61157> `sudo -u other-user -e osascript ` doesn't work because the Apple Event to quit iTunes is still send to user currently logged in. <comment61178> What could cause the metadata issues? Is that something that could happen if iTunes is sitting open but otherwise idle? <comment61179> In theory yes, in practice I haven't seen this for quite some time now (and I tend to kill iTunes about once a week). <comment61210> Ah, that's right. Forgot about that. Fixed.
