Connect to FTP server in Finder not working <body> I can get to my FTP server just fine from the command line but I cannot get to it from Finder. When I am in Finder and I "Connect to Server" and enter codeftp://192.168.125.128//code, then my credentials when prompted, it gives me the error:  precodeThere was a problem connecting to the server "192.168.125.128". The share does not exist on the server. Please check the share name, and then try again. /code/pre  I can however connect to it anonymously just fine, which is frustrating, because as stated before, I am able to log in just fine and browse around from the command line using my credentials.  precodeftp 192.168.125.128 Connected to 192.168.125.128. 220 (vsFTPd 2.3.5) Name (192.168.125.128:name):  331 Please specify the password.

I sniffed the traffic from my computer to the FTP server and saw traffic go through when I connected as a guest. I did not, however, see any traffic when I connected as myself. No traffic whatsoever was going through. On a whim, I tried a blank password and saw traffic going through! After changing my password on the FTP server I was successfully able to connect with Finder. It apparently had something to do with my password??? I played around to see what the exact problem was with my password and, at the risk of revealing too much information about my security credentials, found that any password with an '@' symbol in it caused Finder to immediately display that error and not even try to send any traffic to the FTP server.  <answer117142> Thanks for this.  I was not racking my brain for hours, but was getting very confused by what I was seeing. Terminal was successful, but Finder was not.  I also had an @ character in my password. I changed it as both of you and bingo. I was right in.  Thanks for you help.  <answer120643> This seems to also impact cPanel FTP user accounts which mandate the addition of the domain name after the username (e.g. username@domain.com).  This is particularly true for hosting sites like GoDaddy and others who have moved to cPanel on the Linux hosting accounts.  <answer209912> The solution to the cpanel problem that mandate an @ in the username (i.e. user@domain) is to use a separate ftp program like "FileZilla" which has a version for mac.    <answer216835> You need to be sure your path ends with forward slash 'strong//strong'  preftp://username:password@ftp.your.domain.com//pre  <answer246571> Use codeusername+domain/code instead codeusername@domain/code  Example:  ftp://username+domain.com:password@domain.com  <comment130605> What about specifying the credentials in-line with the IP address, e.g. `ftp://username:password@192.168.125.128`? <comment130606> It doesn't like that format. <comment130607> I also had an @ in my password. After hours of frustration you saved my day, sir! Thanks alot! =) <comment253259> Not good form to piggy-back on an answer.
