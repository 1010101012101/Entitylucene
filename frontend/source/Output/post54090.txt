My download button has moved too far to the right for me to download podcasts directly to my phone <body> I used to download new podcast episodes by going to the podcast on my phone and pushing the "get more episodes" button. I have done this for years now and had no problems.   Suddenly on June 14th the download button has moved too far to the right so that I can't access it to push it and download the podcast. It doesn't work to flip the phone and I can't pull the screen over to access the button.   <answer69731> Super frustratingâ€”same thing happened to me. I found that if I went to read the ratings (an option at the top of the screen) and then back, they had moved back to regular position. See if this works for you.  <comment61899> Can you add a screenshot please?
