What are correct permissions for the Trash folder? <body> I would like to understand the permissions and ownership for folders/files moved to the Trash in OS X (specifically Yosemite, but I imagine it's the same across the board).  If one user moves files to the Trash, can another user (possibly from a different computer) empty the trash?  Are files supposed to retain their ownership and permissions when moved to the trash?  For example, I have a USB disk that shows the following, which seems to be correct:  precodesh-3.2# ls -alph .Trashes/ total 0 d-wx-wx-wt@  3 _unknown  _unknown   102B Apr 17 12:19 ./ drwxrwxr-x@ 11 root      wheel      442B Apr 17 12:19 ../ drwx------@  5 _unknown  _unknown   170B Apr 17 12:19 501/ /code/pre  I have a SAN volume that shows the following:  precodesh-3.2# ls -alph .Trashes/ total 66048 d-wx-wx-wt@   4 root   admin         2.0K Apr 29  2016 ./ drwxrwxrwx   16 root   wheel         2.0K Apr 14 01:46 ../ -rw-------    1 ec3io  _lpoperator   4.0K Apr 29  2016 ._501 drwx------@ 424 ec3io  _lpoperator   106K Apr 14 14:25 501/ /code/pre  OS X seems to be unaware of the trashed files on the SAN, so after emptying the trash, those files remain. I suspect this is related to permissions somehow.  My user account is codeec3io (501)/code.   On the SAN, all the files within that code501/code folder are owned by code60001:60001/code and I don't know what that user is.
