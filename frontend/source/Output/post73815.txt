Mail.app: How can I set a different default signature for each address? <body> I have my Gmail account setup in Mail 6.2 (Mountain Lion). From that account I can send mail with one of five different addresses (4 other accounts forwarding onto Gmail). Is there a way I can set up a different default signature for each address, rather than a single default signature for all addresses?  I have 5 addresses and 5 signatures, I just can't link them together.  <answer73816> 1) Open Settings (kbdCmd/kbd + kbd,/kbd), click signatures. You will see a list of email accounts on the right.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Q4JzF.png" alt="Signatures"  2) strongClick the one you want to set a default signature to. Click the + button below the signatures./strong  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9vTF3.png" alt="+ and - buttons below signatures"  3) strongAdd you signature./strong  If you have more than one signature, select your preferred default on from the drop down menu below the signatures.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/tYkcM.png" alt="Default signature"  <answer95524> You might wanna try SignatureProfiler (shareware). It can assign different signatures and strongFrom/strong names for each e-mail address on the same account. Setup is somehow cumbersome (after a conversation with the dev, he acknowledged the plugin needs a redesign) but it works great, pretty much like standard e-mail identities. It also offers other features such as strongRandom Quotes/strong or strongiTunes/Skype Statuses/strong on e-mail signatures.  Mail alone can't do what you (we) want. Even the option to insert signatures sequentially, when using multiple addresses separated by commas, in the strongAccounts/strong pane, is as useful as the option to insert signatures randomly.  <comment85797> Thanks @bassplayer7, however this sets the default signature for the entire Gmail account. As I mentioned I have multiple addresses within that account, and would like a different default signature for **each** address. <comment85825> I am sorry - I obviously hadn't understood your question. I've never had a setup similar to yours, but am guessing that there would be no way to do that. The signature making, and assigning, process that I described seems about as much customization as is available in the current UI.
