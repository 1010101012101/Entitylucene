Old iPad not charging <body> Old ipad charging indicator comes on but doesn't hold a charge. Doesn't build charge either? Any suggestions already tried cable and new transformer.  <answer173455> It could simply be the battery in the iPad no longer holds a charge due to age and cycles. You may try to replace the battery yourself:  ul lihttps://www.ifixit.com/Guide/iPad+3G+Battery+Replacement/3186/li /ul  <answer173508> Looks like its time to replace the battery unfortunately.
