Log out after X minutes turning itself back on <body> This is driving me insane. The checkbox in codeSystem Preferences &gt; Security &amp; Privacy &gt; General Tab &gt; Advanced &gt; Logout after X minutes of inactivity/code turns itself back on whenever I move away from the settings screen. I recorded a gif to illustrate this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/XYdju.gif" alt="Sorry for the low quality"  Anyone knows why this is happening? Is it some new antivirus setting? Some remote setting? Some MacOS setting? Btw I'm running latest El Capitan  h3EDIT/h3  I tried using Automator to disable this again every 5 minutes. Didn't work haha. I was also able to figure out the file where this particular pref is saved, running codesudo fs_usage -w/code. It's here:  code/Library/Preferences/.GlobalPreferences.plist/code  running codedefaults read/code shows me the preference is codeAutoLogOutDelay/code  If I run:  precodesudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/.GlobalPreferences.plist com.apple.autologout.AutoLogOutDelay 0 /code/pre  The computer freezes for 5 minutes. I have no idea what's going on  h3Edit 2/h3  Found a thread from Apple discussions. The last message in the thread points to codeProfile Manager, General &gt; Login Window &gt; Options/code I will try to check with the network manager.  No, it's off there too. Looking further into codefs_usage/code I noticed something strange. A process codeVShieldScanner.3263/code is editing the preferences, namely McAffee ...   <answer261139> It was a bug in McAffee   Updating to version code10.2/code fixes the problem  <comment320832> Have you tried "locking" the changes? (click the padlock to the right of "Advanced" when you make the change) <comment320852> Yes, this has no effect :( <comment320910> Is there anyone else who has administrator access to your computer, and/or anyone who might have some management over it (such as it being on a corporate network)? <comment321134> Yes, it is, but I am the only one facing this issue. I will ask the administrator. In the mean time, I found a temporary solution. Xcode prevents logout, so keeping it open partially solves the problem. Still very frustrating
