How can I get a raw print queue in the Print & Scan menu? <body> I have set up a raw queue (without a PPD) in CUPS via the command line and lpadmin.  It works perfectly if I print files via the command line and lp, but it doesn't appear when I try to add it via Add Printer in Print &amp; Scan in System preferences. As such I cannot print from inside applications.  Any idea on how to get the printer to appear in the list of available printers?  Thanks.  <comment150054> show us your work ! <comment151051> @buscar: Pasted it here: http://pastebin.com/ytztLeWr
