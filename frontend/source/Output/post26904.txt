How can I assign hotkeys for pasting from the clipboard? <body> I am looking for a way to have some text "permanently" copied to the clipboard and assigned to a hotkey?  Any software suggestions?  <answer26905> If I understand your request correctly, TextExpander might be right up your alley. It allows you to assign custom abbreviations to text snippets and graphics for insertion anywhere.
