Painfully slow wireless with Windows 10 Boot Camp <body> Internet connectivity is painfully slow when running Windows 10 on a Boot Camp partition. This is compared to the same wireless service while running macOS Sierra on my mid-2012 11" AirBook (i7 2GHz). I have a Broadcom wireless chip (Broadcom BCM43xx 1.0 (7.21.171.126.1a2)) and have confirmed that I have the latest drivers for it. Using Google's "internet speed test" the performance while using the Windows 10 OS and testing Chrome, Edge, Opera and Firefox, is consistently around 5 times slower than when I am booted into the macOS Sierra partition.  Why is this happening and, more importantly, what can I do to improve the Windows 10 performance?
