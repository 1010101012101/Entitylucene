Can I install OS X Snow Leopard on 2006 mac mini? <body> So..I bought my first macbook pro few days ago, but found I don't need a laptop. I figured out that I can buy used mac mini + windows laptop for my developer environment.  is it possible to install snow leopard on a 2006 mac mini?  <answer12634> Yes it is. See here.  As long as it is an Intel Mac Mini (with a minumum of 1gb ram) you'll be fine.  If its a Power PC Mac Mini then you'll only be able to install Leopard (not Snow Leopard)  <comment13248> Qualification: it'll need to be upgraded to 1GB of RAM for Snow Leopard (that model shipped with only 512MB by default).
