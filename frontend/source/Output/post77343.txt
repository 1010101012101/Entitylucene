Why does Mail.app keep sent attachments open? <body> Sending a pdf as an attachement leaves open the original file according tobr codelsof | grep my.pdf/code How can i prevent this rather unpleasant behavior ?  OSX 10.6.8 - Mail Version 4.6 (1085)  UPDATE: I filed a bug at apple and the guys at apple actually responded saying this is a know bug (duplicate of #4023875) which is still open.  <answer77346> I can't speak for why anything Apple has done, but three things come to mind for changing the open file status:  ul lifile a bug http://bugreporter.apple.com/li liquit mail/li lipatch the Mail program to fix the bug/li /ul  Unless you have some third party Mail plug in, it seems you've identified something that hopefully Mail eventually releases since you might have problems deleting a file that's still open.  <comment89666> How long after mail activity finishes are these file handles kept open? <comment89668> at least an hour <comment89670> Well - I can't imagine any network access still being pending at that point. Likely you found a bug. <comment91510> How are you sending the file?  Simple attachment, drag and drop type, or from within preview or another pdf reader? <comment91516> I attach the file using the UI-Dialog in Mail <comment91555> What version are you using? <comment91556> Version 4.6 (1085) <comment91609> so by UI Dialog you mean you are clicking on the attachment icon.....??  Or are you actually using a jQuery call for it. <comment91646> jap, the paperclip icon
