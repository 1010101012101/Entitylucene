How can I scroll down to the bottom of document (HTML) in Safari? <body> I normally can use Command-DownArrow, to go to the bottom of the document in text editor such as TextMate.  How can I do the same thing in Safari? How can I scroll down to the bottom of the document with Safari when I read the long HTML document?  And, how can I scroll one screen with keyboard?  <answer9187> kbdCommand ⌘/kbd + kbdDown ↓/kbd or kbdFunction (Fn)/kbd + kbdRight →/kbd should both work.  kbdFn Right/kbd is the built-in key combination that is most equivalent to the kbdEnd/kbd key.  <answer9190>    And, how can I scroll one screen with keyboard?   Press the kbdSpace/kbd key.  <comment9691> Command+Down works for me. <comment9806> that only scrolls a couple lines and does not jump to the bottom of the page tho... <comment9808> Strange. On my computer it scrolls one screen.
