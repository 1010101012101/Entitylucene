What SSD interface/form factor is compatible with my 13" MBP (Mid 2012)? <body> I have an old MacBook Pro (13", Mid 2012; 5,400 RPM HDD) that I want to bring back to life with an SSD.   The options I've been exploring are the 2.5" SATA SSDsâ€”am I looking for the right component? I just realized there's mSATA, not sure if that's what I should be looking for.  Thanks!  <answer274924> Yes! A 2.5 inch SATA SSD like this one from Samsung or this one from Crucial or this one from Western Digital will work. (Note that those three are just examples.)  <comment345780> You'll also want to grab a T6 screwdriver since you'll need one to open the drive caddy. <comment345800> I personally recommend the Samsung one Noah linked to. I've had the EVO 850 for 2 years and the only issue I had was actually Apple's fault <comment346076> @Rajiv: That was my first choice, but sadly it's CAD$50 more expensive than the 525 GB Crucial (also linked).
