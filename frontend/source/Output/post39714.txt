How can I transfer all my songs to iPhone instead of just purchased songs? <body> When I connect and sync my iPhone to iTunes it only transfers over purchased songs and not songs I ripped from a music cd.  How do I get all of them to sync?  <answer39761> There are multiple ways to get around this issue, and I've detailed one below. Before trying that, though, see if this solves your problem:  ol liSelect the iPhone in the iTunes sidebar. Go to the Music tab and look at what music is syncing./li liI expect maybe only the "Purchased" playlist is syncing, and that's why. If that's the case, simply select img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WgJ1y.png" alt="Entire music library" and you're set!/li /ol  Here's the other fix, if that doesn't work:  ol liSelect the iPhone in the iTunes sidebar. Find the tick box that looks like this: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7xyc9.png" alt="Manually manage music and videos" and make sure it's checked./li liGo to Music in the sidebar and select everything (Tip: kbdâŒ˜ (command or control)/kbd kbdA/kbd!)./li liDrag everything to your iPhone./li /ol  <answer57168> Another small suggestion.  Select some song in iTunes that is not being transfered to the iPhone.  Look in the Advanced menu and see if the option "Create iPod or iPhone Version" is available.  If so, use it.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lIh6O.jpg" alt="MENU"  <comment44878> possible duplicate of [Getting my music from iphone to macbook](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/4667/getting-my-music-from-iphone-to-macbook) <comment44879> Hi Rich - Welcome to the site!
