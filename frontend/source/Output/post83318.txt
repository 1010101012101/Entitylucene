How to prevent OSX from allocating as much virtual memory as there is space available on the hard drive? <body> I recently had data loss because the hard drive was completely used up by virtual memory and some programs couldnâ€™t handle zero free space on the hard drive. How can I prevent this from happening (besides always keeping a few GB as a buffer)?  <answer83338> I can propose you one way to do that, although it is not complete.  You can set memory limit per process using codelaunchctl limit/code (see the man page). However this is per process not system wide.  In real life, few processes are consuming vast amount of memory. Therefore, I would advise you to look at codeActivity Monitor/code output and see which are the process consuming the most. Count the ones that are using more than 20% of your RAM. How many such processes do you have? Let's assume emn/em and assume that you have emm/em GB of RAM. How much maximum swap space do you want to use? Let's assume ems/em GB of swap.  I would do the following calculation: code(m + s - 1) / n = &lt;max memory per process in GB&gt;/code  Convert the GB into B: code&lt;max memory per process in GB&gt; / 1024 / 1024 / 1024 = &lt;max mem per proc in B&gt;/code  Now try this limit and see if it works (note, this setting will be lost after a reboot, so it is "safe" to perform):  precodesudo launchctl limit rss &lt;max mem per proc in B&gt; &lt;max mem per proc in B + 1073741824&gt; /code/pre  If you are happy with this choice, then you can save them, so they are permanent. Edit the file code/etc/launchd.conf/code and add:  precodelimit rss &lt;max mem per proc in B&gt; &lt;max mem per proc in B + 1073741824&gt; /code/pre  <comment95955> @bmike I am sorry but can't you put your comments in your own answer or comment? I am not sure the ton you use fits with mine. Although valuable, I will ask for you edit to be undone. Feel free to add it as a comment of my answer or as a plain answer. <comment95956> Just click edit and revert my changes - do be aware that the site is very open to more than one contributor to any post. What I proposed is an answer component and not a comment IMO, but I'll probably copy your words and add mine if that makes you feel better. I figured you did the bulk of the work and wanted the authorship to remain yours, but I'm open to leaving your entry as is and adding a second answer. <comment95961> I know, I also did set some of my post as community wiki. But this time I felt that the style of our answers were too different, and it felt awkward. Thank you, I did found that one can revert changes! Great tool! <comment105569> This question may be a duplicate of [Is there a way to limit the size of the disk swap file in Mac OS X?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/64440/8546) (2012-09-19), which has an accepted answer.
