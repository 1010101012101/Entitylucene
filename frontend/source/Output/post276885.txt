Open "About This Mac" window <body> How can I display strongAbout This Mac/strong window?  I know that it is managed by the codeloginwindow/code process so I tried to open in applescript(I'm still a beginner).  precodetell application "System Events" to tell process "loginwindow"     open window "About This Mac" end tell /code/pre  The code keeps on running. It neither stops nor displays window nor shows any error. Is it even right command?  So, how can I open strongAbout This Mac/strong window?   The solution is not limited to applescript. Is there a way to open it from terminal?  <answer276886> I don't know about the applescript but I know how to do it terminal.  Use codeopen/code command in the Terminal to open strongAbout This Mac/strong window.  precodeopen -a "About This Mac" /code/pre  <answer276898> The application code/System/Library/CoreServices/Applications/About This Mac.app/code is only available on macOS Sierra, so  SkrewEverything's answer fails on versions of OS X prior to macOS Sierra.  Here is an example of AppleScript code to open "About This Mac" via UI Scripting:  precodetell application "System Events" to click menu item "About This Mac" of menu 1 of menu bar item "Apple" of menu bar 1 of application process "Finder" /code/pre  The above AppleScript emcommand/em can be executed in Terminal using codeosascript/code as in the example below:  precodeosascript -e 'tell application "System Events" to click menu item "About This Mac" of menu 1 of menu bar item "Apple" of menu bar 1 of application process "Finder"' /code/pre  Note that when using UI Scripting, the calling application will need to be given permission for assistive access by adding the target app to, e.g.: System Preferences  Security &amp; Privacy  Privacy  Accessibility  <comment348568> Thanks! Wish I could up-vote your answer. <comment348569> The application `/System/Library/CoreServices/Applications/About This Mac.app` is only available on macOS Sierra, so your answer fails on versions of OS X prior to macOS Sierra. <comment348571> @user3439894 I too just realised. Is there any way to open it prior macOS Sierra then? <comment348573> @SkrewEverything, If one is running macOS Sierra, then your answer if fine.
