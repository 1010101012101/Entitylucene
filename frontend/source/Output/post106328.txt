Can I use two non-Thunderbolt displays on a MacBook Air <body> I have been told that the only way to connect more than one external display to a MacBook Air was to buy Apple's Thunderbolt monitor and daisy chain.  Mavericks promises better support for external displays. Is it now possible to run two non-Thunderbolt monitors from a mid-2013 MacBook Air or is this still impossible?  <answer107733> The changes in Mavericks make it possible to connect a DisplayPort monitor to your MBA and also use an Apple TV as an external display - I've just confirmed it on my setup - but that is pretty slow over wifi.   The issues with connecting monitors to the MBA are in hardware, not software. For example, the reason why you cannot connect a DisplayPort adapter to the Apple Thunderbolt Display is because the monitor itself uses the DisplayPort channel:  http://www.anandtech.com/show/4832/the-apple-thunderbolt-display-review/8  Connecting two displays to the MBA requires two thunderbolt devices.  The first device can be either the Apple TB display or one of the Thunderbolt docks with a DVI / HDMI connector. Both of these options use the DisplayPort channel, so connecting a DisplayPort monitor to them won't work.  This is where the second Thunderbolt device comes in (a hard disk or other device with two TB ports for pass-through). This acts as a man-in-the-middle and can extract a second DisplayPort signal.  So your setup will look like this:  code&lt;Air&gt; -- &lt;TB dock/display&gt; -- &lt;TB drive&gt; -- &lt;DisplayPort monitor&gt;/code  <answer108848> You can connect two monitors to a 2013 Macbook Air by connecting one to the Mini DisplayPort, and one to the USB port via this USB - DVI adapter:  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0086359SG/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1  With the computer open, this gives you up to three screens. The USB connected screen is minimally laggy - fine for work, but probably not good for games or video.  <answer137115> It's possible to daisy chain two external monitors.  This KB-article lists the models that support up to 2 displays through one Thunderbolt port.  ul listrongMacBook Air (Mid 2012 and later)/strong/li liMacBook Pro (13-inch, Mid 2012 and later)/li liMacBook Pro (15-inch and 17-inch, Early 2011 and later)/li liiMac (Mid 2011 and later)/li liMac Mini (Mid 2011 and later)/li /ul  <answer167467> You could use a Thunderbolt to HDMI then a HDMI splitter and I know there's a program to make your MacBook think you are using one big display.  <comment124874> Note that [this question](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/41446/how-to-connect-multiple-monitors-to-a-macbook-air?rq=1) is similar but refers to older hardware and software. <comment124879> [this  Matrox adapter](http://www.matrox.com/graphics/en/products/gxm/dh2go/digital_se/?productTabs=1) is a partial solution, but tricks the mac into thinking the two monitors are one super-wide display. It would be nice to have a solution that recognizes that the two displays are in fact two displays. <comment166998> on Marvicks I have this issue when the displayLink (USB to dvi adapter) is connected that sometimes the whole machine would just crash and restart it self. Anyone else having this issue? <comment196390> The question was about using non-thunderbolt displays. <comment201487> I've had this same setup and it works, however the system tends to crash when using expose or mission control. <comment308909> Won't the splitter mirror the displays, as the Macbook can't differentiate between the two? <comment327686> sadly, these DisplayLink adapters are still this buggy. when you use Mission Control, your computer crashes and logs you out. not a good solution.
