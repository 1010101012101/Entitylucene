Plugging a MIDI Device in a MacBook Pro <body> What options are there for plugging a MIDI-device that offers only a standard DIN-5 MIDI connector into a MacBook Pro?  The marketing print on the box of my Rock Band 3 Wireless Keyboard talks about plugging the keyboard into a computer for use as a general MIDI instrument when not playing Rock Band, but there's no cables inside the box to accomplish this, and again, the only port it offers is a DIN-5 port.  <answer13433> Simple and cheap: USB to MIDI connector. If you need to plug in more than one MIDI device there are dedicated MIDI interfaces. Additionally, many A/D audio interfaces - that you might also use to record input from analog devices like guitars or microphones - include MIDI ins/outs.  Without more information about your specific needs I can't say the products I linked to are the best choice, but they are representative of the vast array of options for plugging a MIDI device into your MacBook Pro.  <comment14210> I'm using the Rock Band 3 Wireless Keyboard. I added a little blurb about it into the question. Though I think your MIDI-USB convertor will be good enough. <comment14214> Yep, it will work with any of the methods I suggested. You just need a MIDI cable and any of the the MIDI to USB converter suggestions above, the USB to MIDI connector being the cheapest. <comment15213> Definitely buying a straight MIDI-USB cable. Thanks. <comment42874> A wise man once said, "standards are for unoriginal losers"
