List All Documents Shared by All Apps <body> In iTunes (Mac or Windows), when I go to the Apps tab in my iPad or iPhone device, the File Sharing Section shows the root files folder of all the files each app is sharing.    For example, the "Adobe Reader" app shows all the current documents the app has (it is not possible to go into sub-folder although the root folders appear).    I am looking for the largest "shared documents", e.g. largest PDFs to clear some storage space.  Is there a way to list the name and info, i.e. size, of all the files for all the apps on my device, similar to what iTunes does?    This might be an app, or even an external application that can scan my device.br Either Windows, Mac or iOS would be fine.   <comment168614> Could you edit in what OS you prefer to run iTunes and connect to your iOS device? If you don't care Windows or Mac, saying that would help guide potential answerers. <comment168618> So it is not the "show package content" for each app you are looking for ? <comment168620> You want to see the documents for all apps, in one view, rather than app-by-app like iTunes shows you? <comment168649> @bmike: Either is fine. I added this above. Thanks. <comment168651> @Buscar웃: I don't think so. AFAIK, the package content is the bunch of files that make up the app itself. I am interested in the files and document that the app is "willingly" sharing. <comment168652> @samh: Ideally, yes, including also the internal folders. Essentially something like iterating recursively through the directory structure of shared files of each app and getting each file's info. <comment168655> AFAIK there is no way to see all active files at same time, that is physically not possible. You can see the dependencies in the activity monitor. <comment168662> @Buscar웃: iTunes essentially does what I want, so it is not really impossible. But iTunes does not allow me to (1) sort by size, or (2) step into the folders. I don't mind accessing each app separately. If I could get this data and dump it into Excel that would also be sufficient. <comment168700> Buscar I think you are not understudying what he is asking for. I don't see how Activity Monitor is going to help in identifying files and their sizes on an iOS device.
