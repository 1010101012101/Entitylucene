MBA Stuck in internet recovery after failed recovery from recovery partition <body> I have had no luck getting internet recovery to work for me, constantly returning code2002f error code/code. I have tried this guide  to create USB bootable installer to no avail.  I had wiped the device ahead of an installation from the recovery partition which failed because the network went down, machine restarted and went straight to IR.  When I boot the device and hold alt/opt I just get the internet recovery screen.  I have tried resetting PRAM.  <comment311683> @Harikrishnan thank you for the helpful edits. I don't suppose you have any ideas about solving the problem though?
