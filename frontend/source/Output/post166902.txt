Can't mount Volume via Applescript as a login time <body> So I have this script that I saved as an application and added it my login items.  precodetell application "Finder" to mount volume "afp://Data_Cube.local/Scotts Stuff" delay 5 tell application "iTunes" to activate /code/pre  However when I login I get an error dialog with this message "Connection is invalid. Finder got an error: Connection is invalid. (-609)"  If I click the edit button in the error dialog it opens up the Script Editor.   I press the run button and the volume is mounted just fine.  Any ideas why my volume won't mount when used as a login item?   FYI I'm using Yosemite.  <answer166940> Changing  precodetell application "Finder" to mount volume "afp://Data_Cube.local/Scotts Stuff" /code/pre  to  precodemount volume "afp://Data_Cube.local/Scotts Stuff" /code/pre  seems to be the resolution.  As mount is part of the standard scripting library.  <comment195677> it's firing before the network is fully established, maybe? Try giving it some breathing space at the head - delay 60s before your first action then maybe see how much you can reduce that & still be successful <comment195730> I tried to add some delays that did help.
