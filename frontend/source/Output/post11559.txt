Application to periodically update desktop with new images from Flickr tag search? <body> Are there any applications I can use to periodically download new images from a Flickr tag search and update my desktop picture (preferably with support for multiple monitors)?  <answer11565> DeskLickr is a few years old, and I've not tried it, but it should do what you want.  <comment12106> I'd like to create one... <comment12111> Thanks for the suggestion.  I had to turn off the "Change picture" option in the Desktop and Screen Saver prefpane, but it works like a charm!
