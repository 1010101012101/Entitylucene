Yosemite: Corrupt quick look images <body> Ever since my transition to 10.10.5 Yosemite, quick look keeps corrupting the preview images every now and then. Sometimes is persists until reboot, other times it goes away after a while. The image files themselves are fine and open and display in any application.   Any ideas?   Example:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Oypgn.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer239635> This may help : http://encase-forensic-blog.guidancesoftware.com/2014/05/examination-of-mac-os-x-quick-look.html or https://discussions.apple.com/thread/1289781?tstart=0  You should be able to rebuild the so called ThumbnailCache on your mac. This should work. hope this helps :)   <answer239641> strongCreate a guest Account/strong   and test if the problem still persists.

That ought to fix this. <comment294153> Also try relaunching the finder in the force quit menu. <comment294158> Welcome to Ask Different!  Please refrain from posting link-only answers.

I would start there first, at least. <comment294306> @RedEagle2000 Fair, but "Upgrade the OS" doesn't solve everything, and if they need/want to stay on 10.10, the question is still valid, as other 10.10 installs don't appear to have this issue. <comment295368> @Nate, sorry but relaunching the finder doesn't help. <comment295369> It remains a problem, and to add to it, the cached previews are actually fine. It is the full screen generated ones that are scrambled every now and then. <comment295414> Sorry it didn't work. I'll tell you if I find out any thing else on the issue. <comment295537> I'm going to accept this answer, because resetting the quicklook cache, does help, most of the time. <comment295798> Sometimes the copy & text selection feature in Quicklook break the preview images. The defaults command works in Yosemite and earlier Versions. Unfortunately this feature was removed from El Capitan. So I don't write down im my Answer. You can try to disable it in Yosemite and try if works. But remember you loose the ability copy and select text. Here the command you should type in your Terminal: defaults write com.apple.finder QLEnableTextSelection -bool FALSE; killall Finder . To Enable replace FALSE with TRUE.
