Can I use my PC to mirror an iPod Touch screen like Apple TV? <body> I'm using an iPod Touch 3 and I saw in the AppStore that it is possible to use it as a controller via Apple TV to play games on it like Modern Combat and Real Racing. Because I don't have neither an Apple TV nor a TV, I was wondering if it could be possible to play these games on my computers monitor via bluetooth or wifi.   Is it is not possible by Apple, maybe there's something in Cydia (under jailbreak) to do this?   <answer70060> You could try Reflector for PC:  precodeYour iPhone or iPad. On your Mac or PC.

It's okay to include a link, but please summarize or excerpt it in the answer. Thank you :) <comment81507> Derrp, I knew that.
