After upgrading to iOS 5, I lost my all calendars, contacts, and message data <body> Today I upgraded my iPhone 4 to the newest iOS. In the process steps it asked something like start from new iOS, or start from your back-up in iTunes, I selected the first one and then noticed there are no contacts, nor messages!  My iTunes had a problem and I thought I had backed up the files in my iTunes but I checked code~/Library/Application Support/MobileSync/Backup/code  <answer34961> Try a 'Restore' on your iPhone from iTunes and when it asks whether you'd like to start from a new iOS or backup, choose the backup.  (What was the 'problem' you had with iTunes?)  <answer35948> This is what you do:  ol liGo to settings/li liClick on Mail, Contacts and Calendars/li liScroll down and go to Calendars/li liOpen the Sync screen /li liCheck the box which says All Events/li liIn about five minutes time, go back to your calendar which should have all of your previous events restored./li /ol  Happy days.  <comment39882> If `~/Library/Application Support/MobileSync/Backup` is empty as somewhat implied in the question, this will unfortunately not work. <comment39883> I think your last sentence got cut off somewhat. You checked the folder and found what?
