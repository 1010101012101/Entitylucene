ffmpeg arguments used for converting to mp4 <body> I have been suggested two different ffmpeg commands for converting an mkv file to an mp4 while just re-encoding the audio (to aac) and leaving the video portion as is. Here are the two commands:  ol licodeffmpeg -loglevel panic -i source.mkv -vcodec copy -c:a aac -strict -2 -ab 160k -ac 2 -ar 48k target.mp4/code/li licodeffmpeg -i source.mkv -c:v copy -c:a aac -b:a 384k -strict -2 target.mp4/code/li /ol  Could someone please explain the difference? OK, more precisely, I am curious about the things the first command does in addition to what the second one does. Is it necessary to use a strong-log level panic/strong argument? What happens if it's omitted?  I understand the second command thoroughly. But the additional arguments in the first one are confusing me and I didn't find much help in the ffmpeg documentation either. In particular, I want to understand what the strong-ac/strong, strong-ar/strong, and strong-ab/strong arguments accomplish and why are they not used in the second command.  <answer130817> The three flags ask for a 2 channel, 48000 Hz sampled, 160k bit rate encoded audio track.  The flags that can be passed to codeffmpeg/code are listed in the ffmpeg manual page. Manual pages tend to be terse but informative:  h1ac/h1  precode-ac channels /code/pre  Set the number of audio channels (default = 1).  h1ar/h1  precode-ar freq /code/pre  Set the audio sampling frequency (default = 44100 Hz).  h1ab/h1  precode-ab bitrate /code/pre  Set the audio bitrate in bit/s (default = 64k).  <answer130899> ffmpeg duplicates syntax. Except for the values used, and that the first command set the sampling rate instead of using the default, the commands are effectively the same:  precode -loglevel panic  - merely makes ffmpeg less noisy in the shell  -vcodec copy     = -c:v copy  -acodec copy     = -c:a copy   # unlisted in the command, but listing here to show there is consistency  -ab              = -b:a /code/pre  Note: The other answer info is correct.   There is a guide online; it lists what every possible argument means.       <comment153557> if -ab sets the bitrate, isn't it the same as -b:a? <comment153570> Why not try both and compare the output? It certainly looks possible to double set values with a tool as sophisticated and capable as `ffmpeg`.
