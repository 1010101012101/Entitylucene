Files backed up to a removable hard drive from PC not opening on Mac <body> I got a new removable hard drive which I've properly partitioned into 2 using Apple disk utility to work with both PC and Mac. For PC partition I used ExFAT format. Then I copied some test files (pdf, docx, jpg etc.) from PC to test this setup. When I plug-in the disk to Mac, it shows all the files but none of the files open. I get the message "could not be opened/may be damaged...". What should I do?  <comment362774> How is the partition formatted?  NTFS? HFS? FAT?  There's lots of info missing here <comment362775> ExFAT is the partition format for PC <comment362778> Did you format it on the Mac or the PC?  Try creating it on the Mac and then copying it over. <comment362780> i formatted on Mac using disk utility. <comment362782> Couple things you could try:  Format on the PC and try formatting FAT32 (not ExFAT)....  Need to narrow down what the issue could be.
