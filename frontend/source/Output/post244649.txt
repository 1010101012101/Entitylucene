List of Macbook Pro's with user replaceable parts <body> After finding out that my 2011 macbook pro is slowly dying I am now thinking about its replacement.  However I would prefer an updated macbook pro in which I can replace both the hard drive and RAM.  So is there a current, simple list somewhere that identifies the year/model of a macbook pro and what parts are easily usersup1/sup replaceable?  sup1. [Pedantic mode on] And by user replaceable I mean only with something like a screwdriver.  I am not looking to de-solder/solder items.[Pedantic mode off]/sup  <answer244707> All new Retina MacBook Pro models don't have user serviceable parts. You can still buy a non-retina MBP which do have user serviceable parts. I believe the latest model is Mid-2012. It is a bit old but it is the only MBP that you can change components without the need to solder things.
