Help with Applescript to paste text into Word <body> I've just started using Apple Script and I was trying to make Word paste some text in an unformatted way. This is the code I am using:  precodetell application "Microsoft Word" tell selection try set theClip to Unicode text of (the clipboard as record) type text text theClip end try end tell end tell /code/pre  But the thing is I want to add a paragraph at the end of it every time I paste it but I can't figure it out how to do it. I know it is a stupid question but I would be glad if any of you could help me.
