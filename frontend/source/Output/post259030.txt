MacBook Pro with Retina Mid 2012 - Spontaneous Shutdown <body> I bought a new MacBook Pro with retina 2012 mid release 3.5 years back with 3 years extended warranty. Just now after getting my extended warranty expired, the PC started giving me the issue like spontaneous shutdown and it would turn on with manual power on button and I could still hear charm sound and apple logo for only few seconds and shuts down but If I try the same after some time then it would turn on and runs normally for few minutes and then would shutdown.  It seems heat issue and "Apple Hardware Test" results "No trouble found" message but couldn't completely do the "extended testing" since it would turn off in the middle.  I brought it to Apple authorized repair center in India and they did few diagnosis and I am pasting their test results here,  ul liReset SMC./li liUnable to Ran AST Test due to automatic restart./li liChecked the machine in known good OS same issue persist./li liReseat battery same issue persist./li liChecked the machine in minimum configuration same issue persist./li liClean and check the machine same issue persist./li liIssue with MLB. Post replace MLb only can able to found any functional issue in machine.Hence need to replace MLB under exchange price. /li /ul  It was shocking me since it cost me nearly half of the actual price of the Mac that I spent to buy it.  Anyone could you please help me to judge whether its a logic board issue or any other possible issue with components like Fan, Thermal sensor and thermal paste.  Whenever, I turn on, I could normally proceed with typical Charm sound then Apple logo for few sec. and log in options and head in to my account. The temperature after few min. I could see 125 degree and left side fan making blowing noise while right side fan struggling up and down blowing noise.  Thanks  <comment323967> If you say that you are hearing the right fan struggling, before you begin any further diagnostics, you ***must*** fix that component.  It may be the cause or it just might be an unrelated symptom, but you need to rule it out.  It's a fairly easy fix with this [guide](http://bit.ly/2fmnIqq).  The fan is also available on that site or you can get one for cheap on eBay <comment323980> Thanks Allan, I have also doubt on fan component but Apple repair center saying its not fan issue rather than Main logic board. Anyway I will try to replace the fan first then let me see still the issue persists. <comment323981> If it's the logic board, you would have wasted nothing by fixing a component that needed to be fixed anyway.  Also, if it's a heat issue, which you alluded to (125C?), then the symptoms fit.  It's best to start there (plus it's fairly cheap)
