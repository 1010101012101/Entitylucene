How do I configure Gmail on an iPad? <body> I just purchased an iPad 2. I was trying configure mail in my new iPad.br I followed strongthis tutorial/strong for configuring mail on my iPad. But after I enter the required information and click strongNext/strong, I receive this message :       strongCannot connect Using SSL/strongbr   Do you want to try setting up the account without SSL?   If I click strongYes/strong I receive a message :       strongThe IMAP server "imap.gmail.com" is not responding/strong.br   Check your network connection and that you entered the correct information in "Incoming Mail Server" field.   Only strongOK/strong button appears this time. I have checked my network and all the text fields a number of times. Still no success.  Where did I go wrong?  <answer19196> I don't know why this tutorial is telling you to use the "Custom" template, I've had no issue with the Gmail one.br The latest iOS updates make sure that the Gmail specificity are handled correctly (Archiving, etc.)  Try to set up your mail account using the Gmail template, and update your question if you still have issue. Then we'll know it's something going on between your iPad and Gmail servers and not strongon/strong your iPad.  <answer19216> Don't use that guide. In fact, don't use the gmail option either, if you can help it.  Use google's own advice which suggests setting it up as a Microsoft Exchange server. that will get you syncing with mail, contacts and calendars. But strongthe main benefit is that it gives you true push syncing/strong!  It's probably a little redundant, but here is a shortened version of the list of instructions.  ol liSelect Microsoft Exchange account/li liIn the Email field, enter your full Google Account email address. If you use an @googlemail.com address, you may see an "Unable to verify certificate" warning when you proceed to the next step./li liLeave the Domain field blank./li liEnter your full Google Account email address as the Username./li liEnter your Google Account password as the Password. (If you are a 2-step verification user, please use an application-specific password instead.)/li liTap Next at the top of your screen./li liChoose Cancel if the Unable to Verify Certificate dialog appears./li liWhen the new Server field appears, enter m.google.com./li /ol  You can then choose which items to sync, choose whether to keep existing contacts on the iPad etc.  <comment21048> The problem with this solution is that you won't get the same functionality than with the Gmail web interface. Those differences are listed [here](http://www.google.com/support/mobile/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=161771) <comment21389> Does using the gmail account preset give you different options? I don't really see the way it maps those iOS paradigms to google ones as a problem. I mean, gmail doesn't *have* folders other than labels, that's what I expect the mail client to do when I assign to folders. <comment21443> for me it's the "delete/move" that archive, that bother me most. I have to go to the "All mail" folder, then it loads everything, then I can delete.
