Why is Netflix more effecient in Safari than Firefox? <body> I've noticed that when I play Netflix video in Firefox, my Macbook Air's fans spin up to maximum, but under Safari, it stays silent. Why does Safari cause less of a load?  <answer102754> Please see Toms Hardware Benchmark.  This could help explain comparable efficiency between Safari and Firefox.  I have no proof, but a Apple Genius has also told me Firefox is less efficient compared to Safari and Chrome.  <comment120939> I'm no Netflix user, but it may just be the engine behind safari (which is WebKit) which works better *in that context* than the engine behind Firefox (Gecko). Try using Google Chrome - which uses WebKit as well - and see if it behaves similar to Safari. <comment120940> Does it use flash on Firefox and not on Safari ? <comment120945> @MatthieuRiegler Nope. Netflix uses Sliverlight exclusively on desktops and laptops.
