Other than speed, is there a reason that a 10W iPad charger shouldn't charge a new MacBook Pro 2016? <body> Are there any reasons not to use a 10w ipad charger with a USB-USB-C cable to charge a new MacBook Pro 2016? Have the one charger that came with MacBook but would like to be able to plug in at office, home on road, etc. with other chargers. Thx.  <answer266706> A 10W iPad charger should emin theory/em work and you would be correct that it would be a slow charge.   Well, to be accurate, it would be a horribly slow charge - you are getting a charger that is 1/6th (17%) of what is required (61W).  Will there be a problem?  No.  Will it charge?  Slowly.  Molasses in January slowly. From Apple's web site:     Your Mac will charge from USB-C power adapters not manufactured by   Apple if they adhere to the USB Power Delivery specification.   Assuming you are using a genuine Apple iPad charger, it should charge since Apple charges adhere to the spec.  <comment334433> Thx. It won't be my main charger...but I would like to use when the standard MacBook charger isn't with me. <comment334439> I would take my 61W charger and not the iPad charger.  The 61W is compatible with both and will not damage your iPad .  The iPad will only draw what it needs.   A good rule of thumb is that your charger must be = to the device draw, not the other way around. <comment334486> I just want to add that if you end up using the iPad charger to do this on a regular basis, in the long-term you will damage it (i.e. reduce it's life). Also, I would strongly recommend not doing this while the MBP is running. However, the rule of thumb used by @Allan is 100% spot on and I would be carrying the MBP charger around instead. <comment334699> ok. Thx for the advice. Are there any 3rd party chargers you can recommend? I would like to have 2 or 3 chargers available but the Apple one is pretty pricey. <comment334776> At present, there are no (that I know of) USB-C type chargers with 61W of power.  The best one that I have seen is the [Anker USB 30W charger](https://goo.gl/xUAYTq)  It will charge the MacBook, but not the MBP.  Chances are they will come up with a charger capable of handling the Pro (61W or 87W).  When I find one, I will update the answer.
