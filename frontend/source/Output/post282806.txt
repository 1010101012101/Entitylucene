Why do I see the Chrome icon in Reminders.app <body> A few of my reminders show the Chrome icon next to them. If I tap on the icon it opens Chrome but it doesn't open the URL in the reminder. Other reminders show Safari's icon. Why am I seeing Chrome's icon on this one? img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/g1VtA.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment356419> I think those are reminders generated by Chrome in an effort to get you to use Chrome for Reminder integration.  I don't think Apple would list a reminder as 'icloud.com'.  I've seen others with this problem fix it by removing and reinstalling Chrome.  Are you open to doing that?
