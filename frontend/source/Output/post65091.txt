Ball and Stick molecule modelling program for Mac OS <body> Does anyone know any good programs for making ball and stick molecular models on the Mac? I'm looking for something to produce high quality 3D models with nice lighting, like this on  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yPu6u.png" alt="enter image description here"  from wikipedia.  <answer65117> Apple it self recommends some of them. VIDA by OpenEye and MarvinTools by ChemAxon provide 3D modeling.   <answer107472> Try Avogadro. It's open source, and cross platform.  <comment76449> If I remember correctly, pictures of such molecular models appeared on the side of the box my eMac came in.
