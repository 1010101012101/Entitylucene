How to attach an image directly inside iOS Mail app while writing an e-mail? <body> When I want to send an image from my iPhone 4s, the workflow is easy. I go to Pictures, I pick the target image and then I click on the "share" icon in bottom left corner. Then of course I can add additional message and my e-mail with attachment is ready to be send.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pGKLd.png" width="320"  That's fine but what if I'm for example writing just a plain text e-mail. I'm in the middle of it and then I decide to add an image? I don't want to quit the Mail. Is there a way to attach an image (file) directly from there? I'm a really perceptive guy but in this case I cannot see any icon with a paper clip symbol or anything similar that would suggest that I can attach something.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/RjM7a.png" width="320"  <answer196741> Press and hold anywhere on the text area. A contextual menu will appear.  If there is no text on the message, the option to the right will say "Insert Photo or Video".  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Zsyj5.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  If there is text, the options will be "Select", "Select all", "Paste" and an arrow. Clicking the arrow will show "Insert Photo or Video"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bn6Wn.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Click on it and select the Photo or Video you would like to attach.  <comment235091> Thank you Jaime! Every time I was punching right arrow, the contextual menu was disappearing! Seems that I finger is too big. OK. Now I'm more precise and it works. EDIT: Exactly - thanks for the screenshots. :) <comment235129> I wish there was a way to attach anything, not just pictures. <comment235138> It's funny how things are so simple with iOS yet they are very difficult to find! Thanks for this great answer
