Why does F3 not work as Find Next in Chrome? <body> I've already set up in system preferences, checkbox Use all F1, F2,... as standard function (checked on).  But still after kbd Cmd ⌘ /kbd kbd F /kbd  on Chrome, pressing kbd F3 /kbd  won't do anything... I expected Find Next would go.... only way is pressing kbd Cmd ⌘ /kbd kbd G /kbd   any chance?  <answer229487> F3 for search is very much a Windows shortcut, &amp; in fact isn't in the shortcuts list for Google Chrome on Mac at all.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/No2dv.png" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LynSZ.png" alt="enter image description here"  Source : Google Chrome Help  <answer229489> kbdF3/kbd, like the previous poster said, is a Windows convention.  kbdCmd/kbd+kbdF/kbd is how all applications within OS X do a "Find".  However, you can re-map your Windows favorites to OS X with no problem.  If you want to make kbdF3/kbd = "Find Next" in Google Chrome, you can set that up yourself.  Go to [System Preferences] -- [Keyboard] -- [Shortcuts]  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ujlym.png" alt="Keyboard Shortcuts"  Select App Shortcuts and then click the "plus sign" to add a new one.  You will get a dialog box like the one below  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GAUMd.png" alt="enter image description here"  Select your Application that you want to create the shortcut for, in this case Google Chrome.  Now, here is the most important part:  Type the name of the menu command strongexactly/strong as you see it.  Go to the menu bar at the top of the screen and select the command from one of the menu drop downs.  In this case, it's "Find Next"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ztTUu.png" alt="enter image description here"  Enter that into your new Shortcut and assign the key you want, in this case kbdF3/kbd.  It should look like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/c4A1X.png" alt="enter image description here"  Click "Add" and you should see it show up as an new Shortcut.  Head over to Chrome and you will see that "Find Next" is now mapped to kbdF3/kbd  <comment279974> like charme! thanks
