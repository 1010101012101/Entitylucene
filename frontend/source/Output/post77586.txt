Create playlists for full albums in iTunes (i.e. albums with all songs) <body> How could I create playlists for all of the albums in iTunes for which I have all of the songs? Assume that track number &amp; track count metadata is accurate where specified, and don't worry about catching tracks which lack that metadata. I assume this will require AppleScript.  <answer77626> I realized this was a complicated enough question I ought to try to skin the cat myself. Here is one approach:  precode-- Creates a playlist for each full album you have in iTunes -- Set the playlistPrefix and playlistSuffix as desired before running  -- Based on code by Brad Campbell -- http://www.bradcampbell.com/2009/05/26/make-a-whole-album-playlist-in-itunes/  tell application "iTunes"     set playlistPrefix to "FA: "     set playlistSuffix to ""     -- The "FA: " prefix will help cluster full albums in iTunes' playlists,     -- and is narrow enough to not get in your way when viewing on an iPhone      set albumBuckets to {} as list     set allSongs to (every track of library playlist 1 whose enabled is true and podcast is false and kind contains "audio") as list      -- Find all partial albums in iTunes     repeat with currentTrack in allSongs         set albumName to album of currentTrack as text         set artistName to artist of currentTrack as text          -- First check for missing values, then perform integer comparison         -- Zero is on the left to force interger type coercion, just in case         if album of currentTrack is not missing value and 0 is less than length of albumName then             if artist of currentTrack is not missing value and 0 is less than length of artistName then                 if track number of currentTrack is not missing value and 0 is less than track number of currentTrack then                     if track count of currentTrack is not missing value and 0 is less than track count of currentTrack then                         if albumBuckets does not contain album of currentTrack then                             copy album of currentTrack to the end of albumBuckets                         end if                     end if                 end if             end if         end if      end repeat      repeat with currentAlbum in albumBuckets         set albumSongs to (every track of library playlist 1 whose album is currentAlbum)         set firstTrack to first item of albumSongs          -- Filter album list to act only on full albums         if (count of albumSongs) is equal to track count of first item of albumSongs and 1 is less than (count of albumSongs) then             -- This is a full album, construct the playlist              -- Sort tracks by track number             set albumSongsSorted to {} as list             repeat with i from 1 to (count of albumSongs)                 repeat with trk in albumSongs                     if track number of trk is i then                         set nextSong to trk                         copy nextSong to the end of albumSongsSorted                     end if                 end repeat             end repeat              -- Don't show artist name for compilations             if firstTrack is not compilation then                 set playlistNameArtist to artist of firstTrack &amp; " - "             else                 set playlistNameArtist to ""             end if              set albumPlaylistName to playlistPrefix &amp; playlistNameArtist &amp; currentAlbum &amp; playlistSuffix              -- Create playlist             if user playlist albumPlaylistName exists then                 try                     delete tracks of user playlist albumPlaylistName                 end try             else                 make new user playlist with properties {name:albumPlaylistName}             end if              try                 repeat with trk in albumSongsSorted                     duplicate trk to user playlist albumPlaylistName                 end repeat             end try         end if     end repeat      display dialog "Playlists created! Check iTunes for playlists beginning with '" &amp; playlistPrefix &amp; "'" end tell /code/pre  To try this out, just copy and paste the code block into AppleScript Editor and push Run. Do be aware there's no easy "undo" button - you'll have to just hold down the delete key if you want to ditch all the created playlists.  There's probably a faster algorithm (i.e. one that makes only a single pass through iTunes' library) but I couldn't figure how to work with two dimensional variables in AppleScript, which seems like a prerequisite.  A bonus side effect of this script is that it may surface ancient albums in your library you have moved on from and can safely delete :)  <comment108191> Very good question and excellent answer. With that code, one get very close to destination. However if I am not wrong it cannot deal with full-albums that consist on multiple-disk. I tried to modified the code but not much success (at the moment).
