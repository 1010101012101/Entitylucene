Select non-contiguous text / words anywhere <body> How do I select text that is not together separately, for example:  codeThiS is SomE sampLe teXt/code  or...  codeTHIS is SOME SAMPLE text/code  (I want the characters in capitals to be selected).  I know I can use kbdOption/kbd + kbdSelect text/kbd in Word and TextEdit, but I'm looking for a universal method to do this (not just in text editors - I want to do this in Safari, Chrome etc...)
