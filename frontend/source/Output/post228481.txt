I've updated the list of ports using, codeport upgrade outdated/code.  <answer228483> The name of the emport/em is "aircrack-ng", not "aircrack", and the eminstall/em command is:  precodesudo port install aircrack-ng /code/pre  <answer273592> Make sure you have the full installation of Xcode and MacPorts command-line tools for your Mac version. Run Terminal.app, then run this command: codesudo port selfupdate/code  <comment340438> I get `Error: Port aircrack-ng not found`
