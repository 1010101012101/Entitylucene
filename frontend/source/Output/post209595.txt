Red box on Finder icon in Dock <body> Please see this image:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/EKuNB.png" alt="red box in finder icon"  I don't know what's going on with that icon, but it has been persistent for the past week. It became like that when I forced the shutdown on my Mac because it hanged up. I've just upgraded to El Capitan when it happened.  I've tried the following:  ul liReboot/li liRelaunch Finder/li liQuit Finder and Dock on Activity Terminal/li likillall Dock/li /ul  Nothing worked so far.  strongUpdate:/strong  As per user24601's suggestion, I've tried the following:  ul liTurned on magnification. It persists on zoom. Please see image:/li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/apvMm.png" alt="magnified"  ul liTried to change position. It still persists:/li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ocE03.png" alt="vertical dock"  <answer209862> It could well be a bug. You can try sending feedback to Apple.  <answer213247> I ended up reporting it as strongdeeeeeeekun/strong suggested. Some of the suggested workaround in the comments were also suggested to me. This is the solution they gave that worked:  1) cd codegetconf DARWIN_USER_CACHE_DIR/code  strike2) attach com.apple.dock.iconcache to radar/strike  3) coderm com.apple.dock.iconcache; killall Dock/code  I'll update the answer when they give me the reason why the redbox happened.  <answer264187> I had the same problem with a half red/pink box on my finder icon (like a hat).  Just a 'killall Dock' command in the Terminal fixed it.  <answer264213> Looks a lot like an accessibility feature. Check under that section in System Preferences.   <answer264244> Try doing a Safe Mode startup (hold down the Shift key right after the start-up chime.)  Getting to the user Desktop may take longer than usual as there are several things OS X is doing during a Safe Mode such as checking the integrity of the boot disk and deleting cache files. Once Safe Mode finishes, restart.  <comment252840> Interesting!  Did you try killall Dock in terminal? <comment252846> Several times. I also found out that killing the Dock and relaunching Finder does not relaunch Dock. I just did it now, and while the behavior changed (Dock relaunched), the icon remains the same. <comment252849> You might want to update your question with the steps you took already to try to fix it but without success.  Cheers! <comment252869> Will do. Thanks. <comment253132> If you turn on Dock Magnification, does the red box grow with the icon? <comment253141> @user24601 yes, please see updated question. <comment253143> If you go to Macintosh HD  System  Library  CoreServices  Finder (Control-click and select Show Package Contents)  Contents  Resources  Finder.icns, which should be the graphic for the app icon, does it have a red box too? <comment253149> @user24601 it's normal.
