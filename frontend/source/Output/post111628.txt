2010 15" MacBook Pro unable to recognize internal display, works fine with external <body> Today I walked over to my 15" Mid-2010 MacBook Pro (which I had been controlling via VNC not long before) and attempted to use it. I was greeted with a screen that would not wake up.   After much rebooting (by holding down the power button and over SSH), I plugged it into an external monitor, logged in, and opened up codeSystem Information/code (formerly codeSystem Profiler/code). To my shock and horror, only the external monitor was detected and the internal "Color LCD" wasn't listed.   Does anyone know anything about the pathology of a problem like this? Does fixing something like this (probably) entail a logic board replacement?   I'm inclined to believe that the problem lies somewhere in an LCD controller or power supply rather than the panel (because I'd assume that a broken panel would still show up).   Again, the general functions of the machine work just fineâ€”just not the internal display.  <answer142399> I had similar symptoms on my MBP 13 (mid-2010). Internal display died suddenly and external display worked fine. None of the software or startup tricks did not bring the life back to in-built screen. Disconnecting and re-connecting the battery connector from the logic board fixed this problem.
