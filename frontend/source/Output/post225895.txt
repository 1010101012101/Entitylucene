Can't copy text from iBooks? <body> Using The Swift Programming Language 2.2 from iBooks, i can't seem to copy the text (many lines of code from inside the book) to then test.   Does anybody know why this is happening? In the past I have been able to copy the text from the book however now it is not letting me (it's greyed out).  For example  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/taK5O.png" alt="Cannot Copy and Paste from iBooks"  Here is another example of what I mean.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/taK5O.png" alt="Cannot Copy and Paste from iBooks"  <answer251505> The only way I found is to use strongmore - search web/strong and to copy that text from Google search bar.  <answer266533> Highlight the passages you wish to copy.   Then go into the show notes area by clicking the show notes icon in the toolbar.   Select the passages you want to copy. Go to edit  copy.  <answer293267> Below are steps for copying text from iBooks:  ol liHighlight the passages you wish to copy./li liA popup will be opened automatically strongor/strong you must open a popup using a right click on selected passages./li liSelect the 'Add Note' option from the popup./li liThe selected/highlighted text will be shown on the left pane./li liRight click on the passages in the left panel and select the 'Copy' option./li /ol  I have created a video to show how it works: https://youtu.be/ZQLl_Gl9TMw  Happy coding!  <comment274206> Welcome to Ask Different. Could you let us know what OS and version of iBooks you are using? there are several on iOS and on Mac so the solution might be easier if you narrow down your setup. <comment274211> I can't reproduce the error. In addition to what bmike suggested, can you tell us what device you're using? Have you tested to see if you can copy text from another book? <comment274224> I am using a Macbook running El Capitan running 10.11.3. iBooks is 1.4. Also if it's any help I seem to have two copies of The Swift Programming Language 2.2, but they are still different (as in they have subtle differences in text and code). <comment274251> Is that a fixed-layout ePub? iBooks has a hard time copying text from some fixed-layout ePubs. <comment330817> I have the same problem on MacOS Sierra 10.12.1, iBooks ver 1.7, Swift 3.0.1. Seems nobody fix this problem... <comment369995> While this may theoretically answer the question, [it would be preferable](//meta.stackoverflow.com/q/8259) to include the essential parts of the answer here, and provide the link for reference. <comment370103> @Glorfindel, Thank you very much for your suggestions. I heartily Appreciate it. I have updated my answer and Pls let me know if any changes required..Happy Coding..Thanks Again <comment370112> Thanks, this is better now. I hope there's another user around who can improve the grammar (and probably the formatting), I have other duties right now. <comment370132> @Glorfindel, I have updated my Grammer. Hope, I think It looks better. Thanks for your suggestions. <comment370134> I have made some changes as well. I tried to cut out the 'fluff' so that it focuses on the actual content of the answer. This is how an ideal Stack Exchange answer would look like (at least to me) so I've upvoted it. (It still has an automatic downvote from the Community â™¦ user, because it started out as low-quality. I can't do anything about that.)
