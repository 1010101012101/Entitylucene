Could I connect a macbook pro to an external hard drive for use with time machine <body> I want to know if connecting a macbook pro to an external hard drive for use with time machine when I am not using it, at night, will work.   If I then disconnect it in the morning (regardless of the progress of the time machine OR journaling) will it cause any problems?  Thanks  <answer212134> There are third party solutions to strongschedule/strong the timemachine backups. Backing up to any standard USB external harddrive should not be a problem at all.  While I cannot give you a firsthand review, strongTimeMachineEditor/strong seems quite popular and reliable: https://www.google.fr/search?q=timemachineeditor  When disconnecting the harddrive, you should however always make sure that the backup is finished and no write process is currently done. strongEject/strong the drive would be the safe thing to do.  <comment256187> Yah, if you just yank **any** drive out of the port without ejecting it properly Mac OS will scold you. So drag it to the trash/eject or select it and do COMMAND-E to eject it properly.
