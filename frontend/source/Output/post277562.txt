Repair USB drive without losing data on OS X (Mac OS Extended Journaled) <body> Today, my MacBook Pro suddenly disconnected my USB drive but not correctly, it gave a warning like if you remove a drive without ejecting it before unplugging it.  I did not touch or move the device, the system did this completely on its own while I was uploading a file from the stick to the web. After unplugging and connecting it again, after a few seconds of nothing happening, OS X shows a warning that the device cannot be read.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/CGUML.png" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Z2Yxs.png" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WFDMf.png" alt="enter image description here"  I would like to access my files. How do I rectify this without losing my data?  strongUPDATE 1/strong  As suggested by klanomath, I ran codesudo gpt -r show /dev/disk2/code and this is the output. Unfortunately it only gave me an error and also codediskutil list/code is now showing a different output. Yesterday I ran a tool called testdisk to analyse the drive for errors but I did not write something (here is the logfile: https://pastebin.com/DCMdS7k5 ).   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ctp2T.png" alt="enter image description here"  strongUPDATE 2/strong  I forgot to mention that after a short period of time, the drive does not show up in diskutil list anymore. Also it does not show up there everytime I connect the device. Sometimes I have to unplug and plug it in again to get the error message and see it in diskutil.  <comment349367> Yes, I think it was Mac OS Extended Journaled <comment349368> I have answered a similar question here: [My SATA hardrive was ejected, and is unable to be remounted due to issues](http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/252807/93229). Your thumb drive is much smaller though  some (partition) sizes in the linked answer have to be modified <comment349406> added the output <comment349408> The results are inconsistent: diskutil shows an MBR "Fdisk_partition_scheme" but testdisk suggests a gpt partition scheme: "Partition table type defaults to EFI GPT"! <comment349429> Any idea what that could mean? Before I ran testdisk disktutil was showing nothing (see the first console screenshot in my question). I'm really appreciating you trying to help me!
