What is the (external) keyboard shortcut to lock my screen with the screen save <body> Which keys can I press to bring up the locked screen save while I walk away for a few minutes?br I have an external keyboard (MS Comfort Curve 2000) thru a multi pc switcher box so I have ctrl-cmd-alt keys but no option key and everything I've tried so far doesn't work.  <answer58501> You can use kbdControl/kbd + kbdShift/kbd + kbdEject/kbd to put your display to sleep but also to lock your screen. If you don't have an Eject key, you need to use an Automator based workaround to assign your own shortcut. Alternatively, you can set a Hot Corner for the screensaver to start in System Preferences.  For the locking to work, you have to tell OS X to require a password immediately after sleep in emSystem Preferences  Security &amp; Privacy/em:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/egT8D.png" alt=""  When this is set, the above key combo will lock your screen and a password is required to unlock it.  <answer58504> A bit out of the box but this could work:  If you have an iPhone or iPad you could set up iCloud and find my mac, iPhone, iPad. boot up the codefind my iPhone app/code on your iDevice and lock your mac from there while you walk away.  Or if your not afraid for some apple scripting and you have a bluetooth enabled mac you could use this script to lock your mac upon bluetooth disconnection. ( which also should work with an non apple phone ) more info about the scripting can be found here: Lock and unlock a Mac using Bluetooth detection  <answer274466> Open codeSystem Preferences/code - codeKeyboard/code - codeShortcuts/code - codeApp Shortcuts/code.  Then click on the plus  sign under the white box that has the different options in there.  Name it 'Sleep' and give it the ⌘⌥F12 command (cmd + opt + F12).  You can set it to whatever you like but most keyboards already map F12 to the eject key so if you get a different keyboard it may work already by default.  Remember to also change your settings to require your password after a set time after going to sleep.  Hope this helps, I searched for awhile to find out how to do this and couldn't find any good answers.img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5AEJM.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment67317> this assumes the user has an Eject key; from his post it sounds like he is not using an Apple external keyboard as he doesn't have an Option key. <comment67318> There's no default shortcut for it (unless you count ⌃⇧⏏ and ⌥⌘⏏ when requiring a password after sleep is enabled), but see [Is there a quick way to lock my Mac?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/64/is-there-a-quick-way-to-lock-my-mac). One option would be assign a custom shortcut to `/System/Library/CoreServices/Menu\ Extras/User.menu/Contents/Resources/CGSession -suspend`. <comment67321> indeed, thanks. Updated the answer with the easiest workaround I could find by just using the Start Screensaver action <comment67324> FWIW, Alt and Option are the same key. <comment352556> This worked for me, so thanks for this.  I had to close out of System Preferences before it would work--it doesn't seem to apply immediately. <comment362823> Glad that worked for you.  Drove me insane trying to figure it out
