Shortcut for right click on underlined misspelled words <body> As many I tend to misspell some words when I type. OS X is being nice and underlines them letting me know that something was not right, if use a mouse and right click on the underlined word a menu pops up and offers the correct spelling of this word.  Is there a way to trigger this menu from the keyboard?  <answer234099> Sort of, but not quite in the same way - without the mouse to indicate which word you mean, it has to start from the top &amp; work through them all...  kbd Cmd ⌘ /kbd kbd : /kbd will pop up the full spell-checker with which you can then navigate through the doubtful words, but once open, you need to interact with it using the mouse, even to actually make it the front-most window.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/JkscV.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer234100> You may want to try kbdCmd:/kbd (colon), that's not exactly the same menu but it may do what you're looking for.
