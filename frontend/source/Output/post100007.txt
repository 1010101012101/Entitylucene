Excel 2011 Opens Spreadsheet As Read-Only <body> I have a spreadsheet (.xlsx) file that, when I open it on my MBP running Excel 2011 14.3.6, I get a pop-up telling me the file is locked and can only be opened in read-only mode.  About a minute later, Excel opens another pop-up and this time says that the file is unlocked and asks if I want to edit it.  I've triple-checked permissions on the file and it's definitely editable by me.  I've also verified in Get Info - General that it's not locked.  The file is located on a USB flash drive.  I created a copy of this file on the local drive (/Users/aj) and it will open fine without the warning.  Other Excel files saved on the USB flash drive open without this warning.  A copy of this file on the USB drive still has the warning.  What can I do to remove the warning?  I use this file all the time and it's super-annoying.  <answer100012> Does your file name contain a code//code? For example, if you take codethisfile.xlsx/code, and make it into codethis/file.xlsx/code, it will only open as read only. I verified this on my own Mac.  <answer163889> Whilst the first answer did not apply to the opening post, I'll use the old bugs in Microsoft Office to exemplify how a file that is read-only in an Excel window is not an open file.   @AJ. (opening poster): given the available information, multi-platform use of different versions of Excel is the likeliest cause of problems in your case. Please see below, emPersistence of temporary files/em …  hr  h2Microsoft Excel 2011 problems with POSIX-compliant use of HFS Plus by OS X/h2  Excel 14.4.7 (141117) allows the user to include the solidus character strong//strong (slash) within the name of a file in, for example, the Save dialogue:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/L8m5v.png" alt="screenshot of Excel allowing entry of / within a file name"  Simply saving then closing the workbook with that file name will cause the file to be read-only, to Excel, for as long as there's a character that Excel can not handle.   Editing the saved workbook, before initial closure, may expose additional bugs – one of which is shown at end of this answer.   hr  h2Other causes of Excel treating a workbook as read-only/h2  Use Terminal with ls(1) and lsof(8) to tell whether any lock-related file is present for the affected workbook; and to tell whether anything other than Excel has the workbook open.   Please note that codelsof/code is executed as the superuser.   h3Approaches to opening/locking/h3  Not all apps use the same approach.   strongExample 1/strong: a workbook codefile.xlsx/code opened first by NeoOffice then by Microsoft Excel:   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6SHEg.jpg" alt="screenshot of Mac OS X native file locking by NeoOffice"  Excel responds properly to the Mac OS X native file locking of NeoOffice:   ul lithe Excel window to the workbook is read-only/li lioutput from lsof confirms that the workbook is not open by Excel./li /ul  strongAlso in the screenshot above/strong  The codeCOMMAND/code column shows that two processes have the file open:   ul licodesoffice.bin/code – here, that's NeoOffice/li licodefilecoordinationd/code – for system-wide file access coordination./li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/v2hIi.png" alt="screenshot of Activity Monitor info for filecoordinationd"  strongExample 2/strong: the same workbook codefile.xlsx/code opened first by Microsoft Excel then by NeoOffice:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8cMW4.png" alt="screenshot of file locking by Microsoft Excel"  NeoOffice responds properly to Microsoft's approach to locking:   ul lithe NeoOffice window to the workbook is read-only/li lioutput from lsof confirms that the workbook is not open by NeoOffice/li lioutput from lsof confirms that lock file is not open by Excel./li /ul  strongEssentially/strong  Use codelsof/code to discover what has the workbook open. If not codefilecoordinationd/code then it might be a third party backup or synchronisation application, or a metadata-related process … and so on.   hr  h2Persistence of temporary files/h2  A temporary file may remain in the file system longer than necessary.   In example (2) above we see code~$file.xlsx/code – a companion to codefile.xlsx/code – such files are normally invisible to Finder.   If an (invisible) code~$….xlsx/code file is present following (for example) a crash of Excel on your own Mac, then Excel should behave properly when the (visible) workbook is next opened.   In contrast: if for any reason an code~$….xlsx/code file persists after closure of the workbook by another installation of Excel, then Excel on your Mac may respond strangely. With reference to the opening post –     … About a minute later, Excel opens another pop-up and this time says that the file is unlocked and asks if I want to edit it …   – that symptom is very familiar to me from shared use of a workbook served by Microsoft Windows Server to Windows and OS X clients.   (In my case, accepting the prompt to edit rarely allowed edition; there reappeared the alert about read-only access, then another prompt to edit, and so on … and that behaviour would persist after all users had closed the workbook. Resolved only by manual removal, from the server, of the invisible code~$….xlsx/code file.)  hr  h2Back to the bugs in Microsoft Office/h2  The solidus / in an existing file name prevents Excel from opening the file (the window to the file is read-only):   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/cRlkj.png" alt="screenshot of Excel limiting itself to read-only"  That's relatively innocuous.   However, edition following the initial save may present a succession of problems. Screenshots below show AutoSave/AutoRecover failure –  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/TK4B1.png" alt="screenshot of Excel preparing to save another file with a name that the application will find troublesome" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/OiueE.jpg" alt="screenshot of Excel failing to access an AutoSave/AutoRecover file" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/VxxBu.jpg" alt="screenshot of Excel disabling AutoRecover"  – the workbook is saved and remains open (confirmed with codelsof/code) but the behaviours are disconcerting to the end user.   <comment117683> Was the Excel spreadsheet created/modified in a Windows version of Excel? If so, are there any plugins/Macros in the spreadsheet? <comment117689> Yes it was created on Windows (good question).  No, I didn't add any macros, but that doesn't mean there aren't any (I guess)?  How can I tell? <comment117690> No, nothing like that.  It's just like 'foobar.xlsx'. <comment117699> Tools - Macro - Macros...  If there are any, they'll be listed there. <comment117835> No macros in the workbook. <comment156880> What Excel version is the file (not your application)? if you now move the file from HDD to USB what happens. <comment159484> I think this is true. When I removed the "/" symbol. The read-only status disappeared. <comment191981> Which version of OS X; which version of Windows; which version of Office for Windows? Is the drive properly ejected from Windows? Is Excel for Windows closed completely before the proper eject? Please edit answers into the question. Thanks.
