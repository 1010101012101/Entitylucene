Can I have Screen Sharing use something like ssh-keygen, so I don't have to type my password every time? <body> I can use ssh-keygen to set up accounts on my two Macs so when I type "ssh me@my-other-mac" from here, it doesn't need me to type my password again every time I connect.  Is there a way to set up Screen Sharing similarly?  <answer152206> No, I don't think so. Screen sharing uses VNC which is a different protocol than SSH. SSH allows you to use keys which is the mechanism where you can not use typed passwords.  <comment179205> That's why I said "something like" -- there are lots of authentication systems that let me log in without re-typing a password, which don't use SSH.
