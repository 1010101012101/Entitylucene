Can I add more math constants to Spotlight search? <body> You can use codepi/code to do calculations, but I also want to add codetau/code and more math constants, is there a way to do this?  <answer176686> Spotlight can only perform the functions listed in the codemath/code man page (type codeman math/code in Terminal to get a full list of functions). Adding a new constant like Ï„ would likely require modifying a library.  <comment208693> isn't tau 2xpi ? <comment208697> Because the spotlight icon is calculator, I once thought that I can do something in the calc preference. Seems I was wrong. <comment208698> Yeah but I also want others.
