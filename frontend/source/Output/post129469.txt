/usr/sbin/uninstall? What is it/what does it do? <body> There's a code/usr/sbin/uninstall/code command on my system. What does it do? There is no codeman/code page, and running it says   ol li"codeYou must be root to run this tool./code",/li liand (after codesudo uninstall -h/code) it says "codeURL is not uninstallable: -h/code". /li /ol  If I just run codesudo uninstall/code, it says "codeuninstall file_urls .../code"  I'm curious!  <answer135395> 0942v8653's guess is right, code/usr/sbin/uninstall/code is a command line uninstaller for Mac App Store apps.  The file URL must be specified as parameter. In my tests the path to the application did it:  precode$ sudo /usr/sbin/uninstall /Applications/Reeder.app Preparing Uninstall... Uninstall Began... 7%... 15%... (...) 92%... 100%... Uninstall Ended... /code/pre  while non-Mac App Store apps couldn't be uninstalled:  precode$ sudo /usr/sbin/uninstall /Applications/Seashore.app  URL is not uninstallable: /Applications/Seashore.app /code/pre  Interestingly, although I ran the command with sudo it still asked me for administrator credentials:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9eSk0.png" alt="enter image description here"  code/usr/bin/uninstall/code uses the Uninstall private framework:  precode$ otool -L /usr/sbin/uninstall  /usr/sbin/uninstall: (...)     /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Uninstall.framework/Versions/A/Uninstall (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 202.0.0) (...) /code/pre  just like the Dock:  precode$ otool -L /System/Library/CoreServices/Dock.app/Contents/MacOS/Dock | grep Uninstall     /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Uninstall.framework/Versions/A/Uninstall (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 202.0.0) /code/pre  That makes sense, because my tests showed that when an application is uninstalled inside Launchpad (by clicking the appâ€™s delete button that appears when icons wiggle) codeuninstall/code is not used, but the Dock.  <comment151538> idk what it is, but have a little bit more information. The command first appears in 10.7 Lion, and there is also a framework and daemon in /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Uninstall.framework/Versions/A/Resources/uninstalld and a matching plist in /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.uninstalld.plist <comment151540> My guess is for the Mac App Store (especially with a daemon) ... but I really don't have any evidence to back that up. <comment151547> That was my guess as well, but App Store appeared in Snow Leopard with a couple daemons that could handle that, and uninstall did not appear in any update for Snow Leopard, which still uses App Store (unless you do as I do and [disable it](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/13797/how-to-update-app-store-application-from-command-line/128150#128150)). This does not preclude the possiblity, and it is still my strong suspicion... but I have no evidence. <comment151736> @chillin Well, maybe it needs to be globalized for Launchpad, etc? <comment151749> @people I've tried com.apple.[etc]-style (aka Java-style) URLs, but it didn't take them. It also doesn't take iTunes web links, nor the Mac App Store links (my chosen test url: macappstores://itunes.apple.com/us/app/caffeine/id411246225, for Caffiene) <comment160630> Interesting! Thanks for the investigation. (I wish it'd work for non-MAS apps, though.)
