Images have a specific date on the Photo's app but exported with an entirely different date? <body> I have about 300+ photos taken in 2012 and it shows so in the Photos app. However, exporting it as original to a folder completely replaces that date with 2016 July. Not sure why, but even trying to extract EXIF data does not show the original 2012 timestamp.. So running EXIFTOOL to modify the dates would not work here, as the EXIF data with original creation date is not there.   Any idea how can I force extract photos with the relevant timestamp shown in the Photos app?  For example, the following shows in Finder :   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bjUh8.png" alt="enter image description here"  But in Photos, I get this :   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/XcetF.png" alt="enter image description here"  And using REGEX.INFO, there are no date values in the EXIF :   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uTuc2.png" alt="enter image description here"
