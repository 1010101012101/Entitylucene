Setting environment variable for sudo in Yosemite <body> I followed this similar question to set my environment variables in Yosemite: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25385934/setting-environment-variables-via-launchd-conf-no-longer-works-in-os-x-yosemite/26179907#26179907  I want to do the same thing, but for sudo  precodedo shell script "sudo launchctl setenv variablename value" with administrator privileges /code/pre  but somehow, it does not show if I go in a terminal afterwards and run the command:  precodesudo launchctl getenv variablename /code/pre  What am I doing wrong ?  <answer155854> Your first line of code is wrong. If you say codesudo/code and codewith administrator privileges/code you are doing the same thing twice. If you use the terminal, as you can see, the following works:  precode$ sudo launchctl setenv TEST true Password:&lt;you have to insert your password here&gt; $ sudo launchctl getenv TEST true /code/pre  You could unset the variable with the command:  precode$ sudo launchctl unsetenv TEST /code/pre  You don't need an applescript to do that.  <comment183336> I think I didn't mention it, but I am using apple script to load the variables at each reboot! I'll test your solution and see if it works. <comment183345> Using your solution, of not saying `sudo` and adding `with administrator privileges`, with AppleScript worked! Thank you
