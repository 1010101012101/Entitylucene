Increase Number of Recent Applications In Dock <body> I've enabled the 'Recent Applications' folder to appear in my dock:  precodedefaults write com.apple.dock persistent-others -array-add '{ "tile-data" = { "list-type" = 1; }; "tile-type" = "recents-tile"; }' /code/pre  Is there any way to increase the number from 10 Recent Applications to 15, or preferably, omit specific applications from being in it.  <answer170266> Going to System Preferences  General  drop down box for recent documents, apps, and servers should do the trick.  <comment199991> Thanks for the down vote guys, I believe that usually calls for a comment? But no hard feelings I'll try to read your minds on what I could be doing better <comment200137> This works, but only after a killall to finder or maybe dock, didn't try dock, but I had to kill finder and relaunch for it to reload, but thanks, I didn't even think to look there <comment200155> Can be hard to find the right setting sometimes, especially when doing stuff Cook and his buddies don't want you to do. The easiest way to hide something, is to make it obvious.
