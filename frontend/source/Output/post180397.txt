What's using up my iPhone space and how to clear it? <body> I've taken a look at my "Usage" stats and it reads as such:  Used 7.3GBbr Available 4.7GB  And when I go into Manage Storage, I add up all the app's MB usage and it totals: 4.48 GB  So where is my ~2.9 GB at?   Not only do we have to endure the formatting size steal (16GB drive = 12GB space) disaster, but almost 25% of that space is seemingly being used else where?   <comment214261> What version of iOS are you using? <comment214263> 8.2 on iPhone 6 (16GB) <comment214265> I can post some screens of my phone also so you can see I'm not pulling numbers out of the void.
