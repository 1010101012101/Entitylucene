How do I increase "ulimit -u" (max user processes)? <body> I can change all of the usual ulimits via (for instance) codeulimit -n 8192/code and codelaunchctl limit maxfiles 8192 8192/code. Somehow, this doesn't seem to work for code-u/code, the maximum number of user processes:  precode~$ sudo launchctl limit maxproc 8192 8192 ~$ sudo launchctl limit maxproc     maxproc     2048           2048 -- in a new terminal: ~$ ulimit -u 1064 /code/pre  I do get a "failed to fork" every once in a while, and it's quite annoying having to kill a bunch of processes when "kill" can't start :) (i.e. I usually resort to just rebooting the machine).  What's the correct way to change the maximum number of user processes?   <answer140705> http://blog.ghostinthemachines.com/2010/01/19/mac-os-x-fork-resource-temporarily-unavailable/ talks about this issue in great detail.  When you do codesudo launchctl limit maxproc/code, you're viewing or changing the system-wide launchd limits.  When you do codelaunchctl limit maxproc/code, you're viewing or changing the launchd limits for your user.  One thing to keep in mind is this:     The root user can increase the hard limits of the system-wide launchd,   without a reboot.  However, you cannot change a userâ€™s launchd hard   limits without a reboot (even if trying to do so as the root user).   Basically, the hard limit (the right hand column) that is displayed when you initially do codelaunchctl limit maxproc/code will be the limit that you can set using codeulimit -u/code without rebooting.  Logging out and back in will not work.  Even if you change whats displayed by codelaunchctl limit maxproc/code, the initial hard limit remains.  See this answer for a bit more info on the relationship between codeulimit/code and codelaunchctl limit/code. To raise that limit, you have to  ul liedit/create code/etc/sysctl.conf/code to raise the maximum processes supported by the kernel  precodekern.maxproc=2500 kern.maxprocperuid=2500 /code/pre/li liedit/create code/etc/launchd.conf/code to raise the hard limits of the system-wide launchd at boot time  precodelimit maxproc 2500 2500 /code/pre/li lireboot/li /ul  Also note that 2500 seems to be the maximum limit that codekern.maxproc/code can be set to.  I'll ask a question about this as soon as I reboot and have enough free processes to open another Chrome tab.  <comment301120> Note: The `launchd.conf` method [no longer works in Mavericks](http://unix.stackexchange.com/q/108174/21471) and other newer distributions.
