Dia on macOS Sierra <body> I'm trying to run Dia on macOS Sierra (MacBookPro, Retina). It crashed searching for codelibdia.dylib/code. Exporting codeDisplay=:0/code, as recommended here, does not help.  Any ideas?  <comment357050> For me, adding `export DISPLAY=:0` below line 39 in `Dia.app/Contents/Resources/bin` did the trick. One solution for you is to run it inside an Ubuntu VM in Virtualbox.
