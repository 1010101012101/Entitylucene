Freeware for extracting 7zip files? <body> I've used The Unarchiver for this purpose, but it doesn't support extracting encrypted 7zip files. Can anyone suggest any other freeware for this?  BTW I'm using Mac OS X Leopard 10.5.8  <answer5381> Some unofficial p7zip packages for Mac OS X exist, you can try them.  <answer5412> Softonic has a nice list of 7Zip for Mac utilities. Some are freeware.   <answer5848> I've been using 7zX for unzipping 7zip archives. It works with passworded  and encrypted (with -mhe=on) archives. http://sixtyfive.xmghosting.com/products/7zx/  <comment5503> The link for page 'p7zip for Mac OS X' http://homepage.mac.com/krmathis/ returns with 404. Is it hosted somewhere else? <comment5531> Downloaded 7zX from the list. Not the best software but works. Thanks.
