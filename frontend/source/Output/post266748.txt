Transcend JetDrive 725 as Internal SSD <body> I have a mid-2012 macbook pro retina (10,1) that I'm looking to upgrade the 250GB SSD. I'm considering the JetDrive 725 (960GB), but I want to know if it would show up as an internal SSD. I know that the 960GB OWC Aura Pro shows up as an external drive based on the way they used a raid controller.  If anyone has upgraded their SSD, I'd appreciate any suggestions based on your experience.
