How to sync ForkLift Favourites and settings across computers? <body> is there any 'easy' way to sync my ForkLift so I don't have to keep updating my three computers every time I add an FTP for example..  I thought about doing a symlink via dropbox but I don't have idea of which folders contain this information.  Any suggestions?  Thanks, Luis.  <answer237118> At the risk of resurrecting this old thread, I've just had the exact same problem.  According to the developers the next major version will allow syncing of password-protected favorites via Dropbox. As of this writing no release date has been set.  In the meantime you could try this.  ForkLift preferences – including Favorites – are stored in  precode/Users/your-user-name/Library/Preferences/com.binarynights.ForkLift2.plist /code/pre  Move – not copy – this file to your Dropbox. I placed mine in a folder named ForkLift.  Next, you need to create a symlink using the strongln/strong command in Terminal with the strong-s/strong switch. This is important as simply dragging the file in the Finder to create an alias will not work.  precodeln -s /Users/your-user-name/Dropbox/ForkLift/com.binarynights.ForkLift2.plist /Users/your-user-name/Library/Preferences/com.binarynights.ForkLift2.plist /code/pre  The downside is that passwords are not copied. Also, having ForkLift open at the same time on different machines will likely cause a file conflict with the preference file. But this solution works for me.
