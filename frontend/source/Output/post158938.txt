Macbook Pro 13" HDD cables going bad <body> I have a user at my institution who has had 4 HDD cables go bad since May, 3 times in her laptop and once in a loaner we provided. Both are the same model, Macbook Pro 13" unibody. I'm starting to think it's not a coincidence but have no idea what could be causing it. The user appears to take good care of the machine otherwise. It's still under warranty for another year but if it's not a coincidence, we'd obviously like to stop it.
