Not able to share symlinked folders with Dropbox for Mac? <body> I'm having a problem with the Dropbox client for the Mac. I have symlinked code~/Projects//code into code~/Dropbox/Projects//code using MacDropAny.app, which basically runs codeln -s/code. This works as suspected. But when I try to right click a file or folder within my codeDropbox/Projects/code folder, the Dropbox sharing alternatives are not showing. These items appears fine in other, none-symlinked folders inside Dropbox.  If I go through Dropbox.com, i can share this folder/subfolders fine. But I want to be able to easily share linkes to files/folders from the Mac right click context menu. Any tips/ideas?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wNzsw.png" alt="enter image description here" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/syGgp.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment346258> Another thing, that might be related, is that you don't get the green/blue sync status icon on subfolders when using symlinks. <comment346261> If this turns out to be a bug, you might want to add this to the drawbacks of using symlinks with Dropbox - http://superuser.com/questions/383475/using-only-the-dropbox-folders-vs-symlinks-on-os-x <comment346265> What if you create the symlink manually and not use the app? <comment346332> @Allan Tried to set symlink manually. Same problem, only one difference. A "Move to Dropbox" option appeard, which doesn't show in the other symlinked folder.
