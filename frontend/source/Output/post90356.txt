Does the javascript debugger in Safari have the ability to de-minify javascript like chrome does? <body> In the Chrome debugger under the "Sources" tab, there is a little "{}" button at the bottom that will de-minify minified code and make it human readable, as well as allow the developer to set breakpoints, etc.  I haven't found anything similar in Safari... Does anyone know if Safari has this ability?
