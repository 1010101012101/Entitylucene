Speed up iPhone SMS app <body> I found that after some weeks of usage, my SMS app on a iPhone 3G (iOS 3.0.1, JB) seems to take a few more seconds to start than usual.  On all other cellphones I had, you had to delete old messages because of memory constrains and to make the app work better. Does this apply to the iPhone as well?  If so, how can I delete all messages of all contacts that are more than 1 month old, or something?  As the SMS database is SQLite based, I could script it. I even found this link regarding this but has been hesitating to use it.  How do you do it?  <answer1759> Not for the faint of heart, but I've done some research into iPhone daemons, and deleting/ disabling certain ones can have an impact on speed. Here's a lesson from BigBoss about the subject. Here's a list of daemons and what they do (I found this really helpful).  Hope this helps!  <answer14109> I cannot remember where I read this, but turning off Spotlight search indexing for messages should speed it up. Go into Settings: General: Spotlight Search, and uncheck Messages.  <comment1543> Are you jailbroken? I've played around in the AddressBook database file. There seems to be no rhyme or reason to its "organization" though. If you're still interested, I could look up the location of the database in the filesystem. I'm not sure how to speed up the SMS app though. Sounds like a fun project though. I wouldn't mind experimenting with my 3G as well. <comment1544> What version of the iOS are you currently running? <comment1545> The SMS database seems to be located at /var/mobile/Library/SMS/sms.db. You think deleting old records from it will speed up the SMS app? Am I the only one feeling it slow to launch?  I'm running a JB iPhone 3G, iOS 3.0.1.
