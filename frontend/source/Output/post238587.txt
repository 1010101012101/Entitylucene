Music / iPhone: no access to library, just an image dead end: "girl with headphones" <body> I have an iPhone 6 running iOS 9.3.1.  I just made a synchronization with its host MacBook Pro with no problem and which might not be related in any way to the problem I witness.  Upon opening Music on this iPhone, I just get this  image:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/url7e.jpg" alt="image on Music / iPhone picture" , with apparently not any function visible on the screen or hidden anywhere.  I tried to click within the usual corners where hidden functions are placed but didn't get any reaction.  I can close the application, reopen it.  Same dead end.  My iPhone isn't connected to any network outside of my phone provider. I don't have any Internet connection (on phone, on Bluetooth or on Wi-Fi).  I never used iCloud to stay on basic problems (there are already enough problems thus far). Here are my codeSettings &gt; Music/code: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nuCeI.jpg" alt="Settings &gt; Music"  I did not try to shutdown the iPhone since I would like to understand what is this problem and its origin before trying to fix or kill it.  hr  Among the technical details:  ul liI am not using Apple Music (I don't even know how to)./li liI am not using Siri./li liI am not using iCloud./li /ul  Any strongvery similar/strong question which involve any of these three functions might be a strongfalse duplicate/strong.  Apple doesn't aknowledge if this is a bug but seems already aware that there is a real problem with the codeMusic/code software since the number of  users reporting the exact same problem is regularly growing. Their actual receipe is just "restart it" which I dont consider a professionnal answer.  hr  If you encountered the same problem, do you have any hint of which operation or configuration error might lead to it?  What may help to analyze this problem?  <comment292647> I don't use Apple Music and to be honnest I haven't yet looked at what this application or service might be. I'm simply not interested.•• return •• This similar question didn't bring me any clear explanation to the problem I want to understand and avoid definetly. <comment292655> Try some of the others then - http://apple.stackexchange.com/search?q=girl+headphones <comment292663> Thank you for your hint to search for relevant questions.•• return •• I am in the process of reviewing all of them in a search for a correct explanation and a way to avoid this silly **interface dead end**. <comment292943> Didn't find any correct explanation or analysis :). The answers tagged as correct are of very low quality. <comment292951> Adding a new question asking the same thing will not increase the quality of the answers, that's why it got closed as a duplicate. If you are looking for better answers, consider editing more details into the original question and/or set a bounty. <comment293120> → patrix: I made purposefully a new question because none of the one I found was clearly presenting the problem and at least contained a screen capture of the dead end picture. Rather than to make a complete edit on top of low quality **discussions**, I made my own question which was much faster and cleaner (for me).•• return •• If this method seems you a failure on a way to get better quality answers, just delete my question. I won't invest time on a problem where all questions are of really low quality.
