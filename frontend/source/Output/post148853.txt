Disconnecting charger while Macbook Pro Retina is still turned on <body> Is it safe to disconnect (unplug the charger from) my Macbook Pro Retina 13" while the computer is turned on and running?  <answer148854> Absolutely it is safe.  It has been designed for that, it does not have a locked in plug, but a magnetically coupled plug for that reason.  I have done that on purpose or by accident (tripping over the cable) many times without problems.  <comment175315> Yes. Buscar is correct. <comment175316> So, to clarify, this means that I can connect and disconnect the charger to and from my MBPr while I'm still using the computer itself? <comment175318> correct you can do that at any time.
