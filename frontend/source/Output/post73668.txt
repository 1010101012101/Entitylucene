Is it still possible to run Safari 6 in 32bit on MacOS 10.8? <body> I tried the ways i know:  ol liGet Info - 32bit Mode - Start == runs in 64 bit/li liarch -i386 /Applications/Safari.app/Contents/MacOs/Safari == results in error/li /ol  is it still somehow possible to run Safari in 32bit ? I need it in order to work with ManyCam which can only operate in 32bit.  <answer73671> No, Lion abandoned 32-bit application mode.  <comment85565> thats what i thought, strange that it offers the option to select 32bit mode <comment85666> This is strangeâ€¦ :-/ <comment89379> that seems to be the sad truth as far as my research goes
