Mails from Apple are shown malformed in Outlook 2010 (Windows) <body> I have a setup with Mac and Windows clients. The Mac users use Apple Mail and all users have an HTML signature with images. When a Mac user replies to an email the text from the initial message becomes an attachment with the name: codeuntitled attachment001.html/code and the image from the signature becomes an attachment with the name: codePastedGraphic.pdf/code.  Can this behaviour be avoided? How can I preserve the original email and signature?  I have managed the following. I discovered that it was due to the malformed signature. So I created a .webarchive file that contains the signature as I want to be. The signature appears correctly at both the file and the apple mail signature editor. But when I open to write a new mail only the borders of the signature image appear and there is an '?' inside the borders. What does this mean?  <answer43722> The Mac users need to make sure that their outgoing email format is HTML or Rich Text even if the incoming format was plain text or use a plain text signature.  I'd prefer the latter: I use plain text email whenever possible as it's more-widely compatible and usually is easier to read. This, by necessity, would entail using plain text signatures.  <comment49679> Have you considered plain text sigs? <comment49704> Anbd what about images? <comment49707> The outgoing mails are in rich text(does apple mail support outgoing in html?). I have tried to disable inline attachments but nothing happened. Seriously, Apple mail is so lame? <comment49730> @peraueb8921 Is "use the same message format as the original message" checked? <comment49731> @peraueb8921 I believe that Mail's Rich Text is equivalent to HTML on Outlook. <comment49733> @peraueb8921 Have you tried Outlook for Mac? If you're having trouble with Mail, it might be worth it to switch to a different email client. <comment49907> Check my edits please <comment49908> Unfortunately I dont have outlook licence <comment49920> @peraueb8921 Microsoft has 30-day trials of Office (http://www.microsoft.com/mac/trial) that include Outlook. <comment49921> @peraueb8921 Re: your edits, is the question mark in a blue box? Do you see the question mark on the Mac before sending or in Windows after receipt? <comment50067> Almost...I made a step forward. I managed to see correlty the signature while I write a new mail. The message appears perfectly on Thunderbird but outlook says it cannot load 'cause a broken link:O
