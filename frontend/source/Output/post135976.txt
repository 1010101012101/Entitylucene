Downloading entire website - freeware software <body> Is there any strongfreeware/strong software (including command line utilities) to downloaded entire website recursively (aby kind of links, not only HTML files)?  <answer135978> strongSitesucker/strong isn't freeware, but it's exactly what you're looking for. I use it all the time. It costs $4.99 through the App Store.      "SiteSucker is a Macintosh application that automatically downloads Web   sites from the Internet. It does this by asynchronously copying the   site's Web pages, images, backgrounds, movies, and other files to your   local hard drive, duplicating the site's directory structure. Just   enter a URL (Uniform Resource Locator), press return, and SiteSucker   can download an entire Web site."   Best of luck.   <comment161207> That question has been [asked](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/100570/getting-files-all-at-once-from-a-web-page-using-curl) [before](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/97834/how-can-i-download-all-mp3-files-from-a-web-site?rq=1).
