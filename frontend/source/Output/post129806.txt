Add commandline app shortcut <body> How do I run the app: code~/ngrok/code by typing codengrok/code?  I want to add a shortcut to the code~/ngrok/code location so that I don't need to know the place where it is when I run the app.  <answer129807> Commands in *nix terminals are stored in various directories throughout the filesystem. The codePATH/code variable is a series of colon (code:/code) sperated directories that are searched in order to find a desire command. When a command is called, the codePATH/code variable is read, and all the paths is contains are checked for the command in question.   You have 2 ways to make your program run without specifying location: either add it to a directory that's already to your codePATH/code variable, or add its containing folder to the codePATH/code variable.  You can read your current codePATH/code variable by running:  codeecho $PATH/code  And you can edit your codePATH/code variable by following a guide such as this one  P.S. I REALLY strongly discourage keeping files directly within code~//code  <answer129810> You can also make function in Your code~/.bash_profile/code file. Simply put this line:  codefunction ngrok { ~/ngrok; };/code  To test it in current terminal window type codesource ~/.bash_profile/code. New terminal would load this file automatically.
