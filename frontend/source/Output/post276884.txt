Cannot ping MacBookPro on VLAN unless it is asleep <body> I have a MacBookPro attached (wired) to a network port that is an Untagged member of a VLAN. WiFi is turned off. The MacBookPro has a manually set IP address, but cannot be pinged by, or ping to any other host on the same IP network and VLAN.  When I replace the MacBookPro by an arbitrary Windows laptop, there is no problem pinging to or from any of the hosts. This causes me to thing I'm dealing with a Mac setting instead of a network configuration issue.  Here's where it gets weird: when the MacBookPro falls asleep it DOES respond to pings. As soon as it's woken up however, or has its network cable removed the pings stop.  What is making my MacBookPro drop IP packets when its on a VLAN port on the switch?  Here's some information on the Mac:  precode  Model Name:   MacBook Pro   Model Identifier: MacBookPro11,3   Processor Name:   Intel Core i7   Processor Speed:  2,3 GHz   Number of Processors: 1   Total Number of Cores:    4   L2 Cache (per Core):  256 KB   L3 Cache: 6 MB   Memory:   16 GB   Boot ROM Version: MBP112.0138.B18   SMC Version (system): 2.19f12  Thunderbolt Ethernet:   Type: Ethernet   BSD Device Name:  en3   IPv4:   Addresses:    10.0.102.70   Configuration Method: Manual   Router:   10.0.102.70   Subnet Masks: 255.255.255.0   DNS:   Server Addresses: 8.8.8.8   Proxies:   Exceptions List:  *.local, 169.254/16   FTP Passive Mode: Yes  Firewall Settings:   Mode: Allow all incoming connections   Firewall Logging: Yes   Stealth Mode: No /code/pre
