"Mount" network share as a volume via SSH? <body> There is a remote server that I can connect to only via SSH, and storage space have been allocated for me in that server.  Is there a software that lets me "mount" a network share via SSH so that I can use it as if it is a local folder?  I strongly prefer cross-platform and Free (as in Freedom) solutions, but anything you can think of I'd love to know.  Thank you!  <answer37752> Use HomeBrew to install fuse4x and sshfs  The commands to install are:  precodebrew install sshfs /code/pre  when you run it, it gives two other commands that I needed to run in order to install the fuse4x kernel extension. Run them.  Then, to mount the ssh filesystem  precodemkdir ~/mymountdir sshfs username@hostname:/home/thedir ~/mymountdir /code/pre  it will ask you for your password.  <answer37756> I've not tried it, but for what it's worth, the codeman/code page for the Unix codemount/code command lists that you can connect to remote systems:  precodeThe mount command calls the mount(2) system call to prepare and graft a special device or the remote node (rhost:path) on to the file system tree at the point node.  If either special or node are not provided, the appropriate information is obtained via the getfsent(3) library routines. /code/pre  <comment42839> Thanks for your answer! Since I already have MacPorts setup I discovered it has sshfs, too. <comment42843> You actually don't need MacPorts or HomeBrew at all to do this.
