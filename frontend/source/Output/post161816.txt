OSX Yosemite can't resize partitions? <body> A few weeks ago I installed OS X yosemite.I did it on the standard partition, but I had a dual-boot with ubuntu. I realised that the ubuntu boot was gone so I tried to redo it. But in disk utility, when i tried to make Macintosh HD smaller it gave a "Error: -69803: Couldn't modify partition map because file system verification failed "  How do I fix this, not just for dual booting but resizing partitions?  <answer161826> Boot holding kbd Command âŒ˜  /kbd kbd R /kbd at the chimes to boot into Recovery Mode, run Disk Utility &amp; Repair Disk.  <comment189045> Thank You.I tried Recovery mode but didn't know what repair disk did!
