Keeping the mac awake when running certain applications? <body> I need to keep my MacBook Air awake when running certain applications. But when I put the display to sleep, often the whole system suspends after a few minutes.  Specifically I run Air Video Server on the Mac to stream/decode videos to my iPad. But the Mac keeps sleeping and thus stopping streaming videos.   I tried to use Caffeine to keep the Mac awake, but it looks like it has lost its magic in Mountain Lion â€“ it couldn't keep the Mac awake to continue running services after I put the display to sleep.  Wimoweh (another sleep-preventing app) couldn't detect whether Air Video server is running, so it's probably won't be useful in this situation.  So is there any other app that can keep a Mac running services with the display asleep? I'm not keen to install OS X Server on this laptop since it's more of a once-in-a-while thing and most of the time I need the Air to really sleep if it's unused.  <answer93877> I use caffeine to avoid the system to sleep, you can configure the time is "awake" as well: http://lightheadsw.com/caffeine/  Edit to update as caffeine hasn't been updated for a long time, Amphetamine seems to work OK https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/amphetamine/id937984704?mt=12  <comment104732> Have you tried disabling automatic sleep in the energy saver preference pane or [using caffeinate](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/75980/are-there-any-hidden-settings-to-modify-default-system-sleep-conditions/76091#76091)?
