Mail prompts me for SMTP password the first email I send <body> New Mac user here, running 10.9.2 on an air and am running into an annoying issue with Mail.  I have setup my Live account and POP is working great but at least the first email I try to send, per each time I log on to my machine, I am prompted for my SMTP password.  This is only an annoyance but I would think I could ask it to remember my password.  Is this possibly a setting in keychain which needs adjusted?  <answer123203> Aside from the fact Mail should remember you SMTP password once you enter it for the first time, you can set it by:  ol liOpen Mail/li liOpen Mail preferences/li liGo to accounts/li liselect the mail account whose SMPT password you want to set/li liIn the 'Account information' tab click on the 'Outgoing Mail Server (SMPT) list/li liFrom the drop down menu at (5) select 'Edit SMPT server list'/li liSelect the SMPT server in question from the list/li liClick on the 'Advanced' menu/li liSet Username and Password (and possibly tick the "use Secure Socket Layer (SSL)' box)./li /ol  You are now set.  <comment143876> Can you change the first sentence, I can't understand what it means
