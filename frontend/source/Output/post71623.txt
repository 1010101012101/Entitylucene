How can I transfer songs between Garageband for iOS and OS X? <body> I have Garageband on iPad, iPhone and OS X. How can I transfer the music between them? I have enabled iCloud with iPad and iPhone but cannot understand how to get the music from there to OS X? I have tried iTunes and the file sharing option, but it is too slow, I am trying to find some faster way â€” I want that the sounds to be available between all of my devices without too many manual changes, hopefully automatically.  Basically: I create a song with the iPhone or iPad, I want it immediately available on OS X for processing, how to get it there?  <answer71656> First make sure you've got strongiCloud/strong turned on in strongGarageband/strong, by tapping the strong+/strong icon when viewing all your songs. Then, for sending a song to iCloud, just:  ol liTap on the emEdit/em button, and select all the songs you want./li liYou will now see an iCloud icon along the top bar. Tapping it, will prompt you to send the songs to iCloud./li /ol  Now, all uploaded songs to iCloud will have an iCloud logo on the top-right corner of the song thumbnail.   Opening Garageband with any other device, which has, too, iCloud enabled, will show a green arrow on the top-right corned of the songs which stronghaven't/strong yet been downloaded. Tapping the thumbnail will start the download.  Mind that, songs created with iOS's version of Garageband strongcannot/strong be opened with the OS X application if it's the 6.0.1 or earlier version.  <answer83337> I found a quicker way here: https://discussions.apple.com/message/20126598#20126598  Basically, in ~/Library/Mobile Documents/XXXXX~com~apple~mobilegarageband you'll find the songs you've saved in iCloud from GarageBand on iOS.  <answer101843> This is my clear impression: You can't.  iOS Garageband emcan/em use the iCloud. OS X Garageband emcan not/em. Use iCloud for moving between Garagebands on iOS-devices only.  <comment83223> ...so I need to wait just for newer iOS version? <comment83225> The other way round. Updating the Mac version to **6.0.2** should let you open the songs you've created with iOS. <comment83291> Ok, not yet available for me so have to wait... <comment84284> ...perhaps related [here](http://avp.stackexchange.com/questions/5405/mixing-videos-and-sounds-with-garageband-soundcloud-and-youtube). <comment130710> WHY can't I just e-mail the song to myself? Sometimes I hate all the restrictions with Apple. <comment130711> @Marcus Email really is awful for large attachments and Apple does sync all the iOS songs to the Mac. If you have a case where the selected answer here doesn't work for you, you could ask a follow on question explaining how this solution doesn't work for you (or your use case is different than the one hhh has described).
