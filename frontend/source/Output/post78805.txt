Chromium builds for Mac OS X <body> What is the emproper/em way to install Chromium (not chrome!) on Mac OS X?  Stable builds are a must, beta builds or nightlies are nice to have.  <answer78814> Get on the bleeding edge of the web with Google Chrome's nightly builds called Chrome Canary. This should work for you. Good luck!  <answer78816> The strongChromium Project/strongsup1/sup does not seem to provide compiled builds for the OS X or Windows platform. If you run Ubuntu, you can use the Software Center to install Chromium just like you would with the Mac App Store.  Therefore, under OS X you would have to emdownload the source code/em and embuild/em the application yourself which requires the use of the free Development Software strongXcode/strongsup2/sup.  You can follow the official strongMac build instructions/strong to help you get started:  https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/docs/mac_build_instructions.md  br  h2Ewh! I don't want to go through all this trouble.../h2  The strongFree OpenSource Mac User Group/strong stronghosts/strong a site that has the latestsup3/sup compiled build. According to their website:  ol li...the download is compiled following the official Mac Build Instructions (link above)./li li...they integrated the strongSparkle/strongsup4/sup update framework to offer a simple update procedure since Chromium does not have the auto-update feature of Google Chrome. /li /ol  Their download is a simple code.dmg/code which you install via drag-and-drop, just like Chrome.  While they do provide a MD5 hash, the Chromium Project does emnot/em provide MD5 hashes of the compiled builds. So strongyou have to trust this website's integrity when using their downloads./strong  Other than no auto-update integration, Chromium has some more differences from Google Chrome which you can read in the following Wikipedia article on Chromium (web browser).  <answer79762> Try   http://download-chromium.appspot.com  Nice and easy, just download.   <answer215426> ul liInstall HomeBrew/li lidelInstall HomeBrew Casks: codebrew install caskroom/cask/brew-cask/code/del &lt;- emthis is now obsolete/em/li liInstall Chromium: codebrew cask install chromium/code/li /ul  h2Or, an alternative/h2  is this method which uses this script, and has a more up to date version as the one above (and also verifies the Chromium checksum), and provides updates:  ul liInstall HomeBrew/li licodebrew tap domt4/chromium/code/li licodebrew install domt4/chromium/chromium/code/li licodebrew linkapps chromium/code/li /ul  updating is as simple as:  ul licodebrew update; brew upgrade/code/li /ul  If you want to automatically upgrade daily in the background you can use this (note that this also upgrades your other HomeBrew packages if you have any):  ul licodebrew tap domt4/autoupdate/code/li licodebrew autoupdate --start --upgrade/code/li /ul  h2Currently recommended method (05-2017):/h2  ul licodebrew tap domt4/chromium/code/li licodebrew cask install mac-chromium/code/li licodebrew tap buo/cask-upgrade/code (click here for cask-upgrade info/source)/li /ul  To upgrade Chromium, run:  ul licodebrew cu/code/li /ul  or  ul licodebrew cu -y -a/code/li /ul  <answer216616> Stable build from FreeSMUG (Free Software Mac User Group are here: http://www.freesmug.org/chromium  <comment91113> Canary is not chromium, but the second link seems legit, thx. <comment91114> I can build Chromium (thx for the thorough steps, I already have an environment :)), but I'm looking for precompiled builds that are easy to distribute. <comment92473> The FreeSMUG builds show as unsigned on my computer, does anybody else see this? <comment92512> @lupincho No, I had no problem executing the current download in 10.8.2. No warning or anything like that. <comment96977> Be aware that the download on this page is not ideal for most users. It grabs the Chromium build directly from the Chromium SVN build server which is not always stable. It's roughly equivalent to Chrome Canary, which Google says is "designed for developers and early adopters, and can sometimes break down completely." so be aware of this before downloading. <comment259276> What's with the links formatted like footnotes? Why not just make the relevant word or phrase a link? <comment287378> Thanks. Small update: `brew install caskroom/cask/brew-cask` is no longer valid. But other than that, this totally works. <comment352870> Much simpler than the accepted answer, thanks! Nice to know about autoupdate too. <comment356988> The FreeSMUG dmg as well as `brew cask install freesmug-chromium` did not work for me. It installed fine, but when I ran it, it gave error `"Chromium quit unexpectedly."` <comment356989> The FreeSMUG dmg as well as `brew cask install freesmug-chromium` did not work for me. It installed fine, but when I ran it, it gave error "Chromium quit unexpectedly." <comment356990> FYI, both the canonical homebrew chromium as well as domt4's chromium are canary/latest versions (currently v60). I could not find a working stable chromium installer (currently v58). The FreeSMUG one did not work for me on Yosemite. <comment369375> Did you ever find out a nice way to install and update stable builds? The current answers still only install the latest dev builds...
