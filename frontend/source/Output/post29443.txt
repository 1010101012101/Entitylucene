How do you edit the favorites list on Lion finder? <body> Dragging in and out doesn't seem to be working for me, but I can see the ones I dragged in there before I upgraded:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ptyfn.png" alt="favorites list"  <answer29444> I don't think you can drag folders out anymore (to prevent accidental deletions), but if you right click you should have a "remove from sidebar" item in the context menu.  <answer29448> You should still be able to drag items on to the sidebar. To remove them either right/command(⌘)-click and select emRemove from Sidebar/em or drag while holding ⌘.  <answer33084> Command/drag works for me - as does the right click.  <comment33822> weird: dragging in wasn't working before, but it is now.
