Allow program to make changes <body> I have a program called ServiceCenter from Native Instruments which is basically a downloader and installer for updates etc. But every time I open it it prompts for my password to allow it to make changes.  Is there any way to whitelist trusted software so it doesn't prompt for admin password?  <answer122588> Yes, this can be achieved with the NOPASSWD directive in the code/etc/sudoers/code file. Editing this file should only be done by an experienced user, because it is a system-critical file and mistakes could be difficult to troubleshoot.  ol liEdit the file from the terminal with codesudo visudo -f /etc/sudoers/code/li liAdd this line under the user privilege specification section, code%admin ALL= NOPASSWD: /absolute/path/to/your/program/code/li liSave the file./li /ol  The codevisudo/code command uses your editor set in the codeVISUAL/code variable or if that is unset, the codeEDITOR/code variable. Please refer to the visudo(8) man page.  <comment143071> Thanks for the reply but unfortunately I tried it and it didn't work... It is still asking for password! <comment143072> The procedure will work if your user is a member of the %admin group (i.e. has administrator privileges).  Make sure the path is correct. It will have to point to a (most likely) binary file inside the Program.app folder. For example, for Sublime Text, the correct path is  `/Applications/Sublime Text.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/subl`. If you do not know the path, try running `ps aux` when the program is running and looking for it in the list. <comment143074> Oh right thats probably the issue then I'll try that! I work a lot with sublime actually, will it allow it to modify files regardless of permissions? <comment143075> This change allows you to `sudo appname` without typing the password. Some apps have sudo functionality built-in, and that's why you get the dialog asking for your password. From a security standpoint, it is generally very dangerous to execute a program with more privileges than it needs, and I'd advise using this as little as possible. <comment143077> Ok thanks for that. Yes I think it's definitely one to use sparingly! <comment257850> @Guy Hughes's solution works great for me.  To add a little bit more details, 1) instead of %admin (group), you can use your user-id (the output from `whoami`); 2) Use backslash to escape whitespace if there is any in the program path.  E.g. `/Applications/AnyConnect\ Secure\ Mobility\ Client.app/Contents/MacOS/AnyConnect\ Secure\ Mobility\ Client`.
