Use cron to screencapture on Mountain Lion <body> I want to set cron to capture the current desktop every hour:  precodescreencapture -Cd -tjpg ~/Desktop/screen-`date +"%Y%m%d-%H%M"`.jpg /code/pre  I tired this method but it seems doesn't work on Mountain Lion. I also tried Lingo but with no luck. Any ideas?  <answer69645> codecron/code behaves a bit differently than a standard prompt, which is why it's not doing what you're expecting. There are two issues with the command as is:  ul liBecause it doesn't parse the codePATH/code environment variable the same was as the shell, codecron/code doesn't know where codescreencapture/code is. You need to specify the full path, code/usr/sbin/screencapture/code./li liAs noted in the crontab(5) man page, codecron/code treats code%/code as a newline character:     Percent-signs (%) in the command, unless escaped with backslash (\), will be changed into newline characters, and all data after the first % will be sent to the command as standard input.   So you need to escape each code%/code with a code\/code to get your desired result./li /ul  This codecrontab/code entry will give you a screen capture every hour, on the hour:  precode0 * * * * /usr/sbin/screencapture -Cd -tjpg ~/Desktop/screen-`date +"\%Y\%m\%d-\%H\%M"`.jpg /code/pre  h3Cron Error Logging/h3  As an aside, if you're having issues with cron, check your system mail by running the codemail/code command in Terminal. It's not very obvious, but by default codecron/code sends error messages there that can provide a starting point to figuring out what's going wrong.
