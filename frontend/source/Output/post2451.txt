How do I Convert FLAC files to ALAC for iTunes? <body> I have a pretty large music library in FLAC, and I need to import it to my iTunes library somehow. I want to use the ALAC format to keep everything lossless so I can transcode to different lossy formats later if I need to.  <answer2453> Have a look at Max. Freeware and Open source. Has a GUI.  <answer92737> You could also use ffmpeg:  precodefor f in *.flac; do ffmpeg -i "$f" -c:a alac "${f%flac}m4a"; done find . -name \*.flac | parallel ffmpeg -i {} -c:a alac {.}.m4a /code/pre  It preserves common tags, but it doesn't currently preserve artwork.  <answer128694> Many people recommend installing "Fluke" to play FLAC in iTunes. I haven't tried it and not sure if this way works.  When i encountered this issue, i just followed a step by step guide to convert FLAC to iTunes supported formats like AIFF, MP3, etc  <answer128697> I'm a fan of XLD and since the original question was posed it gained the drag-and-drop folder capabilities that the person asking the question as after. No need to install Growl to get it to work. It also handles embedded images in FLAC files when doing the conversion and will keep them in the ALAC output files.  <comment2132> Exactly what I was looking for. Thanks <comment2139> Glad it worked for you. YW <comment53153> You may run into issues with Max crashing if you don't have Growl installed. Last time I had to install this, I had to get the source and compile it myself, but it may be fixed in the "dev" version (or even the "stable") by now. Just a heads up if you're getting any crashes. <comment108793> @ShaneHsu Obviously you did not read the question. <comment108794> It was quite dark. LOL My bad. <comment150757> Pretty sure you are getting downvoted here because the OP wants to convert to ALAC.  Your suggestion does not seem to solve that, or does it?
