Alternate to iPhone Configuration Utility for installing Certificates? <body> I need to install .cer certificate on iPhone to enable certain SSL connections to websites.  I have searched and found that this was possible using strongiPhone Configuration Utility/strong, but that has been discontinued now.  Also tried using strongApple Configurator 2/strong, but I can not figure out how to install a .cer using it.  I am using iPhone 6S having iOS 9.2.1  <answer228248> In Apple Configurator 2, choose File â†’ New Profile. Fill out the General section and add your certificate to the Certificates section. Connect your device and choose the profile you just created to apply to the device.
