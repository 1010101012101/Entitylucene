Outlook Express 5.0 Mac Edition - Gmail SMTP Is Not Working <body> We have Outlook Express 5.0 on Mac OS 9 and we are trying to set it up to send and receive emails via Gmail.  Receiving emails via POP works fine but sending emails via SMTP fails.  We are getting some authentication error but we are 100% sure the username and password are correct.  We are doing what is explained in the Google Apps tutorial.  smtp.gmail.com Use Authentication: Yes Port for SSL: 465  Does someone know what could be wrong?
