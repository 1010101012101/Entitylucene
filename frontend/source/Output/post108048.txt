View App Store Download Progress (Downloading Maverick) <body> I'm downloading Mavericks on my Lion, but I don't know how to see the progress. When I go to the purchases tab on the app store, I see a blank button:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/sTjE9.png" alt="Purchases"  <answer108052> ol liTry rebooting./li liQuit App Store, open Launchpad, find the partial download of Mavericks installer and click it. This usually resumes a download that was interrupted/paused./li liReset App Store by clicking Reset Application from the debug menu, then reboot and try again.  subYou can enable the debug menu by running the following command:/sub  precodedefaults write com.apple.appstore ShowDebugMenu -bool true /code/pre/li /ol  <answer108066> It turned out, that it was a 'hidden' purchase, and I had to go to my account and unhide it.  Thanks to this answer.  <answer139572> Go to AppStore and click on Updates at the top.. You will find it.. Simple!!  <comment126712> Thanks for the help, but it didn't work. In fact, after I rebooted, I couldn't find the partial download. <comment126723> Hmm, it's still not working. Event after resetting the app via debug menu and rebooting, the same thing (pic in original post) happens. <comment126725> Open Activity Monitor and select the Network tab at the far right. Does it show any signs of any sustained network traffic in the Data received/sec display (green line)? If not, then its not downloading. <comment164527> Welcome to Ask Different!
