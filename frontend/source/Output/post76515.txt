Delete all calendars and contacts in iOS <body> I'd like to delete all calendars and contacts on an iPod Touch with iOS 5.0.1 without affecting calendars and contacts in OS X.  I've read guides that instruct to disable calendars for accounts in order to delete calendars. In my case none of my accounts have ever had calendars enabled. Calendars have only been transferred by cable using iTunes.  Can this be done without a third party app? If not, what would be needed to accomplish it?  <answer76529> Delete an Existing Calendar :  ul liIn iPhone Calendar, tap on the strongCalendars/strong button at the top-left of the iPhone Calendar display./li liTap on the strongEdit/strong button at the emtop-left/em of the Calendars display./li liTap on the calendar you wish to delete./li liemScroll to reveal/em the strongDelete Calendar/strong button at the bottom of the Edit Calendar display and tap on it./li liemConfirm/em the deletion by tapping on strongDelete Calendar/strong in the confirmation display./li liTap Done at the top-left of the Edit Calendars display./li liTap Done at the top-right of the Calendars display to return to the main display./li /ul  hr  Delete a contact :   ul listrongSelect/strong the contact's name. /li liClick on the strong"edit"/strong button in the upper right hand corner.  /li listrongScroll down/strong and select delete./li /ul  If you want to delete contacts strongin bulk/strong you can use these apps :  ul liPaid : ul lihttps://itunes.apple.com/us/app/contactdel-delete-multiple/id399148990?mt=8 /li lihow to : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHn6ABEDk1o/li /ul/li liFree :  ul liDownload the app strong'Groups'/strong by Qbix/li liLink : https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/groups/id407855546?mt=8/li liAs soon as you open the groups app it has all your contacts./li liYou can tap multiple contacts (a red dot to the left of each one) and then at the top on the right there is a little white arrow that says "actions"./li liTap on that &amp; you can delete, copy, or e-mail all of the selected contact at once. /li /ul/li /ul  <comment88777> Thanks. That worked. Now only the contacts remain to be dealt with. <comment88877> Edited the post how to delete a contact. Hope this works for you. <comment88882> Thanks. Is there not a way to do this without purchasing an app? <comment88884> Yes there is : see edit. <comment88942> Excellent. It was even easier as there was a **Select All** option. I feel gratitude for your help.
