Problems with AirPort on Snow Leopard (MacBook White) <body> Several days ago I performed a clean installation of Snow Leopard on my MacBook White (late 2009). As usual, everything works marvelous - strongexcept for the wireless connection to the internet/strong.  It strongkeeps dropping the connection after several seconds/strong. If I restart AirPort it works for several seconds, then it drops it again.  I played with the settings of AirPort and discovered, that every time the connection drops (I click on a link and the browser seems to load forever and nothing happens) I just have to strongrefresh the "DHCP-Lease"/strong (under TCP/IP) and the browser fires again.  Does someone know what is wrong here?  Thanks for any help.  To get rid of this annoying problem I am thinking about reinstalling Snow Leopard again, but it would be more comfortable not to have to do that, since it is tedious.
