Yosemite Photos: How to select only photos <body> Photos Version 1.0.1 (215.65.0) I can't seem to see anywhere inside Photos to filter items by file type.  No detail/list view like in Finder for me to sort and select. Search with, for example code*.JPG/code in the search box of Photos does not return anything. It does not seem to understand wildcards  <answer198851> To do so, you can create strongSmart Albums/strong  These can be set to filter based on filetype.  You can set as many of these as you wish, and even modify existing ones.  In strongPhotos/strong go to strongFile  New Smart Album/strong or kbd⌘/kbd+kbd⌥/kbd+kbdN/kbd  Then you can set your filter criteria in several ways.  See the attached screenshot illustrating a PNG filter.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/12X0z.png" alt="Photos filter by filetype"  strongUPDATE:/strong If you choose to use the Search field, enter just "jpg" without quotes to get a dropdown that shows filetype.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gOJjq.png" alt="jpg search"  <comment238118> So, do you want to _filter_ or _sort_? Reason I ask is that the Photo's app supports **Smart Albums** but these filter based on criteria. <comment238119> @bjbk I usually sort by file type and then select the files of the same type (i.e. JPG). So I guess both filter and sort, but the net effect is filter <comment238121> I overlooked the `Smart Album` for this purpose. <comment238123> This method dynamically updates as well. Not a quick solution, but can really help to narrow things down. <comment238124> See my updated answer regarding using the Search field. <comment238125> I think the interface is misleading: On the sidebar, there are: Photos, All Photos, Faces, Last Import, and Videos. I can select all videos by clicking "Videos" so I expect "Photos" gives me only photos. <comment238126> Those are built in smart folders.  Yeah, takes time to wrap our heads around new interfaces. <comment238127> Thanks for the update about search box. Seriously, you have 10k photos in Photos :) <comment238128> Those are just the jpgs.  Lots of history in there. ;-)
