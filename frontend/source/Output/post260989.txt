MacBook Pro login screen stuck keeps pressing a key into password field forever <body> My MacBook Pro (mid 2014, Sierra 10.12.1) sometimes gets stuck after waking up after sleep. Some key seems to have stuck and keeps pressing into the password field forever, filling the password field and making me unable to type anything in. If I select all/delete, it refills again immediately, just like I'm pressing and holding a key on the keyboard. I've pressed all the keys as maybe OS thinks one is stuck, hoping that it will fix, but pressing all keys didn't work either. The only solution for me is to restart (and even if I press esc to sleep again, it immediately wakes up in a second as its "pressing" a key), if I close the lid, wait a minute, and open it again, it's still the same.  If I restart, I lose the work inside my apps. Usually nothing serious, but sometimes I've got apps open doing work in the background etc (e.g. batch image processing, neural net training, or any stuff that I can't save properly until the end) and they are all gone. This happens rarely, but when it happens, it causes me to lose data.  Why would this happen and how can I prevent this?  <answer260993> Have you tried resetting your computer's System Management Controller (SMC)?  strongFor your particular MacBook Pro, here’s what you do:/strong  ol liShut down your computer/li liKeep the MagSafe adapter (power cable) strongplugged in/strong./li liPress at the same time kbdshift/kbdkbdoption/kbdkbdcontrol/kbd (on the left side of the keyboard) strongemand/em/strong the kbdpower button/kbd/li liLet go/li liTurn your computer back on with the power button./li /ol  Also, another thing worth doing is resetting your NVRAM.   strongTo reset your NVRAM do this:/strong  ol listrongShut down your machine./strong Yes, a full shut down, not just logging out./li listrongPress the kbdpower button/kbd emand then/em press the kbdcommand/kbdkbdoption/kbdkbdp/kbdkbdr/kbd keys./strong You have to make sure you press these keys before the gray screen appears or it won’t work./li listrongHold those keys down/strong until your Mac reboots again and you here the startup chime./li listrongLet go of the keys and let your Mac reboot normally./strong/li /ol  strongNote:/strong When you log back in you strongemmay/em/strong need to readjust some of your system preferences (e.g. mouse speed, time and date/timezone, etc).  <comment326757> Can you try the following and report back on how each goes? (1) What happens if you connect an external Keyboard? (2) Does starting in Safe Mode display the same behaviour? (To start in safe mode hold down the shift key while you boot up the computer). (3) Does a hardware test report anything (to do this hold down the D key while booting up the computer). <comment326758> @Monomeeth 1) I don't have an external keyboard (and I don't know anyone who has one), but I had just plugged in my Bluetooth earbuds for charging into the USB port before waking it up, if it makes any sense. 2) Well, because this problem occurs rarely and goes away after a restart, I can't really test that. 3) I'll have a look at hardware test soon, maybe that will catch something, but again, I doubt it as my computer (and keyboard) works perfectly otherwise. <comment326759> In that case, it'd definitely be worth resetting your SMC. Also for good measure, you could reset your NVRAM as well.
