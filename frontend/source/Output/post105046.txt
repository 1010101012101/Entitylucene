What is "AddressBookUrlForwarder"? <body> Today I clicked a link on Facebook and a dialogue window gave me the message:     "The link needs to be opened with an application.  Send to:br   strongAddressBookUrlForwarder/strong   Upon examining the link, it had the format:     fb://photo/12345678?set=blahblahlblah   I've never seen a browser link with the "fb://" protocol before and certainly never heard of "AddressBookUrlForwarder".  So I did a finder search and came up with nothing.  Then I did a Locate search from terminal and found:     /System/Library/CoreServices/AddressBookUrlForwarder.app   So I open "/System/Library/CoreServices/" in finder and that app doesn't show up.  But it's definitely there.  Thinking it must have some extended attributes or ACL I do an "ls-lae@" in the coreservices directory and for all intents and purposes it appears to be a normal .app directory with no @ or + or anything special to hide it from the Finder.  What the heck is going on?  What is this app?  Why is it not showing up in Finder?  What is an "fb://" protocol link?  I'm creeped out now.  Also, I'm using 10.8.4.  <answer105047> I'm guessing that this application is used to retrieve Facebook and Twitter contact details for display in the address book.  This assumption is based on release notes for a recent update of Mac OS X, as well as the content of that application's executable (as viewed with codestrings/code):  precodestrings /System/Library/CoreServices/AddressBookUrlForwarder.app/Contents/MacOS/AddressBookUrlForwarder`). /code/pre  The output of codestrings/code makes me think that the application is a URL handler for these expressions:  precode... _urlPatterns http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=$1 fb://profile/(.*) http://twitter.com/$1 twitter:///user[?]screen_name=(.+) http://twitter.com/share?text=$1 twitter:///post[?]message=(.+) ... /code/pre  Do you have a Facebook account setup in System Preferences - Mail, Contacts &amp; Calendars?  <comment123590> No I don't have a facebook account setup in system preferences.  Sounds like a good guess but still doesn't explain why it's not showing up in finder.
