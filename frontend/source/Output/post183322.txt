Photo captions not showing up on photos when viewed slideshow mode in Photos.app <body> The captions I added to my photos in iPhoto are not showing up when I play slideshows in Photo. I can still see that the information is there when I click on a photo's Info in the album view.  Is there a way to have the captions show up in slideshow mode in Photos.app?  <answer184624> There are no settings for this, and it does not appear to be possible.  This is further confirmed by MacWorld's article on "4 things iPhoto can do that Photos can't (yet)".
