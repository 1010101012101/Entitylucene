After entering password Mac shuts down <body> I am using strongMacBook Air 13"/strong with strongmacOS Sierra/strong.  I am facing with this problem for the first time, never had any issues with my MacBook before for almost 3 years.   I turned on my MacBook, picked my user, entered password and progress bar started loading, it filled for about 3/4 and laptop shut down. This happens every time I try to login into my user. However, I am able to login as a strongemGuest/em/strong.  I turned it on with codeCmd + S/code buttons and saw a message :br codeBuildError(): error building a user of type 0x20010008/code  brstrongQuestion:/strongbr I am hoping this is not a strongemhardware issue/em/strong. If it is a strongemsoftware issue/em/strong I have no problems reinstalling my macOS, but how do I save all my data/files that I have? (I am not using TimeMachine)  <answer265019> Okay, so after some searching/googling I found that all problems that I had was because of strongFileVault bug that makes your OS pause/freeze at login/strong.  This FileVault bug first was seen on strongMac OS X Yosemite/strong, I do not know why I faced with this issue on strongmacOS Sierra/strong, which must work perfectly, but nvm, here is my solution.  hr  h1Solutions/h1  em(Works if your FileVault is turned ON, if not, it may be hardware issue)/em br  When you supply a password for your account at login screen your OS starts to unlock the disk. Unfortunately in some cases this process seems to be hindered by some bug with FileVault 2 setups that prevents their systems from immediately unlocking and loading the OS, so their systems now take up to several minutes to log in, or fail to log in as in my case.  h3Solution 1 - If your OS loads for a long time/h3  Ensure you have a strongfull backup/strong of your Mac using Time Machine.  ul liGo to codeFileVault/code tab in the codeSecurity &amp; Privacy/code system preferences and turn off FileVault. /li liWhen FileVault is disabled and your drive is decrypted, restart your Mac./li liHold the kbdCommand/kbd-kbdR/kbd keys down at the boot chimes to load your Mac into Recovery Mode./li liOpen codeDisk Utility/code and use it to run a codeRepair Disk/code routine, available in the codeFirst Aid/code tab when you select your hard drive. Do this for both the hard drive device, and your boot volume./li liRestart your Mac normally and log in./li liRe-enable codeFileVault/code in the codeSecurity &amp; Privacy/code system preferences./li /ul  h3Solution 2 - If you can't login and stuck watching progress bar loading forever/h3  The above routine works for if you can eventually boot your Mac in the face of this bug, but if you cannot log in and see the system hang on the loading progress bar for hours with no ability to use your system, then you will have to use another procedure:  ul liReboot your system and hold the kbdCommand/kbd-kbdR/kbd keys at the startup chimes to load into codeRecovery Mode/code./li liUse codeDisk Utility/code to turn off encryption on your boot drive. If this gives you errors, then reboot in codeTarget Disk Mode/code (hold the kbdT/kbd key at the boot chimes) and use codeDisk Utility/code on another Mac via a strongThunderbolt/strong or strongFirewire cable/strong to turn off encryption. Alternatively, you can try booting to codeInternet Recovery/code by holding kbdOption/kbd-kbdCommand/kbd-kbdR/kbd at the boot chimes, which will avoid using your internal drive for any boot purposes./li liWith your drive unlocked and decrypted, use codeDisk Utility/code to verify and repair your boot drive./li liRestart your Mac normally./li liUse the codeSecurity &amp; Privacy/code system preferences to re-enable codeFileVault/code./li /ul  <comment332219> Have you tried to just reinstalling macOS. <comment332225> @IronCraftMan I can do it, but the best case for me would be to copy all the data from my hard drive or to be able to save it, and then reinstall macOS <comment332237> I really hope this will help someone, so no one will stuck as I did. And **always** have backup of your system, it can save you a lot of time. <comment332240> reinstalling won't make you loose all your data. It's just like updating the system, instead you're installing the same update. You'd need to go into disk utility to actually erase all your data. <comment332241> @Blank I had an issue with none of my dictation commands working on Sierra.  Apple tech support suggested to reinstall Sierra.  I did what they suggested and the reinstallation left all of my files in tact.  It just reinstalled all the operating system files. There was no need to copy my data from the hard drive. I wasn't too concerned about it anyway because I have Time Machine backups
