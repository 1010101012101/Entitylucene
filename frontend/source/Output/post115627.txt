Can't install any app, App Store asks for credit card <body> I haven't been installing anything on my iPad Mini for the past few weeks. But previously, I just had to tap on "Install", enter my Apple ID password and go.  Now, for every new application, even those free ones, I have to confirm each time, that I'm 17 or over. And then App Store asks to enter my credit card information. If I disagree and hit "Cancel", installation process is interrupted and I can't install any application, even free one.  I don't trust Apple at all and I'm not willing to share my credit card information, especially that I'm installing only free applications.  I'm pretty sure that I haven't changed anything in the configuration of my iPad Mini for ages.   Am I missing some significant change to the App Store or this is some kind of bug or virus? Is there anything I can do in this situation? How can I install a free application from the App Store, without having to share my credit card information with Apple?  <answer115628> You need to select that you don't have/want a payment option.  ol liOpen strongSettings/strong → strongiTunes &amp; App Stores/strong/li liTap strongView Apple ID/strong → strongPayment Information/strong/li liSelect strongNone/strong as the payment type/li /ol  hr  If you're not able to select None or the None option is not present for you to select, there are some possible reasons as to why this is the case:  ul liUnpaid balance/li liChanged country/region/li liFamily Sharing management/li /ul  For more information, see the Apple KB article:  ul liWhy can’t I select None when I edit my Apple ID payment information?/li /ul  If you want to create a new Apple ID with None as the payment method, purchase a free app from the App Store and choose Create Apple ID.

This does solve my problem. However, your answer does not explain, why do I have to change these settings? I haven't changed this before ever. Has something changed in iOS? Why it suddenly started to require payment information without any change from my side? <comment135310> @trejder I'm not sure either — I did this once when I created one of my Apple IDs and have never had to do it again, so I'm not sure why it switched seemingly randomly. <comment137686> Where is this **Settings - iTunes & App Stores** to be found? I've checked in **System Settings**, but such an option is missing. <comment137703> @user569825 Settings.app on your iOS device → iTunes & App Stores <comment143259> @grgarside Is there any way to do this from a MacBook instead of from an iOS device? Considering I don't have one of those. <comment143261> @Pepijn Yes — go to iTunes → Account → Payment and select None. <comment143645> @grgarside I've tried this recently, and I can confirm that it doesn't work for the App Store. The only way to get the "None" option is to create a new account from *within* the App Store *while* attempting to install a free App.
