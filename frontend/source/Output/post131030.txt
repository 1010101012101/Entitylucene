How to map Option+X but not change Option+Shift+X in KeyRemap4Macbook? <body> I want to map Option+X to something. But this mapping effects Option+Shift+X key binding as a side effect. Is there a way to prevent it?  Here is an example mapping that I use:  precode&lt;item&gt;     &lt;name&gt;movement home&lt;/name&gt;     &lt;identifier&gt;private.movehome&lt;/identifier&gt;     &lt;not&gt;VIRTUALMACHINE&lt;/not&gt;     &lt;autogen&gt;         --KeyToKey--         KeyCode::C,ModifierFlag::OPTION_L,         KeyCode::CURSOR_LEFT,ModifierFlag::FN     &lt;/autogen&gt; &lt;/item&gt; /code/pre  <answer131033> precode&lt;autogen&gt;   __KeyToKey__   KeyCode::C, VK_OPTION | ModifierFlag::NONE,   KeyCode::CURSOR_LEFT, ModifierFlag::FN &lt;/autogen&gt; /code/pre  The use of code| ModifierFlag::NONE/code prevents other key combinations from being remapped.  <answer131034> Try strongSystem Preferences - Keyboard - Modifier Keys -/strong Change whatever..  or  Try strongSystem Preferences - Keyboard - Shortcuts/strong?  Hope I helped??  <comment153794> Can you expand on your solution? What do you mean by '*Change whatever*'? How does changing shortcuts disable remapping of a third key in KeyRemap4MacBook as was the original intent of the question? <comment153797> well he didnt explain really just tagged "keyboard" and asked to change shortcut.. thats how i understood it.. no need to downvote.. vote every other answer down to make yours rise.. thats pathetic kiddo! :)
