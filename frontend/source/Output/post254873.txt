IR remote stops working with Yosemite <body> OS: 10.11.6 Hardware: Mac Mini5,1  Most of the time the IR works just fine.  Now I'm a "command line" freak.  I typically have iTunes running, and control it via applescript. I also control DVD Player via scripts.  So a sequence of commands might be  precodeosascript -e 'tell application "iTunes" to pause' osascript -e 'tell application "DVD Player" to open VIDEO_TS posix file "/path/to/vob"' /code/pre  And this works well.  But emsometimes/em DVD Player stops responding to the remote control.  I can still control it via script (codeosascript -e 'tell application "DVD Player" to pause dvd'/code), but the IR remote... nothing.  I quit DVD Player, and try with iTunes... still no IR response.  If I then emreboot/em the machine starts working normally; the IR is recognised and continues to work as expected... until some time in the future when it stops.  It's almost as if something has started to "steal" the IR data, but I can't work out a specific sequence to trigger the event.  It emseems/em to be mostly triggered via the DVD Player app.  What could be the reason for the IR remote to stop working?  Is there a work around, beyond a reboot?
