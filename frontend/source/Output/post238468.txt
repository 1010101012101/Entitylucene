Uploading a minor new build must wait for review every time? <body> I just fixed a few bugs and minor things after the initial version of an application was released into the app store. I've uploaded the binary to iTunesConnect but I see nowhere to change over the build version. Is it correct that every time a new version/build(1.0.1 - 1.0.2) is uploaded it has to go through review?  <answer238469> As soon as an App has been already reviewed, uploading a new binary requires a new revision.  Extracted from Apple's Replacing your App with a New Version:     You will only be able to add a new version for a new platform or a platform that has a Ready for Sale or Developer Removed from Sale version. strongIf a platform version has not completed the app review process—it has a status such as Prepare For Submission or Waiting For Review—you can replace the build in the existing version instead of adding a new version./strong    <answer238470> Yes.  Apple requires that every new build, regardless of how small, go thru the App Review processes.  If you have a bad bug and need to get a fix out there quickly, you can request an expedited review.
