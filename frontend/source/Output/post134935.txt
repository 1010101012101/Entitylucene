Late 2013 MacBook Pro Retina + 2 Thunderbolt displays + Apple Cinema Display @2560x1440? <body> I saw this answer by griewei here: https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/124479/81640  Unfortunately I don't have enough rep to comment.  What I would like to do is something similar e.g.  - one latest greatest Mac Book Pro Retina  - 2x Thunderbolt Displays  - 1 Apple Cinema Display via HDMI adapter etc.  @griewei said he was doing this and it was working; does anyone know if the Apple Cinema display is scaled at 2560 x 1440 in this configuration?  I know it was not possible in Mountain Lion but I heard it was possible in Mavericks  Thanks!  <answer275886> This is my current setup with a late 2013 MacBook Pro img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Wd1Kp.png" alt="enter image description here"
