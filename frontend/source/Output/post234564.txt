Updating my 3GS from iOS 4.1 to 6.1.6 <body> Is there a way i can upgrade my iPhone 3GS from iOS 4.1 to 6.1.6 without using a computer?  <answer234613> In short, no.  OTA [Over the Air] updates are only available on devices that shipped with iOS 5 or later.br Your only alternative is a computer running iTunes.

Even if you can do that I don't know if it's a good idea, it might run slow and still won't work with new apps. How about getting a 5S, those are pretty inexpensive now. <comment286800> Your best option is getting a 5s and making it last until iOS 12-13 comes out, and then you can get the iPhone 9s
