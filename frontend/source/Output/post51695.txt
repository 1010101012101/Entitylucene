Repair iPod music database <body> I have an iPod Nano (5th generation). Recently I decided to stop using iTunes for synchronizing my music. So I started uploading songs with Foobar2000. This has caused some songs to be on my iPod twice, after which I decided to manually delete them with a duplicate file scanner.  Now the internal music database seems to be corrupted. According to this database the deleted songs are still on the iPod. When it encounters these deleted songs while playing music, it will skip the song, but still show its info on the screen.  How do I fix this database? Is there any way to make the software scan my iPod to properly update this table? Preferably without using iTunes.  I'm using Windows 7 64bit, if it makes any difference.  <comment59070> Any specific reason you don't want to use iTunes? It might be a bloated piece of software but for managing songs on an iDevice it works well enough. <comment59072> Exactly because it's a bloated piece of software. I just find Foobar a lot easier to listen music with. It also doesn't nag for updates all the time. <comment59077> Well, you jailbreak your phone, you use an alternative tool to manage your music which means there is always some risk involved. The fastest way to get back into a sane state is probably a full reset of your iPod.
