Parallels Desktop 12 - Disable Time Sync <body> Is there any way to disable the time sync on Parallels Desktop 12 ? Whenever I resume my VM - certain tools I have running see the time change and immediately kick into high gear to update themselves and I'd like to prevent that.  <answer254132> In the VM configuration, go to strongOptions/strong â†’ strongMore Options/strong and set strongTime/strong to strongDo not sync/strong.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uakyD.png" alt=""  <comment316316> What's the VM's operating system? <comment316336> This is not always a reliable solution. I experienced some strange behavior like increasing the hour by one every minute in the guest if I didn't disable/unload Parallels' timesync daemon (i.e OS X)/service in the vm itself. <comment316938> There it is - thanks - I'll give it a try
