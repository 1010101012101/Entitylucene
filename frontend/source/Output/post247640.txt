Recommendations on launching applications and setting up workspace based on location? <body> When moving between locations (work, home, coffeeshops...) I find that I have to manually set up things how I like them over an over. Is there an application that will automatically launch emand position/em my applications when I am at a specific location, or select a preset "workspace"?  strongStay/strong, and strongControlPlane/strong seem to scratch the surface of what I want but are BOTH out of date. Launching apps and positioning windows on particular desktops in a specific monitor configuration is priority.  <answer247752> For this problem, I use https://github.com/jigish/slate, as this allows to position windows based on the current monitor configuration which is currently attached. The monitor configuration can be recognised by the resolutions of the the screens. A simple example with configurations for "laptop+external monitor" and "laptop only":   precode# Configs config defaultToCurrentScreen true config menuBarIconHidden true config checkDefaultsOnLoad true  # Monitor Aliases alias mon-extern 1920x1080 alias mon-laptop 1280x800  # Concrete positions alias 0-mail        move screenOriginX;screenOriginY       screenSizeX;screenSizeY          ${mon-extern} alias 1-mail        move screenOriginX+0.17*screenSizeX;screenOriginY       0.83*screenSizeX;screenSizeY         ${mon-laptop}  # layouts layout 2monitor 'Calendar':REPEAT              ${1-mail} layout 1monitor 'Calendar':REPEAT               ${0-mail}  # Default Layouts default 2monitor resolutions:${mon-laptop};${mon-extern}; default 1monitor  resolutions:${mon-laptop} /code/pre  This will move the window of codemail/code from full screen to part of the screen. But see the documentation of the program for more features and examples.  <comment305733> Why do you say ControlPlane is out of date? It was last released in February. <comment305759> The page I was reading claimed only Yosemite compatibility, perhaps I am incorrect. <comment305761> It's running fine for me on macOS Sierra dp3, and I've had no problems on El Cap.
