Removing an Add-in from Office 2016 for Mac <body> I have the same problem as user916499 had here earlier on, posted here: Remove Add-in from Office 2016 for Mac  Trying to remove the Add-In (Excel2LaTeX in my case), i did: -delete the .xla  -removed the check box -removed the Add-In from the list in Tools  Add-ins -reopened Excel -reinstalled Excel from scratch  Trying the solution proposed by Allan in the above thread, I found that the Add-In doesn't appear in the insert  add-in  my add-ins pop-up window.  Still, the Add-In is still appearing both in the Add-In ribbon (although obviously not functioning anymore), as well as in the VBA editor. I'd now like to remove it completely from Excel, since it didn't function properly in the first place and I plan on redoing the installation process.  Thank you for your help.
