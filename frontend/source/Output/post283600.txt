Tiling window managers with emacs style keychains <body> h1Context/h1  I use codei3wm/code on linux and am very happy with it.   I am afraid that at some point in my life someone is going to force me to use a mac, however, I so want to explore the space of alternatives. Also there are things that I do with i3 that I would like to suggest for other people who use macs.  Now, I don't really need a tiling window manager rather:   i. A way of tiling windows, and importantly  ii. A way of launching commands with "nice" keybindings (which basically means emacs-style keychains. (*vim * also supports this type of binding)  h1Question/h1  Is there an easy way to get tiling working on mac?  Is there a way to use emacs style keychains "C-x then A then B then C" to language arbitrary commands in mac.  h1Approaches considered/h1  I had a look at a couple of window managers  ul lislate, and /li liamethyst (CAN'T POST LINK - github ianyh Amethyst)/li /ul  came up. But a cursory inspection leads me to believe these don't support keychains.
