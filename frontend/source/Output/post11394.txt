How to mute the microphone on Key-Down and unmute it on Key-Up? <body> What I would like to have is:  ol liBy default the microphone should be strongmuted/strong/li liWhen kbdCapsLock/kbd is Down the microphone should strongunmute/strong/li liWhen kbdCapsLock/kbd is Up the microphone should strongmute/strong/li /ol  (Basically convert my Skype to act like a Walkie-talkie with a push-to-talk functionality)  I found the AppleScript that can change the volume input of the microphone, so the first step was easy, but I didn't find any way to even assign the kbdCapsLock/kbd to a script. Note that my kbdCapsLock/kbd key is turned off and I would't like to sTART experiencing something like tHIS.  If the kbdCapsLock/kbd is very special I wouldn't mind using another key, but I want to achieve the same functionality.  strongEdit/strong: Probably it is not really possible to do it without using any application, so if there is an app that can do that, it would also work for me.  <answer11545> First, the AppleScript that inspects the key state and handles the mic enabling and muting:  precodeif (modKeyDowntest()) then   tell application "System Events" to set volume input volume 100   repeat while modKeyDowntest()   end repeat   tell application "System Events" to set volume input volume 0 end if  on modKeyDowntest()   set modKeyDown to do shell script "~/opt/checkModifierKeys shift"   set modKeyDown to modKeyDown as integer   set modKeyDown to modKeyDown as boolean end modKeyDowntest /code/pre  Note, that  ul lithe script depends on the codecheckModifierKeys/code command line app (and it's path)./li liinspects the state of kbdshift/kbd instead of kbdcaps lock/kbd (other possibilities are kbdcmd/kbd, kbdoption/kbd, kbdcontrol/kbd and kbdcaps lock/kbd - kbdcaps lock/kbd, however, means the emstatus/em of caps lock, not the key state!)/li /ul  In the second step we bind the script to a key shortcut. There are many applications that can do this (some listed in an answer in SuperUser) or as an Automator service. (C&amp;P from Lri's answer...)     One more option is to save the script as an Automator service:      ul   liOpen Automator and choose the emService/em template./li   liemUtilities — Run Shell Script / Run AppleScript/em./li   liemService receives [no input] in [any application]/em./li   liAdd the script to the text area and save./li   liAssign a shortcut in emSystem Preferences — Keyboard — Keyboard Shortcuts — Services/em./li   /ul   So, I assigned kbdopt/kbd+kbdshift/kbd+kbdM/kbd to the script above and it enables the mic, keeping it unmuted as long as I hold kbdshift/kbd. The mic is muted again when I release kbdshift/kbd.  <answer11554> I have not used it, but Skii plugin for Skype, seems to provide what you're looking for:     Skii is a very easy to use and simple plug-in that uses the Skype API to simplify the Push-to-Talk function. The app gives the user the possibility to control the Skype Push-To-Talk function with just one button! a small utility that will definetly improve your Skype user experience but also your overall workflow.   <comment12079> Maybe this functionality could be added to the app/software you will use for recording. So, in which application you'll use it? <comment12080> There might be some CLI app to inspect the key state of caps lock, so checkModifierKeys could very well be replaced to make the script act on caps lock. <comment12081> And for this question the mute status is the opposite as needed, so invert the volumes to get the right functionality. <comment12087> @nuc Basically I want it to use it when I'm talking on Skype.. I want to use it as a walkie-talkie.. in order to talk you should press a button..! :) <comment12089> Thanks for that.. I don't have time now to test all these things.. but basically what I want is to use Skype as a Walkie-talkie... hold a key to talk..! So I would prefer one key like F5 or something if the CapsLock is out of the question :) <comment12302> even though the other is more wide and thats is what I asked.. i think I have to go with the other one :) thanks for the Skii.. <comment12304> Can you please update the answer to match the question as needed.. and I think that's the answer.. <comment12305> @lipis I would pick the other one as well :) <comment12390> Updated. And thanks. :-)
