Documenting Packet Loss on Corporate Network <body> If you suspected intermittent packet loss on a corporate network that you have no authority over, as an IT guy how would you irrefutably document it?  (you are on a Mac, so any *nix toolchain is possible).   Thanks  <answer110436> The answer depends on the topology of the network.    You can set off different sized pings to different hosts internally and externally, reset these every hour with a bash script, and copy the output to an hourly directory.  Analyse the output in excel, tweak via vim.  You may also try codetraceroute -I/code which will give you hops using ICMP echo instead of UDP.  <comment130089> This might be better on ServerFault
