Are there any other way to restart to recovery HD <body> I tried to restart while keep pressing Command-R  However, my keyboard is not mac keyboard. There is windows-R. It works exactly like Command-R in all circumstances.  Well, I keep failing to get into recovery HD. I need that because I want to repair the main disk.     Error: This disk needs to be repaired using the Recovery HD. Restart   your computer, holding down the Command key and the R key until you   see the Apple logo. When the OS X Utilities window appears, choose   Disk Utility.   What should I do?  I have a flash disk. Can I turn that into recovery HD?  <answer85001> Try this alternative way (explained at macworld.com):  ol liStart you Mac while pressing the kbdOption/kbd key (in your Windows keyboard press the kbdAlt/kbd key) until the Startup Manager appears:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/AwPiQ.png" alt="enter image description here"  One of the volumes will be called Recovery HD./li liSelect Recovery HD and then click the upward-pointing arrow below it to boot from Recovery HD. /li liAfter a brief delay, youâ€™ll see the Mac OS X Utilities screen. Select Disk Utility to repair your disk:/li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/j1gOO.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer278783> I had to power off and unplug the Mac Mini then hold down the kbdAlt/kbd key and start the Mini up that way and then it works.  Every time I install Sierra I can't log in and have to do this first.  <comment97879> The asker uses a Windows keyboard - shouldn't he use the ALT key there? <comment97880> @patrix Yes, added reference to Alt. <comment98104> There is a windows key too that function like command key but that one doesn't work. <comment98105> Thanks for mentioning that. For the method I describe you don't need the Windows key, but the Alt key. Did you have a chance to test it? <comment98405> I did. And it still doesn't work. <comment98406> It looks like the whole keyboard is not detected until restart and by that time it's too late. In windows I can restart to something else or something. <comment99407> Too bad... Is it by any chance a wireless keyboard? Could you post keyboard manufacturer and model? Have you installed any keyboard drivers? <comment99594> It's USB. Also I changed keyboard again. It still doesn't work. <comment106466> I could get hold of a PC keyboard (HP USB keyboard model number KU-0316), restarted my Mac while holding down the Alt key and it booted into the Startup Manager as shown in the screenshot above. Which is the keyboard manufacturer and model you are using?
