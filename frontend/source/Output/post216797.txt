Applescript - Getting Property of an Object Not Working <body> The dictionary for Messages states that the application has a "chat" element which has the property "updated". My goal is to get this property, and here is my code:  precodetell application "Messages"     set _chat_ to get first chat     set _date_ to updated of _chat_ end tell /code/pre  When I run this, I get the error:  precodeMessages got an error: Canâ€™t get updated of text chat id "iMessage;-;+&lt;someone's phone number&gt;". /code/pre  This seems like a very basic thing, and yet it doesn't work. What am I doing wrong?  <answer216991> This does not work because the AppleScript support in Messages.app is broken.
