Why does my ipad music player automatically stop playing a song? <body> When I play music using the default music player app, songs automatically stop playing after 5 minutes or so.  It will stop in the middle of a song.   How do I prevent this from happening?  I set the ipad to never sleep already, but this is still a problem.  This didn't use to be a problem at one time.  I'm not sure why it became a problem all of a sudden.  <comment113243> Is it playing song files saved onto the iPad itself? Or is it doing some streaming/downloading, like with iTunes Match? <comment113278> I downloaded it.  I don't have wifi or internet connection, so i'm sure it's not a connection issue since it can play without it. <comment113316> It may be that not all of the song was downloaded. Were these tracks bought from iTunes?
