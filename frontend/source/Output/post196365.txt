Guest user randomly created on my Mac, after setting up Find My Mac <body> How do I disable the guest user? Is there a reason why it gets created? It won't mess up any of my files or data on my computer right? Is find my Mac suppose to randomly create it?  <answer196369> With Find My Mac enabled, someone who found the computer could sign into the guest user, which could then be located via iCloud. The guest user is a feature of the operating system which allows people to temporarily use your computer but not save any files.  You can go into Users&amp;Groups System Preferences and disable it, for more details see this article   Just make sure emyou/em don't sign into it and expect files you save to still be there after restarting the computer :)  <comment234545> The creation is not random, it's intentional. You choose whether or not to enable it in sys prefs/user accounts
