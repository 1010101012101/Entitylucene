How to disable OS X installer on boot? <body> strongTL;DR/strong br/ Have a MacBook Pro with (probably) bad GPU. br/ Tried to install Yosemite OS X - after reboot, it hangs up on grey screen. br/ strongIs there a way to disable Yosemite OS X (or any other) installer on boot from Single User Mode/strong? br/ br/ Specs: MacBook Pro 15", Early 2011, Intel Core i7 Processor 2GHz, AMD Radeon 6490M, Mountain Lion. br/  Prehistory: a week ago my Pro went black screen while I was running some graphic excessive application through Wine.  I've tried rebooting, restoring PRAM, rebooting with kbdShift/kbd, kbdAlt/Opt/kbd, kbdCmd/kbd+kbdR/kbd, kbdCmd/kbd+kbdV/kbd, etc but nothing helped - my screen either hanged up on grey or blue screens and nothing further would happen.  After lots of search, I've found lots of threads about the same GPU problems in Macbook Pro's 2011. Solution from this thread helped me to load OS X. br/   Solution that helped me: br/ Booted with Single User Mode kbdCmd/kbd+kbdS/kbd.br/ Executed the following:  precode/sbin/fsck -fy / /sbin/mount -uw / mkdir /Disabled_System_Library_Extensions cd /Disabled_System_Library_Extensions mv /System/Library/Extensions/ATI* . mv /System/Library/Extensions/AMD* . touch /System/Library/Extensions exit /code/pre  But the graphics were terrible and in System Preferences I could see that I always have external display attached (for some reason, yet I didn't) and I couldn't change brightness. I couldn't see my laptop's screen in System Preferences.   I've also downloaded gfxCardStatus but I couldn't change to using Integrated video card only because system would find External Display attached and there was none of it. br/ Note: when my Pro crashed, there was no external monitor attached to it.   I had Yosemite OS X installer downloaded before and decided to give it a go and try to do clean install. I've started the installer, my MacBook rebooted, I saw apple logo, install status (grey line filling up) underneath it, it filled up a little bit and then went to grey screen again. After that I've tried rebooting with every mode that I know but nothing helped - I would get either grey or blue screen again.  Now every time I start my Pro it starts installer and hangs on grey screen. br/ I can only run Single User Mode without getting grey/blue screen. br/ Is there a way to disable Yosemite OS X installer on boot from Single User Mode? br/ br/  <comment183682> try http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/120507/boot-hangs-on-grey-screen-even-when-booting-from-usb-drive-with-fresh-os-x-inst?lq=1 <comment183684> I've actually used this solution and even linked that post in my question but it's already beyond that. It was working after moving those extensions but since graphics were terrible I've decided to do a clean install. That led to being not able to boot to my OS Mountain Lion (that I have at the moment) anymore but only to OS X Yosemite Installer that failed after reboot.
