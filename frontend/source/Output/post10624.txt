Mac music tagging software <body> Since the switch from Windows to Mac, I've been looking for a good music tagging application for Mac OS X.   I've tried apps such as Tagalicious, TriTag and a few other apps, but none have made me happy so far. Basically I'm looking for something similar to Mp3Tag (which is Windows only).  Just asking before I consider starting an open source project and do this on my own.  <answer10631> Here are a few options:  ul liMediaRage: http://www.chaoticsoftware.com/ProductPages/MediaRage.html/li liTuneUp: http://www.tuneupmedia.com/index.php/li liPollux: http://polluxapp.com//li /ul  You may also want to take a look at http://osx.iusethis.com/search?order=users&amp;q=id3  <answer10658> I've mostly used TriTag or temporary AppleScripts like this:  precodetell application "iTunes"     repeat with t in selection         --set AppleScript's text item delimiters to "-"         --set ti to text items of n         --set track number of t to item 1 of ti         --set artist of t to item 2 of ti         --set album of t to item 3 of ti         --set name of t to item 4 of ti         --set name of t to (get track number of t)         --set name of t to my titlecase(get name of t)     end repeat end tell  on titlecase(x)     do shell script "ruby -Ku -rubygems -e 'require \"titlecase\"; print STDIN.read.chomp.titlecase' &lt;&lt;&lt; " &amp; quoted form of x without altering line endings end titlecase  on replace(input, x, y)     set text item delimiters to x     set ti to text items of input     set text item delimiters to y     ti as text end replace  on split(input, x)     if input does not contain x then return {input}     set text item delimiters to x     text items of input end split /code/pre  <comment11135> what type of tagging you want? to correct Mp3 ID3 tag? <comment11136> Yes. But it would be awesome to be able to edit tags for any other format too (e.g. FLAC). <comment11137> so ckeck this: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/10522/identify-and-tag-music-from-itunes-library-under-os-x/10525#10525 <comment11178> Thanks, but perhaps it is not much more convenient than using a dedicate application?
