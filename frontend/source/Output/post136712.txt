Set up NTP server on iOS device <body> How can I make an iOS device a NTP server ? The reason for this is, the network of devices I have don't have internet connection but are connected via Wifi. So just want to create a device as a server and let others to associate themselves to it.  <answer136714> I'll quote two answers from Stack Overflow with the hope that it will help you figure out what you're trying to do.  hr  There's a small iOS library named ios-ntp. I have used it in one project in the past and it seemed to work reasonably well.  As of mid 2013 the original ios-ntp project has a few missing pieces, so I have mirrored the original svn repository to github. You can checkout out a working version of the code here: https://github.com/jessedc/iOS-ntp  Source  hr  If you're not developing a commercial application, peek at the linux source.  http://packages.ubuntu.com/source/lucid/ntp  Source  hr  Thread source  <answer288956> Just use dns to intercept requests to time.apple.com and point to a local Linux or raspi serving ntp.  Of course, you will need to set up a dns for this to work.  <comment162280> Thanks for the response, but i have seen them already and they doesn't seem to solve my purpose. The ios-ntp library makes us get the time through the standard time servers, however I need to create a ntp server of my own because I don't have access to internet. Want to create some sort of master slave architecture, any help is appreciated. <comment162290> I will search around. I can't promise much, but whatever I find will be posted here. Good luck. <comment302999> However the iOS device won't be running all the tie so how does that help. In this case I would find a small server e.g. Raspberry, Ardinuo etc <comment364960> I don't see how this directly answers the question.
