Need to automate copy / paste graphic selection from Preview to Google Doc <body> I need to paste sequential rectangular selections from a PNG opened in Preview into a designated Google Doc.  I suspect AppleScript is the best candidate for this, but I'm open to using a more familiar language like Python or JS.  Here's some rough pseudocode for what I want to do.    precode   Define Hot Keys for CopyPaste and Done    File Dialog to select destination Google Doc    Open destination doc    Set insertion point at end of destination doc    Until Done key pressed:        Activate Preview window        On CopyPaste key pressed:            Copy current selection from Preview            Paste to destination doc            Insert two newlines /code/pre  The goal is speed up the many copy/paste operations that I'm now doing by Cmd-C, click destination window, Cmd-V, Enter, Enter, click Preview (so I can make the next selection).             <answer206222> The following is working for me in OS X 10.9:  In ~/bin/preview2chrome.scpt,  precodetell application "Preview" to activate tell application "System Events"     tell process "Preview"         keystroke "c" using command down     end tell end tell delay 0.5  tell application "Google Chrome" to activate tell application "System Events"     tell process "Chrome"         keystroke "v" using command down         keystroke return         keystroke return     end tell end tell  delay 0.5 tell application "Preview" to activate /code/pre  strongIn ~/Library/Services/strong, a Run Shell Script service named Preview2Chrome.workflow containing:  precode/usr/bin/osascript /Users/mellis/bin/preview2chrome.scpt /code/pre  strongOption-V assigned as a shortcut key for Preview2Chrome.workflow/strong .  This solution requires manually opening the destination Google Doc and making it the active tab in an active Chrome window with all other Chrome windows minimized. That's not much of a restriction for my purposes, but it would be nice to have an solution that knows how to paste to the destination doc no matter what tabs and windows are active.
