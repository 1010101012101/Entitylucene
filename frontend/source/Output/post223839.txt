How do I build and install gcc5 in OS X 10.11 without Xcode? <body> Obviously installing gcc from source will require a compiler to build it; is it possible to install gcc without Xcode?  <answer223842> You can find several versions of gcc for different OS X flavors here: HPC Mac OS X.     Download my binaries, and codecd/code to the download folder. Then codegunzip gcc-5.3-bin.tar.gz/code (if your browser didn't do so already) and then codesudo tar -xvf gcc-5.3-bin.tar -C //code. It installs everything in /usr/local. You can invoke the Fortran 95 compiler by simply typing gfortran.       [To compile other sources...] you will also need to have Apple's XCode Tools installed from the Mac App Store. With XCode 4 or better you will need to download the command-line tools as an additional step. You will find the option to download the command-line tools in XCode's Preferences. On 10.9 Mavericks or higher, you can get the command-line tools by simply typing xcode-select --install.   emAddition in square brackets by me.../em  hr  Please also visit Information Security Stack Exchange and search for questions about the security risks associated with precompiled compilers from "unknown" sources.  <comment271370> When you say Xcode without any qualifications I assume you mean the Xcode.app downloadable from the App Store weighing in at +4 GB in size.  You can simply install Xcode Command Line Tools (~200 MB) in order to compile many utilities from source code, which is my preference over downloading precompiled binaries from some sources.  See [How to Install Command Line Tools in OS X Mavericks & Yosemite (Without Xcode)](http://osxdaily.com/2014/02/12/install-command-line-tools-mac-os-x/) which should work in later versions of OS X as well. In a Terminal run: `xcode-select --install`
