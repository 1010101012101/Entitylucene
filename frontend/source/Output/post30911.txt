Is there a Subversion 1.7 GUI Client for OSX Lion? <body> We are looking for a Subversion client for OSX Lion that support version 1.7, but we cannot find one.   Is there "an app for that"? :-)  <answer39435> There is SmartSVN (not free). In latest version they've fixed some Subversion 1.7 related bugs.  <answer39728> You can configure svnX (free client) to use SVN 1.7 by changing "path to SVN binaries" in Preferences to your SVN 1.7 install path.  <answer40620> Cornerstone just updated to 1.7 on Feb. 10th http://www.zennaware.com/cornerstone/index.php  <answer40622> Versions is a very nice one. Also see this question on Stackoverflow.  <comment35494> Both Versions.app and Cornerstone.app don't support Subversion 1.7 yet, but I'd wait a little longer for them to get it implemented. I can't suggest anything else as I don't think there's anything with the same level of GUI integration at the moment. <comment35496> Contacted Cornerstone and they gave me this link: http://www.zennaware.com/blog/2011/10/subversion-1_7/ <comment61422> Thanks for your answer! Can you please add more information about the software you mentioned? Links are always nice! :-)
