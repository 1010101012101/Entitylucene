MBP Retina screen, shows facebook page faded even after closed <body> I'm experiencing something a bit odd on retina screen of my MBP 15".  When i stay on facebook homepage for like 10-15 seconds then close it. Then switch to a greyish application, i can definitely see; search box, friend list on right etc. faded on greyish application.  After a minute or so, it totally disappears... I tried to capture its screenshot but it wasnt same on screenshot. So obviously it is hardware-related, not something specifically designed into software.  Do you experience this too? Should I contact Apple about this?  EDIT: I tried it with other "too white pages" but it didnt result same or it wasnt obvious enough.  <answer96973> Apparently it is called ghosting and happens on MBPs with LG display units.  http://www.macworld.co.uk/mac/news/?newsid=3435647
