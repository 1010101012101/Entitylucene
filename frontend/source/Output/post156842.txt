Mouse problems with Yosemite: unable to click or scroll very slow <body> I have just installed Yosemite and have issues with my mouse codelogitech M-RAK89D/code.  First I couldn't use the clicks. However, I could move the cursor and scroll normally.  I tried to install the last version of the Logitech Control Center.  Now I can click but the scroll is very slow. I tried to modify the speed in Preferences but there is no effect.:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yrRH8.png" alt="Mouse preference"  strongEDIT:/strong  The Logitech Control Center is unable to find my mouse :  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HsybV.png" alt="enter image description here"  It is odd because the mouse works except the scroll which is slow.  <comment184420> Doesn't the Logitech Control Center have controls for mouse speed as well? <comment184421> Are there any other USB controlling programs, like USBOverdrive? <comment184422> @patrix The mouse is not well detected (see the edit) <comment184423> @Flying Trashcan No, there is no other USB device (I tried to unplugged the USB connexion of my screen (`Cinema Display`) <comment184426> I know that might be obvious, but did you make sure that your charging station works and charged the mouse and that path from transmitter to receiver is not obstructed? Also, did you checked it on some other machine? Maybe it's not software problem after all :) <comment184429> @MarekBettman The mouse is charged and the problem occurs even very near to the charging station. I also tried to plug unplugged several times. I can't test it on other machine but the issue came when I installed Yosemite so I think this is related. <comment184431> @hhh ofc, might be due to update, just wanted to make sure to check or obvious first :)
