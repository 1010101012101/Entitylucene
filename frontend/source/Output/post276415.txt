How can I get rid of rEFInd boot manager in macOS? <body> I had a dual-boot environment macOS/Ubuntu running on a MacBook8,1. In order to sell it now, I deleted all partitions using Disk Utility after booting from a macOS sierra installation USB stick.  That left only one partition "Macintosh HD" which I formatted and afterwards I installed macOS Sierra. So far so good. But after booting now, and holding down the alt key, I can choose between two partitions "Macintosh HD" and "EFI Boot". Choosing the latter still starts "rEFInd", which is odd, since I thought I had removed it by formatting the drive..  How can I get rid of this?
