FaceTime started a random videocall at waking Mac from sleep <body> As the title states, my Mac started a FaceTime videocall automatically with a friend. My friend said that he saw me via the iSight camera, but the green LED was not active (and showing me that my camera was on).  ol liiDevice: iPhone 6/li liiOS version: 8.1/li liMac: Retina MacBook Pro 13" 2.6 Core i5, 16GB RAM/li liOSX version: 10.10.1/li liHandoff enabled so continuity could be a contributor. /li /ol  I did have a FaceTime call via my iPhone and woke up my Mac after the I finished the call. Could that be the cause of this?
