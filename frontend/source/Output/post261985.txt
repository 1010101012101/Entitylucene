Copying data from unbootable Macbook <body> I have a Macbook unibody c. 2012 that will not boot (a coffee spill did it in).  I suspect the hard disk is ok and I would like to connect it to another machine to try to copy data off.  I'd like a "casual" interface, ala USB or firewire, as I may not have a similar laptop to use as a bootable host (I do have an older, non-unibody Macbook, however).  Is there some cabling I can procure that could allow me to do this?  tone  <answer262001> You can use this iFixit guide -or the one for your specific MacBook, if this isn't- to remove the hard drive, but in short:  ol liRemove the lower case/li liDisconnect the battery (with care, as you may break the connector)/li liRemove the hard drive/li /ol  Then put your hard drive on a USB 3 case and you're ready to plug it to any Mac or HFS capable Windows or Linux machine to recover your data.  <comment328145> Do you want to pull the hard drive out of the machine? That would be the easiest way to do it. Then just get a SATA - USB adapter.
