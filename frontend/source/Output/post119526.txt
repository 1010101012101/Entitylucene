How do I kill a process that won't die? <body> I'm unable to kill a process using any of the techniques I'm aware of ("Force Quit" in Activity Monitor, codetop/code, codekillall/code from the Terminal) and wonder if there are some additional steps I can take.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YEkF2.png" alt="enter image description here"  precode~ $ sudo killall -KILL 77439 Password: No matching processes were found ~ $ killall -KILL 77439 No matching processes belonging to you were found ~ $ killall 77439 No matching processes belonging to you were found ~ $ killall Mathematica No matching processes belonging to you were found /code/pre  FWIW the process is "Mathematica" which I cannot relaunch, Quit, or Force Quit, or sample, either by name or PID, and it appears to have some odd side effects (screenshots don't appear, can't empty trash, and can't even shut down the system).  Are there additional steps that can be taken to really emreally/em kill a badly behaved process?  <answer119528> codekillall/code kills by process name (which is definitively strongnot/strong 77439 and most probably also not Mathematica). You can use codekill 77439/code or (if this fails) codekill -9 77439/code instead (but if the process is really stuck, only a reboot will solve the problem).  Also, due the the way sending/processing of signals (like codekill -9/code) works in Unix/OS X, there are situations where a process will be unkillable. One typical example for this is if a process gets stuck while accessing some external device and never actually gets control back. In such situations a reboot is the only way to get rid of the process.  <comment139415> Kill sounds like it should go just as it says, but really it should be called 'send interrupt signal', as there are many different types of kill it can perform. Using the parameters `-9` essentially uses the most powerful form of terminating with extreme predjudice available... <comment139419> Can you find this process using top in the terminal? <comment139420> $kill -9 PID always does the trick for me, even if it's that much invasive. <comment139421> So it seems like *Mathematica* is just unusually badly behaved. In the end I had to *force* shutdown (regular shutdown hung). I don't have this problem with any other app, but *Mathematica* has had it more than once. <comment139431> Next time this problem does occur, please add the output of `ps alx | egrep '[ /](PID|Math)'` to your question. <comment139432> @danielAzuelos: Good tip. Will do.
