Is it possible to launch a program in a specific language? <body> I'm a developer, and my primary language is French, so I use Mac OS X in French. However, I need on a regular basis to open an application in English to do support.  Right now I'm going to the International System Preferences and I put English above in the languages list, then I open the app I need to run in English. When I'm done, I switch it back to French.  This is an annoying process. Is there something else I can use, like a command-line program, to launch an application in a specific language?  <answer248> There is a freeware, Language Switcher, to launch a single application with a different languages.  it's really simple and work amazingly.  <answer249> Go to the app, Press Command + I and if there are other languages they will show up in the info page. Just untick all except the language you want  <answer250> You can change the language inside the preferences file of the application :  precodedefaults write com.apple.TextEdit AppleLanguages '("en-US")' /code/pre  Or just run strongonce/strong one application with another language :  precode/Applications/iCal.app/Contents/MacOS/iCal -AppleLanguages '(de)' /code/pre  hr  To determine the bundle identifier, run  precodemdls -name kMDItemCFBundleIdentifier /Applications/Mail.app /code/pre  or directly in one command:  precodedefaults write $(mdls -name kMDItemCFBundleIdentifier -raw /Applications/Mail.app) AppleLanguages '("en-UK")' /code/pre  (via SuperUser)  <answer99971> In the Finder, get info on the application. There are languages here, and you can choose. Alas, this seems to have disappeared in Snow Leopard.  <comment190> Under the hood, it just launches the program with a `-AppleLanguages (French)` switch, which is what I really needed. Thank you! <comment204> This no longer work in Snow Leopard. <comment117621> How does this differ from @Avi's answer made 3 years ago? <comment321378> Interesting. The direct "program-call"-approach works for Excel, but not for Numbers. With Numbers you have to change language in the preference file. (The first example above). <comment322137> This preference does not work anymore on 10.11. Is there any alternatives? <comment356160> It just worked for me on 10.11, no problem here.
