How can I delete Time Machine backups, moved into trash? <body> I was going to delete the Time Machine backups. I made a mistake and instead of deleting them using Time Machine, I just moved the strongBackups.backupdb/strong folder to the trash. Now, if I try to empty the trash, Finder attempts to count the number of files that will be deleted, and this process is incredibly time-consuming, because the Finder tries to count each file in each backup. The same thing happens if I try to move the strongBackups.backupdb/strong folder from the trash back on my hard drive where it was before.  What can I do in this situation? How can I delete the backups?  <answer243874> To remove or move the Backups.backupdb folder open Terminal.app.  ul liEnter codecd /Volumes/&lt;Name_of_BackupDrive&gt;/.Trashes/code to change the working directory. code&lt;Name_of_BackupDrive&gt;/code has to be the volume name of your TM backup volume./li liEnter codesudo ls -laO/code to show all folders. Usually you should see only one folder with  the name em501/em now:  precoded-wx-wx-wt@ 3 root      wheel  hidden 102 Jun 25 20:52 . drwxrwxr-x  9 root      admin  -      374 Jun 26 01:21 .. drwx------@ 2 user      staff  hidden  68 Jun 26 01:21 501 /code/pre/li liEnter codesudo su/code to get super user rights./li liEnter codecd 501/code (Replace 501 with whatever the name of the directory is) to change the working directory and list the content of the folder em501/em with codels -laO/code. Now you should see the folder emBackups.backupdb/em:  precodedrwx------@ 3 user      staff  hidden 102 Jun 26 01:21 . d-wx-wx-wt@ 3 root      wheel  hidden 102 Jun 25 20:52 .. drwxr-xr-x  2 user      admin  -       68 Jun 26 01:19 Backups.backupdb /code/pre/li liNow you may either move the folder back to the root of the backup drive with:   precodemv Backups.backupdb /Volumes/&lt;Name_of_BackupDrive&gt;/ /code/pre  or remove the folder with   precoderm -dR Backups.backupdb /code/pre  If you are asked to override something (e.g. codeoverride rw-r--r--  root/wheel uchg for Backups.backupdb/.RecoverySets/0/com.apple.recovery.boot/boot.efi?/code) enter codeyes/code and hit the return button. You may also add the code-f/code option to skip confirmations./li /ul  hr  To delete a 30 GB backup in a virtual machine it took about 3 minutes. So depending on the size of Backups.backupdb some patience is needed.  <answer264812> You can also try to delete the trash with help of the free program Onyx: http://www.titanium.free.fr/onyx.html You open the program and g√• to "clean", then to "Trash" and then click on "delete". The program will delete the content in the Trash for all connected volumes (for example Time Machine).  <answer286403> First off, thank you so much for the help! I just wanted to include a few steps that were different for my setup- just in case it can help someone else.  I was using a WD external backup drive:  ol liGo to the root folder, where you can get to the Volumes directory:  ul licd ../.. /li /ul/li liChange to the volumes directory:   ul licd Volumes/My\ Passport  /li /ul/li liView all folders:   ul lisudo ls -laO/li /ul/li liGet super user rights:  ul lisudo su 5 Look for the .Trashes directory and change into it./li liEach director is listed at the end of each line. /li licd .Trashes/li /ul/li liList the contents of the .Trashes directory:  ul lils -laO/li /ul/li liLook for a 501 folder and remove it:  ul lirm -dR 501/li /ul/li /ol  <comment300391> Do you use the (probably) external drive exclusively for Time Machine backups? If so, is your Mac the only machine backed up or do you use the external drive to also backup other Macs? <comment300394> @klanomath Thank you, I used an external drive for backups but I also keep a lot of files on this drive. My Mac is the only machine that was backed up. <comment300395> So just formatting/erasing it is **no** option! <comment300396> @klanomath Do you mean formatting the Mac or the external drive?.. <comment300400> I meant the external drive - but I already wrote an answer. <comment300478> Thank you very much, I'll try this method! <comment331971> How does it do this differently from Finder? <comment363972> It worked fine, it took like 1 hour to delete 280 gb. <comment369281> Thanks very much for the answer, I was looking how to delete thise files, ONYXmakes the magic in ONE GO. <comment373980> On behalf of an anonymous user: "open teminal type sudo chmod -R 777 "drag and drop one folder or file from trash bin" press enter type in password if asked. it takes about 3 min to execute the command. again type sudo rm -R " drag and drop the same file." press enter enter password if asked.  takes time 3 mins approx.  this should work as i tried many options only this worked for me. if successful repeat the commands by dragging and dropping all the files that are to be deleted. both steps are required."
