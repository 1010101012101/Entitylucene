Troubleshooting Time Capsule full disk backup <body> I just got a time capsule. It will do full disk backup rather than incremental backup strongevery time/strong. I tried to delete the original backup and start over. However, it won't stop full disk backup.  The OS is Sierra. The time capsule is the newest generation.  <comment326373> The first time you back up using time machine, it must copy over your entire disk. Then it will do incremental backups every hour. <comment326379> I know that. It has done backup more than 10 times.
