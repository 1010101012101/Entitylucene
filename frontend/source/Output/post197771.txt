Screenshot of selected area with shadow? <body> Is it even possible? I understand it's possible for a window, when you press space after kbdCmd/kbd-kbdShift/kbd-kbd4/kbd. I want shadow on my selected area screenshot, so it doesn't blend with the rest of the page/email/text/etc?  This page seems to be on the topic but still doesn't have an answer I'm looking for. http://guides.macrumors.com/Taking_Screenshots_in_Mac_OS_X  <answer199248> strongGrab/strong doesn't generate the shadow when a Window is copied, it copies the shadow that the OS has already applied to each window.  However, If you want to apply a shadow to your screen shots it can be done with extra steps using other applications.  If you have strongKeynote/strong or strongPages/strong installed, you can replicate it with a few steps.  ul liOpen strongKeynote/strong or strongPages/strong (instructions same after this point)/li liSelect a template.  The background does not matter but white shows your work better/li liDrag or paste in your screenshot.  strongNote:/strong Using kbdcontrol/kbd+kbdâŒ˜/kbd+kbdshift/kbd+kbd4/kbd you can send your screenshot directly to the clipboard./li liApply a drop shadow to your image/li liSelect and copy just the image and paste it into your email or desired location./li /ul  See images below:  Original Screenshot:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gFko4.png" alt="Grab"  Keynote modification:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/VGvQZ.png" alt="Keynote"  Result:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ayDta.png" alt="Result"  <comment236479> I don't think it's possible with the built-in functionality, but there's a bunch of tools out there that do this kind of stuff, including the cursor in the screenshot, etc.
