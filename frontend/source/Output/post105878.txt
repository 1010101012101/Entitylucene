One month old Macbook Air does not power on <body> I have an almost new Macbook Air. I started to use Time Machine for the first time with a brand new "My Passport" hard drive. I had to unplug it during the process and it was left unplugged for quite some time. Then it went to sleep probably or maybe not, but I plugged it. Then unplugged again (one charger was shared between two Macs).  Cannot turn it on now! The light on the plug cord is green as it is fully charged. I changed the socket just in case. I tried with USB My Passport drive plugged in and not. Nothing happens.  <answer105885> Keep pressing your power on button for 5 seconds.br The press it again for normal power-up.  You could also try this: Apple Support Page  <answer158812> Try this article very clearly Explain might help someone with mac issues  http://itrepairguide.com/apple-macbook-pro-not-power-on-no-sign-of-life/  <comment124478> Take it to the shop. It is still covered by the warranty unless you did something silly to void it. <comment124545> Thanks, worked. Though, I tried that before, just did not press and hold long enough. So, first Time Machine backup should go without interruption. I had an option checked when backup gets interrupted on power supply disconnected. Corrupted backup recovery is a [long process](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/88677/how-to-prevent-sleep-while-a-time-machine-backup-is-in-progress).
