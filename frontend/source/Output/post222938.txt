El Capitan: VPN is not configured <body> I discovered this new annoying bug in El-Cap (10.11.2 running on MacBook Pro Retina, 15-inch, Late 2013):   Sometimes when I click on VPN icon in the menubar I get 'VPN is not configured', despite the fact that I configured 3.  It is all resolved by going in System Preferences - Network and then un-ticking re-ticking the 'Show VPN Status in menubar'.    Even though I can bring up the VPN list, I'd like to know:  ol liwhat is causing this issue/li lihow do I fix it once and for all/li /ol  Please note I can go the System preference and toggle the 'show VPN' in the menubar and sort this issue.  I would like a more robust and permanent solution.  <comment270209> Welcome to Ask Different. could you edit this to have a specific question? Help in editing is available from [help] and [ask] <comment270234> @bmike "Welcome to Ask Different." - He has 1k reputation, and a few gold badges. "Welcome" is funny terminology. <comment270235> @bmike How is it now? (I edited it.) <comment270237> @FlareCat I couldn't bear the thought of treating someone with reputation worse than someone that didn't know the rules. :-) Hold is released, gladly. <comment270327> @bmike 'guidelines' ;).  Plus I edited the question as requested, in a way that I think was more informative:  I was asking what is causing the issue and how to stop it from happening to start with.
