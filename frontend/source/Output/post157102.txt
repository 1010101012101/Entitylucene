sleepimage wrong size <body> I have an early Early 2011 MBP, which I installed 16GB of RAM in, despite the fact that Apple claims the maximum is 8GB. This is a hack which is known to work, but I'm having some trouble with hibernate as a result.    It seems my sleep image is only 8GB, despite the fact that my RAM is 16GB; consequently, if I lose power while having more than 8GB in memory, safe sleep fails.    Any ideas on how to correct this?  <answer159921> h2A guess/h2  See whether the problem is reproducible with compressed memory disabled.   If that's not a workaround, please vote down this answer and leave a comment.   h2Related/h2  vm_compressor_mode (vm.compressor_mode) values for enabled compressed memory in OS X  â€“ there's a link to an answer about disabling compressed memory.   <answer159925> I have exactly the same configuration (MacBook Pro Early 2011 16GB/10.7.5 though) and my sleepimage has full 16 GB size.  Just delete it by opening Terminal (located in /Applications/Utilities), and typing in the following command, followed by the enter key:   codesudo rm /private/var/vm/sleepimage/code  Enter your administrator password (it will not be visible) and hit the enter key again.  Your Mac will automatically rebuild it when needed (hopefully with the correct size).  <answer181430> Recently I experiment a lot with disabling memory compression in Mavericks and I had clearly reproducible problems  with hibernating to disk.  1) Enable memory compression and using an hibernate mode that writes to disk works without problems  precodevm_compressor=4 + hibernatemode=3(RAM powered+sleepimage) or 25(only sleepimage)  -&gt; no problem when restored from sleepimage /code/pre  2) Disable memory compression and using an hibernate mode that writes to disk leads to kernel panics when waking up.  precodevm_compressor=1 + hibernatemode=3(RAM powered+sleepimage) or 25(only sleepimage)  -&gt; kernel panic when restored from sleepimage /code/pre  3) Disable memory compression and using an hibernate mode that NOT writes to disk works fine.  precodevm_compressor=1 + hibernatemode=1(only RAM powered)  -&gt; no problem, as long you have enough battery power  to prevent lost of RAM while sleeping /code/pre  Well 3) is only a compromise since it lets you disable the memory compression, but you will loose the safety of the sleepimage.  <comment184735> so you found the reason why Apple said 8 and not 16 :) <comment184803> But it's just an arbitrary software difference, so it can be altered. <comment188389> Nope already tried that one. <comment188394> @awiebe which system? <comment188811> That works unfortunately performance degrades, I'm trying different vmCompressor modes.
