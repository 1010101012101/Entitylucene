Open Directory User home folder: why is a terminal "~/Library/xyz/abc/file.txt" going to the server's /Library? <body> My Open Directly network has all users housed/located in a subfolder on the server HDD.br    /Volume/MainHDD/homefolder/xyzusername  I need each user to be able to run a script which touches a particular file within their own home user library folder. A terminal command would look like:    touch ~/Library/Application Support/XYZApp/blah.blah.txt  Here's the issue..  when I run this app (logged in as that OD user on the client desktop), it consistently runs as the root of the server (in other words, it's actually trying to touch /Library/Application Support/XYZApp/blah.blah.txt on the server HDD)..  I need this to actually touch: /Volume/MainHDD/homefolder/xyzusername/Library/Application Support/XYZApp/blah.blah.txt  but it is actually touching     /Volume/MainHDD/Library/Application Support/XYZApp/blah.blah.txt  and for extra points.... I don't want to have to do this as sudo, as the script needs to be rolled out for end user clients who won't have any admin rights.....  what am I doing wrong?
