Keychain stores localhost login information but won't automatically load them again <body> I have a macbook pro which I use for development. Keychain used to store and load my ID and PW for localhost:3000, but for some reason it has stopped loading them automatically.   I have tried deleting localhost entries from keychain and then saving them again after I submit them. That doesn't work.  There is nothing in the code related to login information that has changed.  Thanks for your help.  ADDITIONAL NOTE: The problem is apparently related to Safari. Keychain saves and subsequently loads the login information when using Chrome or Firefox.
