Mission control and Cmd + Tab not working since Yosemite 10.10.3 <body> I upgraded my OS from Mountain Lion to Yosemite yesterday and now Mission Control and Cmd + Tab aren't working anymore. Clicking mission control icon doesn't do anything, although I still have 4 spaces automatically opened upon starting the computer. Also, for instance, when I am on screen #1 and Chrome is opened on screen #2, if I press Cmd + Tab to change to Chrome, the menu bar at the top of the screen will change to Chrome but the screen will remain on screen #1.  So far, I tried, but without success:  ol liRebooting/li liKilling dock process using "killall Dock" and "killall -kill Dock" in Terminal/li liI made sure no other updates were available/li liBrowsed internet a few hours to try to find something, but found nothing successful/li liF4 shortcut doesn't work neither/li /ol  My computer specs are the following:  iMac 27 inches, late 2009, 2.66 GHz Intel Core i5, 8 GB DDR3  Would anyone have any suggestions?  <answer190921> Try resetting all the defaults for Mission Control. I had the same problem and now it works.   Type the following command into Terminal:  precodedefaults delete com.apple.dock mcx-expose-disabled &amp;&amp; killall Dock /code/pre  <comment225446> you mean "killall -kill Dock" <comment225448> I also tried it, but also unsuccessful in order to make Mission Control work, although Dock was reseted. Edited it. <comment225451> Is this User specific? and did you repair permissions in disk utility? does the mission contrl keyboard shortcut works? or the F4 <comment225453> There is only one user on the computer, so I do not know, should I create a second user and try it? I do not know what those repair permissions are, I'll look at that. I also tried F4, but not working. I'll edit it concerning F4. <comment225457> Open Disk Utility app in your utility folder, then run the repair disk permissions. it is a slim chance the problem is there but it wont harm doing it. <comment225466> Disk utility repair permissions did not change anything. <comment225467> Final attempt form my site, start in Safe mode to see if it works there. <comment226745> Thanks for your advice, but sadly I have already downgraded back to 10.8 because I couldn't find anything. How can I mark my question so people do not loose time answering it? <comment226781> @A.P. - Your question still needs an answer. It will help other people. <comment248181> This works for Yosemite with the following adjusted command:  "defaults delete com.apple.dock && killall Dock".
