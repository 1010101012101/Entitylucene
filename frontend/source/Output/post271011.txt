Resetting iPhone 6 help :( <body> I have an iPhone 6 and I really need to reset the whole phone meaning its going to delete all my data but I bought my phone in the USA and I'm in Mexico right now for vacations and I was thinking if I reset it would my phone number change and the company all that  being in a different country and all idk       Help :(  <comment340647> Why do you need to reset your iPhone? There are a number of _Reset_ options and not all of them delete your data. In other words, you may not need to delete your data - so some context as to what your issue is may help us help you. <comment340649> basically my phone has been shutting off at random percentages and if It says 100% in less then 5 min it will go to 57% and I've been getting really tired of it and so I went on the App Store help center and said I have to Reset my whole phone meaning all media and data will be deleted and I'm fine with that just that I don't know if it's going to change my # number or something since I'm in a different country right now and my father is paying my phone bill from the USA so I don't know if it's going to change any of that <comment340651> @Lilly Resetting your phone won't affect the phone number, even if you're in another country. Just make sure you have access to WiFi to set the phone up, and note that a factory reset probably won't fix your battery issues (you'll likely need to go to the Apple Store and pay them 80 dollars to change your battery to fix the issue you described).
