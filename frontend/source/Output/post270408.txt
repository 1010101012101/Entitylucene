Fish adb not found <body> I installed fish shell on my macbook. when I try to run the command codeadb/code - get error fish: codeUnknown command 'adb'/code, though adb is added to .bash_profile. How to fix it?  ~/.bash_profile  precodeexport ADB=:/Users/mancj/Library/Android/sdk/platform-tools/ export PATH=$ADB:$PATH /code/pre  strongEDIT:/strong I tried a codecd/code in the adb folder and run the codeadb/code command , also get error codefish: Unknown command 'adb'/code  <answer270411> codefish/code doesn't care about codebash/code's startup files, see https://fishshell.com/docs/current/tutorial.html#tut_startup  You need to change your codePATH/code in code~/.config/fish/config.fish/code instead and restart the shell.  <answer270507> Further, it's unlikely that fish includes '.' (i.e. the CWD) in its path by default, so simply entering the directory containing the binary you want to run is not likely to work.  If that's strictly necessary, explicitly specify the path:  $ ./binary_to_run  In general, including '.' in the path is a security exploit waiting to happen.  <comment339833> `fish` probably doesn't care about content in the startup files of `bash`... <comment339834> Anyway: The `:` in the definition of `$ADB` looks odd and isn't necessary (it's probably even dangerous). And is `adb` really located in `/Users/mancj/Library/Android/sdk/platform-tools/` or is there something like a `bin` directory within? <comment339835> @patrix `adb` is located in `/Users/mancj/Library/Android/sdk/platform-tools/` folder <comment339836> please check my question, I added a small note.
