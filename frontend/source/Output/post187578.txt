After Xcode update, simulator has wrong sizes <body> I just updated Xcode. When the simulator opens, the actual screen is bigger than the overall screen. Here is an image:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/x37In.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  I am not sure what's wrong. How can I fix this? I already tried changing the scale to different sizes, but it didn't work.  <comment221758> I didn't found a permanent fix, but, restarting the simulator should fix the issue. <comment221760> Tried that. didn't work
