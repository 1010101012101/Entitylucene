Cannot send .zip file via iCloud <body> I've encountered a problem when I wanted to send an email with my xcode project compressed to .zip. It's roughly 1 MB. When I'm trying to send it using Mail.app or iCloud website there is an error:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ykxoq.png" alt="enter image description here"  I tried including .swift file - it was ok, then I compressed .png file to .zip file and these messages were sent and delivered correctly. Is there any mechanism that blocks xcode projects being send even when they are compressed?  <comment361795> Did you try sending the first .zip again afterwards? <comment361867> @Tetsujin yes, I did
