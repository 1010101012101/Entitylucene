Applescript character count in words with combining diacritics <body> If I combine an acute accent with, say "x", with a w before it and a y following, like this: "wx̀y", this will look good in BBEdit and Word, and both programs will give a character count of 4. However, this applescript:  set a to "wx̀y"  display dialog (number of characters of a)  ... will reply "3".

Fortunately, one of those results was 4. I did this by outsourcing the calculation to Python:  precodeon run {input, parameters}     set var to "wx̀y"      set output to (do shell script ¬ "python - &lt;&lt;EOF # -*- coding: utf-8 -*- print len(u'" &amp; var &amp; "') EOF")      return output end run /code/pre
