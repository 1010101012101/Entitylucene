Karabiner ( KeyRemap4MacBook) Ctrl to Command, preserve Ctrl+Tab and Command+Tab <body> I've been struggling with this for a few hours now. What I want to achieve is I want to map kbdLeft Ctrl/kbd to kbdLeft Command ⌘/kbd. However, I want to preserve the functionality of kbdCtrl/kbd+kbdTab/kbd. So kbdCtrl/kbd+kbdAnything/kbd should be kbdCommand ⌘/kbd+kbdAnything/kbd with the exception of kbdTab/kbd. What I could achieve:  ul liLeave kbdCtrl/kbd and kbdCommand ⌘/kbd as they are (default)/li liMap kbdCtrl/kbd to kbdCommand ⌘/kbd (in this case kbdCtrl/kbd+kbdTab/kbd = kbdCommand ⌘/kbd+kbdTab/kbd)/li liMap kbdCtrl/kbd to kbdCommand ⌘/kbd and map kbdCommand ⌘/kbd+kbdTab/kbd to kbdCtrl/kbd+kbdTab/kbd (in this case kbdCommand ⌘/kbd+kbdTab/kbd is not preserved)/li /ul  (I might want to add some other exceptions in the future, but seeing the basics surely helps).  Thank you.  <answer148286> Since both right and left kbd⌘/kbd are identical in functionality (I hope this is the case in your setup), we first map left kbdCtrl/kbd to the right kbd⌘/kbd:  precode&lt;autogen&gt;   __KeyToKey__   KeyCode::CONTROL_L,   KeyCode::COMMAND_R &lt;/autogen&gt; /code/pre  Then map right kbd⌘/kbd+kbdTab/kbd to kbdCtrl/kbd+kbdTab/kbd:  precode&lt;autogen&gt;   __KeyToKey__   KeyCode::TAB, ModifierFlag::COMMAND_R,   KeyCode::TAB, ModifierFlag::CONTROL_L &lt;/autogen&gt; /code/pre
