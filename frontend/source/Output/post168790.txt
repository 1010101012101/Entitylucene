They will know the specifics of your contract and options as well as help you by asking some questions like   ul liWhat version of iOS are you running? /li liAre you using iMessage?/li /ul  Your first step might be disabling SMS on the iPhone and then contacting the carrier to get further instructions. It really depends upon what number is sending the SMS and if you opted in to any subscriptions or got crammed or signed in to SMS on a web service of some sort.  <comment198168> Some message apps send sms for initial activation. I think imessage sends one sms as well when it is activated. How many sms are being sent? What number are the sms sent to? You could find out more if you google it.
