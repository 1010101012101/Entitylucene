Download Over Cellular? <body> I have set up several alarms that use songs on my iPhone (iOS 6).  Whenever I modify one of those alarms (or create a new one with the now default setting of one of those songs) the phone asks me  precodeDownload Over Cellular? Additional fees may apply when downloading songs over cellular. (Cancel) (Download) /code/pre  What does it want to download? The songs are on the phone.  <answer99733> Try:  emSettings-General-Cellular/em scroll down and set  strongUse Cellular Data for:/strong emiTunes/em = strongON/strong  This doesn't mean it's going to re-download anything for the alarm, just gets rid of the stupid warning.  Also you can check emSettings-Itunes &amp; App Stores/embr strongUse Cellular Data = ON/strong  If that doesn't make it go away, try resyncing library with itunes also.
