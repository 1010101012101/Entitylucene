Checking button text with applescript <body> I'm trying to automate CCleaner, so far I can start the application and click the button that starts the cleanup job, however I'm relying on a codedelay/code to determine when I should move onto the next portion of the script.  precodetell application "/Applications/CCleaner.app" to activate  tell application "System Events"     tell application process "CCleaner"         click button "Run Cleaner" of window 1         delay 10     end tell end tell /code/pre  I don't particularly like this approach and would prefer to detect when CCleaner is finished running (it may be much sooner or later than the 10 second delay).    While CCleaner is inactive, the button text is "Run Cleaner"; when CCleaner is active, the button text is "Cancel".  Can someone advise how I check the text on the button?  If I know how to do that I can do something like this:  precodetell application "/Applications/CCleaner.app" to activate  tell application "System Events"     tell application process "CCleaner"         click button "Run Cleaner" of window 1         delay 10     end tell end tell  repeat     # ?     # ? if button text is "Run Cleaner" then exit repeat     # ?     delay 1 end repeat  # do more stuff /code/pre  <answer83363> You can check every button of the window and wait until one is titled like you want :  pre property btnTitle : "Run Cleaner"  set btnFound to false  tell application "/Applications/CCleaner.app" to activate  tell application "System Events"     tell application process "CCleaner"         click button btnTitle of window 1         delay 1          -- Start checking every seconds if window 1 contains a button titled "Run Cleaner"               repeat while not btnFound             repeat with btn in buttons of window 1                 try -- Some buttons don't have title which would return an error if not in try                     if (title of btn is btnTitle) then                         set btnFound to true                     end if                 end try             end repeat             delay 1         end repeat      end tell end tell  if btnFound then     -- Do more stuff end if /pre  <comment96118> This worked, thank you @Bibou
