Confused by Siri's answer <body> I asked: "Should I wear a jacket today"  It replied: "Sorry Nathan, I can't look for places in France"  What does that mean? (Yes it's true I'm in France)  <answer27939> It probably tries to look up the weather to answer that question and fails to find the weather at your location.  <comment31997> yet if I ask, what's the weather like? It shows me the weather at my location... <comment31998> Actually, now the same question works for some reason ... <comment31999> In that case I have no idea, maybe we can get a clue if someone else with a 4s asks that question and reports on what it replies.
