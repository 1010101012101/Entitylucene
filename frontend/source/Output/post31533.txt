Configuring Lion VNC Server:Â virtual display by default? <body> The new Screen Sharing server in Lion supports multiple concurrent log-ins: if there is already someone logged into the computer when you try to connect with VNC, it gives you the option of logging into a virtual display instead.  Is there some way of forcing all screen-sharing logins to be virtual? Or choosing to log into a virtual session even if there is no one else logged in?
