Has Apple hidden any tributes to Steve Jobs? <body> In Apple's software, are there any hidden tributes or memorials to Steve Jobs?  Someone told me you can find his glasses in an app but I can't find them.  <answer220388> I don't know about glasses, but you have this one :  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pEACR.jpg" alt="enter image description here"     Apple's latest version of OS X Lion contains a plethora of new   features that are being uncovered piece by piece now that the preview   version is in the hands of developers. One little gem recently   discovered is a new section in the Finder called "All My Files." This   feature helps you organize your files by criteria, such as file type,   file creation date and last opened date.      The icon for this new section is an image of a filing drawer stuffed   with documents and dividers. Zooming in on the documents within this   icon, one can see writing that is taken from notable quotes delivered   by Steve Jobs and Apple.   http://www.engadget.com/2011/03/01/mac-os-x-lion-features-hidden-tribute-to-steve-jobs/  hr     This awesome image of a vinyl album found within OS X Lion’s user   icons seems normal enough at first – but zooming in on the image   reveals that this particular vinyl contains some very interesting   songs…   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mDc4i.jpg" alt="enter image description here"     If you’re a fan of Steve Jobs’ keynotes, excitable personality, and   unique marketing catchphrases, you’re sure to get some amusement out   of this. As you can see, the tracks on the album label are names after   Jobs’ famous catchphrases: “Magic”, “Revolution”, “Boom!”, and   “Unbelievable.” Now that’s an album I’d love to hear! Yup, the track   titles on the record label are all Steve-isms: “Magic”, “Revolution”,   “Boom!” and “Unbelievable.” Now that sounds like an album I’d like to   listen to.   http://www.mactrast.com/2011/07/os-x-lions-hidden-tribute-to-steve-jobs/  <answer220400> The strongReading List icon/strong in Safari is a tribute to the glasses.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fgSth.png" alt="reading list"  hr  Didn't know the story behind the iconic glasses - see this Wall Street Journal article talking about it.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MEnuq.jpg" alt="Image from Associated Press"  <answer220416> Here's one more: the TextEdit icon contains the text of Apple's iconic commercial Here's to the crazy ones:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/cJhIE.jpg" alt="TextEdit icon: Here&#39;s to the crazy ones"  <answer220481> From http://www.businessinsider.com/steve-jobs-speech-easter-egg-2014-8:     Simply press "Shift + Command + G" in Finder and paste in "/Applications/Pages.app/Contents/Resources/" and then open the Apple.txt file.   I was told many years ago when I was in school that the NeXT had easter eggs that would show up only if your user name was stevejobs, but I never attempted to confirm or deny that rumour.  <answer220598> If you ask Siri "Who is Steve Jobs?" it replies:     Thanks for asking about Steve. Here's Apple's web page about him:      Steve Jobs Memorial   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/EONQz.png" alt="Thanks for asking about Steve. Here&#39;s Apple&#39;s web page about him: Steve Jobs"  <comment266804> The “Here's to the crazy ones” text is also hidden in many glyphs in Apple's Emoji font:  <comment266951> How is this a tribute to Steve Jobs? <comment267015> That precedes Steve's death. <comment267025> The Apple.txt is no longer available on El Capitan (or just for me ^^) <comment267026> It could be argued that the text itself was already a tribute to Steve Jobs. "Tribute (noun): an act, statement, or gift that is intended to show gratitude, respect, or admiration." <comment267085> @MrMojoRisin I can confirm, couldn't find this file either.
