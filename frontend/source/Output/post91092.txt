location aware network drive mount? <body> At work we have a network drive (hosted on a windows server, mounted wirelessly via SMB) that is best if it is automounted.  The trouble is that this causes the system to pause when it tries to mount the drive on a different network.  How can I tell my mac to ONLY mount the drive when on my work network, no where else?  <comment106976> Network drive: hosted on a Windows server, OSX Server, NAS? Network: wired, wireless? <comment106986> I have edited the question
