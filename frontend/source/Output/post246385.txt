Why doesn't Handoff allow me to continue browsing a site I was watching on my iPad? <body> I followed what reported on Use Handoff in Chrome for iOS to use Handoff to be able to use Handoff with Google Chrome between my iPad and my Mac Mini.  ul liI connected both devices to the same Wi-Fi network/li liI signed in to iCloud with the same account on both devices/li liI turned on Bluetooth and paired both devices/li liI turned on Handoff/li liI enabled Handoff on Google Chome, which is the default browser on my Mac./li /ul  Yet, Handoff doesn't allow me to continue browsing on my Mac Mini a site I open on  my iPad. I also tried moving away from my Mac and returning with a new page open, but that didn't work. Even setting Safari as default browser and opening a site with Safari on my iPad didn't help.  Handoff was working normally, even if my iPad and my Mac were not paired through Bluetooth, before I connected my Mac to Internet via Ethernet cable. Once I connected it back via Wi-fi, Handoff stopped working, even after resetting my Mac.  How can I make Handoff work again?  I paired the devices via Bluetooth only after I noticed Handoff was not working as before, once I started again to use the Wi-Fi.
