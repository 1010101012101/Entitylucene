Can I see my CPU and memory usage meters in the menu bar? <body> I'd like to be able to view my cpu and memory usage in real time.  Not as a desktop widget or window application, but as a widget in the menu bar.  Is this possible?  <answer1272> iStat Menus has the functionality you are asking for. It is available starting at USD$18 for a single license.  <answer1273> I use MenuMeters for this functionality, and have a hard time living without it.  How do other people know when their web browser is finally done downloading a page, or YouTube stalled out, or iPhoto still working, or ...?  MenuMeters is freeware, but well worth the donation.  The original author has stopped maintaining MenuMeters, but someone new has taken over for El Capitan.    <answer30444> Or you can try some geeklets from the internet (or make one yourself) on Geektool. I find it more customizable than menu bar apps, and prettier when I get to use the fonts and sizes I like.  <answer121412> I prefer SystemPal. iStat itself consumes too much CPU and RAM. SystemPal is quick, tiny, configurable, neat, and powerful. It's available on Mac App Store.  <answer210401> There is also nice commercial app called  CheckMyMac can be downloaded from www.nomsoftwares.com  Disclaimer I am the developer of this app.  <answer234736> I made a simple app that displays cpu and memory usage on menubar, free and open sourced. Feedback is welcome.  https://github.com/ningt/iStats  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/psVuS.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer287985> A free open source solution is CpuInfo on GitHub (shows cpu only)  <comment1085> +1 I really like this one. can customize how much is shown and it seems to perform very well. I may actually buy it. <comment1086> I wasn't able to get this to work. After unzipping, running installer, and logging out/in, it doesn't appear on the menubar. <comment1106> @sunpech: Did you enable them from the Menu Meters Preference Pane? By default they don't enable until you say you want them. <comment1145> I also like it and I still use the old free version. What I don't like is that it invites you to upgrade without informing you that it costs money afterwards. <comment1183> What Chealion said: Did you go to the MenuMeters pref pane (at the bottom, in the "Other" category in System Preferences) to turn on the meters you'd like? <comment32671> I love MenuMeters. I'd vote it up, but I'm out of votes for today. :-( <comment82474> I did that!  I had a nice weather.com geeklet on my desktop.  And then I upgraded to Mountain Lion, and the geektool is failing for mysterious reasons, and I have to debug it.  :-/ <comment142295> Does this work with the new memory management in mavericks? <comment142296> Does this work with the new memory management in mavericks? <comment142428> Sorry, I switched to the paid version of iStat Menus 4 some time ago. This one works fine on Mavericks. I can't comment whether the old versions 2.x or 3.x still work. <comment164191> Activity monitor reports 7.78 GB of memory used, while MenuMeters reports around 5 GB of memory used. Any ideas about the discrepancy? I'm mostly just concerned with when my computer starts swapping. (should I make a separate question?) <comment243846> AlikElzin-kilaka @GordonGustafson, good questions!  I'm on Yosemite now, and I do see a disparity in reports.  Since Activity Monitor & MenuMeters both break down the categories of active memory, I can see that Wired & Compressed Memory are reporting the same amounts in both.  However, "App Memory" in Activity Monitor is higher than it is in MenuMeters for me.  Will write to developer. <comment243849> Update - I was previously on 1.7.  Upgraded to 1.8.1 to go with Yosemite and numbers are much closer now.   FYI, developer says he will not update for El Capitan due to Apple policies; we'll see if MenuMeters keeps working then. <comment283583> A new author has taken over development of MenuMeters and it works with 10.11.  [El Capitan MenuMeters](http://member.ipmu.jp/yuji.tachikawa/MenuMetersElCapitan/) <comment283613> If you don't want to use third-party software, you can also use Activity Monitor (however, it's on the Dock, not the menu bar). Do this by opening Activity Monitor  View  Dock Icon  Show CPU Usage <comment283878> Nice!  Thanks for the update, @DanPritts! <comment288613> Still costs dollars, but *much* fewer than iStat Menus does, so thank you :) <comment288614> Upvoted this.  Wish I could do more:  in fact I wish I'd seen it before I payed for SystemPal ;-) <comment295334> Just a note - if you use TimeMachine and are having slow backups now with El Capitan, try disabling the disk monitoring in Menu Meters.  See thread here: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/7275653?start=60&tstart=0 <comment295337> You can also read tips on turning off I/O throttling, and seeing if backupd is being throttled, here: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/212537/time-machine-ridiculously-slow-after-el-capitan-upgrade/219884#219884 <comment344467> You could try using [Ãœbersicht](http://tracesof.net/uebersicht/)
