Can't a Macbook Pro work properly on integrated GPU only? <body> For a couple of weeks, I've been having kernel panics in my MacBook Pro (Early 2011, Yosemite), mostly doing zoom operations using QuickView and Preview.  A couple of times, it had problems rebooting, until finally it only rebooted to a grey screen.  I installed gfxCardStatus to prevent it to switching to the discrete GPU at any time, and things seemed to go smoothly for a couple of days. But one day it had a kernel panic when waking up from sleep.  Booting in verbose mode showed no indications of what the problem could be, but I suspected it was a video card issue. I've known that this model of MBP had problems with defective AMD Radeon discrete GPUs. I know Apples is repairing eligible machines, but I live in a country where perhaps that wouldn't be possible.  I decided to prevent the laptop from using the AMD GPU and use the integrated intel chip instead, I moved this drivers out of the code/System/Library/Extensions//codefolder:  precodeAMD2400Controller.kext AMD2600Controller.kext AMD3800Controller.kext AMD4600Controller.kext AMD4800Controller.kext AMD5000Controller.kext AMD6000Controller.kext AMD7000Controller.kext AMD8000Controller.kext AMD9000Controller.kext AMDFramebuffer.kext AMDRadeonVADriver.bundle AMDRadeonX3000.kext AMDRadeonX3000GLDriver.bundle AMDRadeonX4000.kext AMDRadeonX4000GLDriver.bundle AMDSupport.kext ATIRadeonX2000.kext ATIRadeonX2000GA.plugin ATIRadeonX2000GLDriver.bundle ATIRadeonX2000VADriver.bundle /code/pre  It wouldn't boot up after that either, so I moved this ones also:  precodeGeForce.kext GeForceGA.plugin GeForceGLDriver.bundle GeForceTesla.kext GeForceTeslaGLDriver.bundle GeForceTeslaVADriver.bundle GeForceVADriver.bundle /code/pre  strongAfter that it did boot up/strong, but the screen shows thin horizontal blue stripes all over as well as some other glitches and overall sluggishness.  Detail of stripes (there's some unavoidable Moire pattern in the photo, but the thin blue lines can be appreciated in the darker parts): img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wlMZC.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  I just want my Mac to use the integrated Intel GPU and forget the discrete ADM Radeon card altogether. strongOther machines, including Apple machines, don't have a discrete GPU, just an integrated one, and they work fine for day-to-day, non-graphic-intensive tasks/strong  strongMy question:/strong  ul liIs possible for this machine to work normally using only the integrated Intel GPU? /li liIf so, how?/li liAre both my discrete GPU and my integrated GPU damaged?**/li /ul  <answer174754> That seems not to be going well.  First check this out: http://www.apple.com/ca/support/macbookpro-videoissues/  Next I would suggest:  put all ATI/AMD drivers back to /System/Library/Extensions/  ul liremove only and specifically the driver files that were being used for the specific GPU. In your case:  sudo rm -r /System/Library/Extensions/ATIRadeonX3000*/li lisudo touch /System/Library/Extensions/li lireboot/li /ul  <answer286190> Just moving kext files won't disable your discrete graphics card, it will just make it work in a very basic mode.  You can achieve that modifying certain EFI variable. I answered this other question with the full procedure to permanently disable discrete graphics card on startup and have a fully functional machine.  <comment205856> Do you mean AMDRadeonX3000* ? <comment205857> I did this http://www.asyncro.com/2014/03/24/macbook-pro-discreate-graphics-card-issue-fix-updated/ and damaged the kernel cache, not it won't boot even in single user mode (command-s). What can I do now? <comment205859> now you are a candidate for system restore :) cmd+r <comment205864> I'm out of luck. cmd+r boots into a grey screen (after a pin-striped Apple logo and about a third of progress bar) <comment205865> do you have a bootable USB <comment205975> The problem is that any installer will try to use the discrete GPU and it is damaged. After my last comment O tried again and the recovery started from the recovery partition but it used the discreta Radeon GPU and first the image was shifted, then with vertical blue bands then nothing at all (during downloading). Afterthat I had to turn the computer off sinces I couldn,t see is the installer was prompting me for anything. <comment205979> It should be working in safe mode that does not requires discrete GPU but as last resort, wipe that disk and start over.
