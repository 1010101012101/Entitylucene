How do I sync my music and video from iTunes to new iPhone 6? <body> In trying to sync my music and video to my new iPhone 6, I noticed that all of the music and videos that I purchased downloaded to my new phone but all of the ones that I had ripped from CDs did not. Is there a way to sync all of my music and videos from iTunes to iPhone 6? Thank you.  <answer146258> The ability to sync the contents of your old iPhone to a new phone is contingent upon your backup method.
