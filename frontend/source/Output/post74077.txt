Connecting external display turns both screens black <body> I updated from 10.8.1 to 10.8.2 for my MacBook Pro Retina with my external 27" Thunderbolt display. When I connect to my Thunderbolt display both screens are black. I can only see my mouse pointer and sometimes little boxes of display. Any idea what's wrong?  <answer74172> The solution explained in this Apple Discussions thread worked for me.  ol liDelete code/Library/Preferences/com.apple.windowserver.plist/code./li liDelete code~/Library/Preferences/ByHost/com.apple.windowserver.XXXXX.plist/code./li liReset NVRAM./li /ol
