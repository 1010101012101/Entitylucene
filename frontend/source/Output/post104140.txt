I have logged on to Icloud and the calendar events are on both accounts. however it is not syncing with either phones... (this is only for the old events only) All new events are showing on both phones.  How do we get the previous events to reflect on calendars on our phones...?  <answer104141> Go to Settings  Mail, Contacts and Calender  Sync  Set it to always and the old events will be synced as well on both the devices.
