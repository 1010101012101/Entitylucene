Extract zip file to different location without Terminal <body> Without third-party software, is there a way to extract a zip file to a different location without using Terminal? I realize I could use codeunzip file.zip -d /path/to/destination/code, but I'd love to do it just by dragging and dropping with a keyboard modifier or something.  Is this possible?  <answer126251> Try throwing your terminal script into automators run shell script and saving as a service, then you just right click on the file and select the new service and it'll extract to your chosen destination.  there are a few other answers here https://discussions.apple.com/message/17831395#17831395  I also found a very interesting tool today called Keka, which is fantastic for creating seperate zip files from one large folder. It has an option to save to a new folder, perhaps this could help.
