Safari has a problem displaying certain images <body> Safari does not display certain images properly.  The latest example is http://i.imgur.com/GqQchYM.jpg which is perfectly loadable in firefox.  In Safari however the picture is displayed properly while it is loading/as long as it is only partially loaded. When it should display the whole picture all I get is black or white box. It can be clicked to zoom in though.  h2Safari/h2  img src="https://i.imgur.com/kTgkGZQ.png?1" alt="Safari 7.0.3" title="safari"  h2Firefox/h2  img src="https://i.imgur.com/WMuboNZ.png?1" alt="Firefox" title="firefox"  I've had the same problem once before. That time I found this thread: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/3796427  and was able to get it working by deleting:  precode~/Library/Caches/com.apple.Safari/Cache.db /code/pre  I've tried that this time as well, but the picture is still failing.  The system is updated. My version of Safari is 7.0.3 (9537.75.14). The operating system is  OS X 10.9.2 (13C1021).  What can I do to get the browser working again?  EDIT:  I've tried removing all extensions from the browser. img src="https://i.imgur.com/oR47GDv.png" alt="Extensions" title="extensions"  I only had Reddit enhancement suite installed before cleaning.  EDIT2: problem persists after updating to Safari Version 7.1 (9537.85.10.17.1)  EDIT3: Problem solved in Safari Version 8.0 (10600.1.25)!  <answer130262> It does work on my MBA 10.9.2 Safari 7.0.3 ?  At the moment I do not know what is causing it on your computer.   Here are some initial findings:  That site has some bad formatting to begin with:  For example if you change the Margin to 3 instead of 0 the magnifier will no longer go outside of the image area, which is the first indication of a problem with that link.  precode&lt;body style="margin: 3px;"&gt;&lt;img style="-webkit-user-select: none; cursor: -webkit-zoom-in;" src="http://i.imgur.com/GqQchYM.jpg" width="166" height="222"&gt;&lt;/body&gt; /code/pre  supThe image is set to display in width=166 , height=222, while the Natural size is 3120x4160./sup  UPDATE:  Since It works on my computer I would say it is your specific Safari installation.  We could go in to trying to repair your Safari (I do not know a quick way to do it)!?, but to be honest, if you have that problem on a bigger scale, I would recommend to reInstall Safari. Unfortunately that means reInstalling Mavericks. So the choice is yours.  <answer131952> Trying it as a different user or as a newly-created user account should quickly tell you if it's a bug in your version of Safari or a system-wide corruption vs. a cache or preference issue.   Since Safari 7.0.4 is out, you might also try updating.  <answer151556> Upgraded to OSX 10.10 Yosemite today. It brought Safari Version 8.0 (10600.1.25).  I no longer have trouble opening the image! =)  <answer169111> It's a bug that manifests itself when using Intel integrated graphics.  Using gfxCardStatus to force the use of the discrete video card works around the problem.  <comment152625> Same system setup. Link works in my safari. (no changes done to the link) But does not show the image bordered in black <comment152627> My Safari shows the title as GqQchYM.jpg 3,120x4 160 pixel <comment152628> As a test I just set my number separator grouping in  format in Language & region to a 'space' and reloaded the safari page. I got the space in the title. So that all that is. <comment152629> Do you have any extension on that could be interfering <comment152630> great find, so it is not that ? <comment152694> I had reddit enhancement suite installed as my only extension. Removing that made no difference. <comment155042> I' ve the same in 7.0.3 (9537.75.14) with all the icons in Facebook. <comment155364> Same error in Safari 7.0.4. <comment155365> Logged in as my wife the picture still displays wrong. <comment155366> Created a new user - the picture still won't load. <comment161106> I have exactly same problem and still can not find how to fix this. I noticed, that black background shows only then progressive JPEG is loading. I use latest Mac OS X Maverics.
