Old MacBook Pro 17" freezes when WiFi gets turned off <body> I recently updated from Mountain Lion to Mavericks 10.9.4 on my late 2007 MacBook Pro 17". Now every time I turn off WiFi, the computer freezes within a few seconds to a few minutes. Upon reboot, the computer freezes again very quickly (sometimes at the login screen, sometimes right after getting to the desktop). I assume this happens as soon as the computer checks the WiFi state and sees that it's off.  It all happens too quickly for me to flip the WiFi back on.  I thought I was stuck (save for wiping the computer and reinstalling the OS every time this accidentally happens), but someone found a partial solution, posted on the following thread:  https://discussions.apple.com/thread/5603415?start=21  The user "Ira Wolf 81" identified 4 steps which I will copy below:  ol liBoot into single user mode (kbdcommand âŒ˜/kbd+kbdS/kbd)/li liMake volume read-write (codemount -uw //code)/li liEdit /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/preferences.plist to change the PowerEnabled setting for the Airport Interface (usually en1) from codefalse/code to codetrue/code/li liReboot/li /ol  This worked for me, and I'm grateful to be able to use my computer again. But (1) it doesn't address the underlying issue of why turning off WiFi would freeze the computer, and (2) I have to manually follow these 4 steps anew every time this happens.  So I'm wondering if a script can automate Ira Wolf 81's solution.  One idea is to read and possibly edit that preferences.plist file every time the computer gets booted normally, and to do this before the OS can read that file.  Anyone want to take a crack at this?  Alternatively, if anyone knows how to fix the underlying issue, that would be cool too.  strongEdit:/strong  In the name of science, I just intentionally turned off WiFi and waited for my computer to freeze (which it did), all the while secretly logging its actions with the Console. Here are the logs from the moment I turned off WiFi at 5:31:42 PM right up until the freeze at about 5:33 PM:  precode5:31:42.000 PM kernel: AirPort: Link Down on en1.

Basically I wrote a bash script to check the WiFi status and turn it on if it's off.  I then wrote two plist files for calling the script with launchd: one plist is a daemon and it calls the script right at boot, the other is an agent and it calls the script whenever the following file is modified: /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/preferences.plist.  That's the file that the OS stores the WiFi status in.  I put all my code up on GitHub and made a simple installer:  https://github.com/dmuenz/KeepWiFiOn  I've only tested this on my own computer.  <answer143943> Thanks for the Console log. I can only imagine how stressed you were to get it all done before shut down happened :)  Lets start with the obvious first (the rest comes later)  You have many SMC (system management controller) Errors.   Reset your SMC using the procedure from Apple.  <comment169329> In order to evalute the root cause we need to see your Console report at the time of interest (when you turn off your wifi and some 50 lines after that. Since your computer will freeze, once you have it going scroll back in the Console to the time of the event. <comment169566> Thanks for the suggestion to use Console, @Buscarì›ƒ. I've updated my question with Console logs encompassing the time of the freeze. <comment169569> Just out of curiosity, what do you use the Netbios (Network Basic Input/Output System) for ? <comment169574> I see the netbios reference in the first set of logs (from before the freeze) but I don't know what it's used for.  I think it was just one of the cascade of log messages that came shortly after turning off WiFi. <comment169575> Are you connecting to Windows server or any servers at all, or company networks? <comment233346> In the past two weeks, since switching to Mavericks, I have started to experience the same, or very similar, issue. I turn off wifi and the Santa Rosa MBP (2.4MHz) locks up. I was using Mountain Lion, which did not show the same issue. I do not have the same SMC issues, which are shown in your logs. I shall compare logs further, to see if I can track down the cause of the issue. However, at the time of switching off the wifi, just before the (forced) reboot, I see no untoward messages or errors in the log.
