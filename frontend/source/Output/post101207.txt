Can't connect to VPN via iOS <body> I have set up a Mac OS X 10.8 server running the VPN service. From my Macs I can connect to the VPN server without any problems, but the iOS devices are all unable to connect.  The console displays the following message while trying to connect an iPhone:  precode9/8/13 11:02:51.704 AM racoon[313]: Connecting. 9/8/13 11:02:51.704 AM racoon[313]: IPSec Phase1 started (Initiated by peer). 9/8/13 11:02:51.706 AM racoon[313]: IKE Packet: receive success.

If the problem continues, verify your settings and contact your Administrator."  Why am I unable to connect an iPhone to the VPN server while a Mac doesn't have any problems connecting?  <answer101324> I finally figured it out:  My shared secret was too complex, I configured a new one that's slightly shorter and has no special characters and now iOS is able to establish a VPN connection.  It turned out iOS can't handle shared secret of more than 32 characters.  <answer110781> You saved me... well, you and replacing the raccoon binary on Maverick with the one from Mountain Lion.   Interesting was that I was using the Apple default (generated) shared secret.
