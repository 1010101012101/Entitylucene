Microsoft Studio Mini DisplayPort to Thunderbolt? <body> I recently purchased a MS Surface Studio after being a faithful Mac user for 27 years. It was a DIFFICULT transition but I'm learning to love my new computer (especially drawing directly on the screen). But now I have a beautiful Apple Thunderbolt Display that I am unable to connect to the Mini DisplayPort.   I tried this adapter: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00VI3M7S6/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o09_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1 but it does not work.   Does anyone know of a solution?  <comment363319> Actually, that's a confusing duplicate... let me find another [but essentially, no, you can't go from DP to Thunderbolt, only Thunderbolt to DP] <comment363320> https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/173735/display-port-to-thunderbolt-display or https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/93224/can-i-use-a-thunderbolt-display-for-a-macbook-pro-with-a-mini-display-port
