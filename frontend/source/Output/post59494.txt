Where can I buy iMovie that is compatible with SL? <body> I just upgraded my macbook to SL and wanted to upgrade iMovie too. But the system requirement for the version available on App Store is 10.7.4 or later. Where can I purchase one that would work on a SL 10.6.8? Thanks.  <answer59496> I found that on ebay you can buy iLife '09. If you look at the iLife '09 tech specs, you can see this:     strongSoftware:/strong   brMac OS X v10.5.6 or later.   So that should work for you if you have SL. iLife '09 is also available on Amazon.   <comment68529> Thank you for the links. I didn't intend to buy the whole set, but guess I can't purchase iMovie individually? <comment68530> @vul3 - The only ways you could bet it individually would be to go through illegitimate channels (torrents), so no I guess. Sorry. It's a marketing ploy by Apple to make you spend money on the entire set. <comment68531> I see, think I'll just pay for it then! At least it's cheaper than Mac Box Set...thanks again!
