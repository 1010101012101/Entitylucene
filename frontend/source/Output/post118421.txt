Does APNS work over LTE, or only UMTS/GSM and WiFi? <body> Over at Android Enthusiasts, we are having a discussion of what's more battery-life efficient&nbsp;&mdash; having APNS over GSM or UMTS networks during sleep, as TS4264 appears to indicate (thus having the capability to completely turn off the WiFi interface), or using WiFi during sleep, in order to keep the persistent TCP connection to Apple/Google servers that's required for APNS/GCM.  My understanding is that, due to GSM or UMTS already being required to be on at all times, for the incoming voice calls over the mobile network PSTN, there is little extra power required to also keep the data on, too, compared to keeping an extra WiFi chipset on instead of off.  However, in the case of LTE, it would appear that LTE may so far be incapable of handling voice calls, with Voice-over-LTE (VoLTE) still being in its infancy; as such, it is my assumption that when the LTE is on, in many cases, either GSM or UMTS has to be on, too.  strongWhat does iOS do in the presence of LTE in regards to APNS?  Does it not keep an LTE connection on during the sleep?  Does it vary, depending on whether VoLTE is activated?/strong
