Spotlight index has ghost app that I cannot get rid of <body> Spotlight has ghost entries for an USB disk that I cannot get rid of. It links to a bootable usb disk that is not currently connected. I have added that disk to Spotlight Privacy. Nothing I have tried unloading, reseting, deleting and reloading spotlight. Nothing.   These ghost entries do not show up when using Finder search.  Where are Spotlight caches stored other than code.Spotlight-V100/code ? There must be a place so that they survive cache rebuilding.  I am on 10.12.1 MBP and it is a clean install from two days. No use of migration assistant, etc. No external disk currently connected. Single partition.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/tEYGa.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer258888> The indexing is not finished, I would wait until it is finished before considering an error.   If the indexing is still going on 2 days after the clean install, you either have a big drive with a lot of files or it's hung on something. That usually happens with wrong permissions on some files and in worse cases because of I/O errors of the drive.   In order to check that you should take the following steps:  First: run the Disc Utility found in /Applications/Utilities/ to check your drive and repair permissions. Details for usage can be found on the Apple Support Pages found here  Next: I strongly suggest you rebuild the Spotlight Index in any case. A guide to do that can be found on the Apple Support Page here (In short: Click on the Apple Icon  Privacy  add your drive, confirm, then remove it again)  Most likely your problems will be solved after these steps.  <answer258891> In addition to the answer of @J.C. you can find out where the location is by pressing in Spotlight the kbdCMD/kbd key. At bottom you see the path of the selected item. Double click on the item during hold down the kbdCMD/kbd will open the location.  strongWorkaround (hope this help)/strong  Please Plug the named drive to your Mac.

I have rebuilt the index several times already, letting it go to completion. It does not resolve the issue. The pointer for this ghost record stubbornly remains. <comment323754> That is the problem. It points to /Volumes/Sierra/Applications/ but that disk is not connected. <comment323790> Have you the disk still available? Connect It to your Mac and add the drive to System settings - Spotlight - Privacy to move it out of the index. <comment323794> First thing I tried. Even in the privacy tab, it still shows up in the Spotlight window. <comment323800> Add workaround hope this helps.
