How to fix incorrectly sorted albums whose titles contain numbers <body> I have an iPod Classic 160gb 6g. In Cover Flow it appears that some of the albums containing numbers in the title will end up at the end of the alphabet. For example, this is the end of the Cover Flow:  ul liUnder A Blood Red Sky - U2/li liWho's Gonna Ride Your Wild Horses - U2/li liBringing Down The Horse - The Wallflowers/li lixx - The xx/li liYoung The Giant - Young The Giant/li liEagles Greatest Hits Volume 2 - The Eagles/li liErasure: Pop! 20 Hits - Erasure/li li99.5 The Mountain Homegrown Vol. 6 - Live at The Soiled Dove Underground - Various Artists/li /ul  However, there are some albums, such as these, which are alphabetized correctly:  ul liGreatest Hits, Vol. 1: The Singles - Goo Goo Dolls/li liThe 2nd Law - Muse/li liTKOL RMX 1234567 [Disc 1] - Radiohead/li /ul  Why is this happening, and how do I fix it?  <answer99738> Verify that the "Sort Album" is set correctly in iTunes. It may be set to have the numbers at the beginning of the title for some reason, and iTunes sorts album names that start with numbers after "z".  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/OihQ0.jpg" alt="iTunes info window, sorting tab"
