Accidentally deleted Applications link in Favorites in Finder <body> I accidentally deleted the Applications link in Favorites in Finder.  (I dragged it into the Terminal hoping to do a cd to the Applications folder---not that that matters.)  How can I restore it?  <answer167942> Go to Finder → Preferences (⌘,) → Sidebar and check Applications.                                    img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/AyUcC.png" width="355"
