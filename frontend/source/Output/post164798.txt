Copy files after the current copy operation is completed <body> I sometimes need to copy a lot of files from here and there to an external drive. What I do is copy some files, paste it in the drive, copy some more files, then paste again etc. But this makes the files copy parallelly which slows down the drive.  Is there a way (maybe a third-party app to install) that would queue the second copy until the first copy operation is completed?  <answer164799> ol liPathfinder from Cocoatechbr It's called codeQueue file operations/code or codeCopy queue/code:  Open in the menubar Windows - File Operations (or shortcut: kbdalt/kbdkbdcmd/kbdkbdP/kbd) and enable codeQueue file operations/code. All file operations (like copy, move etc.) will be queued then.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xcIvM.png" alt="queue"/li liCopyQueue from Curio Software  You have to define new tasks (New Queue or kbdcmd/kbdkbdN/kbd) first. You may save them, if you have to use certain copy operations repeatedly.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/agyjy.png" alt="enter image description here"/li /ol  <comment193287> Thanks! PathFinder looks really great. Still worrying whether the huge price would be worth it. Going to try out the trial.
