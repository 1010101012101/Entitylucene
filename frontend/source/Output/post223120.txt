How to disable Virtualbox auto-close <body> When my computer reaches 4% battery, Virtualbox shuts off. How can I disable this or change when it happens?  <answer223124> The manual contains:  strongBattery Low/strong The battery level reached a critical level (usually less than 5 percent charged).     This event is currently only handled on Windows hosts and Mac OS X hosts. When this event is generated, VirtualBox will save the state and terminate all VMs in preperation of a potential host power down.      The behavior can be configured. By executing the following command, no VM is saved:  precode VBoxManage setextradata global "VBoxInternal2/SavestateOnBatteryLow" 0 /code/pre      This is a global setting as well as a per-VM setting. The per-VM value has higher precedence than the global value. The following command will save the state of all VMs but will not save the state of VM “foo”:  precode VBoxManage setextradata global "VBoxInternal2/SavestateOnBatteryLow" 1  VBoxManage setextradata "foo" "VBoxInternal2/SavestateOnBatteryLow" 0 /code/pre      The first line is actually not required as by default the savestate action is performed.
