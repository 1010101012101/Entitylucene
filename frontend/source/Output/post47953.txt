Can I cmd-F and click a highlighted link in Safari (or something similar) without a mouse? <body> I'm trying to make my Mac as mouseless and possible. My three last big hurdles:   ul liMoving the current window to a different space in Spaces. (I'm still on OS 10.6, until 10.8 comes out.)/li liA more efficient way to move through toolbars and menu bar than Tab. /li /ul  And  ul listrongWhen using Safari, being able to Cmd-F ("find") linked text and then click it./strong (Or some better way to move through in-page links I've not thought of.)/li /ul  <answer47984> kbdCmd/kbdkbdF/kbd-selected text doesn't seem to be available to activate.  But you can kbdOpt/kbdkbdTab/kbd / kbdOpt/kbdkbdShift/kbdkbdTab/kbdthrough the page's links until you've highlighted the one you want, then kbdEnter/kbd to activate it.    In Preferences | Advanced, you can reverse the kbdTab/kbd behavior so the kbdTab/kbd selects links and kbdOpt/kbdkbdTab/kbd selects window elements.  <answer48132> According to https://superuser.com/questions/233246/move-windows-between-spaces-in-mac-os-x-using-only-the-keyboard there is no keyboard shortcut for moving a window to a different space.  <answer48207> h3Type-to-Navigate/h3  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/EQLUU.png" alt=""  <comment54953> In FF, you can set it so that typing = searching. Not need for CMD+F. So just type the link. If it isn't unique, tab or CMD+G to get to it, then hit enter. <comment55239> Brilliant! You should submit this to Safari's extension page (unless it's there and I've not seen it). <comment55339> @fakaff It's listed in the extension gallery already. <comment55360> I've been using [Glims](http://www.machangout.com/) for this, but this looks better -- Glims isn't a new-style Safari extension, and it doesn't allow you to activate links from the keyboard either. (I'll be keeping Glims installed for one or two other things, though.)
