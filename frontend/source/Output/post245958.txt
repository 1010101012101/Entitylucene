What's an easy way to view formatted Markdown files? <body> When I tap spacebar on a code.markdown/code file in the finder, Quick Look shows me a very nicely formatted view of that file. But the view doesn't act like a normal window, I can't select text from it, etc. All the apps I have that can open Markdown files show them in edit mode, without the pretty formatting.  Short of buying an app like Marked, is there some way to open Markdown files with pretty formatting?  <answer245962> MacDown is a free and open source markdown editor (and viewer). There are others out there as well. Try googling for markdown editors for more options.  <comment303253> You should be using a search engine before posting a question. Googling "os x markdown viewer" gives the _possible duplicate_ and MacDown as the top hits. <comment303255> I searched quite a bit. MacDown seems clunky. I searched this site but with the term "markdown" not "md". Searching for "markdown preview" doesn't work. On well! <comment303257> Have a look at: [Best Markdown Editors for OS X](https://www.raywenderlich.com/119949/top-five-markdown-editors)
