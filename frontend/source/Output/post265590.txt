Thunderbolt Display Post Mortem - What should I do? <body> Hi I'm hoping you could help me make an informed decision on what to do with my 27inch Thunderbolt Display.  I purchased it from Apple refurbished about 4 years ago. Yesterday it suddenly stopped working.   I tried all the steps I could I found online to fix the problem:  ol liResetting the PRAM/NVRAM /li liResetting the SMC /li liTrying a different Thunderbolt Cord and changing outlets./li /ol  It has been completely and utterly unresponsive. The USB and Thunderbolt peripherals don't work and the built in Magsafe doesn't power my laptop.  AppleCare is expired.  My questions: 1: What’s your opinion on what could be the problem?  2: Is it worth my time to get a new power cable and see if that works?   3: Is there any way I can narrow down what the problem could be? Would there be anything in the log that contains a hint to what failed?  4: Is it affordable to bring it to Apple to be repaired since the Apple Care is expired? What do you think the expense would be? (I don’t want to pay over $200.)  5: Is an iMac power cable compatible with the Thunderbolt Display? (I might be able to borrow one.) - Just to see if the power cord is faulty.  6: Is there anything else I can do to diagnose/fix the display?  <comment333009> It's only a post-mortem if you open it & put all the funny-looking bits in glass jars :P ..Seriously, take it to a repair shop & see what their guess/quote is, bearing in mind you could pick up something similar for a couple of hundred $£€ <comment333015> 2. The display uses a standard PC power cable connector (http://images.monoprice.com/productlargeimages/52931.jpg) - you should be able to find one easily. <comment333117> Start with assuming you have a power failure: check your mains supply / wall outlet, check your cable (as Bowen suggested), check your fuses. If the power failure is internal to your display then it could be an internal fuse (easy for a local electrical repairer to fix) or a faulty power supply (easy for a local electrical repairer to diagnose, easy for a PC repairer to replace). After that you could take it to an Apple Genius Bar to see if they have any suggestions or a free diagnosis but the repair costs after that could outweigh the value of replacing your display.
