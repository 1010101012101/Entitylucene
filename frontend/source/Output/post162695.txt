How to fix iMac keyboard delay? <body> I just opened my new iMac, and the bluetooth keyboard is terrible.  When I press a key, it can take up to 3 -  5 seconds to respond, and sometimes, the keyboard acts as if I've been holding the key down.  Is there any known way to fix this?  It's extremely annoying.  Note: I'm on Yosemite  <comment190249> 'just opened'? Brand new from the store or it was OK but now it isn't? <comment190251> It's brand new from the store.  I noticed the issue immediately after beginning to use it. <comment190253> Did you set up FileVault? That will slow the machine down until it's completed. Indexing could also do it - Look at Applications/Utilities/Activity Monitor & see if you can see the processes mds or mdworker looking particularly busy <comment190258> I didn't set up FileValue, and none of my processes are taking up over 5% CPU <comment190259> How's memory pressure? [same app] If that's still well in the green, then I'm out of ideas, sorry. <comment190265> Yeah memory pressure is in the green.  I'm going into the Apple store shortly to swap this out.  Thanks for the help. <comment190266> Welcome - wish you luck.
