Change JSON and CSS files to developer kind in All My Files <body> In strongAll My Files/strong, CSS and JSON files appear in the strongDocuments/strong section, even though I would call them developer files. Is there any way I can change their emkind/em, so that they appear as strongDeveloper/strong files?  <comment114796> I think it depends on which application's UTI declarations were registered first.
