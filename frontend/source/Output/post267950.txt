Why are my calendar colors messed up on my iPhone and how can I keep them in sync? <body> I am using an iPhone 6 Plus with iOS 10.2. I am using an outlook.com account for my calendars. My calendar colors look like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kFa09.png" alt="enter image description here"  When I open my calendar settings on my iPhone calendar colors look like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4ILfe.png" alt="enter image description here"  Occasionally some these colors change over time, but they do never fit to the color settings on my outlook.com account. When I align the colors manually, they are still changing from time to time.   Any change to keep these colors in sync? Or can I at least keep my manual settings without iOS overriding these settings after a while?
