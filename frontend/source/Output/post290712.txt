Connect Wired & Wireless Headphones to iPad <body> My husband uses wired headphones &amp; I have wireless headphones. We want to connect both to his iPad. How can this be done? Thank you...  <comment366993> Well it has to be a bluetooth device. Wireless doesn't necessarily mean bluetooth. [Instructions by apple ](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204091). Simplified steps: **1.** Turn on the pairing mode in your bluetooth device. Very often, to turn on the pairing mode, you need to press and hold the power button approximately ~3 to ~5 seconds.The power LED should start blinking and they typically make sound. **2.** In the iPad, go to `Settings  Bluetooth`. Turn on bluetooth. This is where the bluetooth device will show up when set to pairing mode. Click your device.
