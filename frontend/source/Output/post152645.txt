Attempting to revert to Mac OS X Mavericks, now can't get out of OS X Utilities! <body> Here is my situation:  I have an MBP Retina 2013 with an SSD drive which I ran with Mavericks with no problems for about almost a year now.  I recently upgraded to Yosemite which seemed to work well at first, but I found that it kept freezing up after an hour or two.  This was unacceptable and I was unable to determine the cause so I decided to revert to Mavericks using my Time Machine backups, so I rebooted using cmd R.  I selected Restore from Time Machine backup and followed the steps including unlocking the FileVault.  It began to restore and then said it couldn't continue because of some sort of unspecified error.  So I tried to use the disk utility to erase the disk but the erase button was disabled.  I did verify and repair on the Macintosh HD which did not report any errors.    Then I attempted to begin a reinstall OS X but that only sees the "Recovery HD", it doesn't see my main disk partition so I can't install.  Then I rebooted, hoping to simply boot back into Yosemite but it continues to boot to OS X Utilities no matter what I do.  Now I try to do a Restore From Time Machine backup and its no longer able to find my Yosemite boot drive!  I try selecting "Startup Disk" which doesn't find any startup disks. Somehow the main drive seems to be lost, I'm unable to erase it or even access it, what do I do?  Top drive partition ("Macintosh HD") does show under disk utility Partition: Name Macintosh HD,  Format Mac OS Extended (journaled), Size 750.42 GB.  Edit: I've also tried booting to my DiskWarrior DVD but it just hangs on the Apple screen and never gets there!  My next approach is to build a Mavericks USB bootable drive and see if I can install from there.  It seems clear that my main hard drive is locked or disabled somehow, I just don't know how to get it turned back on.  <answer152745> ol liRestart your Mac to Recovery Mode by pressing kbdcmd/kbd kbdR/kbd at startup/li liLaunch emTerminal/em from the menubar Utilities-Terminal/li liEnter the following command at the Terminal prompt:  precodedefaults write com.apple.DiskUtility DUDebugMenuEnabled 1 /code/pre/li liPress enter/li liQuit Terminal/li liStart emDisk Utility/em and enable codeShow every Partition/code in the codeDebug/code menu/li liAfter a few seconds all partitions should be visible/li liActivate the partition emMacintosh HD/em if it's present and greyed out./li liErasing/formating of emMacintosh HD/em should be possible now./li /ol  If this doesn't work quit emDisk Utility/em and according to this site  ol start="10" liStart emTerminal/em and enter following command at the Terminal prompt:   precodediskutil cs list /code/pre  This will give you a list of the CoreStorage volumes on your system.

(Disk Utility  select the top drive  Partition) <comment179676> (Want this to be a comment) Do you have any backups or Time Machine entries to revert to? <comment179679> @deceze I've edited original post to show partition info. <comment179680> @user3473227 yes I have a Time Machine entry to revert to, but I have not been able to restore it to my hard drive as I described above. <comment179687> You can try to use a recovery usb http://www.gottabemobile.com/2014/10/20/how-to-downgrade-from-os-x-yosemite-to-os-x-mavericks/ <comment179795> @MrMojoRisin yes, I'm working on that too -- hopefully that will bring my disk back to life! <comment179906> Thanks so much, what an awesome answer!  The first approach worked like a charm.  It is restoring from my Time Machine even as I'm typing. <comment208187> I created an account just to say "Thank you man"! I've been searching for this solution for two days in a row! <comment208189> @vooD ;-) You are welcome!
