What filesystems does iOS use? <body> I can't find this information documented anywhere.  What filesystems do iOS devices use?  Did Apple stick with HFS+?  Is it different between devices and iOS versions?  <answer83673> I can't see any definitve Apple documents but books quoted in these Stack Overflow questions and this and this book say HFSX (ie case sensitive HFS+) which is not the same as the default for OSX.  <answer83674> The other answer seems to be correct about the file system being HFSX*, but on being case-eminsensitive/em (other answer since edited to correct), I found that not to be the case in the book Mac OS X and iOS Internals. On page 23 it says:     In iOS, being strongthe case sensitive HFSX/strong by default, case is not only   preserved, but allows for multiple files to have the same name, albeit   with a different case. Naturally, case sensitivity means typos produce   a totally different command or file reference, often a wrong one.   em[emphasis above is mine]/em   Since that didn't agree with the other answer, I sought confirmation.  I loaded a sample iOS project I was working on and changed the name of the database to only differ by case.  After running the app on my iPad mini (iOS 6.1) to re-create the database, I went into iTunes and looked at the files under File Sharing for the application.  Here's what I saw:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/C7V9e.png" alt="Screen shot from iTunes File Sharing demonstrating two file names with identical names differing only by case"  So, it would appear emMac OS X and iOS Internals/em is correct: case is preserved and allows for multiple files to have the same name.  Interestingly, when I selected both files in iTunes' File Sharing and clicked "Save to..." my desktop, I did emnot/em get any warning.  iTunes apparently "saved" both files to my desktop, but only the initial-uppercase version survived (presumably overwriting the initial-lowercase version of the file.)  hr  h1* 2017 Update to Apple File System (APFS):/h1  As of strongiOS 10.3/strong, released on March 27, 2017, iOS now uses the new strongApple File System/strong (APFS), said to be em"optimized for flash and solid-state drive storage, with a primary focus on encryption."/em  APFS was announced at WWDC 2016 and there is a WWDC video titled Introducing Apple File System, and an Apple File System Guide for developers. The features section of the guide may be of specific interest.  <answer84175> iOS indeed uses HFSX (HFS+ , case sensitive). You can also use the codeHFSleuth/code tool from the Mac OS X/iOS Internals website, to prove this, and delve deeper into the filesystem structures.  <answer270838> As of iOS 10.3 (March 2017) - APFS/Apple File System is now the file system being used.  Previous to iOS 10.3 HFS+ was being used.  APFS will add improved support for solid-state drives and encryption improvements - things that were not a priority 20 years ago when HFS+ was introduced.  <comment96328> My error I misread the quote and missed the "in" <comment96329> @Mark No problem. What's more interesting is the behaviour where it preserves both versions .. something I wouldn't have ended up reading about & testing if not for your innocent error :-) <comment126825> [In the disk of an iPhone, are *both* HFSX slices journaled?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/108166/8546) <comment340483> APFS is used by the first developer beta version of iOS 10.3; it *may* be used in the general release of iOS 10.3, but we don't know that yet.
