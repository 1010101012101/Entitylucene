Disk utility in command line <body> I'm looking for the codeCLI/code equivalent of "Check disk" and "repair disk" in Disk Utility. I think codefsck/code is involved but I don't know with which options, and if it's the only program run.  <answer24004> In fact, Disk Utility does use fsck to check the disk in question. "Verify Disk" uses  precode /sbin/fsck_hfs -fn -x /dev/diskX /code/pre  while "Repair Disk" runs  precode/sbin/fsck_hfs -fy -x /dev/diskX /code/pre  These are the options used:  -f: 'f'orces a check, even if the disk seems to be clean  -n: 'n'ever attempts to repair any found issues  -y: says 'y'es to any question whether an issues should be repaired (as you might have guessed, -n and -y are exact opposites)  -x: generates output in XML format, which is parsed by Disk Utility  /sbin/fsck (as opposed to /sbin/fsck_hfs) is a wrapper that calls /sbin/fsck_XXX for the type of file system in question. You'll get more information in the man pages for fsck and fsck_hfs, from which I've borrowed a lot of information for my reply.  <answer40147> code/usr/sbin/diskutil/code is what you are looking for.  Checkout codeman diskutil/code and look at the coderepairVolume/code command.  <comment27126> Hum, it seems that the disk utility is doing much more than the single `fsck_hfs -fy`. The former worked, while the latter failed with the message 'Disk reparation faild. Aborting.'. <comment62555> The advantage of using `diskutil` over `fsck_hfs`, is that where for example `$ fsck_hfs -fy /dev/disk1s2` might not fix errors found "_** Cannot repair volume when it is mounted with write access. ** The volume Backup could not be repaired._", where `$ diskutil repairVolume /Volumes/Backup` unmounts the Volume and fixes the problems found.
