Is it possible to install Windows 8 on a MacbookPro13,3? <body> I tried booting a Windows 8 installation CD and first of all, my keyboard/trackpad didn't work, so I had to use external ones. When I got to the part where I'm supposed to choose which hard drive to install to, it didn't recognize my partition (tried both MS-DOS and Windows NT).   I then tried downloading the latest Bootcamp drivers and put them on a USB and put it in the computer, I clicked on "Search for drivers" but it didn't recognize any of the drivers on the USB as drivers.   This used to work on a  MacbookPro10,3. Is it not possible on a MacbookPro13,3 or did I do something wrong.  <comment329175> Can you please post the years instead of the model numbers? It's much easier to figure out which MacBook model you're talking about if I can know the year. <comment329199> @IronCraftMan Macbook Pro Late 2016. <comment329200> You can only run Windows 10 on that MacBook. Apple only has driver support for your MacBook Pro running Windows 10 and later <comment329212> @IronCraftMan Alright thanks, that's good to know.
