Change macOS's Hide App cmd-H behavior? <body> I find it incredibly irritating that sometimes kbdCommand/kbdkbdH /kbd has an effect and sometimes it doesn't. It seems like after using Hide Others (kbdOption/kbdkbdCommand/kbdkbdH /kbd), it will refuse to hide the current window. The workaround is to click outside of it, maybe press kbdEsc/kbd, click back in, and try again.  IMO this is a really bad UX pattern. Instead, I want kbdCommand/kbdkbdH /kbd to hide the window regardless of what I've told the OS to do before. Sure, I said show it a few minutes ago! But now, I want it hidden.  Anyone know a setting or app that can change this behavior?  <comment374159> I just confirmed this behavior in El Capitan and you don't have to hit Esc.  You can just click the desktop and then click the window.  It could be a bug that should be reported:  [Apple Feedback](https://www.apple.com/feedback/) <comment374160> Thanks, I'll do that. <comment374164> What should be displayed **after** hiding all others **and** hiding the last remaining? <comment374165> @klanomath The Desktop. Exactly the same as if I click the Desktop, then click back to the app, then hide the App. <comment374166> @Dogweather The desktop is related to the Finder which is hidden (by the Hide others... command). <comment374174> I don't think it's a **bad** UX design nor a bug. I'd expect it to work like this. After hiding all other apps and trying to hide the last remaining it's impossible to determine which app should be unhidden instead. Therefore most apps disable the cmd-h shortcut in hide-others mode. I've found a Java and a VPN app though, which don't disable cmd-H and open an arbitrary hidden app after entering this shortcut.
