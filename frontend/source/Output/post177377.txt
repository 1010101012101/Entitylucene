MacBook Air boots into wrong partition <body> I have two partitions created, one called "Yosemite" and the other is my default 10.6.8 partition "Macintosh HD".   I successfully installed Yosemite onto the "Yosemite" partition, but when I try and boot the partition by pressing alt-option at startup, it simply boots me back into my Macintosh HD.  Even after attempting to boot to a thumb drive, it still boots back into Macintosh HD. I tried to change the startup disk in System Preferences, but the only things that show up are "Mac OS X, 10.6.8 on MacBook Air 13" and "Network Startup".  <comment209799> Please open Terminal.app, enter `diskutil list`, hit Enter and add the result to your question by copying and pasting it.
