How to find local trends on Twitter for iPhone? <body> I think we can all agree that the "# Discover" button in the official Twitter for iPhone app is a big waste of screen space. I never really rely on Twitter to "Discover" anything other than that which is said by those who I follow. But if there was one thing I did want to discover, it would be local trends. Is there any way to access this information in Twitter for iPhone? Is there another app that better serves this information?  <answer39958> From my experience, the Twitter App uses location services for Trends. Is that enabled on your phone? Like you, I don't use the #Discover page often because it is just not relevant to me.  <comment45256> Location services are on yet trends seem to be national, at best (There's currently a "Rooney" in there). Where can I see NYC trends?
