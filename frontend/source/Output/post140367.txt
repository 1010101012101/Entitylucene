4 devices on 1 Apple ID no have problems <body> We have 2 iPad minis and 2 iPhones on the same Apple ID when I text my husband it goes to all 4 devices including mine twice. When anyone messages from the other 3 devices it goes to all 4 including my phone twice. When anyone tries to FaceTime  any of our devices it goes to all 4 devices. How can we get it to only go to one device ( the one we are sending the message to)?   <answer140368> strongUse different Apple IDs on each device./strong Using the same Apple ID will mean that the devices will be indistinguishable to FaceTime/iMessage/etc.  <answer140382> As mentioned, you should use a different Apple ID on each device, for Messaging.  However, for the emStore/em, you can use the same ID across devices to allow you to share apps, music and other purchased content.  <answer140391> strongiCloud Accounts/strong are strongPersonal/strong, so this means, every Apple User emshould/em have an strongown/strong iCloud Account.   You can use your emiCloud Accounr/em for the emStore/em and emiCloud Services/em and your husband can use it also in the Store.   (Best way is to add first the new iCloud Account on your husbands Phone - switch to AppStore App - logout from iCloud Account - login with AppleID with Payment or purchased Apps)   In the Future you can set up a Family Account (iOS 8 Feature) so it will be no Problem to share purchased Apps and Games with the emPersonal iCloud Account/em of you Husband.  <comment165488> not for each Device - Use different `Apple IDs` / `iCloud Accounts` for every Person?? <comment165495> @bMalum They're synonymousâ€”doing one does the other.
