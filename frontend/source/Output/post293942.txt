macOS Sierra Shortcuts (cmd + space / cmd + shift space) stopped working <body> On my MacBook Pro late 2016 with touchbar, I notice that cmd + space (Alfred) and cmd + shift + space (spotlight) would stop working a few times a day. Going back to its settings to reregister the shortcuts will work till they stop working again the next time. I tried resettings keyboard shortcuts but that didn't fix anything.
