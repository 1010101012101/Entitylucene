Display external video on iMac <body> I am considering purchasing an iMac. Our office situation is such that the new computer will be placed where a monitor is presently located for a Windows laptop connected via a docking station.  Is it possible to connect external video to an iMac? Alternatively, is the iMac capable of hooking up to a second monitor? (my monitor has multiple inputs which I could just switch between) Are there other options that I am missing?  <answer3136>    Is it possible to connect external video to an iMac?   Yes, the latest 27" iMac can act as a monitor via Mini DisplayPort. From Apple:     Mini DisplayPort output with support for DVI, VGA, and dual-link DVI (adapters sold separately); strong27-inch models also support input from external DisplayPort sources (adapters sold separately)/strong   You'll need an adapter to convert your laptop output to Mini DisplayPort. Be careful, as some adapters, such as those provided by Apple, are designed to emoutput/em DVI/VGA/etc, and aren't capable of being reversed to accept it as input.  strongfurther reading:/strong http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3924  <comment2778> Are you asking about using the existing external display with both the iMac and the laptop, or using the iMac's internal display for both itself and the laptop's external display? <comment2781> @Dori I'd like to use iMac's internal display. <comment26125> Can i connect a PS3 to the iMac 27 i7 mid 2011? <comment26126> @Herr I don't think so, the newest iMacs [can only accept Thunderbolt video input](http://www.tuaw.com/2011/05/03/target-display-mode-missing-in-action-on-new-imacs/), and I don't think there are any adapters yet <comment160412> possible duplicate of [Console + iMac 27" 2011 External Display](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/23418/console-imac-27-2011-external-display)
