In Screen Sharing, how do I stop the local Mac from grabbing Mission Control keyboard shortcuts meant for the remote Mac? <body> I have two Macs, each with code^-1/code through code^-4/code configured to switch between Mission Control desktops in Keyboard/Shortcuts. When I use Screen Sharing, these shortcuts always go to the local Mac, never to the remote Mac, regardless of whether the remote Mac otherwise has focus.  If I go into Keyboard/Shortcuts and disable these on the local Mac, I can then use them on the remote Mac. However, it's a hassle to toggle these every time I start/stop using Screen Sharing. Is there a way to get the local Mac to stop grabbing the shortcuts?  <answer166579> I have my local machine set to use Option for Mission Control.  I set the remote Macs to use Control.  This way, I have entirely separate key combinations.  <comment195334> I may have to settle for something like that, but it's annoying enough getting my fingers to learn to switch back and forth between my MacBook's keyboard and the PC keyboard I have plugged into my iMac.
