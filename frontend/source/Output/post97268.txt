About how large is a clean install of OS X? <body> If you were to wipe a hard drive clean and install OS X Mountain Lion, with one user account and no user data files. (so simply OS files) How large, in disk space, would OS X (how much hard drive space would be used on that unused system?)  <answer97271> The codeInstall OS X Mountain Lion.app/code I have is about 4 GB, but the uncompressed size shown by Pacifist is about 9 GB. My initial snapshot of a 10.8 VM was about 11 GB, but about 1 GB was taken up by code/var/vm/swapfile/code.  If you have a laptop with 4 GiB of RAM, code/var/vm/sleepimage/code will take up about 4 GiB after you put the laptop to sleep once.
