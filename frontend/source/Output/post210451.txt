Key Combination to Make All Instances of App the Same Window Size <body> Is there a default Mac OSX key combination that'll make all of my open windows/instances for a given application the same dimension (height/width)? Is there a way to do this with codeAutomator/code (not experienced with it enough to know if it's doable)? Or, an codeAppleScript/code script that I could initiate using a "hot-key" combination?  strongScenario/strong: I have multiple instances of the notes app open and would like to resize them to some arbitrary size, preferably stacked staggered on top of each-other.  strongFrom/strong:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/OtRuo.png" alt="enter image description here"  strongTo/strong:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/JOISI.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment254008> Not sure about Automator, but AppleScript handles Windows pretty well. <comment254009> @IronCraftMan just updated the question. hopefully someone's already solved this and can provide a solution. <comment254013> Take a look at this website: [https://macosxautomation.com/applescript](https://macosxautomation.com/applescript).
