Making music CDs with ITunes <body> I have 4 CDs I made from music tracks using iTunes and I was wondering if those are MP3 or some other format. Is it possible to read them with a non-MP3 player, such as a car CD player?  <answer5585> If you create a playable CD with iTunes, then the software converts them to a format that can be played through any hi-fi or CD player and burns that to a disc. If it was a data CD you used, then that works in a similar way to a USB flash drive, just copying the files and burning them to a CD. These will not be playable in a CD player, but you can get the files off from a computer.  Hope this helps.  <comment5729> I think I selected Audio Cd, is it readable then? <comment5730> Yes, that should be fine, and should play like any other CD in any CD players. Go ahead and try it out! Cheers. <comment5740> Worked fine, thanks. <comment5744> Excellent, your welcome
