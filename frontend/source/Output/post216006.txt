Date and address links in emails not resolving <body> Before I upgraded to 10.10.5, dates/times and physical address were recognized and highlighted by Mail such that I could click on the drop down icon and save them to the Calendar or Contacts, respectively. Mail still recognizes them, but when I click on the [v] menu button the button just disappears. No menu. No automatic additions to Calendar or Contacts.
