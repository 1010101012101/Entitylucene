How do I ensure smooth video and music playback without breaks? <body> I'm using a MacBook Pro from 2011 with 4 GB RAM and I'm experiencing problems with music playback in iTunes (music stops and starts periodically) and video playback does the same.    I've read many forum discussions, repaired permissions on my harddrive, and to free up RAM have occassionally used the Terminal to purge the cache of 'inactive' memory - but then it keeps crawling back up.    I'm not running massive amounts of heavy duty programs... and it seems strange that my system would do this.  I've updated iTunes and my OS X (Lion) and still the problem persists...   Anyone else experiencing this annoying skip / pause in music and video and found a solution?   Thanks
