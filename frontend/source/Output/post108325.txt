How can I determine what application is asking "Where is GrowlHelperApp.App?" <body> I recently upgraded to OS X 10.9 Mavericks and am now seeing a "Choose Application" dialog pop up every minute or two asking: "Where is the GrowlHelperApp.app?". I don't particularly want to buy the new version of Growl, so how can I determine which application is looking for it so that I can change it's preferences or remove it?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lIhVZ.png" alt="Choose Application dialog: Where is GrowlHelperApp.app?"  Update: It turns out that it was an old Dashboard widget that was looking for Growl. I found this out by deleting all of my Dashboard widgets since I haven't used it in a while, but I'd still be interested in finding out how one would discover what is launching this dialog.  <answer108347> You could have used codesudo opensnoop/code to see what files are being opened or fseventer to see what files are being modified.  Those dialogs are often shown by AppleScripts that have reference a missing application. You could also have tried running codemdfind GrowlHelperApp/code, but it doesn't search the contents of compiled scripts or scripts saved as applications.  <answer139205> Helped me solve this problem I am having an awful lot of time. The codemdfind GrowlHelperApp/code with combo of deleteting the resource files found helped me to remove the annoying popup window. In my case, Firefox was the rooting problem app.  <comment127031> What apps are running when this pops up?
