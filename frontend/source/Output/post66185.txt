Where and how I find the songs in iphone 5 which were downloaded into itunes <body> Can someone help me with this. As I am new to iPhone and itunes. I have couple of songe (audio format) downloaded from internet and added into "My Music" in itunes. I have synced my iphone 5 with itunes in my PC. But on iPhone where these songs would have been downloaded?? When I go to the itunes tab on iphone 5 it takes me straight to it main page and if I go the downloaded ones then that one is empty.   <answer66202> The iTunes app on the iPhone is for browsing the iTunes emstore/em. The Downloads tab there only shows you songs that are currently being downloaded from the store. If I understand correctly, you're tapping this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/oOt5d.png" alt="iTunes.app"  Check the strongMusic/strong app on the phone instead - synced music should show up there:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/EZpvo.png" alt="Music.app"  <comment78421> Which format are these songs in (MP3, WAV, AAC etc)? Did you either select "Sync all music" or selected the songs for syncing?
