Is there a command like namei for OS X? <body> I'm sifting through some incorrect permission issues and discovered the namei command for Linux. Homebrew doesn't currently have a Mac port.     namei - follow a pathname until a terminal point is found   Is there a command or series of commands that can be used to accomplish the same thing on OS X?  <answer143754> Macports has a port of it: https://trac.macports.org/browser/trunk/dports/devel/util-linux/Portfile  I did try to make a homebrew recipe for it, but there were some issues getting it to compile. It's definitely possible, but there are some problems to work out.  emUpdate/em:  I've made a formula that can be installed with:  precodebrew install mkdryden/homebrew-misc/namei /code/pre  This is the original version, not the version pulled into util-linux. (not sure how much has changed since the original)  <answer234822> I've found this to be a possible solution:  precodels -l /path/to/directory /code/pre  <answer234829> You can download the source code for codenamei/code from SourceForge. To compile, you need to delete the code#include &lt;sys/sysmacros.h&gt;/code line from codestat.c/code, then run codemake/code.  <comment287349> Thanks, I wasn't aware that the version in util-linux was based on the one from SourceForge. I did eventually figure out how to get the util-linux one to compile, but it comes with many other utilities, a lot of which are redundant on OS X. Anyways, see my updated answer for the homebrew formula of the original. Beware, installing from source with `make install` can cause issues if `/usr/local/bin' is ahead of `/usr/bin` in your PATH as it installs hardlinked to `stat`. The formula avoids this and only installs under namei. <comment291925> This only shows the first symlink layer, not the entire symlink chain.
