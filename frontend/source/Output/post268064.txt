buy app for a different itunes account <body> I administer a small network with several Macs, in which each user is using a personal iTunes account on his/her machine.   Now, I would like to buy and install Apple's Keynote on their machines. I was looking for an option to buy the software with my account and "send" it to another iTunes account. Is that even possibile?   Thanks.  <comment336443> thanks - didn't found it before posting. That's what I was looking for.
