iOS10 restrict "Look Up" feature to dictionary alone <body> I have just upgraded to iOS10 and found that the "Define" feature (that appears after selecting a word) has been replaced with "Look Up", which now pulls the suggestions from various sources on internet besides the local dictionary.  Is there a way to restrict this "Look Up" feature to search in local dictionaries alone? I couldn't find any solutions on the internet as of today (14th Sep16).  <answer252687> The instructions are in the "About Lookup &amp; Privacy" that you read before using it for the first time... I can't figure out how you could get to see that a second time, fortunately I grabbed a screenshot while I was there.  Settings  General  Spotlight Search - disable Suggestions, for Search &amp;/or Look up.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KkBaw.png" width="280"
