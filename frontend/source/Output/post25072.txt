How do I change a username? (shortname and home folder) <body> Under Linux, this would be a no brainer. Just go into /etc/password and edit that, and rename the directory in /home.  I want the new shortname and the new home folder to match after the change.   <answer25073> In strongSystem Preferences/strong, strongUsers &amp; Groups/strong, right click the username in the list on the left and select strongAdvanced Options/strong. Edit the strongAccount name/strong field and click strongOk/strong.  Ideally you'll also want to edit the strongHome directory/strong to match the new username, although this isn't strictly necessary.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZhGkd.png" alt="screenshot"  <answer25074> Apple's own instructions work quite well. There may be more complex and faster ways out there, but I've never run into an issue (such as incorrect permissions) with these steps.  Mac OS X v10.6 and earlier: How to change user account name or home directory name  <answer25109> I really don't like to edit a user in place since it's so simple to delete the user (preserving the home folder) - rename the folder as root - make the new user with the correct short name matching the renamed folder.   The preference pane will see that you already have /Users/newshort and offer to inherit the folder. It does the best job I know of in setting ownership and correcting the ACL needed for your home folder to work as Apple intended.   hr  ol liCheck your backup is current - strongemjust in case/em/strong/li liDo the delete img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mlfqs.png" alt="enter image description here"/li liDo the move in terminal codesudo -s/code followed by codemv /Users/tester\ \(Deleted\)/ /Users/test/code/li liDo the create img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NnGIY.png" alt="enter image description here"/li /ol  <comment28255> How do we change the home directory to match the username? Renaming it in finder doesn't seem to work <comment28262> Just a side note: in Linux it not so straightforward. You also have to update `/etc/group`, eventual mail alias (e.g., username@machine)  and all the places where your old username is present (usually many). <comment28267> Ingmar Hupp is referring to the dialog box that appears when you select "Advanced Options." <comment28331> You should *probably* run the "Repair Permissions" task in Disk Utility after performing this action. Since the Unix user ID will be different after deleting and creating a new user. <comment28338> Repair Permissions never touches a user home folder. It only fixes software that Apple has installed by looking at /Library/Receipts (or the newer receipts database) - the user permissions are only set by the preference pane / dscl / open directory that's new in Lion. <comment28343> This is certainly the "official" way to go - but it has two drawbacks: The big one, is you end up with a different UID. It's not a big deal, but for most people, keeping user number 501 is the least hassle when connecting an external drive to another mac. The other is it's longer than needed. I presume Apple decided to have a much longer process to avoid telling someone to delete a user account since some people will not read things and end up deleting everything - potentially without a backup. <comment28345> I did not realize the bit about the UID - haven't run into a problem regarding the UID, but it's certainly something to consider. <comment29357> This worked fine for me, thanks. I thought it would be harder.
