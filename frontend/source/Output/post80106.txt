Alternatives To Apple Dock - Taskbar <body> This box helps explain the association that I always have had.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jd3HX.gif" alt="enter image description here"   We bought a Mac.  I like many parts about it.  It syncs with my iphone etc...  I can't learn the dock.  I am afraid we might need to move back to Windows.  I can't stand it.  I've tried explaining to myself how to minimize it into the corner and strongtried minimizing applications to icon/strong, but no luck.  h2Is there an application to display a list?  I'm not looking for alternative techniques for understanding.  I really needs a list, not a dock./h2  Preferably it would work look similar to Windows Dock.  Having used applications like emQuicksilver/em before, and knowing the ingenuity and geniuses in the Mac community it feels like someone could create something like this.  <answer81248> Maybe Hyperdock helps. It shows thumbnails of all open program windows when resting the mouse pointer on a dock icon. One can click on a thumbnail in order to bring the respective window to the front.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/otWQH.png" alt="Screenshot"  I cannot live without. Available from the app store.  <answer88206> strongDragThing/strong is a commercial application that can display a list of running applications. It can be configured to create a Windows-like taskbar.  ol liClick the  in the topleft corner, click Dock, then click Left or Right to move the dock to left or right. (so it won't get in the way of the Windows-like taskbar you are going to create, while you can still use it as a handy app launcher.)/li liDownload DragThing (thanks to this page for telling me about it) . It costs US $29 but you can try it for free. However, if you like it you should buy it./li liOpen the downloaded DMG file, drag the DragThing icon to the applications folder, delete the DMG file, open the applications folder (or Launchpad if you have Mountain Lion) and open DragThing./li liMake sure DragThing is the active application (It says "DragThing" next to the  in the topleft corner then), press ⌘+0 and close all the DragThing windows except the one that appeared when you pressed that./li liRight click on the window that appeared when you pressed ⌘+0 and click Rotate./li liDrag it to the center of the bottom of the screen./li liRight click again on it and click "Dock settings..."./li liSet the following (got most of it from this page):     Set "Float Dock Window" to Always      Turn "Show Window Title Bar" off      Set "Icon Size" to 16×16      Set "Spacing" to 0      Set "Width" to about 70      Set "Show Item Names" to Right      Turn "Use Single-Click To Open Items" on (can be found at Advanced tab)      Turn "Lock position" on (can be found at Advanced tab) /li liClose the window/li liEnjoy your shiny new taskbar! Eventually right click it and select a new color./li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/TtMVr.png" alt="Screenshot"  <answer88209> h2DragThing/h2  Here is some more information about DragThing, in addition to com. BOY's answer.  I have owned and used this program for more than ten years. There is a free trial; the app costs US $29.  Among other features, DragThing can be configured to display a floating strong"Process Dock"/strong, a panel of the icons of applications that are currently open and running -- and only the ones currently running. Unlike the Dock, it emdoes not/em show icons of applications that are emnot/em running right now. (You can create other panels or docks to display tabbed groups of icons of frequently-used applications that you want to launch.)  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/y59Dp.png" alt="enter image description here"  You can position strongDragThings' Process Dock/strong on the bottom of the screen if you want; I have it in the upper-right corner of my screen. Visually, you can choose from many different color schemes and designs. I chose the "heads-up-display" translucent black design.  In the "Process Dock", clicking on one of these open application icons will immediately bring that application to the forefront. This is analogous to the bar at the bottom of the Windows desktop.  There are four kinds of panels or docks that DragThing can create:  ul listrongDock/strong to show tabbed multiple panels of your favorite apps organized and grouped any way you like /li listrongDisk Dock/strong to show connected hard disks, CDs and DVDs, and servers /li listrongProcess Dock/strong, as I have discussed above/li listrongWindow Dock/strong to show open application windows (your elderly relative might be able to use this too.)/li /ul  DragThing is not designed to be "Windows-like". If anything, it resembles features of Mac OS 9, the "classic" MacOS. But I think it will do the trick.  DragThing has myriad configuration settings that you can customize; far too many. It's daunting. But once you figure out the features and configure it the way you want, it will just work.  I have used DragThing for more than ten years. I can't live without it.  Having configured everything I want in two DragThing panels: a Process Dock in the upper right-hand corner of my screen; and a tabbed icon panel on the bottom of my screen, strongI subsequently banished Apple's Dock off the screen and I virtually never use or look at Apple's Dock anymore./strong   Here is a review of DragThing from MacWorld Magazine from two months ago.  If you can't figure out how to configure DragThing to function like you want, you can email the developer, James Tomson, for tech support.  <answer143072> uBar is a Windows-style taskbar for OS X that I developed. Be sure to set strongWindow Grouping/strong to strongNever/strong in the preferences, and it will exactly replicate the behaviour you are looking for.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nGdwY.png" alt="uBar taskbar for Mac"  <answer195605> DockShelf is a general Dock replacement and can be used to add emprocess docks/em to any side of the screen (shown at different sizes, styles and as a tab in the screen shot).  I use Windows on and off for short periods of time and managing windows is a problem for me also so I'd recommend not minimizing windows at all but instead hiding an application (command-H) when you're not using it.  When you select another application using any of the dock methods mentioned, all the windows will appear on screen at once.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dQMFC.png" alt="enter image description here"  In the interest of full disclosure I am the developer of DockShelf.  <comment92420> I wonder about her trying to use Launchpad? That way, you would clean off the dock - completely - except for Finder, which you can't remove, and the Launchpad icon. Then the programs that are open will appear down in the dock. Just a thought. Obviously, you have BootCamp if all else fails as well. <comment92422> @bassplayer7 It really becomes an issue when she has more then one of the same application open.  For example she will get confused when she opens 2 Word Documents.  She can't understand where to click to bring up the last one. <comment92431> How did she solve the "two Word documents" situation in Windows? If you are looking for an app to mimic the Windows Taskbar we should know in detail how she worked through the different Use Cases during the day. <comment92451> If it's just a matter of minimizing, what about going to System Preferences  Dock and **un**-checkmarking "Minimize windows into application icon"? That keeps every window separate. *I'm still thinking out loud here.* <comment92475> @patrix Good catch.  The picture doesn't represent her set up exactly.  In her system, the taskbar would display Documents side by side in the taskbar.  The grouping feature would be unchecked under "properties" so yes the picture is wrong. <comment92476> @bassplayer7 I believe it has more to do with having a 1 click always correct location to bring up the window.  For example if she had a Microsoft Word windows open "Word Document 1" and "Word Document 2" She could always click "Word Document 1" in the taskbar to bring up the window no matter if she minimized, maximized, etc.  In mac osx she can't make the linkage so well because the same icon can represent 3 Microsoft Windows applications open.  Additionally there isn't any text anywhere to remind of what she does have open. <comment266554> @William I understand absolutely what we both can't stand! You shouldn't force your self to use mac, computers should fit users not the opposite way. <comment320857> Use expose. Or click on the application, then click window up the top. <comment345813> Outstanding! This post is very helpful. I'd give it 100 up-votes. <comment353278> How can you display actually windows open like you have it and not docks icons? <comment353280> @William What do you mean? What does it look like for you? <comment353304> My computer just what it represented basically by the dock icons.  Example here in pic https://i.stack.imgur.com/VuuJU.png <comment353307> Is there a way to prevent this from showing Finder all the time even when you have no Finder windows open? <comment372061> This is awesome, but why so pricy though?
