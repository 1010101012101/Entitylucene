Text box not appearing in a Messages conversation <body> I have a recurring problem in Messages on my Mac where, in one group conversation in particular, the text box occasionally disappears. Instead of having a text box at the bottom of the screen I can type into, the conversation simply goes all the way down. When this happens, the text box still appears in every other conversation; I can also still send messages in that conversation from my iPhone. It disappears only on my Mac, and only on that one conversation. The problem persists when I shut down Messages and start it back up. Sometimes the text box comes back, and then later disappears again, on a pattern that I have not been able to discern.  Any thoughts?  Messages 8.0br Mac OS 10.10.2  <answer216013> From another site, try disabling and then re-enabling the account in question as follows.   Within the Messages app:  ul liSelect the conversation that has the problem (I don't know that this is necessary, but I did it anyway)/li liGo to Messages-Preferences...-Accounts/li liIn the box at the left hand side, select the account in question -- it will probably be your Apple ID with "iMessage" below it/li liThen over on the right, make sure "Settings" (and not "Blocked") is selected near the top/li liStill on the right, underneath your Apple ID, uncheck "Enable this account"/li listrongAt that point, back in the main Messages app you should see the text box reappear at the bottom of the conversation/strong/li liThen re-check "Enable this account"/li /ul  Done.  P.S. This was done on emOS X El Capitan/em (Version 10.11.1), and emMessages/em app version 9.0 (5084)  <comment261006> Same problem. Any answers? <comment301844> This only helps short term. Every time I do this, a short while later, the input field is gone again.
