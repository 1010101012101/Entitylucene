Add line over letter in Pages, Keynote <body> In Cocoa programs in Mac OS it is possible, using the fonts palette, add line below the character (underline), in the middle of the character (strikethrough), changing the stile of the line: single, double, colour.  I need to add a line above a character (to represent antiparticles in particle physics). Is it possible to do without using drawing tools?  I need a line being possible to add above any character, not just ones that have lines in certain languages.  <answer101791> You can use Unicode combining character U+0305 COMBINING OVERLINE. It can be found by searching in the strongEdit → Special Characters…/strong palette, or by using a specialized keyboard layout such as the built-in Unicode Hex Input or my own custom one mostly designed for mathematics.  Here's some sample text with overlines, but note that the quality of the results varies widely with the font and software in use:     A̅ B̅ C̅ D̅ a̅ b̅ c̅ d̅ α̅ β̅ γ̅ δ̅ ε̅   Also, since the position of the overline depends on the height of the character, it will not necessarily align over multiple adjacent characters.  When using Unicode combining characters directly, you type them emafter/em the base character (and once you do so, they will be treated as one unit for editing purposes). This is the opposite of classic “dead key” combinations like kbdOption/kbd-kbde/kbd kbda/kbd á where you specify the accent first.  <answer101799> If you are doing more than just individual characters separated by text, I'd suggest you use an equation editor.  Pages can import MathType or you can use something online, like   http://www.codecogs.com/latex/eqneditor.php  to produce images you can insert.  Latex for this particular thing is \bar{a} or \overline{a}  <answer145681> A quick and dirty solution in Pages 5, is to select the text you want a line over and add "____" as "Phonetic Guide Text" from the Format menu. The line might be slightly thinner than you want, but it's fast and requires no extra tools  <comment119915> I would say that is not possible, since a line would be a character space. <comment119928> related question here, but mainly discussion of where this might/might not work: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/101364/use-a-combining-macron-in-word-2011 <comment121841> Thanks for this suggestion. I didn't know about this possibility. It helped me in some cases.
