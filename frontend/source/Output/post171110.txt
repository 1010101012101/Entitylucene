Chrome Mac - NET::ERR_CERT_AUTHORITY_INVALID <body> codeAbout This Mac/code: codeOS X Yosemite 10.10.2/code &amp; codeMacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Early 2013)/code.  While trying to access GitHub Â· Build software better, together. (using codeGoogle Chrome Version 41.0.2272.43 beta (64-bit)/code), I'm getting following error:     NET::ERR_CERT_AUTHORITY_INVALID   I'm able to access same site using codeSafari/code and/or codeFirefox/code.  <answer171124> Google changed the way that Chrome handles HTTPS connections to servers that have invalid or out of date SSL certificates, and Chrome will reject the connection with the error you're seeing. I've dug around in Chrome's advanced settings and there isn't an option to allow you to selectively opt to accept the connection, though there are options to add certificate files - I haven't dug deeply enough to find the details about how one would add site certificates so that they are accepted.  <answer183129> codeChrome/code is reporting that codeDigiCert High Assurance EV Root CA/code root certificate had expired on July 2014. This issue can be address by following these steps:  ul liManually deleted my local copy of DigiCert High Assurance EV Root CA ul li(open codeKeychain Access/code, select codekeychains:login/code, select category: codecertificates/code, search for codeDigiCert/code, right click, codedelete/code)/li /ul/li liDownloaded the real cert(s) from DigiCert Root Certificates - Download &amp; Test | DigiCert.com ul liRoot Certificate Authority that the sites use: ul liDigiCert High Assurance EV Root CA /li /ul/li liIntermediate Certificate Authorities that the sites use: ul liDigiCert SHA2 Extended Validation Server CA /li liDigiCert High Assurance CA-3/li /ul/li /ul/li liAdded these certs to Keychain Access simply by double clicking them If that doesn't work you can manually import via File  Import./li /ul  hr  Use following link to test it:  DigiCert Root Certificates - Download &amp; Test | DigiCert.com  <answer206062> I had the same problem, just with respect to different sites. It took me some time to go through a number of resources (including  ul liNET::ERR_CERT_AUTHORITY_INVALID with HSTS - Google Product Forums/li litls - Why is Symantec/Verisign CA appearing as an invalid authority? - Information Security Stack Exchange/li /ul  Finally, what worked:  ul licheck which certificates do not work (click on the lock with red cross, left to codehttps/code),/li liusing Keychain Access, remove this key (is in codelogin/code, then certificates`),/li liinstall this certificate (or even a certificate family) from a trusted source./li lirestart Chrome, perhaps, for some sited I had to wait some time (10 min?)./li /ul  In my case, the problem was with emVeriSign Class 3 Primary CA - G5/em. Then, I downloaded and installed all codecrt/code files from https://www.symantec.com/page.jsp?id=roots.  <answer254899> I was getting this on Mac OS Sierra on a cert for my company.   I fixed it by:  ul ligoing into Key Chain Access. /li liFind certs for my company/li li*.COMPANYNAME.com./li liThere were two /li liRight click  Get Info /li liThen there are a number of drop down with Trust settings./li liI changed "When using this certificate" : was set to Custom I changed it to "Always Trust"/li /ul  This set all the drop downs below it to Always trust.  I opened a company website SOMESITE.MYCOMPANY.com and https error went away.  <answer267428> I've seen lots of bad information out there on this.  Commercial sites should be using trusted authorities.  If errors are seen when accessing Amazon, for example, something could be wrong.  I've seen other recommendations that turn off all invalid cert warnings.  This is something that shouldn't be done if you are a consumer on commercial sites.  A developer may do this, however.  Intranet sites inside of companies may issue their own certs.  This is when the cert needs to be added as a trusted source.  Here are the steps to add the cert to the key chain and set it to trusted:  ol liAccess the site/li liClick the warning icon (red triangle with exclamation symbol)/li liYou'll see a message stating "Your connection to this site is not secure" along with some explantory text.  Under this text, click the "Details" link.  This will open Chrome Developer Tools./li liClick "View certificate"/li liClick "Detail" section on pop-up/li liScroll down to the section that contains a URI for the domain.  It should be in the "Certificate Authority Information Access" section.  Click this URI and download the cert./li liDouble click the cert in the downloads directory.  This will open key chain access./li liAdd the cert to your key chain - you can select login (user) or system (everyone)./li liOnce the cert is added to the key chain, double click it and set it to "Always Trust" in the Trust area./li /ol  You'll still see the warning icon in the window, but the speed bump warning you about the cert will now be gone.  The steps seem lengthy, but only take a few minutes at most.  <comment218519> I've followed the procedures and although the test page https://www.digicert.com/digicert-root-certificates.htm works for me, https://twitter.com doesn't.  It works perfectly well with Firefox. <comment218589> if you test against every single certificate there and it did not show you any problem, then your problem is something else apart from this. <comment218710> Thanks. I did and it passes all tests. I still can't load Twitter with Chrome, that shows the previous error and doesn't even allow me to override it. I've tried it with different connections. At home, local pub, hotel, 3G with my phone. It also works with Safari for me. It's a problem just in Chrome. <comment220321> Agreed with @Osvaldo. Twitter.com stopped working few weeks ago, and nothing will fix it. Chrome build 42.0.2311.135. Works fine in Safari. <comment349039> For me the issue was an expired Comodo certificate. Awkward that you need to start another browser to find out which certificate authority the "unsafe" site is using. Chrome v.57 doesn't give a clue.
