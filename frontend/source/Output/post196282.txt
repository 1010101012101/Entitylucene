Yosemite swoosh missing fix required <body> Have recently upgraded from Mavericks to Yosemite 10.10.4, and found that Mail's swoosh sound when sending mail is no longer evident. Anyone know how to get it back?  <answer196334> Make sure that the option "Play sounds for other mail actions" is checked in Mail preferences under the General tab. When activated, you should hear the "swoosh" sound when sending an email. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/H9Y9A.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer196348> OK, I have found the answer in my case. I did as follow. In addition to the advice provided by akjblue, go/reset: AppleSystem PreferencesSoundSound Effects and check "Play user interface" = ON. Also go . . .Sound EffectsOutput and select Internal Speakers. It may be necessary to cycle these settings off and on again to make the settings "stick".  <comment234441> I am still on Mavericks and there is no "swoosh" on my Mail. How did you do it. <comment234524> Yes, I have tried that as well as resetting both New Messages Sound and Play sounds off and then on again with a log out and in again between each, as well as a Restart. I've also tried using Disk Utility to "Repair Disk Permissions". So far all to no avail. Interestingly, I also have a MacPro laptop running the same versions that "swooshes" like a charm.
