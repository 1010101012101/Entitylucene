Show Date Created in Finder <body> My teacher doesn't believe that I did my homework, just because I did like 95% of it.br So he thinks that I did it this morning and I want to prove to him that I did in fact do it last night @ 6 pm.    In other words, I would like to know how to check when a TextEdit document was created on Mac.br I am running El Capitan.  <answer216546> Set your Finder window to List View, then right click in the header bar where it says Name, Date Modified etc &amp; check Date Created  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qd7cq.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment261715> The file creation date is modifiable using `SetFile -d date` from the command line (at least through Yosemite but I'd be surprised if that was removed in El Capitan), and duplicating a file in the Finder sets the creation date of the copy to the creation date of the original, so the creation date doesn't offer any actual evidence as to when you did your homework. <comment261717> And from the command line, `GetFileInfo -d file` will get the creation date and `SetFile -d date file` will set it. <comment261725> Unless the teacher is ***really*** sharp, that will not be an issue ;)
