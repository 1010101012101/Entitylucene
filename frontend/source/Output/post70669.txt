Enable Cut in Finder in OSX 10.7 (Lion) <body>    strongPossible Duplicate:/strongbr   Why is it not possible to use the “cut” command to manipulate a file in the Finder?       I was fiddling with several settings a few days ago, and I'm pretty sure I did something that disabled the "Cut" option in Finder.  Anyone know where I can re-enable it?  <answer70672> As @RobZolkos said in his answer:     It's not part of the Apple system to 'cut' files. The option is there   and becomes enabled when text is selected. But not files. [...]      kbd&#x2318;/kbd+kbdC/kbd then kbd&#x2325;/kbd+kbd&#x2318;/kbd+kbdV/kbd does the cut-and-paste for files   on OS X.   <answer70760> Found the problem - I use Total Finder, which adds Cut/Paste, and it wasn't running when I posted the question.  (I didn't know OSX doesn't have this by default).
