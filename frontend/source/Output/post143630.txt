Filtered RSS Feed via Push Notifications on iPhone <body> It's a bit tricky but I'm looking for an app that filters RSS Feeds by keywords and redirects links to Safari. My filtered feeds should be notified in a menu like this and, when tapped, should be opened in Safari.. Does exist something like this?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/A6aJB.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment169160> What source for RSS do you use? CNN, Google, ect... <comment169161> I basically take RSS links from websites.. Most of them use feedburner <comment169164> you can use add ons for browsers for RSS feeders, so no need to push notification <comment169166> Do exist addons for iOS' Safari?! <comment169167> do exist in iOS 8 ! <comment169230> "Safari also picked up the ability to add RSS feeds to your Shared Links feed. To add a new RSS feed just visit the website in Safari, open up your shared links, go to Subscriptions and tap “Add Current Site.”" I found this feature of iOS 8.. I hope that some developer will use this new feature to develope an addon.. I can't find a place with addons for iOS 8 :v Any help?
