MacBook Pro won't start up <body> This is a 15" 2010 model that came with OS X 10.6 and now has 10.10 installed. After turning the computer on I can hear the startup chime and the power adapter indicator light lights up. The Apple logo and a progress bar appear, but after that there's only a blank white screen.  There are some pixel anomalies, what appears to be scanlines and slightly distorted colors that look like it's running in 16-bit color depth.  I have tried following the official instructions, i.e. reset the PRAM/NVRAM and SMC, tried booting in safe mode (same symptoms, but after that it seems to boot automatically in safe mode since the loading takes a lot longer).  Also I recently installed Homebrew if it might have to do with this.  Any ideas?  <answer193770> This was apparently some known issue because when I took the computer to be fixed, they simply replaced the motherboard for free.  <comment230592> Try booting in verbose mode by holding `command + V` while booting, and see where the computer stops. Post an image here. <comment230606> @WilliamTFroggard It seems to stall with [this screen](https://www.dropbox.com/s/jnkleu2uo5mzl4i/IMG_2445.JPG?dl=0).
