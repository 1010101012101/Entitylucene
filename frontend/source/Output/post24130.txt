Windows 7 bootcamp, DVD does not appear, I need to open it with a key <body> In Windows 7 bootcamp, DVD does not appear, I need to open it with keyboard, and the Open/Close key on Apple keyboard is not working.  <comment26985> I dont get it, sorry. What key are talking about? What do you mean by opening and closing your dvd? Im guessing you mean ejecting the disk (because that does require a key). <comment27001> Sorry that was not very clear, but there were two problems, 1) the DVD hardware was detected but had an error and was not usable, and 2) related likely to #1, was the fact that the "Open/Close" or Eject key on the Apple extended keyboard (to the immediate right of F12) would not force an eject. After a series of reboots in Windows and OS X, after reloading Boot Camp Assistant, it is available and working. Unfortunately, I am not positive which action resolved the issue. <comment27021> @Florida Type up your answer and accept it when possible. <comment27035> Good. Glad you solved your problem. :)
