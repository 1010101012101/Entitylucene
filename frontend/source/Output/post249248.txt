Can I modify the name and Dock icon of an application that was launched with sandbox-exec? <body> By default, launching any application this way results in a non-standard icon (a dark screen that looks like a terminal with the word "exec" written on it in green color).  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/IWsUS.png" alt="generic Dock icon"  The name is also sometimes not appropriate, for example "JavaAppLauncher" instead of the actual name of the application.  It gets confusing particularly when I use several sandboxed applications at the same time.
