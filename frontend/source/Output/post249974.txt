MacBook 2007 charger <body> I have a MacBook I bought in 2007 and the charger recently died on me. (I'm assuming the computer itself is still working).   I did some research and ordered from Amazon a Magsafe1 60W charger, but when it arrived the connecter is too large for the port.  Any ideas what the correct charger should be? These are the details of the MacBook, purchased in Aug 2007  ul li13-inch MacBook (White) - 2.16GHz Intel Core 2 Duo/li liPart Number: MB062/li liKeyboard (English) &amp; Mac OS (English) Country kit/li li2.16GHz Intel Core 2 Duo/li liSuperDrive 8x (DVD +R DL/DVD RW/CD-RW)/li li1GB 667 DDR2 - 2x512MB SO-DIMMs/li li120GB Serial ATA drive (5400rpm)/li /ul  <answer249978> The adapter that you should get is the 60W Magsafe with "T" Connector.  From Apple's Support site:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/v2ojL.png" alt="enter image description here"  That said, I would get an Apple 85W adapter instead of the 60W.  You will have more versatility if you decide to upgrade your MacBook to a different model down the road.  You won't do any damage, 85W just means that's the maximum power draw the adapter will support, not that it will push that amount to your computer.  <answer250099> The adapter you bought is a MagSafe 2, and that is why it's too wide. Since you bought the first one on Amazon, here is the link for one that will work. It is thicker but narrower side-to-side: https://www.amazon.co.uk/Apple-MagSafe-Adapter-Non-Retail-Packaging/dp/B00K0BQG9I/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1471805469&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=magsafe+60w  The power adapters with the original MagSafe connectors come in either L- or T-varieties. Both adapters will fit your MacBook. The reasons for why they have gone back and forth are beyond the scope of your question, but there's no electrical difference and no difference in the physical connection to the MacBook.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QqVc2.png" alt="MagSafe 2"  <comment310199> Can you provide a link to the exact charger you purchased? <comment310346> Hi there - thanks for replying! This is the one I bought that was too big : https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/aw/d/B00K0BQIQ4/ref=pd_aw_sim_147_2?ie=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=F87KA55WJN3EAA5ZH51S <comment310348> Hi Alan, thanks for replying! I saw this option but was a little nervous as my original connector wasn't a 't' shape. Will that make any difference? <comment310379> It was either the "T" or the "L" shaped connectors for that generation of MacBook.  As far as making a difference, generally speaking, if it fits, it won't damage your Mac (will it have enough power to charge/turn on is a different story).  If it doesn't fit, there's nothing it can do damage anything. <comment310410> Thanks so much for your response!! <comment310433> If a response here answered your question, please mark it as the accepted solution. Thanks! <comment311007> The charger arrived today and it was the right one - thanks guys!
