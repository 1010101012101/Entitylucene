Filename and editing permissions are gone from Finder Tags <body> I just added two pdf files in a Tag group and I the filename is blank even though in a normal finder windows I can see it.  An other problem is that if I select the file and I press enter to edit the name, nothing happens.  I tried to add extra files on the group and it seams to work fine with everything else.  I also tried to change the Tag group of the file, but same problem.  I checked the permissions and are totally fine. Any ideas?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MYUoj.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer176945> I restarted the codemds/code service and the problem was fixed. I also re-indexed my hard drive.  <comment209018> Can you dod some screenshots <comment209026> Yes! I just did
