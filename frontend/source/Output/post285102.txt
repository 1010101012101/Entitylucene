Will rsync have access to copy all files, regardless of owner if I use sudo? <body> A while back, I asked this question about how to transfer a ton of data from one external drive to another. The answer was to use codersync/code and it worked very well.  I am moving data again from another Drobo. For some reason, however, I don't have access to all the data on the drive. So I assume I can either change the permissions to all the data on the drive, then copy the data, or I can just prefix the codersync/code command with codesudo/code like so:  precodesudo rsync -vaE --progress /Volumes/SourceName /Volumes/DestinationName /code/pre  Will adding codesudo/code before codersync/code allow codersync/code to access and copy all files in the source, even ones I don't have access to?   <comment359517> Yes, using `sudo ` will copy files that you currently do not have access to.
