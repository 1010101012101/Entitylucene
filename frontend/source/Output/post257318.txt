Diagnosing ios 10.0.2 audio routing <body> Since I upgraded to ios 10.0.2 on my iPhone 7 it no longer offers my car as an audio output choice when it's plugged in. What options do i have for further diagnosing the fault?  ul liIs there any way to query the ios system logs for clues? If this were a "regular" unix box i would be looking in syslog (or equiv)/li /ul  The car stereo controls continue to operate the iPhone as normal when plugged in. Track information, album art and playback progress displays on the car stereo as if everything were normal. Charging is also unaffected.  The only symptom is that on the iPhone, the car (dock) is no longer offered as an output device, so audio comes out the phone speakers where i expect it out the car speakers.  This worked yesterday on 10.0.1 but stopped today on 10.0.2.  The car is a 2014 VW Golf mk7 with the "Composition" media unit and MDI interface with VW Lightning adapter.  <comment321296> I don't have a comparable unit, mine is a Pioneer CarPlay - but if [when] it ever goes hinkey a reboot of the phone usually sorts it out until next time.
