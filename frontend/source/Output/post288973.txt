Trouble transferring Mail folders to a new Mac <body> I just bought a new Mac.  I want to transfer everything in my Mail install from my previous Mac to this new one. This includes all of the folders that I created "on my Mac"â€”meaning the contents are stored on the hard drive rather than on the IMAP server.  I've tried copying everything from the ~/Library/Mail/ folder as well as the Mail-related items in ~/Library/Preferences/, but when I launch Mail on the new Mac those 'local' folders aren't there.  I suppose I could manually export them from the old Mac and import them to the new Mac, but that seems incredibly laborious and unnecessary.  Any ideas? This is stumping me. Thank you!  <answer288974> Try: File - Import Mailboxes  Then point it to the mailboxes you copied over (in code~/Library/Mail/V4/code).  <comment364983> Sorry where are those? In the V4 folder? <comment364984> Yes, the ~/Library/Mail/ folders
