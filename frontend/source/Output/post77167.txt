Numbers: Can I highlight the row and column of the selected cell? <body> When reading larger spreadsheets, it would be helpful to highlight the row and column that the currently selected cell is in.  I'm not talking about conditional formatting or anything in the spreadsheet itself, I'm just talking about a viewing option.  I couldn't find a similar option anywhere.  <answer77338> If I understand your question, Numbers does this by default - note the darkened row and column identifiers in the image below at AK50.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/n0rCO.jpg" alt="Numbers"  Edit: ah, I see.. okay, I found an inconvenient hack:  ul liSelect the Column containing your target cell/li liCmd click the cell above (or the Cmd Click the row index of the cell above)/li liCmd click the Row containing your target cell/li liCmd click to reselect the cell above your target/li /ul  Like so:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2WgRV.jpg" alt="Cmd Click the row index of the cell above"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NsJJ6.png" alt="Cmd click the Row containing your target cell"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/I3eqz.png" alt="Cmd click to reselect the cell above your target"  Maybe you could use automator to make this less painful?  <answer264564> Another method, useful for selecting a range of rows in a column, is to click on the uppermost cell you want to select, scroll down to the bottom of the range, shift-click on that cell. All rows between will be selected (in addition to the two you clicked on).  <comment89765> Sorry, I should have been clearer: I'm hoping to have the *entire* row and column highlighted, to make it easier to identify other cells in that row and column.  In large spreadsheets it can be hard to tell for sure if a cell is in the same row as another. <comment89899> @VirgilDisgr4ce - I see - I've edited may answer above - but its a painful hack (its only one extra click to get the funny T shaped highlight) <comment96597> Great instructions. This is easier than it sounds actually, albeit a bit awkward! <comment143159> Hm, I was thinking of something that's constant and automatic; highlighting the entire row and column makes it MUCH easier to read on a very large window.
