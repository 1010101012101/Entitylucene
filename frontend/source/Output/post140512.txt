Jailbroke my iphone and every single app missin <body> I downloaded a jailbreak from pangu and at end of installing my phone restarted but only had stock apps left, then i turned it off again and when i turned it back on every single app was gone even the stock apps..i can search stuff but when i click into it a notice comes up sayin 'url is unavailable' with a weblink on it...please help  <comment165594> Restore from a backup, perhaps? <comment165595> Will that mean i lose all apps downloaded? such as itube and the likes? thanks <comment165596> Every app that you downloaded from the App Store can be redownloaded â€” they're linked to your account. Apps from Cydia? I don't know.
