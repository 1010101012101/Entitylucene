iPhone warranty valid in another country? <body> I bought the iPhone 6 gold 64 gb three months ago from USA. But now I'm resident in India. Is there any way to transfer the warranty in India of my phone?  <answer176586> Did you purchase AppleCare? It provides global coverage, so long as the necessary repair is available in the country you are now in. See this page.  If not, the standard Apple Warranty appears to state that if the device is portable, meaning it can operate independently without a power cord, you can obtain warranty service worldwide. (Scroll down on that page to the "Obtaining Warranty Service" section.)  <comment208535> Not sure what the Title has to do with the Question. Best way to find out would be to ring Apple - https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201232
