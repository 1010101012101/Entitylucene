iPad mini - change ID for App Store <body> I have 2 email addresses. The App store uses email address 2 and I can't remember the password for that. Anyway I'd rather it used email address 1. I have checked through SettingsiCloud, SettingsiTunes &amp; App Store and both are logged into email address 1. SettingsMessages was logged into email address 2 but I've signed out of that. Even so I still can't get the App Store to let me login with email address 1.  <answer218363> The easiest thing to for you to do is to go to the Apple ID management page and reset your password for your Apple ID associated with email address 1.  <comment264217> Thanks for the suggestion but I've already tried that. The problem is that on the App store it's showing one identity and on other Apps it's showing a different one.
