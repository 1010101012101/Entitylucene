How do I make my MacBook's logical resolution the same as its physical one? <body> My MacBook has 2,880 &times; 1,800 physical, R/G/B pixels in its display (1800p). However, Mac OS renders at 3840 &times; 2400 virtual pixels (4k). I don't know or care why, but I do know that this makes things unnecessarily blurry for me. It doesn't do this with external displays, so I know the OS is capable of outputting to the native resolution. strongHow do I force Mac OS to output to the native resolution of its integrated display?/strong  Below is an illustration of what bothers me the most. The left is a photograph (physical resolution of 1800p) and the right is a screenshot (virtual resolution of 4k).  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2rIVl.png" alt="A side-by-side comparison of a photograph and a screenshot of the cursor. The photograph shows a 17px-wide cursor, and the screenshot shows a 24px-wide one. The photograph&#39;s cursor&#39;s left vertical&#39;s rightmost pixels are faded, and the screenshot&#39;s are clean."  Note the 2px left vertical in the photo has one clean, white line on the left, and one faded white-to-black line on the right. The screenshot shows it's actually rendering a 3px-wide left vertical, and all the pixels should be cleanly white.
