Is there a key stroke to switch to a fullscreen app in Lion? <body> I normally switch around my virtual desktops using the kbdctrl/kbd+kbdnum/kbd. Now, Expos√© shows all the desktops and the fullscreen app whereupon clicking the fullscreen app rectangle will take me back to it. I'd rather do so via keyboard nav. kbdcmd/kbd+kbdtab/kbd doesn't work for me because I'm doing this with VMware where I have multiple windows open, one is fullscreen, others are not. kbdcmd/kbd+kbdtab/kbd seems to land me on whatever VMware window it randomly chooses.  <answer40778> You can configure these shortcuts in codeSystem Preferences -&gt; Keyboard -&gt; Keyboard Shortcuts -&gt; Mission Control/code  I think the default is control-option-left/right arrow, at least that's what I have it set to.  In mission control, you can also re-order the position of the desktops/full screen apps by dragging them around. I think by default they're ordered by most-recently used desktop, but you can change that (I can't remember how, that would be a separate question anyway).  <answer53359> By default it's kbdCommand/kbd+kbdControl/kbd+kbdF/kbd.   However, it doesn't work in all apps. Some don't do full screen and some pre-Lion apps retain their original full-screen keyboard shortcuts (e.g., Command-Shift-F in Firefox).  <comment61038> The OP is looking for a way to switch to an app running in fullscreen mode, not to enable/disable it.
