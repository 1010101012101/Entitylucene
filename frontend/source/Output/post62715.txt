Applications Don't Show Up in Spotlight <body> Spotlight has stopped showing any results for my Applications. I've tried reindexing and removing the index so it rebuilds it. No change. I've tried adding Applications to the Privacy tab and removing it, no change.  I tried repairing disk permissions and redoing the above, no change. I've tried removing everything from the index except Applications and then I just get nothing for any search at all (except dictionary entries).  I tried adding a symlink in my homedir to Applications and reindexing, but no change.  Any ideas on what to do?  I'm running Snow Leopard.  This is driving me crazy!  Update: I've noticed that when I start a reindex with codesudo mdutil -E //code and then immediately do a Spotlight search for an app that the app shows up temporarily until Spotlight gets disabled due to active indexing.  After the indexing is done, the app entries go away.  <answer67076> Have you tried removing the spotlight.plist in your user preferences. Similar problem with 10.7.5 and re-indexing wouldn't work until I moved the spotlight.plist to the desktop to be safe and then did a codesudo mdutil -E //code If that works you can delete the old .plist file.  <answer142523> Loading the metadata plist worked for me:  h3Turn off spotlight:/h3  precodesudo mdutil -a -i off /code/pre  h3Unload it:/h3  precodesudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.metadata.mds.plist /code/pre  h3Load It:/h3  precodesudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.metadata.mds.plist /code/pre  h3Turn on spotlight again:/h3  precodesudo mdutil -a -i on /code/pre  Now everything is being reindexed as expected.  <answer218886> Had this issue and nothing worked until I rebuilt the index using this in the Terminal:  precodesudo mdutil -E -i on / /code/pre  As an alternative you can also use a free app called Alfred which has a lot more features.   (I'm not affiliated with Alfred in anyway)  Hope this helps!  <answer278863> When I tried Anil's solution, I got:     sudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.metadata.mds.plistbr   /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.metadata.mds.plist: Operation not permitted while System Integrity Protection is engaged   Instead, I followed these instructions, and it worked:     ol   liGo to System Preferences, Select Spotlight/li   liGo to the Privacy tab in the Spotlight system preferences/li   liClick the Plus button/li   liPress Shift-Command-C to reveal your hard drives (if they are not   available otherwise), or simply navigate to your hard drive (most   likely MacintoshHD)/li   liIf you have more than one hard drive, hold the Command key and click your various drives to add them to your selection/li   liClick the “Choose” button to add them to the Privacy list/li   liIgnore the warning./li   liRemove the hard drive by clicking the minus sign./li   liBoom, no more sad days./li   /ol   <comment75579> Just a quick check: have you gone into system preferences and gone into the spotlight tab and customised the search results tab? In that tab you can check which items will be shown in spotlight. If applications are checked, make sure the applications directory is in the right place and send me the location <comment75580> yes, it's checked, listed first in the list, and is in /Applications <comment120030> Could that be related to http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/96183/spotlight-wont-find-apps-after-appstore-updates-them? <comment174051> Loading metadata plist worked like a charm. Except I didn't have any metadata when I did it which I think was causing my issue. I skipped to the 'Load It' section and now it works like a charm thanks man! <comment184759> @JustAnil +1. your answer fixed the issue I had with Mac App Store showing updates for uninstalled apps. Thanks. <comment240987> if after `sudo mdutil -a -i on` indexing is still disabled please look at [this answer](http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/35073/14854) <comment309375> thank you it worked here as well (el capitan) <comment318099> When I try this I get this error `Error: Index is already changing state.  Please try again in a moment.` regardless of how many times I try it / how long I wait. <comment331566> Dang. That works a treat. The nerd in me would love to know why that worked... I don't see how the plist could change between unloading/loading it... particularly with mdutil off. Any explanation? P.S. why isn't this the chosen solution? <comment336096> +1 for Alfred...which just works.  If it doesn't, it has some very easy-to-use Preferences and Settings interface.  Not to mention, workflows.  (I, too, am not associated with Alfred, just happier using it than a busted Spotlight). <comment337633> This solution worked for me on macOS 10.12.2 (Sierra). <comment346626> @CamiloSanchez - thanks, that solution worked! I just removed the `/.metadata_never_index` file from `/` directory before running the command `sudo mdutil -a -i on /`. However, for some reason it turns off again after rebooting and that file reappears. <comment347884> Here is another solution: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/7356551?start=0&tstart=0 <comment356726> I was having the same problem with outlook for macOS ( Sierra ). The solution provided by @Mackelito worked for me. <comment357420> I got a message saying `Operation not permitted while System Integrity Protection is engaged` while unloading, but apparently it's reindexing anyway and worked for me on 10.12.4. <comment360620> This worked for me.  I was having trouble with the Slack.app application not being recognized as an application.  After performing these steps the Slack app now works just like all my other applications in Spotlight. <comment360631> I had the same problem with Safari, if you can believe it. I am in a highly secure corporate environment, and this is what I was allowed to do, and it worked. <comment364078> It worked. I DID NOT need to unload/load. All I did was turn it off and on. <comment367942> Just had this problem with Evernote and this solved it. Thank you @Senseful. <comment371208> @Mackelito 's link is quite handy! <comment373954> I turned off, then tried to run the unload command, got some message about not being able to due to system integrity being enabled. so I turned the mdutil back to on, now it works. I don't know why, but, it works !
