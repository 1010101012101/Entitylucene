How do I do control-shift-eject on a MacBook Air? <body>    strongPossible Duplicate:/strongbr   Is there a similarly fast alternative to Crtl + Shift + Eject for new Macbook Air?       This keystroke turns off the display on most Macs.   But the Air does not have an eject key. How do I achieve the same result?  <answer34252> kbdControl/kbd + kbdShift/kbd + kbdF12/kbd  see also: Is there a similarly fast alternative to Crtl + Shift + Eject for new Macbook that lack eject keys?  <comment39076> For whatever it's worth, Control-shift-F12 (with or without the function key pressed) does not put my MBA display to sleep. <comment39196> I've heard people say that before. I'm not sure why it works for some and not others. Odd. <comment68030> I think with Mountain Lion it's Control-Shift-Power
