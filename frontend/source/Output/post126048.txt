Run app as a different user (automator) <body> i'd like to be able to open an app as a different user. For example PC1 is my main account and PC7 is my secondary one.   I can achieve the effect in terminal using  su - pc7  eminsert password/em /Applications/Application.app/Contents/MacOS/ApplicationName  How can i use the automator to make a script/app whatever that does this by a simple doubleclick?  Thanks  <answer126050> You can simply save your example as a text file adding the suffix .command or .sh to it to execute it with a double-click. AppleScript can call an .sh-script, too, with   precodedo shell script "/path/to/yourscript.sh" /code/pre  Not sure if Automator can do the same.  But codesu/code basically only works with commands not using the Aqua GUI of Mac OS X. So if you try to open an application like for example TextEdit this way, it wont be able to open a window on the Desktop.   <answer126061> If you were were to open AppleScript, you would use the following format:  precodedo shell script "/usr/bin/su - " &amp; user &amp; " -c " &amp; "'" &amp; cmd &amp; "'" with administrator privileges password "blahblah" /code/pre  If you wanted to make a shell script, you'd need to codechmod a+x/code the file and write it out like this:  precode#!/usr/bin/env bash su -c "/Applications/Application.app/Contents/MacOS/ApplicationName" -s /bin/sh pc7 /code/pre  Or, you can write it how I would write it:  precode#!/usr/bin/bash su -c "/Applications/Application.app/Contents/MacOS/ApplicationName" -s /bin/sh pc7 /code/pre  hr  ol liSave the file as codeYourScritpt.sh/code/li liAdd executable permissions by typing codechmod a+x YourScript.sh/code in Terminal/li liRight-click the file in Finder and select 'Open with" and select "Other"/li liSelect Terminal as the application to open the file (change to All Applications)/li liYou do not need to select "Always Open With"/li /ol  <answer126063> You can not trivially launch graphical applications as another user.  h2A Proxy Process is Required/h2  To launch a graphical application as another user, that user must be logged in to a graphical session and have a process running within their session able to launch your desired application.  Prior to OS X 10.9, this could be approximated via the codelaunchctl/code command. See How to launch a GUI application in another user's graphical session? for a detailed discussion.  <comment147591> `su` works fine with GUI appsâ€¦?
