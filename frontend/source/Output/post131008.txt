Is there anything like OneTab available for Safari? <body> I am looking for a "tabs decluttering" app for Safari like OneTab Chrome Extension     How OneTab Works      Whenever you find yourself with too many tabs, click the OneTab icon   to convert all of your tabs into a list. When you need to access the   tabs again, you can either restore them individually or all at once.      When your tabs are in the OneTab list, you will save up to 95% of   memory because you will have reduced the number of tabs open in Google   Chrome.   <answer131009> The closest embuilt-in/em option available:  kbd⌘ Command/kbd+kbd⇧ Shift/kbd+kbd\ backslash/kbd reveals the "Show All Tabs" menu available:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xdHmG.jpg" alt="Tabs"  You can then use simple gestures (left/right movements) to scroll through all the open tabs. strongThere is not an extension available emdirectly through Apple's Safari Extension Archive/em/strong equivalent to "One-Tab," and I would be weary of installing any open source extensions from third party sources.   I will update this response accordingly if I find a more viable alternative.   <answer131059> The closest extension that can save the open tabs into a list is Sessions.  You can also restore all the tabs all at once, or by double-clicking them to restore individual tabs.  Generally, after you save the tabs into list, you can close the rest of the tabs with kbdOption/kbd+kbdCommand/kbd+kbdW/kbd. Closing these tabs will free the memory that the tabs has taken. Meanwhile, your saved list of of tabs are stored in a document that won’t need memory to stay in use. The only time you’ll see the memory usage is when the Session extension is called (which get loaded with the list of the sessions you’ve saved).  Here is the comparison of the memory usage before and after all tabs are closed.  strongBefore/strong img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2bxxe.jpg" alt="Session Before Closing Tabs"  strongAfter/strong img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/RCpV2.jpg" alt="Session After Closing Tabs"  <answer220274> There is one now called TabLister, that's very similar to OneTab. http://tablister.com  Also available from the Safari Extensions Gallery.  <answer220293> In Safari, you have to use the menu View or the Shift+Cmd+\  keys.  <answer288475> Here is a native way of doing it without the use of any extensions.  In Safari, under the "Bookmarks" menu, there is an option for you to "Add Bookmarks for These X Tabs...". If you click on it, you will be prompted to save these tabs in the current windows as bookmarks. You can assign them to a Folder and give it a Session Name.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/UU6uZ.png" alt="enter image description here"  When you do want to resume the session, you simply go to the bookmark folder, right click on it and select "Open in New Tabs".  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mVLeD.png" alt="enter image description here"  The beauty of this methods is that, if you have iCloud sync enabled, you will be able to resume your saved sessions across all your Apple devices.  <comment153775> You could try and contact the developer and see if they could port it to Safari. It should be possible and hopefully not too difficult since they have most of the code already.And the are soon releasing a Firefox version. They have a "We love to hear from you - contact us" at the bottom of their home page <comment153777> You can also "Show All Tabs" by pinching in on trackpad. <comment181929> Could you add a review? For example, performance aspects: extension memory usage vs memory "released" by saving the open tabs? <comment181944> @PauloOliveira read the answer again. <comment182134> It's really visible the improvement... ;) <comment201134> This is not close to what I am looking for: _closing all open tabs_ and adding them to a list. <comment266600> Just as an update to this question, in the new Safari you can press shift+command+\ to see a list of all your tabs. This probably doesn't affect the memory usage. <comment291422> Is it too paranoid of me not to want to try this? First off, it's not listed in the Safari Extensions Gallery. Second, the developer is completely anonymous and, despite hosting the site w/github.io, has neither code nor a human identity on github.com. <comment369509> It would be nice if TabLister removed links from the list when I click on them to open them. It makes no sense to retain the link in the list, if I have it open on a tab. This is the way OneTab does it, by the way. Do they take feature requests?
