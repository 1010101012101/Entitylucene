9,93 GB of 5 GB iCloud storage taken up by Docs - how to find an delete them? <body> How is that possible?br How can I locate these files and remove them?  I cannot locate them neither through the iOS Settings nor at https://www.icloud.com/.  All I am using iCloud for is creating a backup with only a small number of applications included and it is usually smaller than 2 GB.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WLJYz.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer283450> I was unable to solve the problem myself, so I contacted Apple Support. During a phone call, I was explained that the space was taken by strongtemporary, hidden files like incomplete backups/strong.   I couldn't delete these myself and the technician did that for me.
