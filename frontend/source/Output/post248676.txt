Can't install Bower <body> I am logged in with my local acccount, I even sudoed to that account with SSH.  I tried to install Bower with the following command:  precodenpm install -g bower /code/pre  and I get this error:  precodenpm WARN checkPermissions Missing write access to /usr/local/lib/node_modules /usr/local/lib └── bower@1.7.9   npm ERR! Darwin 15.6.0 npm ERR! argv "/usr/local/bin/node" "/usr/local/bin/npm" "install" "-g" "bower" npm ERR! node v6.3.1 npm ERR! npm  v3.10.3 npm ERR! path /usr/local/lib/node_modules npm ERR! code EACCES npm ERR! errno -13 npm ERR! syscall access  npm ERR! Error: EACCES: permission denied, access '/usr/local/lib/node_modules' npm ERR!     at Error (native) /code/pre  The error is pretty obvious, I have 2 questions:  ol liWhy does it happen with my local super admin account?/li liHow can I fix this?/li /ol  <answer248693> Try this command instead:     strongsudo/strong npm install -g bower   <answer248716> Check your effective permission:  precodeid /code/pre  will tell you if you have the required priviledge (codeuid=0(root) .../code).  Then be carefull upon using codesudo/code. Be warned it is pretty easy to trap admin beginners into using a wrong codesudo/code so as to steal their password. Always use the standard and explicit path of codesudo/code:  precode/usr/bin/sudo npm ... /code/pre  or if you prefer check that you aren't using the wrong one:  precodetype sudo /code/pre  which should reply with the correct answer:  precodesudo is /usr/bin/sudo /code/pre  (and nothing else which would be a bad sign).  <comment308222> From what you wrote it seems you are running the command with a regular user account without the permission to write in the mentioned directory. The phrase "*sudoed to that account with SSH*" is incomprehensible. <comment308245> How did you "sudoed to that account with SSH" <comment308263> Please read this answer: http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/14423/22003 .
