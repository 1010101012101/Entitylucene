Why does my iTerm2 launch with an X in it's path? <body> After upgrading to El Capitan, then working on installing Rails, my iTerm2 shell now opens with codex &gt;/code, instead of just code&gt;/code.  Can someone please explain why this is happening, and help me figure out how to return it to it's normal emhome/em?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5heEA.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer221580> You have codeshell integration/code installed and the last command executed failed:  Example:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xuzhI.png" alt="enter image description here"  codeDoesNotExist/code cmd does not exist, thus an error 127:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Hzc7S.png" alt="enter image description here"     Command status      The mark on a command line will turn red if a command fails. You can right click the mark to view its return code.   Re: https://iterm2.com/shell_integration.html  <answer221610> This has been figured out. There was a leftover RVM script in the code.zlogin/code file that was causing this error, and when I imploded RVM (to use rbenv), I forgot to remove this script.  Thanks to @sushihangover for the willingness to help!  <comment268315> When I type `pwd`, the `x` disappears immediately and I am in $HOME, which for me is `/users/randytolentino`.  I would love for this question to be appropriated to the write SE forum - I'll look into having it moved. <comment268321> Hi, thanks for the quick response. Considering that this behavior occurs when I launch a new session of iTerm2, how can I find out what the error/code was?  Right clicking on the `x` does not give me the same menu as the image you posted above. It just opens up a typical menu with options like "New Menu", "New Tab", etc. <comment268323> Not sure why right-clicking on the `mark` would not present the last cmd context menu... but in terms of last error I would look at the end of your `.zshrc` ... simple test, add a `pwd $(HOME)` at the very end, does the error mark go away on a new zsh? <comment268366> adding `pwd $(HOME)` gave me a `command not found: HOME` <comment268367> sorry... fat-fingered... just `pwd` or `cd $HOME`, just some command that will produce an `exit 0` result <comment268369> First of all, thanks for helping me out.  `pwd` had no effect when I closed out iTerm2 and relaunched it.   `cd $HOME` just basically outputted the home directory `/users/randytolentino` then on the next line, still getting `x  ` <comment268372> Which version of iTerm2 are you using, i'm running 2.9.20151229 and in the profiles that I use zsh in, it starts up and shows a green mark... if you have the same version, file a bug/issue and see if the developers can help... it really is not hurting anything as it just shows the status of the last exit code...
