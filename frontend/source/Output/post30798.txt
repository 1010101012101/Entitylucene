Send message on iPhone 4S using PC Bluetooth keyboard? <body> I have successfully paired a Bluetooth keyboard with my iPhone 4S, and it works great for composing messages.  However, I can't find a way to kbdsend/kbd a message from the Messages app using just the keyboard.br I've tried kbdEnter/kbd, kbdAlt/kbd+kbdEnter/kbd, kbdCtrl/kbd+kbdEnter/kbd, and kbdShift/kbd+kbdEnter/kbd.  There's a thread on Apple's site that covers the same topic - one of the posts alluded to a "send" button on a full-featured iPhone keyboard.  Does anyone know what extended key code or combination the "official" keyboard is sending?  If not, is there a way to find out?  <answer30836> In Mail for the Mac you can send the current message using kbdShift/kbd + kbdCmd/kbd + kbdD/kbd, so maybe try that?   On my PC keyboard, the kbdWin/kbd key sends a kbdCmd/kbd in Mac OS X, yours is probably the same.  <comment35416> Good point, I hadn't tried the Win key yet. Sadly, that didn't work.  I tried Shift+Win+D, then a whole bunch of combinations of modifier+Win+Enter, but I still can't get it to send the current message. <comment35417> @mskfisher Then I'm sorry, out of ideas. Hope you find a way, that would be really useful! <comment35419> Someone else was asking for similar support in a third-party app: http://www.shapeservices.com/en/support/forum/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=1053
