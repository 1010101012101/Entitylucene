Activating screen saver from AppleScript in Mountain Lion <body> I had a script that I used to use to activate my screen saver, and it no longer works in Mountain Lion.  It was a shell script that called an AppleScript script:  precode#!/bin/bash osascript /Users/lorin/scripts/lockscreen.scpt /code/pre  This is what the codelockscreen.scpt/code file looks like:  precodetell application "ScreenSaverEngine"          activate  end tell /code/pre  If I bring up codelockscreen.scpt/code in the AppleScript Editor, I get the "Choose Application" dialog popping up asking "Where is ScreenSaverEngine?"  Anybody know the Mountain Lion-y way to activate the screen saver?  <answer57918> This works in ML:  precodetell application "System Events"     set ss to screen saver "Random"     start ss end tell /code/pre  "Random" can be replaced with your choice, "Flurry" or "Shell" and so on.  Source Disclosure: http://hintsforums.macworld.com/showthread.php?t=111478  <answer89638> That is a nice way of starting a random screen saver. If, however, you'd simply like to start the active screen saver, you can use this in Mountain Lion:  precodetell application "System Events"      start current screen saver end tell /code/pre  <answer131057> To shut down your computer you can try to type in this code:  precode   tell application "Finder" shut down end tell /code/pre  <answer256884> codetell application "ScreenSaverEngine" to run/code  <comment71084> How do I make it stop the screen saver?  I tried `tell application "System Events" to stop screen saver` <comment117280> @Jayen `tell application "System Events" to quit current screen saver` <comment153837> That does not call the screen saver it does something totally different
