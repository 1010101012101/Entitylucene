How do I determine which app is trying to invoke Google Chrome? <body> For some reason, Google Chrome was randomly starting up on my system. I uninstalled it, and now I occasionally get the "Choose Application" dialog, which asks "Where is Google Chrome.app?"  How can I determine which application on my machine is trying to invoke Google Chrome?  (Note that I have "Google Chrome Canary" installed, and it is set as my default web browser).    <answer13866> Two places come to mind immediately.  ol liStart up Safari and make sure Google Chrome isn't the default browser./li liClean up your launch services database./li /ol  Since you have already done #1 - redoing it won't likely matter but your safari pref file storing this setting could be corrupt.  Item 2 needs more explanation - Use Finder to right click on a text or html file - if you still see Chrome in the Open With... dialog you might want to manually rebuild the launch services database.   <answer17572> precodeman iosnoop  man execsnoop  man opensnoop  /code/pre  Also possible to get a hint of what's going on running  precodelaunchctl bslist -j /code/pre  as root, which will show you launchd jobs, -j tells you which job started it,   and   precodelaunchctl bstree /code/pre  Which shows the jobs running, and under which domain they are running under.  <comment19216> Did any of these show anything but launchd as the parent process? <comment19224> Several launchd's run , one for each user, even users with no shells.  I'll edit the answer though. <comment19225> opensnoop in particular will show a file descriptor of -1 for failed opens, which might give insight.
