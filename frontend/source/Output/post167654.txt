Web Inspector quickly inspect element <body> How do I quickly inspect an element using Safari's Web Inspector, preferably by keyboard shortcut?  h2Expected functionality/h2  In Chrome, kbdcommand/kbd+kbdshift/kbd+kbdc/kbd enables the function and the mouse then selects an element.  h2How things work in Safari/h2  In Safari, the same combo seems to work, but only if Web Inspector is selected. Here are some example scenarios:  ol liWeb Inspector is not open. Pressing kbdcommand/kbd+kbdshift/kbd+kbdc/kbd does nothing./li liWeb Inspector is not open. Pressing kbdcommand/kbd+kbdoption/kbd+kbdi/kbd opens and selects Web Inspector, so following up with kbdcommand/kbd+kbdshift/kbd+kbdc/kbd enables inspection mode./li liWeb Inspector is open, but user has interfaced with web site and Web Inspector is not selected. Pressing kbdcommand/kbd+kbdshift/kbd+kbdc/kbd does nothing and pressing kbdcommand/kbd+kbdoption/kbd+kbdi/kbd closes Web Inspector./li /ol  <answer167657> Right-click an element, then choose Inspect Element. This opens the developer tools and selects the element in the DOM. This can be scripted with Automator/Keyboard Maestro/etc for activation with a keyboard shortcut if you wish.  <comment196583> I had forgotten about Automator/etc. I'll mark this as accepted in a few hours if no native keyboard answers pop up.
