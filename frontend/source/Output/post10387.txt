NTFS-3G cpu usage <body> my ntfs-3g application takes up to 20% of my cpu usage. I don't know any way to reduce it so I have to kill it's proceess. Any idea about fixing this?  <answer10388> I'd consider configuring spotlight not to index or monitor your NTFS partition.  ul liOpen 'System Preferences'/li liSpotlight/li liClick the 'Privacy' tab/li liClick the + and select your NTFS partition/li /ul  If that doesn't work you might consider defragmenting the NTFS partition, disabling transparent compression, or updating to a newer version of NTFS-3G.  For more information Tuxera has a decent FAQ related to performance problems with NTFS-3G.  <comment10907> WOW !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! THAT WAS AWESOME !!! THANKS A MILLION.
