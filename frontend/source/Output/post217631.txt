Using El Capitan, can I create a bootable Windows 7 USB? <body> I have an El Capitan, can I create a bootable USB of Windows 7? I also have a Windows 7 ISO. I need to use a USB since I will be reformatting a netbook without DVD/CD-ROM drive.  <answer217761> As @hirnwunde has pointed in the comments, the article from Indiana University works!  ol liFrom the Finder, open the Applications folder, and then Utilities./li liOpen the Boot Camp Assistant, and then click Continue. The next screen should give you a list of options./li liUITS recommends making the USB drive installer first. You don't need to install Windows or download the support software at this time, as it will be easier to do both later. To proceed:  a. Verify that the USB drive you will be writing to is plugged in.  b. Uncheck the Install Windows 7 or later version and Download the latest Windows support software from Apple options. c. Check Create a Windows 7 or later install disk and click Continue./li liYour USB drive should be listed in the "Destination disk" area.

For me (MacBook Pro, Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2015), that means it now looks like:  precode&lt;key&gt;ExternalInstallOnlyModels&lt;/key&gt; &lt;array&gt;         &lt;string&gt;MacBook8,1&lt;/string&gt;         &lt;string&gt;MacBook9,1&lt;/string&gt;         &lt;string&gt;MacBookAir7,1&lt;/string&gt;         &lt;string&gt;MacBookPro11,4&lt;/string&gt; &lt;/array&gt; /code/pre/li liCheck if your model is listed under PreUSBBootSupportedModels. If so, remove it./li liNow start Boot Camp Assistance from your Applications directory and you'll get the option to burn to USB./li /ol  <comment263092> Bootable as in the USB will have Windows installed on it, or as in to install and repair Windows (install USB)? <comment263106> Just install would do.. <comment263107> Sorry, the first one or the second one? <comment263248> @Brick first one <comment263249> @hirnwunde that works! thanks for the link, i made your comment as the answer.. <comment265782> Sorry, in OSX 10.11 (El Capitan) there is no longer a list of choices when installing with Boot Camp, thus your suggestion will not work. (USB-less install) <comment265980> i have an El Capitan and it worked for me. i'm not sure, but i think what might have helped is that i formatted my usb drive bootable <comment265981> the USB drive is already selected as the destination disk.. <comment266024> From what I can see, its different depending on the model and year of your mac. The new macs use USB-less installation, yet older ones seem to have the options. Source: http://www.macrumors.com/2015/09/30/el-cap-boot-camp-no-usb/
