Can I make macOS Sierra not notice when I turn off my monitor? <body> I'm having this problem where my computer performs some weird behavior when I turn off my external monitor. For example, I have to run some programs and I'd like to have my screen off because they take many hours to run. However, when I turn off my monitor it seems to stop the program. How can I make my  computer not notice when I turn off my screen? I have a Dell monitor and a Mac Mini with macOS Sierra.  <answer267070> I suspect the best way to manage your situation is via some of your System Preference settings.   More specifically, try the following and let me know how you go:  ul liGo to System Preferences /li liSelect Energy Saver/li liSet your Computer Sleep to Never/li liSet your Display Sleep to a short period/li liEnsure that emPut hard disks to sleep when possible/em is unchecked/li liNow exit Energy Saver and select Desktop &amp; Screen Saver instead/li liSelect the Screen Saver tab/li liEnsure that the Start after setting at bottom left is set to Never/li liExit System Preferences/li /ul  Now try using your Mac Mini as you want, but don't turn off your monitor until strongafter/strong it has gone to sleep. Let me know how you go.  strongSleep/strong  As an aside, is there a reason you want to physically turn your monitor off?  Your monitor uses strongless than 0.3W/strong when it's in sleep mode, so you're not really saving much in terms of energy by shutting it off instead of letting it sleep. So, if you set your Energy Saver settings as above, the amount of energy consumption while your monitor sleeps is negligible and your Mac Mini can still perform what it has to.  <comment335001> Can you specify the exact model of Dell Monitor and Mac Mini and how they're connected? <comment335002> @Monomeeth It's [this](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/bnh/controller/home?O=&sku=1254756&gclid=Cj0KEQiA7qLDBRD9xJ7PscDCu5IBEiQAqo3BxMhF59w6wj8_SrMlIquexSCPrCyM-dg0PQerzDlTri4aAv5N8P8HAQ&is=REG&ap=y&m=Y&c3api=1876%2C92051678882%2C&Q=&A=details) monitor and a 2014 Mac Mini. They are connected through HDMI. <comment335015> By the way, are you sure that the program is being stopped when the monitor is turned off, and not by the Mac eventually going to sleep (when the monitor happens to be off)? <comment335114> @Merlin I'm using an app called Anti-Sleep which is supposed to stop sleep
