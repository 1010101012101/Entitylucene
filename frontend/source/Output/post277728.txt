How can I run unzip silently in terminal? <body> I have a lot of Zip archives that I want to unpack in a script. Is there any way to run them silently?  Here is what I have:  precodebash&gt; unzip  02b852e3571e46f25fdfc79f43ceb726ddff9ba7.zip  Archive:  02b852e3571e46f25fdfc79f43ceb726ddff9ba7.zip 02b852e3571e46f25fdfc79f43ceb726ddff9ba7   inflating: .editorconfig              inflating: .gitattributes       bash&gt;   /code/pre  Here is what I want:  precodebash&gt; unzip &lt;something to silence zip&gt; MyArchive.zip       bash&gt;   /code/pre  <answer277730> If you don’t want to see the output from your terminal commands then you can redirect both standard out and standard error to /dev/null by adding ' /dev/null 2&amp;1’ to the end of your command.  Of course this can hide errors, so you might want to redirect it to a file instead, depending on your use case.  <answer277733> As stated in the manual, -q (quiet) or -qq (even quieter).  precodeunzip -qq filename /code/pre  <comment349535> `man unzip` is your friend (works for more or less all commands you can run in Terminal) <comment349985> I know about `man` but I believe most people will agree it is difficult to find what you want looking through `man` pages. I think it was faster and easier to ask here. <comment349999> It takes some time tontet used to it, but things like command line options are easy to be found there.
