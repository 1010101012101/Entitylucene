How to sort column by date in Numbers? <body> I've my column in format dd/mm/yyyy and I would like to sort them by date. But I can't find any way of sorting the column by date. If I Sort Ascending, it doesn't recognise that the rows have the date formats. Any easy way of doing that?   <answer144951> Your dates might not be recognized as dates by Numbers.   In my case, Numbers does not offer dd/mm/yyyy as one of the standard date format and I have to define a custom format for that pattern. (Not sure, if that applies in your case: The date must be entered according to your locale settings - I can set "dd/mm/yyyy" as the date format, but I have to enter it as "dd.mm.yyyy" on my German system.)  Using the sort &amp; filter window then works well on the formatted dates.  <comment170745> What is the format ? is it date ? <comment170843> Yes, it's a date in format dd/mm/yyy (e.g. 10/12/2012, 18/02/2013, 10/12/2012, etc).
