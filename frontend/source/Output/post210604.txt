How do I turn off notifications from the home screen of my iPhone in iOS 9? <body> How do I turn off the notification on the lower left corner? I tried to turn off notifications in Settings for the app, but it didn't work. iOS 9.0.2.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HTEoh.jpg" alt="notification on lower left" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xsy8X.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer210611> Those are not notifications, those are apps that are suggested by iOS due to location and usage, or by Handoff from your other devices.  To change the settings for those, change the toggles in codeGeneral &gt; Handoff &amp; Suggested Apps/code in the codeSettings/code app. Toggle everything off if you do not use Handoff and do not want to see any suggestions.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/09qXX.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment254195> Thanks! I only have one iPhone. Strange.
