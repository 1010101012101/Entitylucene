Is there a way around "Error: Command Line Too long"? <body> I am using a command line software for which I need to input a lot of arguments. Something like  precode./exec -A argA -B argB -C argC ... /code/pre  There are so many arguments that I get the error message  precodeError: Command line too long (302110 &gt;= 130592) /code/pre  One solution would be to modify the software so that it reads arguments from a file. However, I don't have access to the source code.  Is there a way around this problem?  hr  FYI, I am on codeMac OS X 10.11.3/code and use codeTerminal 2.6.1 (361.1)/code  <answer254019> Put the arguments in a file such as code-A argA -B argB -C argC â€¦/code (excluding the binary), then run:  precodecat /path/to/file | xargs ./exec /code/pre  <comment316208> `getconf ARG_MAX` -the maximum characters allowed by the kernel. <comment316210> interestingly `getconf ARG_MAX` returns `262144` which is almost twice as much as `130592` (but still lower than `302110 `). <comment316243> Thanks a lot for your answer. I had some trouble while investigating the application of your solution to my specific issue (even though that sounds super simple) and so I asked [this question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/39648748/how-can-i-feed-this-long-line-of-arguments-to-an-executable?noredirect=1#comment66601135_39648748) where the first answer seems to say that `cat /path/to/file | xargs ./exec` cannot be a solution anyway.
