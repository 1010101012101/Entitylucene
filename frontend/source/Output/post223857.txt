How to image USB drives without having OS X mount them afterwards <body> I am using OS X to write USB drives. I have a disk image and am using codedd/code to the raw device to create the drive image. The problem I'm having is that OS X is automatically mounting the drives as soon as they are imaged. I'd like to prevent this behavior. Is there any way to do so?  <answer223860> Download, install and start Disk-Arbitrator. Activate it in "block mount" mode.  Now execute codesudo dd if=/path/to/file of=/dev/diskN [operands]/code. The resulting volume won't be mounted and no file will be created nor a folder will be changed:  precodesh-3.2# ls -laO total 0 drwxrwxr-x  7 user      staff  -      306 17 Jan 22:21 . drwxrwxrwt@ 8 root      admin  hidden 272 17 Jan 23:11 .. drwx------  5 root      wheel  -      170 17 Jan 22:21 .Spotlight-V100 d-wx-wx-wt@ 2 root      wheel  hidden  68 17 Jan 22:21 .Trashes drwx------  5 root      staff  -      170 17 Jan 22:21 .fseventsd /code/pre  Original image content:  precodedrwxrwxr-x  7 user      staff  -      306 17 Jan 22:21 . drwxrwxrwt@ 9 root      admin  hidden 306 17 Jan 23:23 .. drwx------  5 root      wheel  -      170 17 Jan 22:21 .Spotlight-V100 d-wx-wx-wt  2 root      wheel  hidden  68 17 Jan 22:21 .Trashes drwx------  5 root      staff  -      170 17 Jan 22:21 .fseventsd /code/pre  Don't forget to deactivate Disk Arbitrator after finishing the cloning.  hr  My first proposal below modifies at least some metadata of the folders /Volumes/VolumeName/.Trashes and /Volumes/VolumeName/.fseventsd  Simply appending code&amp;&amp; diskutil eject /dev/diskN/code after dd'ing should work:  precodesudo dd if=/path/to/file of=/dev/diskN [operands] &amp;&amp; diskutil eject /dev/diskN /code/pre  Upon completion of the dd command this should immediately eject the thumb drive.  <comment271380> Are you using a scripted process and if yes it might be helpful to included the script in your question.  If the image has an UUID or if the volume label that is known and static you can probably set a `fstab` entry that should keep it from mounting.  I do this on drives that I have multiple partitions that I only want a given partition to mount when inserted, leaving other(s) not mounted.  May work for you however don't have enough info on how/what your doing to test it. <comment271381> Does this cause the drive to be mounted, then unmounted, then ejected? My concern is that mounting the drive changes things on the drive. <comment271395> @vy32 updated answer <comment271402> That is precisely what I was looking for. I wasn't aware of Disk-Arbitrator. Thanks. <comment271415> Thanks. I saw that on another question. It's a useful idea, although getting the UUID the first time is a bit of a pain. <comment271416> I need a USB write blocker.
