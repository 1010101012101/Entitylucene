Function keys default <body> I have a MacBook Pro with Touch Bar. Touch Bar shows default buttons for brightness, volume, play/pause, etc.  I know there is the option to add applications to the shortcut bar in system settings to have the function keys kbdF1/kbd…kbdF12/kbd on the Touch Bar, but I want them ALWAYS.  I need them for programming (and I'm lazy and don't want to change my behaviour — imho it is part of the job of my computer to adapt to me, not the other way around) and so I have added PHPStorm to the apps, showing kbdF1/kbd…  The problem is, when I'm in my browser, calendar etc. Play, etc. is showing. So I never know whether I have to push kbdFn/kbd or not to pause the music.  Is there any way to make the display of the Touch Bar consistent?br And consistently showing kbdF1/kbd…kbdF12/kbd?  <answer287529> You can only do that: How to use function keys on MacBook Pro with Touch Bar     For some apps, you can make the function keys display permanently in   Touch Bar:      ol   liIn System Preferences, choose Keyboard./li   liClick Shortcuts./li   liFrom the left sidebar, select Function Keys./li   liClick the “+” symbol, then navigate to the app and select it./li   /ol      Now when you open or switch to this app, Touch Bar always displays the   function keys.
