iMessage going to different number <body> Whenever I use iMessage on my iPhone 4 or Macbook Air, some (not all) of the incoming messages go to another family member's number. This family member is not using my iTunes account and we have completely separate phone numbers. I did go to codeSettings &gt; Messages &gt; Receive At/code, and the codeCaller ID/code was my number, not the other person's.  How do I get the messages to only come to me?   <comment116010> What version of iOS is in use on your iPhone, and what version of Mac OS X is in use on the MacBook Air? For the messages received by the other family member, did you receive them too, or were they ONLY received by the other family member? <comment116037> On my iPhone, I have iOS 6.1.3 and version 10.8.4 of OS X on the Macbook Air. To my knowledge, whatever goes to my family member does not come to me. <comment116170> One other thought I had, then I'm completely stumped. If you go to Settings  Messages  Send & Receive on THEIR device, does anything listed there belong to you? (Should be a list consisting of a phone number and at least one email address.) <comment116187> I will definitely try that! Thank you
