How do I get BBEdit to display the error browser programmatically? <body> One of the nice features of BBEdit is that it can show a list of errors (e.g. syntax errors in a Ruby program), and clicking on the error will display the line in the source code file.  How can I bring this window up programmatically, e.g. via the command line, AppleScript, or a language module?  In my specific situation, I'm compiling SML/NJ programs.  The compiler lists errors in the following format:  precodecodegen.sml:121.31 Error: syntax error: inserting  LPAREN codegen.sml:130.49 Error: syntax error: inserting  EQUALOP /code/pre  When I get compiler errors like that, I'd like BBEdit to display those error messages and let me click on them to display the buggy line in my code.  <answer42517> You can do it using AppleScript and BBEdit's coderesults browser/code command. It isn't well documented, but there are some good examples around to help you out. For example: John Gruber's CSS Syntax Checker.  Here is a sample AppleScript.  precodetell application "BBEdit"   set error_list to ¬     {{result_kind: "Error", result_file: "/path/to/codegen.sml",¬       result_line: 121, message: "syntax error: inserting  LPAREN"},¬      {result_kind: "Error", result_file: "/path/to/codegen.sml",¬       result_line: 130, message: "syntax error: inserting  EQUALOP"}}   make new results browser with data error_list with properties ¬     {name:"Errors"} end tell /code/pre  Of course, you will want to create the codeerror_list/code variable programmatically, but this should get you started. If you change code/path/to/codegen.sml/code to a file that exists on your system, you can see it in action.  <comment64765> Thanks for the detailed info!  I would never have figured out the arguments from the BBEdit scripting dictionary.  I wrote a Python script to filter compiler output and display the browser window.  https://gist.github.com/3113810
