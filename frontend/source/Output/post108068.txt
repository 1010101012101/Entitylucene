Why is my Mac Mini unable to burn CD's using Finder? I'm getting error 0x80020063 <body> I'm having trouble burning some files to CD's using the finder. Every time I attempt to do so, disc verification hangs at 0%, followed by a bad media error (0x80020063). I've already attempted to use a few dozen CD's, including one from another spindle.     This disc canâ€™t be verified and might be unreliable. Try again using a new blank disc (error code 0x80020063).   The burner works perfectly when burning audio CDs using iTunes (with the same media). The files in question are only 25 MB.  The Console DiscRecording.Log shows the following:  precodeFinder: Burn started, Sat Nov  2 18:20:19 2013 Finder: Burning to CD-R media with SAO strategy in HL-DT-ST DVDRW  GA32N KC08 via ATAPI.

Searching the error online turns up a whole lot of voodoo solutions involving opening and closing finder windows, which, quite frankly, make no sense, but I'm desperate enough to have tried those too.  If it's relevant, this is a Mid-2010 Mac Mini, 2.4 GHZ.   What can I do to fix this?
