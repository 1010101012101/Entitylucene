Can I automatically change keyboard language when I switch between windows on macOS? <body> For example I use Messages app in which I use one keyboard, and in Xcode I use only English keyboard. Can macOS switch my keyboard to english when I make the Xcode window active?  <answer252674> Go to your Keyboard Preferences, then Input Sources and you can see "Automatically switch to a document's input source". Check that.  <answer290335> I have developed a app for this functionality.  GhostSKB - smart switcher of language input source for no-en users of macOS  It will help you to setting default input source for almost every app. By using it, when your app become active, the input source will be automatically changed to the default input source which you setted in GhostSKB.     <comment314407> It works with messenger. But doesn't switch language to English in XCode. Maybe there is some input source preferences in XCode? <comment314409> It works! I just switched language to English in XCode once and system remembered it automatically.
