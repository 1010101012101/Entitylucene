Sure-fire fix for getting an Apple TV 2 to accept an Apple ID? <body> So, I had to factory restore my Apple TV after the latest update from Apple bricked it. Got the MicroUSB cable and got the thing back on its feet.    Try as I might to enable the Remote app on my iPhone or connect to my iTunes Match (both of which require an Apple ID), every time I entered my creds they were refused, ala this support forum thread.  I finally re-entered the creds in a way that appeared no different from previous attempt and they were accepted.   What I want to know is: what made the difference? Anybody have a definitive fix in case this happens again to somebody?
