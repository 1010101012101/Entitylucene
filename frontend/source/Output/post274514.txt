No low battery warning & random restarts <body> Since I upgraded to macOS Sierra on my MacBook 15" (Mid 2014), I noticed some weird behaviour:  ul liWhen I'm running low on power, it doesn't notify me that my battery is going to die. It just shuts down. When I plug it in, it takes a few seconds and then shows me the login window, as if I put it on sleep./li liThe battery icon doesn't indicate when it is loading/li liWhenever my screensaver starts after a few minutes (on power AND battery) it locks my screen (as intended). After entering my password I see that it tried to restart (e.g. "Your mac hasn't restarted, because Google Chrome failed to quit.")/li /ul  I tried restoring the power settings to default, playing with the checkboxes in the "Energy Saver" tab and so on.  <answer274534> The first things I would do are reset the NVRAM and SMC. Below are the steps for doing so, as well as the order you emshould/em do it.  strong1. Reset the NVRAM/strong  Older Macs had what's called Parameter RAM (PRAM), newer Macs use Non-Volatile Random-Access Memory (NVRAM). Here’s how to reset it on your particular Mac:  ol listrongShut down your machine./strong Yes, a full shut down, not just logging out./li liPress the kbdpower button/kbd emand then/em press the kbdcommand/kbdkbdoption/kbdkbdp/kbdkbdr/kbd keys. You have to make sure you press these keys strongbefore/strong the gray screen appears or it won’t work./li listrongHold those keys down/strong until your Mac reboots again and you here the startup chime./li liLet go of the keys and let your Mac reboot normally./li /ol  strongNote:/strong When you log back in you strongemmay/em/strong need to readjust some of your system preferences (e.g. speaker volume, screen resolution, startup disk selection, time zone information, etc).  strong2. Reset the SMC/strong  Here’s what you do to reset the SC on your particular Mac:  ol liShut down your computer/li liKeep the MagSafe adapter (power cable) strongplugged in/strong./li liPress at the same time kbdshift/kbdkbdoption/kbdkbdcontrol/kbd (on the left side of the keyboard) strongemand/em/strong the kbdpower button/kbd/li liLet go/li liTurn your computer back on with the power button./li /ol  Once you've done both of these, check to see whether the problem behaviour is still present. Let me know how you go.  <comment345294> First thing I notice is: The battery icon is back to normal when plugged in and when plugged out. I'll have an eye on it and let you know if it solved the other two problems. <comment345574> Unfortunately, that didn't solved my problem, it still tries to restart when the screensaver is activated
