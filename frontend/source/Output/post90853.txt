iTunes 11 interface illegible <body> I'm having issues with the iTunes interface being illegible. It is especially a problem in the iPhone management area. I have searched the world for similar issues and so far nothing has turned up. Hoping someone here has ideas on how to resolve. Thanks!  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yijVn.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer90882> Have you MD5'd iTunes.app? The easiest solution might be to backup your library and completely reinstall iTunes, being sure to clear out anything in ~/Library, /Library and the like.  <answer91107> I solved this trashing my preferences code~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.itunes/code. I don't know why I didn't do this earlier as it really should have been one of the first things to try.  <comment106678> This persists after quitting and reopening iTunes? <comment106688> Indeed it does. I've had this issue for ~1 month. I've run Cocktail (clear caches, repair permission, run scripts) and rebooted multiple times since this issue began for me. <comment106708> Move iTunes.app to the trash and reinstall it. <comment106760> I downloaded and reinstalled. I also deleted the ~/Library/Caches/com.apple.itunes. The issue persists.
