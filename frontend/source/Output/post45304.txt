Reduce iPhone Ringer Volume Without Affecting Messagaging Alert Volume <body> I need to know how I can lower the volume on my phone ringer without lowering the volume for messaging alerts.  At night, I need Messaging to be LOUD, but I want my phone ringer to be barely audible (note: ringer still needs to emit some sound, not completely turned off).  <answer45307> Sadly this isn't an option on a non-jailbroken device.  <answer45308> One option is to use a silent (or very quiet) ringtone for phone calls and then have the normal sound play for messages. This site has a walkthrough. You could also use the same trick to silence calls from specific numbers.  <comment51618> This is a great tip, although the OP would need to change the ringtone every time it turns night, if they wanted to use the phone normally during the day.
