Fixing broken Messages on OS X Mavericks <body> I managed to break my Messages install trying to get it to work on my MacBook Air by deleting Library files that worked with it. Now when I try to open messages I get the error      An internal Messages error occurred.           There was a problem with Messages. You need to quit and open Messages again.      Can I just copy Library files from another one of my computers running OS X? Or is this the sort of thing that I need to reinstall the OS for?  <answer113959> strongYes, copying the files from another computer should be fine/strong, providing both computers have the same version of Messages.  There is a certain amount of leniency with this though, depending on where the files are that you deleted. For example, files in your home folder are expected to be backward-compatible since if you've upgraded your OS then it must know how to update the files.  Also, once you've copied the files, make sure you set the permissions correctlyâ€¦  ul liIf you've copied files to /Library, use Disk Utility to repair permissions./li liIf you've copied files to ~/Library, use the ACL tool on the Recovery HD./li /ul
