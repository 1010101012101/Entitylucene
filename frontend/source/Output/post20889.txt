How do I write to NTFS drives in OS X? <body> What is the best, easiest, preferably cheapest way to make OS X write to NTFS-formatted drives in Mac OS X?  <answer20896> The simplest solution would be to use MacFUSE and NTFS-3G for MacFUSE, though as of this post only Tuxera NTFS ( ~$35 USD) and PARAGON Software NTFS for OS X  v.9.0 ($19.95 USD) support 10.7. You can grab the source for free from Tuxera for free, however.  As of OS X 10.6 you can natively enable NTFS support, though your mileage may vary. Follow this writeup by Mac OS X Hints if you're interested but I'd use the MacFUSE method over this one. Keep in mind that neither of these methods are fully supported.  <answer29158> Updated at May 2015, with current solutions.  strongFree solutions/strong  FUSE for OS X - Successor to MacFUSE  NTFS-3Gbr Last updated 2010, pretty much abandoned in favour of the Paid version, Tuxera, unless you want to build from source.

Works stable for a month, no problems happened yet. Anybody knows, will users of Seagate HDDs get free NTFS driver upgrade for new OS X when Apple will release it?  <answer97360> I tested this on Mountain lion and it is free and you don't need to reboot. It uses OS X's native NTFS drivers.  ol liPlug-in your device/li liWrite in Terminal codediskutil list/code and look for IDENTIFIER where TYPE is Windows_NTFS.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Yl1t2.png" alt=""  In this case it is codedisk1s1/code/li liThen run the following:  precodediskutil unmount /dev/disk1s1 cd /Volumes mkdir Elements sudo mount -w -t ntfs -o rw,nobrowse /dev/disk1s1 /Volumes/Elements open /Volumes/Elements /code/pre/li /ol  <answer138579> Before we start.

I got an error like `Read-only file system` when I for example tried to run `mkdir /Volumes/HD-HCU2/aa`. Is there some reason why you used `nobrowse`? <comment114231> You are creating the folder on wrong path. You should create the folder under `/Volumes`. <comment114232> `nobrowse` are needed to make ntfs writable. <comment125432> +1, Be aware that this feature is not complete and well-tested. It's not enabled by default for some reason. Worth mentioning that the force-write-enabled driver simply damaged an NTFS volume while I was playing with it. <comment163493> Removing `/etc/fstab` is only an option if it doesn't contain any other important entries <comment166195> So there is a capability within OS X to mount NTFS for read and write support. But this is disabled. Is there a way to do a 'defaults write' to activate this feature? <comment257572> MacFUSE got replaced by [FUSE for OS X](http://osxfuse.github.io/) <comment257828> Fuse for OS X and NTFS-3G must be installed together.

See example in `man fstab`: `LABEL=The\040Volume\040Name\040Is\040This none msdos ro` <comment267076> Ok, After doing all this will the NTFS vol automatically be mounted? <comment267110> @MohammedFawzan Yes, that's the goal. <comment267111> I tried all the steps. still I cannot write to the volumes. :/ <comment267112> Be sure that the `brew install homebrew/fuse/ntfs-3g` was successfull (read carefully). Also if you had previous versions of osxfuse or ntfs-3G, you need to uninstall them. <comment267113> I tried to re run the command I got the following message. `omebrew/fuse/ntfs-3g-2015.3.14 already installed, it's just not linked` <comment267114> If you are experimenting a lot, it will be easier to avoid re-enabling System Integrity Protection (csrutil), so you don't need to reboot too many times. <comment267116> Yeah, I will try to uninstall & install it again. <comment267117> For linking issue with homebrew, maybe try http://stackoverflow.com/questions/29422345/installed-just-not-linked ; also, try brew uninstall ntfs-3g. <comment268293> does the seagate version of paragon 14 work for drives other than seagate?
