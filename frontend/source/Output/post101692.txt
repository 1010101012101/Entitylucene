Cleaning up birth years 2000 in my Address Book <body> A few years ago (or actually, more likely, in 2000), for some reason, codebirthdays/code that didn't have a codebirth year/code (but did and do have correct month and day) were automatically given the codebirth year/code 2000 in my Address Book. There are hundreds of them (among thousands which are fine).  Is there a way to select these cards, perhaps by Smart Group or something similar, so that I may manually remove the codebirth year/code 2000?  hr  NB: I just might also be able to run an AppleScript with a little help. :) OS X 10.8.5 installed.  <answer101709> Try:  precodeset targetYear to "2000" set targetGroup to {}  tell application "Address Book"     set thePeople to every person whose birth date ≠ missing value     repeat with aPerson in thePeople         set birthYear to (aPerson's birth date)         if my yearCheck(birthYear, targetYear) then set end of targetGroup to (contents of aPerson)     end repeat     if targetGroup ≠ {} then set selection to targetGroup     activate end tell  on yearCheck(theDate, theYear)     if theYear = (year of theDate as text) then return true     return false end yearCheck /code/pre  hr  emAdded by the OP for novices like him./em This works. What I did: Open Address Book, click All Contacts, close Address Book, close the Internet connection (just to be sure), copy-paste the above script into AppleScript Editor, press Compile, press Run, wait until "Running..." disappears. Address Book is now open with the cards with 2000 selected. Put those in a Group for further work...  <answer101772> I accidentally posted an answer here on this question meant for:  Removing only birth years from a group in my Address Book    Since it is related I will leave a link to the other question.  <comment119800> My address book has a bunch of people with a birth year of 1900! <comment119811> It won't change anything. It will select the cards. <comment119817> Works like a charm! I hate to ask this, but... It turns out there are 632 cards with the year 2000. Even more than I suspected. Could you please please please make the script remove the years, but keep months and days? Did I say please? <comment119818> @DanielLawson The script below by adayzdone (v1) works like a charm. What I did: Open Address Book, click All Contacts, close Address Book, close the internet connection, copy-paste into AppleScript Editor, press Compile, press Run, wait until "Running..." disappears. Address Book is now open with the cards with 2000 selected. Put those in a group for further work... <comment119820> I don't think you can remove the year. I tried doing it manually and it doesn't work in 10.6.8 <comment119822> I think I can in 10.8.5, at least it appears that I can change "December 22, 2000" to "December 22" (but _not_ to "Frog 22"). (Perhaps I'll ask another question on the site.) Well, I do have the selection now in a Group, so that's a huge start. Many, many thanks! <comment119888> Great! 1604. I'll give it a go later today. Thanks, looks good. <comment119890> I posted the answer on your other question where it was meant to go. If it works out can you accept or comment on that one. Cheers <comment119910> FYI: markhunte figured out that setting the year to 1604 makes the year "disappear". <comment119911> Ha ... I think that is the strangest solution I have seen!
