Change from a French keyboard to a US International on iMacbook Pro with Retina <body> I've purchased a MacBook Pro 13" with retina screen last week in France. I'd like to change some physical keys in the keyboard to a US International keyboard.   What should be the best way to do so?  <comment206874> Are you looking how to change the language in the software settings? That should automatically update the keyboard to match. <comment206883> Negotiate as soon as possible an exchange with Apple. The French, the English international & the German keyboards suffer the same problem: their return key on the right is too small and cause too many typing errors. Ask for a standard Qwerty keyboard, and be aware that you will be able to type on this keyboard any european language twice faster than on any localized keyboard. <comment206888> @danielAzuelos ISO style keyboards are provided by Apple in all W and E European countries, Russia, Canada, Middle East, Africa.  Countless millions of people use them and I can't remember seeing a complaint about the return key before.
