iTunes: Why do some internet radio streams show up in my main music list and some do not? <body> I'm setting up a fresh iTunes library, and I'd like to have a playlist with some internet radio stations.  However, I'm seeing inconsistent behavior with how these are being handled in iTunes 10.  When I add The Current MP3 stream to a playlist, it strongdoes not/strong show up in my main music list, however, when I add the BBC Radio 6 it does show up in the music list, not matter how I add it (dragging from the radio list directly, or adding the URL via Advanced  Open Stream).  Why are these streams treated differently?  How can I strongprevent/strong the BBC stream from showing up in the main music list (like The Current stream currently does)?  I'm using iTunes 10.5.2 (11) 64-bit on Lion  The Current MP3 stream url (Added via Advanced  Open Stream): http://minnesota.publicradio.org/tools/play/streams/the_current.pls  BBC Radio 6 stream url (got the URL from the iTunes radio list): http://bbcmedia.ic.llnwd.net/stream/bbcmedia_lc1_6music_p?s=1326827601&amp;e=1326842001&amp;h=81a3810c662b7c85a3d24d7aa24ac120  <answer37670> I tried both streams like you did and at first I received the same results you did. strongemBBC Radio 6/em/strong showed up in the music but strongemThe Current/em/strong didn't appear to.  Then, I tried typing "The Current" into the iTunes search box while Music was selected in the sidebar. The result: emThe Current from Minnesota Public Radio/em pops up as the first and only search result in the iTunes main menu.   What I believe it that because this radio listing contains a blank album and artist field, iTunes gets a bit confused but ends up placing them "somewhere" amongst your other entries with blank album and/or artists fields. It can appear to be lost there because there doesn't appear to be any particular order those entries are sorted by-default. (I am almost certain you can do something about that if you really wanted.)  IF you are still interested in seeing your music with those streams, I would recommend just creating a smart playlist that excludes them. Try this a the rule to use in the smart playlist (Cmd-Opt-N to bring up its dialog, btw):  "(Kind) (is not) (Internet audio stream)"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1mjj7.png" alt="smart playlist dialog"  Hope this was helpful.  -b  <answer37671> I think I figured it out: if you add a link to a pls file and then leave the entry in the playlist that iTunes creates, the new stream will not show up in the music list.  If the stream isn't a pls file or you try to move it, it will show up as a song in the main music list.
