Is the iPhone 6 more powerful than a 1980s era Cray supercomputer? <body> A friend today mentioned in conversation:     You know that iPhone 6 you're carrying in your pocket. It has more computing power than the Cray supercomputers of the 80s.    That sounded vaguely right, but I wasn't sure.   My question is: strongIs the iPhone 6 more powerful than a Cray supercomputer?/strong  <answer180494> It would really depend on which end of the 1980s we choose. A Cray 2, circa 1985 would be a good midline choice.  CPU speed of the Cray-2 was about 250MHz, with what we would today call 4 cores. 256Megs of memory but at 64bits per address instead of 8, or as we would call it today 2 GB of RAM. In terms of raw power it has been compared to an iPad. that's if you use a CPU benchmark.  However, supercomputers are usually optimized for parallel tasks or rather staggering amounts of input-output. It really isn't practical to say "my phone could replace supercomputer X from year Y" as they aren't capable of performing the same tasks. If we jump back a couple more generations we emcan/em say that an iPhone could have run the entire Apollo program assuming we hooked it up to a signal booster (and hold it the right way).  The iPhone beats the Cray hands-down in power consumption: 200 kW, 480 V 3-phase power coming in resulting in over 2000 amps internal power. Pressurized liquid cooling with an external heat exchanger the size of a car.  Looks awesome sitting in your dedicated computing center though.  <comment214362> More powerful in terms of what, GFLOPS? <comment214363> I wasn't going to specify a particular metric - feel free to select the most appropriate one. <comment214390> You'd look silly holding up a Cray & typing with your thumbs though ;) <comment214420> Todays iPhone battery life times suggests that this 480V 3-phase power supply was not a bad idea at all <comment214451> Apparently Apple bought a Cray to help design the new Macintosh. Around the same time, Seymour Cray bought a new Macintosh to help him design his new Cray. <comment214456> @LaconicDroid: For quite a while, I had a cutting from a UK newspaper that recorded that story â€“ sadly, it got lost some time ago (or, at least, I've not seen it or a decade or more). <comment214457> Was the "256 Megs" of memory therefore 4 gibibytes (8-bit bytes) in 256 mibi-words?  Or was it 256 mibibytes of memory in 32 mibi-words?  (Using 'word' for the 64-bit unit of addressable memory.)  Either way, in raw RAM, the iPhone 6 must be right up there with it (ahead if it was 256 MiB). <comment214467> We would say it had 2GB of memory. 256M memory locations of 64 bits each, so multiply by 8. In the mid-1980s that was an absolutely staggering amount - home computers had 128kB. iPhone 6 has 1GB so it's still ahead there. <comment214472> If you really want to know, port the [LINPACK benchmarks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LINPACK_benchmarks) to your phone and see where it would end up on the historical [TOP500 list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TOP500).  (As a point of reference, my desktop (not counting the graphics card) would have made the list any year before 2001.) <comment214475> An iPhone 6 would indeed look awesome (surprising, at least) sitting in the middle of a dedicated computing center. <comment214487> The iPhone 6 also has a massively parallel GPU which can be used for performing supercomputer-like tasks using something like OpenCL. <comment214495> so how many iPhones would fit in a Cray ? <comment214506> FYI: The [brochure](http://www.craysupercomputers.com/downloads/Cray2/Cray2_Brochure001.pdf) mentions the following about the memory: "It consists of up to 256 million 64-bit words". That is a total of 2GiB of memory.. <comment273583> This answer is poorly phrased.  It doesn't have "256Megs of memory", it has 2 GB arranged as 256M x 64 bits, just like a single modern 2GB DIMM.   Also - "2000 amps internal power"?!  Amps are _current_, not _power_!
