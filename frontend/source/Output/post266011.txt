Reclaiming Unallocated Free Space that might Have Gone to Recovery Partition? <body> So, I have a pretty grave problem that I really need help with.  Earlier today, I decided to remove my old and buggy bootcamp partition and reinstall windows.  Problem was, bootcamp assistant didn't allow me to pick the same size as I previously had, so I decided to try to forcibly resize the Mac partition using codediskutil resizevolume/code and then format the unallocated space into FAT32.    That's when my real problem started.  I was unable to use disk utility to convert that unallocated space afterwards, and a few boots later, I even think that the recovery partition seems to have taken the unallocated space for itself.  This is my main partition, for reference:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HQeFb.png" alt="My main partition"  And this is what codediskutil list/code shows:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1ZcUA.png" alt="closer look"   So my question now is this: how do I return things to normal on my hd and reclaim all the space for the main partition?  Do I have to delete the Recovery HD partition and reinstall it afterwards?  Or am I making a mistake and the space is still somehow unallocated?      <answer266015> You somehow merged disk0s3 and disk0s4 (the Windows partition) to one big recovery partition - consequently there is no unallocated disk space. With your published commands this shouldn't have happened though.  The fastest way to get a default partition scheme is to merge disk0s2 with disk0s3 and later recreate Recovery HD with a tool like Recovery Partition Creator.  The merge command is:  precodediskutil mergePartitions JHFS+ "Macintosh HD" disk0s2 disk0s3 /code/pre  The command will merge emMacintosh HD/em and emRecovery HD/em to one big emMacintosh HD/em while retaining the content of your main system volume.  <comment333835> This did it for me, thanks a lot for your answer!  So rarely in my case does a simple, single terminal command solve my problems, so again thanks for the help.
