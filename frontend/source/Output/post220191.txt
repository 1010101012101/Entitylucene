Export single SMS from iPhone and import on another iPhone <body> Is there a possibility to sync the messages between two iPhones? Currently, I'm switching from one phone to another, but one device has got a new SMS.  How can I export the single SMS and import it on the other phone? Is the only option through making a complete new backup with iTunes (time consuming and I don't need all data)?  I also tried to enable iCloud backup, but it fails every time ...  <answer222039> If both of your iPhones are jailbroken, you can  ol liLogin into your old iPhone via SSH/li liDownload code/var/mobile/Library/SMS/sms.db/code file from your iPhone/li liOpen the file with codesqlite3/code command in your computer or any SQLite client./li liGet the last message based on timestamps with codeSELECT/code SQL command./li liThen login into your new iPhone and open code/var/mobile/Library/SMS/sms.db/code file with sqlite3 command, and do the reverse action./li liThat means: insert the new message with codeINSERT/code command/li /ol  This might work.  <comment266491> To me "single SMS" means one single to message to or from one person.   Also does "new SMS" mean new phone number? <comment266492> Yes, one single message. I had my phone with the old number. I made a backup with iTunes and restored it on the new phone (no SIM yet). Now I got a SMS which I also want to have on my new device. (This device now has a new SIM with a new phone number). <comment268985> thats good idea @Hamid i will try to check what i have in that db :) thanks.
