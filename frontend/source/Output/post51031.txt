How do I make a shortcut command in terminal? <body> I want to have codell/code as a shortcut for codels -ll/code. How can I add it to my Termianl application? I use emiTerm/em as my primary Terminal application. I wish there was a single line command solution for it.  <answer51033> Add it to your code.bash_profile/code by running codenano ~/.bash_profile/code and adding  precodealias ll='ls -ll' /code/pre  kbdControl/kbd + kbdX/kbd, then kbdY/kbd, then kbdEnter/kbd to save the file.  Restart Terminal. codell/code should now be an alias for codels -ll/code. Use it like you would any other commands.  <comment58366> Thanks, this worked. In both native terminal app and iTerm. I was confused with all `bashrc` file locations. <comment58367> @Mohsen Ah. That would do it. :-) <comment58614> No need to restart the terminal, you can execute the same command on the shell `alias ll='ls -ll'` or source you `.bash_profile again` by `source ~/.bash_profile`.
