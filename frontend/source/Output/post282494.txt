How to enable folders and sub-folders notification in Microsoft Outlook for Mac Version 15.32 <body> I'm using Microsoft Outlook for Mac Version 15.32, and I have rules configured for moving mails to specific folders and sub-folders within Inbox.   I get desktop notifications when mail comes to Inbox folder (not the subfolders) but I'm not able to configure rules to enable desktop notifications.   I looked up on forums, and it says to configure an option "Display Notifications". But it's only available under Exchange in Client Rules and not Server Rules. Is there a way to configure for server rules?
