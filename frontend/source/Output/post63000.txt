You can set them up in Preferences  Profiles  Advanced  Triggers  Edit.  Here is my current set of regexes:  pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"code(?i:.*error.*)                     // Yellow on Black (?i:.*(warning|warn).*)            // Orange on Black (?i:.*FATAL.*)                     // White on Red /code/pre  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HRr6U.png" alt="iTerm regexes in a profile’s Triggers"  You are welcome to improve it :)  <comment72710> what exactly is your question here? If it's the question in the title, what do you mean with "optimal"? <comment72719> Hmm - let me see if I can help - you have some of the answer in the question. As edited, it's still a bit too much in the category of "•every answer is equally valid: “What’s your favorite ______?” •your answer is provided along with the question, and you expect more answers: “I use ______ for ______, what do you use?” <comment257641> Any idea what version of iTerm this was introduced? I can't find this option in `Build 0.10`
