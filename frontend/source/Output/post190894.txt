Animate two bullet lists in sync? <body> Given a side by side list of bullets, I can animate them to reveal bullet by bullet. But they will only animate one list at a time. For instance:  img src="https://i.imgur.com/p9n3Tz1.png" alt="example"  The list of one, two, three will go down point by point, then four, five six. I would like to reveal one and four at the same time, the two and five and finally three and six. Does anyone know how this can be done?  <comment226672> create 3 tables that you sequently hide and show. first table with one row, second with two rows, etc. <comment226730> I'm not sure i understand what you mean. Can you clarify. I'm new to keynote.
