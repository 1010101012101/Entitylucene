SD card slot is always read-only <body> I have a 4 GB Micro SDHC card and I use a Micro SD adapter sleeve to read it with the built-in SD card slot of my 15" mid-2010 MacBook Pro. It's been a while since I tried to use it, but I just realized that my Mac will always treat it as read-only, no matter the position of the physical lock on the adapter sleeve.  I can't even format the partition because all the options in the "Erase" and "Partition" tabs of Disk Utility are grayed out for the SD card.  Why is the card read-only, and more importantly, how can I write to it?  <answer65085> Is this problem for all your SD cards or just one. If just one, I would try formatting it in FAT from a PC and then trying that.   I had a USB flash drive that I had installed a Linux distro on and it gave me similar issues on my Mac mini.  <answer65087> According to one user on the apple discussion forum, strongresetting the PRAM should fix the issue:/strong  From Apple KB     ol   liShut down the computer. /li   liLocate the following keys on the keyboard:    kbd⌘/kbd+kbdOption/kbd+kbdP/kbd+kbdR/kbd. You will   need to hold these keys down    simultaneously in step 4. /li   liTurn on the computer. /li   listrongImmediately/strong press and hold the kbd⌘/kbd+kbdOption/kbd+kbdP/kbd+kbdR/kbd.

Use System Preferences to restore your settings.   <answer68658> The problem spontaneously disappeared for me. I'm leaving this as an answer since it might reassure some people to know that for some random reasons, at some point, things start working again. However, I was not able to pin down a specific cause for it, so I'm not going to accept the answer, in case that at some point someone comes with a rational explanation.  <answer72215> Slide the read/write lock to the middle neutral position and retry. I have the same problem sometimes...  <answer76308> In my case, a physical misalignment is causing the read only status. Gently pushing the disk away from the display reliably makes my cards write again.  <answer101177> Open Disk Utility, find and select the SD card, then click Repair Disk from the First Aid tab. You should now be able to read and write.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NemYp.png" alt="Disk Utility Repair Disk"  <answer131255> The tricks above worked for me but less and less so. It feels like a hit and miss and can easily take me 10 tries.  This annoying problem has another potential fix. When I need to get my card into Read/write mode I can do this by taping over the slot of my card where the lock slide is. It does not matter where the lock slide is set to as it will be masked by the tape anyway. This works 100% of the cases. It does have disadvantages:  ul lipotentially getting tape stuck into the reader (be careful)/li lineed to apply it and take it off each time tape/li limight take the paper of any label sticker on the SD card off/li /ul  I’m actually going to buy a reader because of these disadvantages.  <answer138779> Another thing to ensure when trying all these 'tricks' is to plug the laptop into a power supply. Because the card reader draws power if the battery is not delivering enough current to the reader it can cause issues.  For example, mounting of problematic USB hard disks can be resolved by plugging the laptop to the power supply.  <answer199226> I regularly have this problems with my macs ...so I bought two card readers. One is an strongAdvent/strong one... but that wont let me write sometimes either. The one I have by strongPuremedia/strong seems to have no problems though .. so I stick with that.  <comment76433> Well I have two Micro SDs at hand and both exhibit the same behavior. I formatted the 4GB one to FAT32 from my digital camera (since that's what I wanted to do anyways) and I still can't write to it. <comment76436> Also, Linux distributions are generally installed on an EXT filesystem, so my feeling is that you just couldn't write to the filesystem, instead of to the device itself. In my case I can't write to the device at all, and a format didn't fix it. <comment76892> I'll try that when I get back home. <comment77009> The problem spontaneously disappeared today, so I'm afraid I can't verify anything. Still, thanks for the tip, if this happens again I'll try that. <comment79768> I am having this problem with all of my cards, and resetting the PRAM has NOT fixed the issue. I see no solutions on any forums this issue has been posted on, but lots of people saying it eventually just disappeared by itself. I am running 10.8.2 <comment79770> @Rob, I read on the Apple support forum that for a user, depending on how you inserted the SD card into the slot, it would be read-only or read-write. He said that if you put the card loose into the slot and push from the side closer to you to make contact, it becomes read-write, and otherwise it's read-only. I did it like two times without success but then the problem disappeared on third time. This looks superstitious, but at that point you might want to try anyways. <comment83834> There is a neutral position on an SD card? <comment88524> What MBP model is this? I have a similar issue on MBP Late 2009 <comment88529> Sliding the read/write lock to the neutral position works for me. <comment88542> It's a mid-2010, I just edited my question to include it. <comment88655> Weirdly enough, this worked for me (I put the switch about halfway between lock and unlock, popped it back into the slot, and all write options were no longer grayed out).  Try it and post your results. <comment98393> @zneak WOW your method worked for me the very first time, and this was after me trying all kinds of other ways to no avail. I have a 2011 MBP running Lion. <comment119100> Didn't work for me when I had this problem. <comment119104> Wouldn't the volume be greyed out if it were mounted read-only? I suppose you should be able to unmount it and then attempt a repair, but my guess is the item you have listed as **8.02 GB Apple SDXC Rea…** would be grey in the case of this question. <comment119852> I put the lock into the middle position as others mentioned and it, too, worked for me. How bizarre. <comment163732> This sounds more like superstition than like an actual explanation. A card reader acting on NAND Flash storage needs much, much less power than an actual hard drive. My laptop was connected at all times when I had this problem. <comment168745> This works for me too. Can't believe this will work. <comment178170> I shared @patrix's sentiment. I then tried sliding the lock selector to the middle and, surprisingly, it worked. <comment185008> Worked for me but it took a lot of experimentation to figure out the exact position... at about 6/10ths of the way along, I can read/write again :) <comment199125> having the same problem -- with an USB card reader the same card works perfectly... <comment339140> I also ended using an external card reader. <comment359113> Bloody hells. This saved me a lot of aggravation. <comment364153> None of the methods in the answers worked for me, but zneak's trick that he commented above worked well after 2 tries.
