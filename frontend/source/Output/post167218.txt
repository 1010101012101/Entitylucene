Clam shell mode without external display, keyboard, mouse <body> I have a latest 13 inch MBP retina, running 10.10.  I am wondering, is there a way to run the machine with the lids closed strongWITHOUT/strong an external monitor, keyboard, and mouse?  We are using the machine as a server in a confined space, and would like to keep the machine closed, but still running.  Thanks  <answer167219> Not natively, but you can use an app like InsomniaX to prevent the device from sleeping when the lid is closed.  http://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/22211/insomniax
