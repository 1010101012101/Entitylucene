Prettify OS X console by coloring output? <body> OS X terminal is not using colors for highlighting output from different commands, for example codels/code.   When compared with other systems like Ubuntu, this is a big loss of accessibility/productivity.  What solutions do I have to improve this experience? For the moment I found only this guide for colored ls output under OS X but I am looking for a more complete solution.  <answer15000> You can easily change the ls output color by installing "TerminalColors" plugin. I am a big fan of "Solarize" theme which looks terrific on my Mac.  <answer15003> ul liyou should change the Terminal.app preferences-advanced into xterm-color./li lienter the following into your ~/.profile/li /ul  for enable colored codels/code:  precodeexport CLICOLOR=1; export LSCOLORS=exfxcxdxbxegedabagacad; /code/pre  and from now, you will get colored codels/code output.  <comment16184> Looks nice. Will try it this evening. <comment16188> +1 thanks, Solarize is nice and I will use it, but the question was not about how to "tune" the colors, it was about adding colors to the output of different commands. <comment16193> +1 For proper terminal colour definitions. In general colours are personal but I would recommend to enable features more on a system-based way than by adding a plugin. <comment16207> +1 - Does what it says on the tin. Cheers. A question: Where would I put such a config file at a more general level (i.e. not in ~)? <comment16210> IMHO the your $HOME/.profile is the best place, but if you want can put them into system wide `/etc/profile`. e.g. sudo open /etc/profile <comment25858> Note that prior to Lion, the default $TERM value is xterm-color, so you rarely need to change it. As of Mac OS X Lion 10.7, Terminal's default $TERM value is xterm-256color, which enables programs that can take advantage of the extended 256 color palette. On Lion and later, using xterm-color is discouraged, because it describes an older, less-featureful branch of xterm, and Lion Terminal is more compatible with modern xterm. So you should generally stick with xterm-256color or just xterm. <comment260262> You can create your own color scheme with this [online tool](http://geoff.greer.fm/lscolors/)
