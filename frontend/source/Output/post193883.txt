To have RAM-based filesystem in OSX? <body> I would like do real-time monitoring, discussing one part of it here about counting quickly.  No packages about it in homebrew.   How can you have RAM-based filesystem in OSX?  <answer194651> Mac OS includes support for RAM-based filesystems via coderamfs/code. Everything is RAM backed so it's incredibly fast with near zero latency, but the contents are lost upon reboot.  To create one and mount it under code/tmp/mymount/code, create a script with the following contents and run it:  pre !#/bin/sh NUMSECTORS=128000       # a sector is 512 bytes mydev=`hdiutil attach -nomount ram://$NUMSECTORS` newfs_hfs $mydev mkdir /tmp/mymount mount -t hfs $mydev /tmp/mymount /pre  The above was adapted from the codehdiutil/code manual page.  You can also do it in a one-liner (adapted from here):  pre diskutil erasevolume HFS+ 'RAM Disk' `hdiutil attach -nomount ram://XXXXX` /pre  Where codeXXXXX/code is the size in 2048 byte blocks. There is also a useful script in this post on Superuser.  <comment231164> Reading between the lines, I assume you'd like a RAM-backed filesystem (the equivalent of a "RAM disk")? <comment232248> @mjturner Yes. I want a RAM-backed filesystem. Any idea how in OSX?
