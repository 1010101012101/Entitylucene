How can I draw freehand circles on screenshots? <body> In Windows I can happily fire up MS Paint and draw freehand circles with the brush tool on top of my screenshots.  In OS X if I open up a screenshot with Preview and use the pen-looking thing and draw a freehand circle, it's automatically converted into a soulless oval. I also can't draw squiggly arrows or poorly scrawled text.  Short of launching Photoshop (or whatever non-default app), is there a baked-in way to draw freehand circles in OS X?  <answer228996> But you can draw freehand circles in strongPreview/strong, just select the shape you want to use in the upper left corner after you draw the shape. Looks like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qQd75.png" alt="Preview with shape selection"  <comment279301> Ah, didn't notice that popping up for some reason. <comment335062> For those wondering where these controls are: `View Show Markup Toolbar`
