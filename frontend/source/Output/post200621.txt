Apple software - Numbers <body> How do I identify and add(sum) only specific cells in a row - they are not continuous cells. Ex. I1, O1, U1 total sum and show in BG1  <answer200626> You would use a formula for this.  In the cell you want the SUM to display (BG1 in your question), enter this formula code=SUM(I1,O1,U1)/code  Note that the function is codeSUM()/code preceded by an equal sign code=/code and the cell values are comma separated. You can also include ranges by putting a colon between cells.  Say you wanted to select A1 through E1, then I1, O1, and U1: code=SUM(A1:E1,I1,O1,U1)/code  Here is a list containing some of the functions available to you in Numbers.
