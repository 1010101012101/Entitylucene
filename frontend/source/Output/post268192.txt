Open a single Pages document in two windows? <body> In Pages is it possible to open a single document in two windows?  Example:  I have a 10 page document called "Recipes." I want to see pages 3 &amp; 8 of the "Recipes" document on screen at the same time.  I can then scroll from page 3 to 4 and onwards, while page 8 remains on screen.   There are lot of work arounds (such as open the document in Word or Preview). But I would like to be able to do it all in Pages.  Hopefully, there is some terminal command or something that I have missed.   (I know I can send Feedback to Apple, but who knows how long before they create such a feature).   <answer268235> It's pretty clear to me that the ask is for two views into strongthe same/strong document, either two windows, or a split screen â€” as has been offered in Word and many other word processors and text editors for a long time.  I believe the short answer is no.
