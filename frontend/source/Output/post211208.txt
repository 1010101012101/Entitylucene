iPhone 5s from Dennmark to Portugal <body> Will an unlocked iPhone 5s from Dennmark work in Portugal?   Thanks!  <answer211210> I've visited both countries (and most other European countries) with my iPhone 5s A1530 model (=Asian version) and it works fine.  I worked both with my common simcard as wel as local simcards.  Never had any problem.  That being said, I also never had any problems using European, Asian and Australian versions of the iPhone 4, 4s, 5 and 6.    Although I don't have experience with these, I assume only with phones designed especially for US and China you might have issues in Europe.  <answer211211> Yes, an unlocked iPhone is a phone that is purchased without a service contract to a major cell phone service provider. This means that you can use an unlocked iPhone with any carrier in any country you want.  <answer211214> Look at the model number as printed on the back of the phone, it starts with the letter A and is followed by 4 digits.    The use this table on the apple website to determine carrier compatibility. (Note: the iPhone 5s section on that page requires scrolling down quite a bit.)  <comment254960> The table only determines if the 4G(LTE) compatibility, even if it's not in that table he could still use 3G. It doesn't mean that the iPhone will not work on a certain carrier.
