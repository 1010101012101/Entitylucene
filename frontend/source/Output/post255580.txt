Mac OS Scaled Resolution <body> I have a Dell 4k p2715q monitor. I have connected it to my Mac mini 2012.  However, my mac mini can't run 4k. In order to work I had to lower the resolution to 1920x1080. The display quality looks awesome. I can't believe it. I took a different Full HD display and connected it and it worked with the same resolution but the display sharpness and quality was not nearly the same. 1080p should be 1080p? Right? I was wondering if it has something to do with the "Scaled" option?  I would like to know more. Did anyone notice similar display/resolution issues/benefits?  <comment318350> _"I took a different Full HD display and..."_ Can you clarify what brand/model this other display was?
