Install InkScape without XQuartz <body> Is it possible to install InkScape without XQuartz?  I did install it already and it's working but I feel like it's not that native (e.g. the menu doesn't appear on the top pannel but until the title bar).  How to install InkScape without XQuartz?  <answer237955> Not officially possible, yet&mdash;the Inkscape developers will have to remove the XQuartz dependency by switching to the native Gtk and Glib libraries for OS X, just like the GIMP team did a few years ago.   This work has been in progress for a couple of years on a separate Inkscape branch, but there is no official release yet. However, you can download the latest DMG here (currently based on Inkscape 0.91), at your own risk&mdash;expect bugs and crashes.  <comment291711> Hmm, I tried that build and it doesn't work at all. But yeah, I understand the issue. Thanks! <comment291786> I tried it too, and it worked okay (MBP, 10.10.5)... took a very long time to load the first time, though.
