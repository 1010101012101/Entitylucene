Could my stolen Mac have been erased before I activated Find My Mac? <body> My Mac was stolen on a train and I only noticed it shortly before arriving the final destination. The thief most likely left the train at one of the earlier stops.  I activated the Find My Mac feature when I finally got home after I went to the lost and found office at the train station. I also remotely locked my Mac and activated the Play Sound feature.  Since then, I keep getting the same message, that "the computer is not online". I am wondering if whoever took it was able to open it and erase the contents and operating system on it before I was able to activate the security features.  Would that disable the Find My Mac feature, or would it still be able to locate my computer? (It's a MacBook Pro.)  <answer164701> If you don't have configured a password to choose boot options the thief is able to delete all your content, without having your root password. He can simply:  ol liDo not connect your Mac in internet./li liTurn on Mac pressing kbdCmd/kbd+kbdS/kbd to enter in CLI mode./li liChange your admin account password (I have intentionally omitted details on this step)./li liLogout./li liLogin using your account with his password./li liDisable all services related to iCloud, so disable Find My Mac./li /ol  In this case you're unable to locate your Mac.
