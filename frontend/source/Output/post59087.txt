Alternative way to add Apps to LaunchPad <body> I noticed that its possible to add custom apps to the launchpad by dragging apps to the launchpad on the dock. However I removed it from dock, but still want to add an application without dragging it all the way to the dock. Is there a right click option or something similar that allows such feature ?  Platform : rMBP Mountain Lion V 10.8  Any suggestions please ? I Do not want to use 3rd party apps.  --  I have yet to find an alternative method, can someone please help  <answer59093> Take a look at Launchpad Cleaner.  Its a nice app for managing LaunchPad. They have a free and $5.00 version.  <comment78273> Is there a way without using 3rd party apps ?
