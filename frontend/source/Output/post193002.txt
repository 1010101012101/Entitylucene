Yosemite: Backslash key doesn't work <body> My backslash key stopped working after upgrading to yosemite last week. Also, whenever i restart my mac system starts typing backslash on any textbox. It doesn't stop until i hit backspace.  <answer199941> backslash key was permanently pressed. Nothing related to yosemite. Used Karabiner to disable that key.  <comment229928> Try repeatedly button mashing the backslash key <comment229931> Cleaned your keyboard lately??? <comment229932> How does an external keyboard behave? <comment230678> @emilycurious took out the key cleaned it, doesnt' seem a hardware issue. <comment231451> @CousinCocaine yes, external keyboard works.
