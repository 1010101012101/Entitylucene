Is there a keyboard shortcut to move between Google Chrome screens in OS X? <body> kbdcommand/kbd +  kbd`/kbd (left of the kbd1/kbd) works for other apps, but it doesn't work most of the time for Google Chrome.  Anyone knows of another keyboard shortcut?  <comment320507> Do you mean between windows, or between tabs? Command + ` is the correct shortcut for switching windows. I don't have any problems with it. <comment320543> The trackpad? If you full screen and separate each window.
