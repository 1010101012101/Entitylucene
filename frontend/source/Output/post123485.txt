How to use "open in terminal", and "two windows side by side" on mac? <body> I'm a Linux user. I just bought my first Macbook but I still need some features from Linux that I think are also useful. For example:  ol liOpen in terminal (right click and choose menu to open the current folder path in terminal)/li liTwo windows side by side (this feature from Windows.)/li /ol  How can I get these features?  <answer123486> To your question #2:  OS X does not have the Split screen feature.  How ever there are 3d party apps that do just that.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9Pjir.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer123488> For the number one, just put the terminal icon in the doc then drag the desired folder to the icon and it open the path  <answer135690> h1Answer 1: Open in terminal/h1  You can use DTerm which is also work with other app like Sublime...  h1Answer 2: Snap windows/h1  You can use spectacle  Both of them are free.  <answer284490> h2Answer 2:/h2  There is a way to split screen natively:  ol liMaximize App1 window using the green button, it will be moved to a new desktopbr (e.g. desktop #2)/li liSwipe back to desktop #1/li liPress control+up, or Swipe 3-fingers up (shows all windows in desktop)/li liDrag App2 onto App1 in desktop #1/li /ol  <comment144187> Normally we prefer one question per session so to be able to sort, search and find the answers individually, but since you are a newcomer we let it pass this time. <comment144188> or use this http://www.macworld.com/article/1047793/folderinterm.html <comment144190> In addition to this comment, I recommend 'Window Magnet'. It is available in the App Store and sits nicely in your MenuBar. I can also recommend 'Cinch', even though the last time I used it it had far less options than Window Magnet...and was for free. <comment144191> or add the Terminal icon to your Finder toolbar. This way you can drag and drop Folders/Files on there. To do this  Applications - Utilities - Terminal - drag/drop next to the search bar at the top in the current Finder window <comment144193> Your originally second question is already answered [here](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/17293/set-always-on-top-for-a-window?rq=1) which is one reason why it is preferable to stick to the one question per question rule. The other key reason is that having several questions makes it difficult/impossible to "accept" one answer (see the [FAQ] for details on how the site works). <comment144194> Or see [here](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/5857/how-to-make-terminals-open-side-by-side?rq=1) for a lot of other possible solutions. <comment144195> Or see [here](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/11323/how-can-i-open-a-terminal-window-directly-from-my-current-finder-location)
