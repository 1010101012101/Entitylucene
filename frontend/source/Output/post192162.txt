Have I lost my Moviola video? <body> I made a Moviola video on my iPhone, then I imported it to Photos for Mac and removed it from iPhone's camera roll then I reimported it in the iPhone from iTunes.  (Summary: Shot on the iPhone - Imported to Mac - Synced on the iPhone)  Now this video appear in iPhone's moviola folder but it plays as a normal video. Is it normal? Is it a bug or have I to do in a different way?  <comment234092> What is moviola? <comment234182> Are slo-mo videos.
