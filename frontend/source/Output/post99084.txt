How can exclude a whole site from Safari Top sites (and not just an URL)? <body> In this other question, I've asked how to remove a domain from being added to the Safari Top Sites.  Unfortunately it seems that the answer may not be that easy as I though. I've just discovered that the list with the banned domains is on the path code~/Library/Safari/TopSites.plist/code, and I tried to add a domain with a wildcard to the BannedURLStrings, i.e. codehttps://apple.stackexchange.com/*/code, but it doesn't work. Safari removes it as it seems to be invalid. Someone knows if it is possible to add a wildcard, or if they have another syntax, i.e codehttps://apple.stackexchange.com/%/code.
