Copying and pasting between tmux panes containing vim instances over SSH in Terminal.app <body> I use vim to develop Perl code on a remote Linux box running Debian Jesse. The machine is a virtual machine running in VirtualBox. I use ssh and then issue a codevim &lt;file&gt;/code command to start editing the file.  I've been experimenting with tmux on the remote machine to see how I like it. But I cannot for the life of me figure out how to copy and paste text between vim instances in two different tmux panes. I'd prefer to be able to use both the mouse and vim-like keystrokes (codeyy/code, codedd/code codep/code) to do this.  I've tried just about every recommendation out there for trying to get this to work but I haven't gotten anywhere. I'm running El Capitan. Is there a definitive answer out there for getting this to work?  <answer235708> I have run into the same issue and my solution is to use tmux instead of vim in these instances.  1) enter copy mode using Control+b [  2) navigate to beginning of text, you want to select and hit Control+Space 3) move around using arrow keys to select region 4) when you reach end of region simply hit Alt+w to copy the region 5) now Control+b ] will paste the selection  Your key bindings may vary slightly   got this from here: https://awhan.wordpress.com/2010/06/20/copy-paste-in-tmux/  <answer237211> A better way to do it is save the selection in a temporary file and use tmux codeload-buffer/code command to load it into the paste buffer, and then codeC-b ]/code to paste.  Otherwise you may have problems with long text lines that don't fit into the screen. Also, tabs might not be preserved and long lines may be broken down.  I have to mention another (easier) way to do it without any additional files.  There's a mod for tmux adding more flexible scripting capabilities: http://ershov.github.io/tmux/ (I'm the author)  It allows you to copy and paste without using any temporary files:  ol liCopy selection in vim/li liIn vim, type code:!tmux tcl pbcopy "^R%"/code this will put the vim's paste buffer into tmux's one/li liIn tmux, in another pane use code^B ]/code to paste./li /ol  You probably want to use code:set paste/code in vim.  And if you do it frequently, you can automate the step 2 and bind it to a keypress in vim.
