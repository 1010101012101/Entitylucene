Delete an album imported from a computer <body> In my iPhone 5 there is a photo album that I had transferred from my computer; now I want to completely delete this album, including photos. I read that, without using iTunes, just go to "Printers and Devices", choose the iPhone and open the album folder, but this method didn't work. Is there a way to eliminate it, maybe from iTunes?
