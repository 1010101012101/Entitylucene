Using iMac 21.5 mid 2010 as an external monitor of Macbook Pro Retina late 2013 15"? <body> Can I connect iMac 21.5 mid 2010 as an external monitor of Macbook Pro Retina late 2013 15"? How can I connect them?  I read some articles that say it can be done with Mini DisplayPort-to-Mini DisplayPort like http://www.macobserver.com/tmo/article/connect-a-macbook-to-an-imacs-display-with-target-display-mode but I’m not sure if the author is referring to the 27 iMac only or emall/em iMacs mid 2010.  Has anybody had some experience in connecting these?  Here’s my iMac details:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Vb1o5.png" alt="General" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MAPiQ.png" alt="Memory &amp; Graphics" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/JEU3z.png" alt="Connections"  <answer177134> I've tried this and yes it does/can work, depending on your setup. So far I've managed to hook a 2012 MBP 13" to a 2012 21" iMac via Thunderbolt, and the strongcmd + F2/strong function works once logged in.  However, I've not managed to connect to a 2011 iMac (non-Thunderbolt model) using the same MacBook and Thunderbolt cable - I don't have a DisplayPort cable to hand to see if that works or not so right now I can't verify if yours will work or not.
