Should I use Automator or another program for repetitious tasks? <body> I have 100s of images to save out in a different format for a project that I am working on. And the problem is I have to do them one at a time, so I am wondering if there is some way to record the actions of me saving one of them out and then having the program repeat it by looking in a specific directory and doing it with all of the images. I am not sure how else to explain what I am trying to do, but I just need some way to make the program that I am using automate the saving task for each image. P.S I don't know if it helps but the program that I am using is called (Texture Packer)  <answer89662> It looks like the TexturePacker program includes the ability to process images from the command-line, which you could then batch process with a script. You'll first want to install the utility by clicking strongInstall Command Line Tool/strong under the strongTexturePacker/strong menu in the app.  Then I'd suggest having a look at the documentation, which includes the command-line parameters for most of the options in the app. Have a look at that, and see if you can get  the actions you need on the command-line. If you need help turning those into a batch processing script, I'd suggest coming back and amending your question with the specifics.  <comment105319> The answer is clearly yes. Use automation! <comment105320> How can I use automator with a program like texture packer? From what I can see automator only uses apps that come with OS X. <comment105321> I recommend Photoshop if you have it. Just record the actions, and then batch them all. <comment105323> @bassplayer7 I would use photoshop but the format that I need to save them in is (.pvr) format and texture packer is the only one that does that. <comment105325> Aah - so the problem is you aren't sure what tools can automate a program that doesn't include a dictionary of actions that feeds directly into Automator... <comment105340> @bmike that is precisely what I need. <comment105351> I installed the command line tool and found on the texturePacker blog that this is how you batch convert images. `find directoryname -name \*.png | sed 's/\.png//g' | \     xargs -I % -n 1 TexturePacker %.png \         --sheet %.pvr.ccz \         --data dummy.plist \         --algorithm Basic \         --allow-free-size \         --no-trim \         --opt RGBA4444 \         --dither-fs `But I keep getting this output in the terminal. (find: *.png: No such file or directory) <comment105356> @Stephen I answered this in the other question you posted.
