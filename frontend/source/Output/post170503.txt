If the Automatic login function is disabled then according to this emThe WP Guru/em post there are two things to check:  ul liFileVault is not enabled. If it is, you cannot use Automatic login. Check in strongSystem Preferences  Security &amp; Privacy  FileVault/strong/li liYou are not using your iCloud password for your Mac account. If you are, change it to a separate password and you should be able to use Automatic login./li /ul  <answer205809> Thank you....."You can enable Automatic Login in System Preferences  Users &amp; Groups  Login Options  Automatic login."  A bit more, you need to open the lock and click on your User name. It will request a password. Type in and re-lock  <answer213660> If you don't want a password, when it goes your main account, put in your password and when it asks you to put in a new password leave it blank. It'll say, "You have not put in a password for this account". Click on "okay".  <answer230289> Ever since I updated to El Capitan, I can't log in automatically into my user account (without giving password, I mean). Everyone says to uncheck the automatic login button in the codeApple -&gt; System Preferences -&gt; Users &amp; Group -&gt; Option/code section. But the automatic login button is shaded grey, so I can't uncheck it, (yes even after I unlock the padlock).   Here is how to enable that checkbox.  ol liIn the codeApple Menu -&gt; System Preferences -&gt; Users &amp; Group/code section, the account I wish to automatically log in must be admin. Once on my user I clicked to change my password. It asked if I want to change my iCloud password or change my local password. Change your iCloud password. /li licodeApple Menu -&gt; System Preferences -&gt; Security -&gt; FireVault/code, make sure  FireVault is disabled (if it isn't, then do so and it'll take several hours)./li licodeAfter FireVault is disabled, goto Apple Menu -&gt; System Preferences -&gt; Security -&gt; General/code section, unlock the bottom padlock, and you should now have a "deactivate automatic login" that appeared. Uncheck this as it prevents you from doing so./li licodeApple Menu -&gt; System Preferences -&gt; Users &amp; Group -&gt; Options/code, the automatic login button should now have your user instead of the "deactivated/disabled"./li /ol  <comment219662> Hello !
