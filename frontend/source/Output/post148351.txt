What is the __CHECKFIX1436934 environment variable? <body> On OS X 10.9.5 my bash shell has the following environment variable set:   __CHECKFIX1436934=1  What is the purpose of this value? I am surprised there is no record of anybody asking this before.  <answer149146> It comes from launch services, specifically this binary  precode/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Versions/A/LaunchServices /code/pre  and that environment variable seems to be inherited by many processes, as you can see with codeps -Efax/code  1436934 looks like the number of digits in recent Apple "radar" bug numbers, so perhaps it refers to some value used internally for testing.  <comment174768> See https://discussions.apple.com/thread/5559451, no answer there either. Interesting... <comment175314> I have `__CHECKFIX1436934=1` in my ENV too. I note that the few search results that I find for this include it as part of  programmers asking for help and listing their ENV related  to the Go language, Python, SublimeText or Brew. I have all of these installed.
