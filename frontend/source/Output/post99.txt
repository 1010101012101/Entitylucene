Dot-files and other meta data on non-Mac network shares <body> Is there a way to tell Finder to not use (or worry about) the ._* files and other meta-data files it normally tries to use when it's on a network share?  Currently when I'm in Finder and I try to copy a file to a network share it results in an error:     The Finder can’t complete the   operation because some data in “file_name” can’t be read or written.   (Error code -36)   But I can copy the file from the terminal command line to the network share and use it from Finder afterward just fine.  It seems that the meta-data isn't really needed on the network share.  Is there a way to tell Finder this?  For reference, I'm using Snow Leopard and the share is a Samba share on a Linux server.  <answer102> precodedefaults write com.apple.desktopservices DSDontWriteNetworkStores true /code/pre  Will get rid of the DS files. Anything else you might have to do by hand.  <answer103> Is the file you're trying to copy using a resource fork?  If you're dealing with code.DS_Store/code file issues run the following command in Terminal:  precodedefaults write com.apple.desktopservices DSDontWriteNetworkStores true /code/pre  If you're having issues with resource forks on Snow Leopard you may need to change your settings for the streams setting in codesmb.conf/code on the Linux machine or codensmb.conf/code on your local Mac. (code._FILENAME/code files are the resource forks of the file). Check out Super User for more details on this.  <answer57836> Adapted from https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/57832/8546  hr  h1Finder/h1  Finder does much to ensure integrity of data, and to make its results compatible with a broad range of Apple operating systems. For some types of copy/move routines, code._/code (dot underscore) files are strongrequired/strong.   h1File system/h1  If creation of code._/code files is prevented at the file system level, then that file system is partially incompatible with at least:   ul liApple Finder/li liMicrosoft Office Excel, PowerPoint and Word 2011./li /ul  (For any use case that involves Office 2011 saving to a file system, you must allow code._/code on that file system … and so on.)  h1Error code -36/h1  -36 (ioErr) (I/O error) is a file system error, it indicates that data cannot be sent or received by the operating system. Historically, errors of this type were bummers.   Without knowing the detail of your Samba configuration:   ul liI guess that in your case, error -36 is the result of a file system restriction. /li /ul  hr  For more detail please see my answer to an older question, Why are dot underscore ._ files created, and how can I avoid them?:   ul liPurposes of .DS_Store and ._ files/li /ul  <answer79506> This is not working for me anymore. So i have added ._* to the strongveto files/strong I think it's works but i don't know if it has other complications?  strongvi /etc/samba/smb.conf/strong  strong[global] veto files = /._*/.AppleDB/.AppleDouble/.AppleDesktop/:2eDS_Store/Network Trash Folder/Temporary Items/TheVolumeSettingsFolder/.@_emthumb/.@/em_desc/:2e*//strong  strong(esc-shift-ZZ) service smb restart service nmb restart/strong  <comment45> @Josh K: It didn't even notify me that you had answered. <comment73> Didn't do the trick.  I had high hopes for that Super User suggestion as well, but it didn't work either :(  It's definitely the resource forks, and I've tried creating that local nsmb.conf file (even rebooted just to make sure) but the error persists.  It still creates the ._ file on the server and throws the same error, leaving a data file of zero bytes. <comment78> @David: Any chance of knowing if it works with Leopard? You can also try using veto_files on the server which is sometimes the cure and other times the cause of issues with Finder.

I've tried veto files, tried stuff here: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4017  No dice yet.  There are multiple causes for this generic Finder I/O error, but so far I haven't found a solution for mine. <comment58490> Similar: [Why are dot underscore ._ files created, and how can I avoid them?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/14980/8546) (2011), I answered the more recent question. <comment91775> You can also run this in the cronbr find . -type f -name "._*" -exec rm -rvf {} +;
