Export frame to Pictures...where? <body> In Photos app, while playing a movie, if you select the gear in player controller appear a menu list.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/A5F7j.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Selecting "Export frame to Pictures" (or something like that) Photos should save the frame... but I can't understand where!  It's not in pictures folder and not in Photo's moments so...where is it saved?  <answer225254> You can find the frame in your emPicture/em folder under the name Frame_something.tiff. Then you can import that frame in the Photos app like a normal picture.  <answer295123> The TIFF for the frame you exported will be within /Users/[Your Username]/Pictures.
