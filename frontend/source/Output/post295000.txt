Installing macOS Sierra on iMac 2008 new hard drive <body> I've just installed a new hard drive in my 2008 iMac. As my old one died I put a copy of macOS Sierra on a USB stick, but when I try to boot from it all I get is the no entry sign.  Any ideas what Iâ€™m doing wrong? Do I possibly need an older version macOS?  <answer295001> You need at least a 2009 iMac to run macOS 10.12 Sierra.  The latest version of macOS that supports the 2008 iMac is macOS 10.11 El Capitan.  <comment372440> Cheers all working fine now  <comment372441> Glad this got fixed for you.
