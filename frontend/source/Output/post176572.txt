The above doesn't work at all and the message is: -bash: ?: command not found <comment208780> @DarrenStevens You don't run this as a command. Put it into /etc/asl.conf and then run (in the terminal, not the file) kill -hup syslog. <comment208866> Note that this will be deleted after any update, since asl.conf is majorly used, and updates may break it. <comment209142> @awesomebing1 that's mentioned in the link I gave. There was a comment about using asl modules but apparently this did not work. <comment269353> Doesn't the `SUDO_EDITOR` variable get set in the user shell and then ignored when sudo runs? I have to `sudo nano /etc/asl.conf` to avoid `vi` on my Macs.... Great answer +1
