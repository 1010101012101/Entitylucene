Morphox plugins show all waves <body> I'm in trouble with my Linplug - Morphox plugin; I mean, yesterday I installed the codemorphox.component/code into the right folder codeMacintosh-Library-Audio-plug ins- component/code.  When I open Logic Pro 9 (32-bit) and I choose the new AU, I put the correct serial number and everything works perfectly.  Today when I open Logic Pro 9 again, and I choose the AU morphox, any kind of wave, in the waves window, is shown, so no sound for me, but yesterday everything was working fine, and I saw the waves in the "OSC1" and "OSC2" windows.  I've attached a pic of morphox so that you can see what I mean at the left top of the pic, two windows without any wave.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jjBN8.png" alt="Screenshot"  I tried to uninstall it, but if I remove the component and the I paste the component again, I have the same problem; I would try to delete the validation key as well, so that when I restart it, I type the validation key again and maybe it would work, but how can I completely delete all files of the component?  Any idea how to fix this?  <answer178254> As far as I'm aware, Logic Pro X doesn't use 32-bit plugins, only 64-bit.br I'm not sure about Logic Po 9, but I thought that was 64-bit too.br https://splice.com/blog/using-logic-pro-x-with-32-bit-plugins/  Personally, I don't use Logic, I'm Cubase - but the latest Morphox is working fine in both 32 &amp; 64-bit mode.  Install for both is pretty much drag &amp; drop to the correct folders, prefs/sounds in code/Library/Application Support/LinPlug//code plugs in code/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/code, so I'm not sure reinstalling would help. I'd check with LinPlug that you have the latest version.  As of writing, that's v1.1.1 - http://www.linplug.com/morphox.html  <comment211015> How is this a Apple products problem? <comment211030> @Buscarì›ƒ Apple software running on OS X is definitively on topic here :-)
