Launchd - Run as if you're logged in as a user using sudo <body> Is there a way to do this?  Basically I'm trying to run a script that needs to launch a program.  Putting the script in code/Library/LaunchDaemons/code works fine, but everything gets run as if its the root user. This doesn't work because it needs to run as if its a real user, but using the codesudo/code command.  So I moved the script to code~/Library/LaunchDaemons/code but now it won't launch the program, presumably because its getting run as the user and not with codesudo/code permissions.  So I'm stuck. Logging in as the user and going to a terminal and running:  precodesudo my_command_which_launches_a_program /code/pre  Works absolutely fine, and exactly how its meant to work. So I want to basically emulate that, but in a Launchd script, if possible.  Thanks  <answer93174> You put the plist into /Library/LaunchDaemons but edit it to say which user the script will run as  The key you need to add is UserName. For example I run a newserver as user _news  precode&lt;key&gt;UserName&lt;/key&gt; &lt;string&gt;_news&lt;/string&gt; /code/pre  Documented in Apple's launchd man page  <answer288302>    it needs to run as if its a real user, but using the sudo command   I think this belies a false assumption you are making. When a user runs codesudo foobar/code, then the codefoobar/code command is run by the coderoot/code user.  The only things that can be different when running codefoobar/code as root (instead of the user running codesudo foobar/code) are the shell and environment variables available such as code$HOME/code or code$PATH/code.  If your application requires a specific shell or environment variable, emjust ensure that that shell or environment variable is set by the LaunchDaemon you are creating/em. That will save you a lot of heartache over trying to get codelaunchd/code to replicate the exact experience of a specific user running codesudo foobar/code.  strongTo those downvoting/strong, this information is backed up multiple times on StackExchange here, here, and here for starters.  <comment109306> Do you mean you put the script in the directories mentioned or the launchd plist? <comment109307> Ah sorry, I'm talking about a plist which runs the script. <comment219108> Unlike LaunchAgents, LaunchDeamon cannot use `UserName`. They run without loggin in a user. <comment219175> @Julian where is this documented - and I think this used to work so what OS X chnage this
