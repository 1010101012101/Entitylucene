Buying an used iPhone 5 - how do you make sure it is in top notch condition? <body> Is there a battery of tests I can make, in order to evaluate battery life, if calculations per second are all normal, signal reception... etc.?  Basically, just to test the condition of the phone.  <comment95708> Surely an iPhone 5 would still be under warranty. I would make sure that I get the paperwork to ensure that I can follow up on a warranty claim if there are any issues. I have not seen any apps that give you access to the data that you are asking for and I don't believe that Apple would allow them in the App Store. I think they would only be available via Jailbreak. <comment95723> The thing is, how do I know if there is a problem? I don't know if the battery time I'll get is normal. I don't know if the CPU speed is good. I'd like to get these numbers in order to compare them with the "industry's average". But, if there isn't a way (without jailbreak) that might be the answer to this question. <comment95748> Lets see if anyone comes up with something, that is why I made it a comment. With regards to CPU, you could run some checks like geekbench and sunspider and compare them to benchmark sites but there is quite a variation especially due to OS versions.
