What does this technical specification about GSM iPhone mean? <body> This is the text from Wiki on "iPhone 4" http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone_4     Connectivity:      GSM model:  quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE(800, 850, 900, 1,800, 1,900 MHz)      Quad-band UMTS/HSDPA/HSUPA (800, 850, 900, 1,900, 2,100 MHz) (800 MHz   is not yet officially supported by Apple)   very confused, if Apple does not support 800MHz then why they put the 800 in the specification?  Can someone explain what that technical specification means?  <answer131999> If you keep reading...  Connectivity     In contrast to Steve Jobs' announcement at WWDC 2010, recent Federal   Communications Commission documentation has shown that the iPhone 4   contains a strongpenta-band/strong 3G UMTS antenna, not a quad-band 3G UMTS radio,   as advertised by Apple.       According to the FCC documentation filed by   Apple, the radio inside the iPhone 4 strongsupports 800/strong, 850, 900, 1,900,   and 2,100 MHz. The 800 MHz frequency, which is most commonly used in   Japanese mobile phones, is not advertised as being supported by   Apple.[51] However, the 800 MHz band is a subset of the 850 MHz band,   which probably explains why the device is advertised as   quad-band.[citation needed] The chip-sets were manufactured by   Skyworks Solutions[52] and Infineon for GSM version.   <comment155095> Where are you getting that Apple doesn't support 800MHz. You give sources against your point but not to support it.
