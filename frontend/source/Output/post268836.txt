Unable to open iMovie <body> I'm trying to open the iMovie app on my Macbook, but it has an X on the icon and when I click on it, it tells me I to upgrade the app in order to get into it. In the Mac App Store, I checked for new updates, and indeed there is a new update for iMovie (along with iPhoto and Keynote updates). To do the updates, I pressed codeupdate all/code, but only the iPhoto and Keynote updates actually happened (the iMovie update is stuck loading) My computer freezes and fails to update iMovie.   strongHow can I get iMovie to open?/strong   emEdit:/em The update is to iMovie 10.1.4  <comment337610> What type and OS is your Mac?
