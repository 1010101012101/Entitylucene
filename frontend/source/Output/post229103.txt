How can I troubleshoot or reset a Thunderbolt Ethernet adapter? <body> It appears my Thunderbolt Ethernet connector has stopped connecting to my router for good today. Over the last few days I had already seen my ethernet connection "crash" multiple times. My machine would simply drop from the network and not be able to get back on without a restart. I assumed there was some odd bug somewhere, maybe triggered by certain network activity,  but since I could solve it with a restart, it didn't make me concerned.  Now, when opening the codeSystem Preferences/code under codeNetwork/code I only see the codeStatus: Not Connected/code message` for the Thunderbolt Ethernet adapter. I am using a MacBook Pro Retina (Early 2013) and an AirPort Time Capsule (in the more recent 802.11ac tower version). I have tried various solutions that one can find online, but none of those worked.  ol liI am sure the Thunderbolt Ethernet adapter and network cables are working fine - when using a MacBook Air everything connects just fine. I also happen to have a second Thunderbolt Ethernet adapter and it displays the exact same issues./li liI am more or less convinced that the Thunderbolt Port on the MBP is also working - when checking in codeSystem Report &gt; Thunderbolt/code I can at least see the codeThunderbolt Bus/code and a codeThunderbolt to Gigabit Ethernet Adapter/code, which is listed as codeDevice Connected/code. I can't be 100% sure of this though, but it appears to recognise me attaching that adapter./li liIt doesn't matter which one of the two Thunderbolt ports I use, neither of them work./li /ol  strongIs there any good way to try and troubleshoot the Thunderbolt connectivity? Are there any specific settings that I should try to reset?/strong  I had found a suggestion to reset the network settings by strong[A]/strong deleting this file: code/Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/NetworkInterfaces.plist/code, but unfortunately, that didn't work and appeared to have no effect at all. strong[B]/strong I have also added a new location and removed old ones from the Networks Preferences Pane inside the System Settings, but nothing changed.  For some reason the TB Ethernet adapter is not being found or recognised inside the System Preferences and no connection is therefore established. Any idea how this could be fixed?   I am now also checking the console output for network related messages and found a few, but don't know what they mean or if they are even remotely relevant:  precode28/02/2016 11:17:21.128 AM networkd[223]: -[NETPowerManager setupPowerPolicyTable] created power policy table from defaults with 5 timeslots 28/02/2016 11:17:21.131 AM networkd[223]: -[NETInterfaceManager updateInterfaces] nwi_state_copy() returned NULL 28/02/2016 11:17:21.134 AM networkd[223]: nw_nat64_post_new_ifstate successfully changed NAT64 ifstate from 0x0 to 0x8000000000000000 28/02/2016 11:17:21.140 AM networkd[223]: __settings_changed_block_invoke networkd_privileged_copy_settings_async with NULL settings 28/02/2016 11:17:21.141 AM networkd[223]: __settings_changed_block_invoke networkd_privileged_copy_settings_async with NULL settings 28/02/2016 11:17:21.941 AM com.apple.kextd[55]: Failed to load /System/Library/Extensions/IONetworkingFamily.kext/Contents/PlugIns/AppleBCM5701Ethernet.kext - (libkern/common) general/unspecified error. 28/02/2016 11:17:22.088 AM networkd[223]: -[NETInterfaceManager updateInterfaces] nwi_state_copy() returned NULL 28/02/2016 11:17:22.731 AM networkd[223]: -[NETInterfaceManager updateInterfaces] nwi_state_copy() returned NULL 28/02/2016 11:17:24.684 AM networkd[223]: -[NETInterfaceManager updateInterfaces] nwi_state_copy() returned NULL 28/02/2016 11:17:25.680 AM UserEventAgent[287]: user agent networkd: built Nov 16 2015 23:08:50 28/02/2016 11:17:26.286 AM symptomsd[263]: __73-[NetworkAnalyticsEngine observeValueForKeyPath:ofObject:change:context:]_block_invoke unexpected switch value 2 28/02/2016 11:17:26.286 AM symptomsd[263]: __73-[NetworkAnalyticsEngine observeValueForKeyPath:ofObject:change:context:]_block_invoke unexpected switch value 2  28/02/2016 3:08:58.796 PM com.apple.preference.network.remoteservice[548]: CGContextGetDefaultUserSpaceToDeviceSpaceTransform: invalid context 0x0.

The Question of course is why it isn't loading. The Error Message "general/unspecified error" is not very helpful in this instance.  I would do the following:  ol liCheck at the location if the file is present (and has not a 0 size). It probably is, else the error would be 'file not found' or something similar/li licheck permission, best with Apples Disk Repair Utility (found in '/Application/Utilities')/li litry to restore the file from a Time Machine Backup/li /ol  Try these suggestions first and post your results please.  <answer229189> The solution is to try and reset as many network related system preferences as possible. To be more specific:  ol listrongUnplug/strong the Thunderbolt Ethernet adapter./li liCreate and Apply a new default network stronglocation/strong (system preferences)./li liRemove all older pre-existing network locations./li liRemove the following strongpreference/strong files (global and user specific found in code/Library/Preferences/code code/Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/code and code~/Library/Preferences/code):/li /ol  codecom.apple.network*.plist/code codeNetworkInterfaces.plist/code  ol start="5" liRestart your Mac./li liAdd a new strongLocation/strong inside the network system preferences (AGAIN!) and remove the one added previously in step (2)./li listrongConnect/strong your Thunderbolt Ethernet adapter as well as the network cable./li liWait a few minutes (close the system preferences)./li /ol  Step (6) and (7) may be the other way around. Here is what I observed while trying to solve my issue:  I always used to have two Thunderbolt related entries in my network settings:  ol liThunderbolt Ethernet/li liThunderbolt Bridge/li /ol  I believe the bridge may be added by default and the ethernet version may be added on demand, when you plug in an ethernet adapter.  While my connection was "broken", however, this codeThunderbolt Ethernet/code service / interface never appeared or worked again, so possibly some of the settings files related to it were broken.  After removing all old references (from the old locations) to it as well as the listed preference files, I now get the following three default services listed, when adding a new location into the network preferences:  ol liThunderbolt Ethernet/li liWi-Fi/li liThunderbolt Bridge/li /ol  If you don't get these three and you are using a Thunderbolt Ethernet adapter, you may have the same problem as I had and should follow the advice above.  <comment279422> 2 - admittely very - long shots: 1) perhaps the Airport is the culprit?  I'd try a reset or even complete re-config.  2) did you alter/cloned any MAC address in your network setup? <comment279424> I admit I haven't really thought about the Airport as a problem, since everything appears to be working normally on all our other devices. I do have a MAC binding in DHCP settings for the MBP (which is specific to this Thunderbolt adapter), but I sort-of ruled that out as a problem, since I got the correct IP on the MBA when testing the ethernet adapter with it and also all other bindings seem to work. I didn't alter any MAC addresses. <comment279425> Again a long shot, but if Apple releases a patch, with a bit of luck your issue might be addressed also: http://forums.macrumors.com/threads/security-update-breaks-ethernet-port-on-imacs-and-macbook-pros-updated.1958609/ <comment279429> Thanks - from just Iooking at that kext - everything appears to be alright, but no idea if any files are damaged. I already ran "First Aid" from the Disk Utility, but didn't get anything, except for a thumbs up. The latest Disk Utility also doesn't let you "Verify / Repair" separately anymore :( It's also my primary disk, and I'll try the restore assuming the `/System` folder is part of the TimeMachine backup. <comment279523> I extracted older variants of  `IONetworkingFamily.kext` for comparison and restore, but it didn't fix my issue. The network kernel extension is listed as loaded (`System Report  Software  Extensions`) and appears to be working fine. I also didn't see that error message again - so it might indicate when my problem started, but seemed like a one off error. I did see the following output whenever I remove the ethernet adapter, though: `28/02/2016 6:36:53.956 PM symptomsd[259]: nw_interface_get_agents SIOCGIFAGENTIDS failed for interface "en3" (index 7, type other): [6] Device not configured` <comment279548> also interesting to look at - apparently Apple messed up the Ethernet port in a recent upgrade, might be totally unrelated to my problem, though (since I don't actually have an Ethernet port) https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT6672 <comment279557> that's the same bug I pointed out in the Macrumors forum link above.  Yours is directly at Apple Support though. <comment316811> In my case I have 2 thunderbolt ports but the other one is not detected. So I followed your instruction and removed the old reference from the Network Settings and recreated it and works like a charm!
