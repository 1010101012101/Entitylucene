When i try to install my certificate in keychain, the error says: Unable to import - Error Code 25294 <body> I am using the 10.9.5 version and ios 8. When i try to install my certificate i got through my developer account for push notification for my app in the keychain local items, its not importing. The error says: Unable to import the certificate and the error code is 25294  <answer162346> Try adding the certificate to the "login" keychain.  <answer180622> I'm really not sure about what you're question is asking, but I stumbled here while trying to solve the same error. The situation I had on my machine was I had a bunch of similarly named keychains in keychain access and the application would default to adding the .pem to a nonexistent keychain.  So I solved this by selecting the missing keychains one by one and deleting them all except my real System keychain, iCloud, and login. You might not have iCloud depending on your setup, version, and location.  <answer180644> The error code means "No such keychain":  precodeerrSecNoSuchKeychain         = -25294, /code/pre  I'm not really sure on how to proceed, but maybe this information points points you in the right direction.  <comment356671> Please do not delete this answer, as it answers the question and I could not find this solution elsewhere
