How to fix Terminal error DYLD_ environment variables being ignored because main executable (/usr/bin/login) is setuid or setgid? <body> Any time I open a new terminal window (independent of terminal app), the console stderr displays codedyld: DYLD_ environment variables being ignored because main executable (/usr/bin/login) is setuid or setgid/code before the first bash prompt.  The start of this error coincided with my install of 10.8.  How can I get rid of that message?  Below is my .bash_profile:  precodeexport PS1="\u@MBP:\W -&gt;"  ## # Your previous /Users/segiddins/.bash_profile file was backed up as /Users/segiddins/.bash_profile.macports-saved_2012-04-19_at_21:00:04 ##  # MacPorts Installer addition on 2012-04-19_at_21:00:04: adding an appropriate PATH variable for use with MacPorts. export PATH=/opt/local/bin:/opt/local/sbin:$PATH # Finished adapting your PATH environment variable for use with MacPorts. /code/pre  <answer58548> It seems that the problem might be with asepsis (If you have it installed).ã€€http://asepsis.binaryage.com/  Re-install it to make sure that it's up-to-date.

I had this error too while running Mountain Lion and after updating my system to Mavericks, it dissappeared.  <comment66976> In your home folder `~/` there should be a file called `.bash_profile`. Could you [paste it somewhere](http://paste.debian.net/) and show us? <comment67426> Just tried it and it worked for me too. <comment67482> I tried before tonight, then did again and saw why I didnt uninstall it-- asepsisctl uninstall doesn't exist. <comment67490> Thanks, re-install than asepsisctl uninstall did the trick! <comment73744> I don't have asepsis.
