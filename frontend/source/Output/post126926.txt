Copy and Paste Multiple Things? OSX <body> I would like to be able to copy and paste multiple items on a Mac using keys like ⌘1 would copy 1 and ⌘2 would copy 2, ect. Then ⌘! would paste 1 and ⌘@ would paste 2. If there is already a program for this please let me know or if you can make me one. Also I need it to be a free program. Thanks in advance.  <answer126936> Slightly different implementation, but will do what you want:  LaunchBar keeps a history of your clipboard, so you can copy multiple things using the usual keyboard combo kbd⌘/kbd - kbdC/kbd and then paste them using (for me, I may have changed from the default):  ul lihold down kbd⌘/kbd ul litap kbd\/kbd to view clipboard history/li litap kbd&#x2193;/kbd until desired clipping is selected/li /ul/li lirelease kbd⌘/kbd/li /ul  I've found it to be a pretty useful workflow. I do have to flush the clipboard history after dealing with passwords though. I keep it set at 10 items to limit my exposure if I forget.  Launchbar is free to try and $35 to buy.   subI'm not sure how they limit the free version now, but back before I bought it they let you do five types of activities per login, so you could do the copy, paste, and clipboard history deletion freely without running into the limit/sub  I do not use it because I've found Launchbar to be more useful, but it looks like Alfred includes clipboard history in the unlimited free version.  Based on the screenshot it looks like Alfred uses shortcuts closer to what you wanted.   <answer126947> From what I remember CopyPastePro is pretty close to what you want. I haven't used it much since OS X was released, they were very slow with their OS X rewrite. I currently use Alfred for my clipboard needs, but that implementation isn't as close to what you describe as CopyPastePro is.  I used PTHPasteboard Pro for several years. It is probably the most powerful pasteboard utility that I used. IIRC it is probably the closest to what you describe and with some setup can be configured to work exactly as you describe.  None of these are free, but they are all reasonably priced.  <answer174122> I use clipmenu, it's been great, lots of customizable shortcuts -   http://www.clipmenu.com/  Here's what I like about it:  ol liEasy keyboard combo, hit Cmd+Shift+V (or customize it) and it brings up a small sensible fully keyboard navigable menu where you can select from your recent clipboard entries. /li liYou can also optionally add saved snippets of text, I put my stupid auto generated Oracle password in there, win!/li liAnd other than that, it's stable and stays out of the way, you can configure it to start automatically on startup, so you never are without it, it's a life saver/li /ol  <answer275299> I really like Flycut. Available here: https://github.com/TermiT/Flycut  Like all of the other answers here, it's a clipboard manager which stores every item you copy using ⌘+c in a list. Then you can press ⌘+shift+v to see a list of the items you have copied and choose one to paste.   Unlike the other answers here, it's free, open source, and doesn't come with a load of other functionality. Also it is actively maintained unlike clipmenu (last release ClipMenu 1.0.0a1 released  Nov 11, 2014).  <comment148676> I am confused :) copy from where ? I used the cmd+c for copy selected and cmd+v for paste. <comment148701> Big fan of Launchbar - and this is one of the main reasons why. <comment346308> I don't understand the flagging policy here. A historic answer which a few people have found helpful has just been flagged up here 2 years later with a standard message, threatening to remove it, by an anonymous mod. @patrix just wondering was this your flag? Could you give a bit more info on what you're expecting here, given that the OP just asked for a list of programs to consider? <comment346319> @robd Link-only answers have a risk of getting deleted because they usually are not very helpful on the long run. For somebody just looking for links, a Google search would result in better/more up to date information so we prefer some details about recommended tools. <comment346438> Whatevs, stack overflow is better than other sites because of the push in this direction- <comment346734> @patrix I guess my experience of this thread is very different to yours. Since this *was* the first answer in Google, I found it very helpful to have a list of options here, and I was glad the posts weren't deleted. In the end the clipboard manager I vaguely remembered wasn't on this list and I had to find it elsewhere, but it was helpful to have this link. The reasoning on why clipmenu is good is helpful for context, but I wouldn't want the 'link only' post to be deleted. <comment346746> @robd Link-only answers is what you get from Google et all, they don't add value to the site. Look at what chrismarx added to the answer, it gives you a much better idea what the tool is about. <comment346802> I agree that the extra reasoning makes the answer better. But it feels a bit strong to say it didn't add value to the site, especially when it was the answer with most upvotes. Out of interest - do you have a feel for how often link-only answers are actually deleted? Is there a way to see them as a low rep user?
