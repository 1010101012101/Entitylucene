Mavericks Dock icons have become corrupted. Is there a cache to flush or a database to rebuild? <body> I'm running OS X Mavericks 10.9.1. Some of my Dock icons for running applications, including the Finder icon, now appear blank and empty, or as a square filled with random noise pixels.  I have tried "Verify Disk" in Recovery mode, and it detects no errors. I have Repaired Permissions and rebooted.  Is there some cache to flush or database to rebuild that could fix this seemingly harmless but annoying anomaly?  <answer120979> I used a utility (CleanMyMac 2) to flush all the User and System cache files, and when I rebooted, the problem seems to have been solved.  So I don't know which specific cache needed flushing, but everything looks good now.  And yes, I could have done this with Terminal commands, but I prefer to use something with a GUI.  <answer120981> Wheat,  If it was my Mac I'd start by clearing all the caches with AppleJack. This is a great utility for this sort of task.  <answer286549> In case you don't want to use some "cache cleaner app" then just try doing it manually from the terminal with these three commands followed by a reboot:  codesudo find /private/var/folders/ -name com.apple.dock.iconcache -exec rm {} \;/code  codesudo find /private/var/folders/ -name com.apple.iconservices -exec rm -rf {} \;/code  codesudo rm -rf /Library/Caches/com.apple.iconservices.store/code  h3or/h3  Alternatively a single boot into Safe Mode once could/should clear out some caches.  emWorked For Meâ„¢/em in Sierra (10.12)
