2015 Macbook Pro El Capitan - wifi drops when CPU active <body> When the CPU/GPU of my early 2015 13" Retina MBP running El Capitan 10.11.6 is under strain, the wifi drops.  I first noticed this whilst playing the web browser game diep.io in Chrome. When the game is running fairly CPU-intensively the wifi menu bar symbol turns to 'off' for a few seconds and then reconnects, hence booting me from the game. This happens intermittently - perhaps every 15 minutes. I thought it was related to the fan activating but I've observed it without fan too.  I've tested on 2 different wifi routers, both 2.4ghz, and with/without power cable - same results.  This is the only situation I've noticed the wifi dropping in - it doesn't drop randomly or suffer any other connectivity issues AFAIK.  Are there further tests I can run or solutions to try?  strongUpdate/strong: some more tests  ul liChrome with hardware acceleration off: no wifi drops, but game doesn't run hot enough to activate the fan/li liSafari:  Game doesn't work  /li liFirefox with hardware acceleration: same as Chrome (no drops but no fan)/li /ul  I'm thinking this may be simply a Chrome bug with hardware acceleration, but I'm worried the MBP hardware could be defective. Would testing with a non-browser-based CPU-intensive networked game or app be a good way to prove this?  <answer279010> In addition to the tests you've already run, and since your mainly concerned about your MBP's hardware, I'd also run Apple Diagnostics.  strongRun Apple Diagnostics/strong  Follow the steps below to run Apple Diagnostics:  ol liFully shut down your Mac/li liRestart your Mac/li liImmediately press the kbdD/kbd key and strongkeep it down/strong until you see the Diagnostics screen appear/li liWait for Diagnostics to finish (this typically only takes a few minutes)/li liOnce complete, one of two things will appear on the screen:  ul lia emNo issues found/em message/li lia brief description of any errors found plus further instructions/li /ul/li liIf the diagnostics test does find errors, take a note of what they are/li /ol  strongNote:/strong If pressing and holding the kbdD/kbd key at Step 3 doesn't work, start again at Step 1 and, at Step 3 press and hold both the kbdOption/kbdkbdD/kbd keys instead. This will try and run diagnostics from the internet instead, so you will need to allow more time for it to complete.   Regardless, take a note of what happens and let me know how you went.  <comment351146> As a test, do you observe the same behaviour when using a different browser to Google Chrome? As a second test, with Google Chrome, what happens if you go to Chrome  Preferences  Show advanced settings... and scroll to the very bottom and then disable _Use hardware acceleration when available_? <comment351177> thanks @Monomeeth , I updated the question with your suggested tests <comment351222> Thanks again @monomeeth - it came back with no errors (ADP000) so it looks like a Chrome HA issue
