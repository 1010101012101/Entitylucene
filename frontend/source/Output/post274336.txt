Sometimes when I turn on my Mac, the normal click does an auto CMD + click <body> This is the 3rd time it happens, but I don't know why. I turn on my Macbook Pro with Sierra, I open any app and when I click something it acts as if I did codecmd + click/code. However, doing codecmd + click/code doesn't work as a normal click. Any ideas?  <comment344931> Are there any other signs that the Cmd keypress has been somehow activated? For instance, if you press the 'S' key does a Save dialog come up (in an applicable app), or is it always just the mouse that's affected? <comment345521> I believe it's just the mouse, since I am able to write words (meaning I have pressed S at some point, but no save dialog has ever showed).
