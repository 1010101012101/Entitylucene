How can I 'automate' saving email ?as PDF to set folder with file name I choose then email PDF to a set address <body> I have found partial answers that use automator and shortcuts but wondered if anyone out there knows how I might most efficiently achieve this. I need to  ul lisave emails as PDFs to a folder I rarely change (every quarter)/li libe asked for the PDF name/li lihave that PDF automatically emailed to a fixed email address (that won't change)/li /ul  with as little intervention as possible other than the file name..?? Am i asking the impossible? Thanks, Steve  ps I have no experience with automator but willing to learn as needed!
