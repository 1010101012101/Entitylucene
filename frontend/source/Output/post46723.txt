Have battery status only show in menu bar when running on battery power <body> I use my MacBook Pro plugged in to power and an external monitor 90% of the time, and thus the little charged battery indicator in the menubar is useless. However when I'm not on wall power, is there a way to have it show up? When I have that menu item disabled, my MacBook doesn't give me any low battery warnings, and just shuts down (it's happened several times).  <answer46742> I use SlimBatteryMonitor (free, donations accepted, not nagware) instead of the default menu item for the battery status.   SBM can be configured to emalmost/em disappear from the menu bar when fully charged.  If that isn't enough for you, you could run a codelaunchd/code script every few minutes to check the status of the battery, to see whether or not it is fully charged, and act accordingly:  ul liIf the battery is fully charged, quit SlimBatteryMonitor (if it is running)/li liIf the battery is NOT fully charged, run SlimBatteryMonitor (if it isn't already running) /li /ul  I am actually doing something like this already. I just uploaded the necessary files to  https://github.com/tjluoma/slimbatterymonitor  <comment53666> Superb! I think the small blank space in between icons in my menu bar is a small price to pay.
