Apple Music family plan- wife's downloads showing up on my phone <body> I am the primary account holder for my Family's Apple Music family plan. My wife and daughter are the other two users. Every time my wife downloads a song from Apple Music to her phone it shows up on my phone. My daughter's never does. Why does this happen and how do I stop it from happening? My wife's musical preferences are way different than mine and it annoys me to have her music showing up on my phone.  I went into the Apple Store and the tech didn't really fix it, he tried to turn off automatic downloads but it didn't change anything. Any thoughts? Thanks.  <comment358684> Have you double checked to see if your wife is using your Apple ID on her phone, or whether you're using hers on your phone?
