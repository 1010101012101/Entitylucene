Is there a way to throttle nsurlsessiond/cloudd? <body> I have been looking for a way to permanently throttle these two processes.  By default, they are all or nothing processes killing my network connection unless I manually "pause uploads" for iPhotos (nsurlsessiond) or killing/logging out of iCloud for cloudd.  I don't mind them running in the background but would like to control their bandwidth consumption without killing them off completely.  Similar to the way that I can throttle oneDrive upload/download (which to my chagrin, Microsoft does this better than Apple in this case!)  Thanks in advance.
