How does the iMac NVIDIA GeForce GTX 675MX compare to Desktop cards? <body> I'm considering buying a new iMac and am wondering what the GTX675MX will do (have a hard time finding comparisons or tests with that).  I plan to use it for gaming (part with bootcamp/Windows7 if games not available for MacOS)  I think it's a mobile card and with the space restrictions it can't have the same power as (lets say) a PC GTX 670, so next to which PC GTX cards does it fall (I have a GTX 560 in PC for example which now tends to move towards falling down the cliff on the weak side).  <answer92429> It's just theoretical, but according to the PassMark test, the 675MX should be about 30% faster than a desktop 560.  This is on the PC of course and some system specific may flow into the comparison, but at least there is a good chance that performance is at least a bit bettter than your GTX-560.  See GTX 560 vs. GTX 675MX  <answer95007> DO NOT GET the imac 680mx!!!! save and get 675mx same performance but with less cudas 1344 and 1 less gig of vram.
