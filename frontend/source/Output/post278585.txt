4K monitor @ 60hz with late 2016 MBP <body> I have a new late 2016 MBP and a new Samsung u28ue590 4K monitor. According to Apples documentation:     MacBook (Retina, 12-inch, Early 2016) and late-2016 MacBook Pro models support 60Hz refresh rates over HDMI when used with a supported HDMI 2.0 display, an HDMI Premium Certified cable, and a supported USB-C to HDMI 2.0 adapter   My setup have all those things I still cannot run my monitor at 60hz (it runs at 30hz by default, and I can't change it anywhere). Is it supposed to work out of the box or am I missing some configuration?  EDIT: I have tried the following:  ol liBoot in safe mode. This revealed the option to set the refresh rate, however only to 24hz, 28hz or 30hz. When booting normally this option was again not there./li liReset NVRAM. Did nothing./li liReset SMC. Did nothing./li /ol  I'm not sure this is a duplicate question as suggested in the comments as this monitor supports HDMI 2.0. If the monitor for some other reason doesn't support the 2016 MBP I would be interested in knowing that.  EDIT2: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/375XJ.png" alt="Display settings for the external monitor"  <answer278591> Since you can't see the Refresh Rate option in your display preferences, I would try booting into Safe Mode first to see if you can reset your display resolution to default settings. If that doesn't work, then I'd reset the NVRAM and SMC (in that order). See below for full steps for each.  strongBoot into Safe Mode/strong  Follow these steps boot your MBP into Safe Mode:  ol liFully shut down your Mac/li liRestart your Mac/li liImmediately press the kbdShift/kbd key and strongkeep it down/strong /li liLet go of the kbdShift/kbd key when you see the login window (NOTE: If you have FileVault enabled you may need to log in twice)./li liThe very act of starting in Safe Mode will perform a whole heap of functions (such as deleting a whole heap of cache files, verifying your startup disk, etc) so it will take longer to boot./li liAfter booting into Safe Mode take note of your display preferences (i.e. do you see the Refresh Rate option, etc)/li liExit Safe Mode by rebooting your Mac as normal/li liAfter booting normally take note of your display preferences again/li /ol  If this resolves the issue, no need to proceed. Otherwise proceed to resetting the NVRAM.  strongResetting the NVRAM on Late-2016 MacBook Pro models/strong  Older Macs had what's called Parameter RAM (PRAM), newer Macs use Non-Volatile Random-Access Memory (NVRAM). To reset the NVRAM on all Late-2016 MacBook Pro models (with and without Touch Bar) follow these steps:   ol listrongShut down your machine./strong Yes, a full shut down, not just logging out./li liPress the kbdpower button/kbd emand then/em immediately press the kbdcommand/kbdkbdoption/kbdkbdp/kbdkbdr/kbd keys. /li liKeep these keys pressed down for strongat least 20 seconds!/strong/li liLet go of the keys and let your Mac reboot normally./li /ol  strongNote 1:/strong When you log back in you strongemmay/em/strong need to readjust some of your system preferences (e.g. speaker volume, screen resolution, startup disk selection, time zone information, etc).  strongNote 2:/strong These steps will also work to reset the NVRAM (or PRAM) for all Macs. However, the late-2016 MBP models actually required the kbdcommand/kbdkbdoption/kbdkbdp/kbdkbdr/kbd keys to be held down for 20 seconds, while earlier Macs did not emrequire/em this, but doing so does not cause any problems either.  If this resolves the issue, no need to proceed. Otherwise proceed to resetting the SMC.  strongResetting the SMC/strong  To reset the System Management Controller (SMC) on your model of MBP, follow these steps:  ol liShut down your computer/li liKeep the power cable strongplugged in/strong./li liPress at the same time kbdshift/kbdkbdoption/kbdkbdcontrol/kbd (on the strongleft/strong side of the built-in keyboard) strongemand/em/strong the kbdpower button/kbd (or Touch ID button)/li liLet go/li liTurn your computer back on with the power button./li /ol  <answer278826> I didn't manage to solve the problem with the current setup. It seems like Apple still has some work to do regarding HDMI 2.0 @ 60hz. It simply doesn't work out of the box, at least not with this monitor.  h3For the sceptics:/h3  ol liSafe mode reveals the emoption/em to change the refresh rate, but still doesn't allow more than 30hz./li liResetting NVRAM and/or SMC did not help./li liI tried using another monitor (same brand), another late 2016 MBP, another Apple USB-C to HDMI adapter and several different HDMI cables./li /ol  h3However:/h3  Using a USB-C to Displayport cable immediately solved the problem. I used this one: https://store.google.com/product/usb_type_c_to_displayport_cable  <comment350586> When you say _I can't change it anywhere_ what do you mean? Do you mean you can't find the option to change it, or that the option doesn't allow you to change it from 30Hz to 60Hz? <comment350588> @Monomeeth The option is not even there (in the display preferences). <comment350597> Though different monitor, the symptoms are exactly the same so it may be a possible duplicate of [Cannot get more than 29.88 Hertz refresh rate from 2016 MacBook Pro and Acer XR342CK monitor](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/278246/cannot-get-more-than-29-88-hertz-refresh-rate-from-2016-macbook-pro-and-acer-xr3) <comment350639> @Allan see my edit. The symptoms are also not exactly the same since I cannot even see the option of refresh rate. <comment350640> Thank you. I tried it all and nothing really works. See my edit. <comment352827> That's great - I'm glad you got it sorted! :) And thank you for sharing the solution that worked. I'm sure it will help others! <comment355806> +1 for using a Displayport-Adapter. I used a similar, cheaper one (Aukey) - strangely the original Apple Thunderbolt 3 to Thunderbolt 2 (= Mini-Displayport) did *not* work.
