Homebrew install from a file <body> I want to save my favourite application in a textfile and then install all of them using homebrew later.   How can I do this ?   <answer62733> This will be a synthesis of three things:  ol liMaking a homebrew formula that will dump the Applications you care about into the homebrew location. This will require some ruby knowledge and a short read of the homebrew wiki./li liMaking a script to copy/shove/move the files from the homebrew location to /Applications or ~/Applications or an alternate destination with administrator permissions/li liLearning enough about git to grab the tools. You likely won't be able to merge your "formula" with the homebrew repository since it's against their policy to re-distribute software you don't possess the permission (rights) for software code publication./li /ol  If you want to do this as a learning exercise, have a great time learning. There are far better tools to package OS X binaries like Package Maker, JAMF's Composer, or Iceberg.  If you were uncertain if homebrew was your best option, I'd start with Iceberg and a tutorial like this to handle the permissions.
