Bluetooth Barcode Scanner HID gives wrong characters, remapping required <body> I´ve recently bought a Marson Type MT1227L Bluetooth Barcode Scanner. Among diverse serial connections, it can act as Bluetooth or USB HID keyboard, emulating manual keystrokes. Keyboard-Layouts can be configured e.g. English/US, English/UK, French, German. Scanning Barcodes with normal alphanumeric data (A-Z, 0-9) is no problem. Works like a charm.  emThe Problem occurs wenn scanning Barcodes with punctuation marks (e.g. underscore), special symbols (@), brackets (square and curly), german umlauts (ÄÖÜ etc.) -- all the keys which need to be accessed by ctrl/alt/shift/combinations -- which result in wrong charaters e.g.  &lt;=?@[]^{|}~ becomes ^=°?«{¿}&lt;|„≠±./em  From the OSX side, I cannot configure a german keyboard layout (which is the core problem, I think), because I can´t pass the keyboard setup assistant which requires me to press the "key besides the left shift button" etc.  My Question is: emAre there other hooks in the system (system .plist files, terminal commands), where I can tell OSX that bluetooth keystrokes are to be interpreted as coming from a german keyboard layout?/em  Thanks in advance  Added 07/16/2017: I´ve tried Karabiner, but depending on the BT keyboard layout, different symbols trigger the same keycode e.g. ] and +. The Scanner has an 'ALT CODE' mode which dumps 3-digit ascii codes, but unfortunately Karabiner can handle simultaneously pressed keys, but not series of keystrokes.
