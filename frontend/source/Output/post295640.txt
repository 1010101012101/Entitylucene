Laggy write/read performance w/ Samsung 850 evo 1TB on mid-2012 Macbook Pro 10.12.6 Sierra <body> Here's a weird one: after a Samsung 840 pro 512gb has defaulted this week (applications didn't open, files couldn't be accessed any longer), I bought a Samsung evo 1TB SSD and installed it in my Macbook Pro. I restored from a time machine backup which worked fine.   The issue now is this: Using Blackmagic, I see appropriate write speeds, but only strongabout half of the time/strong (around 500MB/s write and read). The other half it's hovering around 200-300, and performance in general is worse than with the older Samsung 840 pro I had installed before.   When opening Finder windows and performing simple tasks I notice a lag that occasionally occurs, making the system as a whole sluggish and slow. Here's a youtube video showing the issue when using Blackmagic (any visible lag is from my system, not the video recording):   https://youtu.be/AX9bZSZvIRc  Has anybody experienced similar issues or does anybody have an idea what could be the root cause?   Some more info:   ul liTrim is enabled/li liDisk utility does not show any issues/li liI have run both Onyx and TechTool Pro 9 to resolve any common issues such as partition map verification, ownership rights etc./li lithe only thing I have noticed is that the inspector window shows that my user account does not have write access to the ssd (see image below), when I try to change that it says "The operation cannot be completed because you don't have the necessary permission", which is weird since I am the admin. Could it be related to this, and how would I got about changing that? /li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/BknNk.png" alt="enter image description here"  I am thankful for any hints, what other components could be the bottleneck here? Maybe the connection cable of the SSD to the motherboard? A faulty SSD controller chip?

What's interesting to me is that you now how two *different SSDs, both having read issues*.  Before going further, I would verify that your SSDs are functioning properly by testing in a different machine.  I am betting your orig. SSD is good, but there's an issue with the Mac itself. <comment373376> Well, the last SSD showed completely different symptoms and was also detected faulty by disk utility, the new one passes all checks but is sluggish anyway. Here some screenshots from the last, faulty one: http://imgur.com/a/A623j <comment373383> Also, the backup I used was from a time when everything was working fine <comment373384> 1) That's the *volume*, (data is corrupt) not the drive itself.  2) You didn't address my initial question re: different computer.  3) A good backup on a bad machine doesn't fix the bad machine.  It's extremely unlikely that a failed SSD is followed by a second failed SSD.  You **need** to verify that the drives are good/bad before going forward.
