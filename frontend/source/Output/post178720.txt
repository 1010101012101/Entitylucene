How to remove, but not delete, podcast episodes? <body> I want to remove podcast episodes on my iPad to free some space. But I don't want to lose them nor do I want to remove them from the saved episodes. I want to "re-cloud" them basically.  Is here any way to do this without factory resetting the iPad regularly?  <answer178741> Podcasts are not stored on iTunes Match. So basically you can remove them from your iPad by deleting them in your podcast app and re-download them as long as the producer of the podcast keeps this episode online.  <comment211745> What is "re-cloud" ? <comment211769> I want them returned to to state where they are available to download (through iTunes Match) but not stored on the device. Basically having a cloud icon next to them (hence re-cloud).
