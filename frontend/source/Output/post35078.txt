Software to emulate Windows 7 on OS X, for developing <body> I need to load Windows 7 under OS X. These are my Macbook Pro's features:  ul liMac OSX 10.7.2/li li2.3 GHz Intel Core i5 /li li4 GB 1333 MHz DDR3/li /ul  Which software would be the most suitable for me, considering that I want to focus on developing .Net Applications.  I know there's VMWare Fusion and Parallels but maybe there's something better or if not, which one would be the best for me? Thanks.  <answer35081> There's also VirtualBox which is free. It's not quite as polished as Parallels and I haven't tried Fusion, but give it a try and see if it's good enough for you.  <answer35082> I'm a Fusion user and have been for a few years now. Fusion 4.x has been a nice upgrade and it's a very stable way to run the latest Windows OSes on OS X. I think you'll be fine with Fusion or Parallels -- both are tested and support Win7. VirtualBox is a nice option, but be prepared to go it alone if you run in to any issues.  None is really better than the other in my opinion. They all have some overlapping features and they all have some features that are unique to the product. Try before you buy if you can.  I will comment on your system: you're going to find things running slow with only 4GB of RAM and a Win7 VM for development work. Visual Studio is a pig and it's running on top of an OS that's not terribly great at memory management. I'd recommend you upgrade that 4GB to 8GB (or more if your model supports it) if you want the best virtualized OS experience.  <answer35083> I am unfamiliar with Parallels, but I have tried both VirtualBox and VMware Fusion. I have been using VMWare Fusion for well over a year now with no problems. One of the features of Fusion that I find quite useful is Shared Folders, which I discussed on this Ask Different answer.   Having said all of that, to really get the most out of your hardware when using Windows, running it natively via Boot Camp is hard to beat. I talk about this on this Ask Different answer. In short, if you are using VMware Fusion, I would recommend upgrading your system to 8 GB of RAM. While it is not impossible to get by with just 4 GB, having twice the RAM makes a noticeable difference when using something like Visual Studio 2010.   Hope this helps.   <answer35084> You might test Virtualbox https://www.virtualbox.org/ (it's working on osX and emulate Windows 7) it's free.  <answer49404> strongA definitive answer about Parallels/strong I like parallels. That is not a "parallels vs Fusion" statement. It works fine, I've not run into any problems.  ul li"Early 2011" MacBook Pro with OS 10.7.3, 8GB memory/li liParallels 6/li liWindows 7 64 bit, VisualStudio 2010 with CodeRush/li liOther coding tools as desired./li /ul  strongPoints to Ponder/strong  ul li4GB of memory simply is not enough/li liGiven Parallels 6, version 7 is not a worthwhile upgrade from what I gather./li liGiving the Virtual Machine half the CPUs and 2GB memory seems to be a nice compromise with OS X./li liThe different "view modes" are nice.
