How to sync 2 hard drives without being connected to them at the same time? <body> Set-up:  ul li1 external hard drive at work/li li1 external hard drive at home/li liMacbook that travels between work and home/li /ul  Hard drive contains iTunes Music Library that I like to have synced between home and work without taking hard drives with me. In 1 direction would be fine. Carbon Copy Cloner over the internet works perfectly but is way too slow.  Is there a method or software available to sync these drives with my Macbook acting as a delta? New files from home are copied to my Macbook and then at work copied from Macbook to external hard drive.  Thanks!  <comment305862> Could you copy everything onto the MacBook and then transfer everything from the MacBook onto the other hard drive?
