How can I create a running total in Apple Numbers (4.0ff)? <body> A typical use of a spreadsheet is to create a running total, as for a checkbook register.  The usual way to do this is to simply add a current row to a prior row.  My example is a variation -- showing the accumulation of bills over time.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/V34u7.png" alt="Typical running total using "  In text, the formula for "Amount" in row "Homeowners" is   pre   ($Amount Homeowners) + â€¨IF (ROW() = ROW($Amount $electric Nov), 0, Calculate via Prior Sum electric Nov) /pre  However, things get a little sticky if you want to interpose some notes (cell background red here) or whatever:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/cr2Ll.png" alt="Typical running addition fails when you vary your use of a row"  It fails in either column, and ruins all successive values  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QAlu8.png" alt="Fails in running total column, too"  <answer266394> The way I got around this today was to generate a range dynamically and use the codeSUM/code operation on it.  codeSUM/code ignores non-numeric entries:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kFgr9.png" alt="SUM over range gracefully skips alphabetic entries"  The formula I use sets a fixed initial cell to start the running total, column "Amount" in row "electric Nov".  I can't use regular tricks, I need to generate the range dynamically for each row using codeINDIRECT/code.  This requires I create a string identifying the range to sum up.  This range should only go up to the current row (which is what makes it a running total).  I don't want to use fixed columns A, B, C, etc., which break if I need to shift columns around; I need to use the initial cell with the numeric column number, and I must use the "R1C1" cell notation instead of "A1".    So I concatenate the (unchanging) row and column numbers from the initial cell, a colon (:) to indicate a range, and then the current row number and column number.  I have pretty-printed the formula (at least I think it's pretty!) below.  pre     SUM (         INDIRECT (            CONCATENATE (                "R",                ROW ($Amount $electric Nov),                "C",                COLUMN($Amount $electric Nov),                ":",                "R",                ROW(),                "C",                COLUMN($Amount $electric Nov)            ),            FALSE          )     ) /pre  Note that this goes quite gracefully past non-numeric entries to give a reliable running total.  I hope this helps someone out there!
