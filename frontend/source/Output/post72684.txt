Database of all Mac models <body> I need a database of all Mac models produced within the last decade (at least). Something like EveryMac or MacTracker but as a table in SQL or a similar format, to be put into a RDBMS.  Does anybody know where I can get / buy one?  <answer72689> Try MacTracker. It's available in the App Store and Mac App Store. I hit enter before I finished thinking through my answer. What info do you need, Model Numbers or Model Names?   <answer72705> Over at apple-history.com you can download the html of their Mactracker-like information.  Probably wouldn't too terribly difficult to scrape your info from it.  Below is an example of the html you can download from them...  precode&lt;p class='specs'&gt;Family: PowerBook&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class='specs'&gt;Codename: Tim LC, Tim Lite, Leary, Replacements&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class='specs'&gt;Gestalt ID: 25&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class='specs'&gt;Minimum OS: 7.0.1&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class='specs'&gt;Maximum OS: 7.6.1&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class='specs'&gt;Introduced: October 1991&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class='specs'&gt;Terminated: August 1992&lt;/p&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;p class='specs'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Processor&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class='specs'&gt;CPU: Motorola MC68030&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class='specs'&gt;CPU Speed: 16 MHz&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class='specs'&gt;FPU: none&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class='specs'&gt;Bus Speed: 16 MHz&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class='specs'&gt;Register Width: 32-bit&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class='specs'&gt;Data Bus Width: 32-bit&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class='specs'&gt;Address Bus Width: 32-bit&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class='specs'&gt;ROM: 1 MB&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class='specs'&gt;RAM Type: unique&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class='specs'&gt;Minimum RAM Speed: 100 ns&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class='specs'&gt;Onboard RAM: 2 MB&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class='specs'&gt;RAM slots: 1&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class='specs'&gt;Maximum RAM: 8 MB&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class='specs'&gt;Level 1 Cache: 256 bytes data, 256 bytes instruction&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class='specs'&gt;Expansion Slots: modem&lt;/p&gt; /code/pre  etc... etc...  <comment84388> Did you contact the author of either of these applications whether they are willing to give you the data? <comment84399> How would one extract a list of all Mac models from MacTracker? <comment84409> MacTracker's developer did not reply to my email. I also wonder where did he get his data from in the first place. <comment84412> I need model numbers, names, year and specs. <comment84449> I haven't found model names (like MacBookPro5,1) and model numbers (MB470LL/A) there, but this is very useful, thank you!
