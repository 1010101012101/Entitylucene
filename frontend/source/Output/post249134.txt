Contact names missing on calls and messages <body> My contacts are on my phone and I can choose them from the contact icon. I can not choose them to make a phone call or send a message. Incoming phone calls and messages do not display the contact name, I have tuned off contacts in iCloud and then back on but it did not fix the problem.  I did something in Facebook that was sending out friend requests to everybody.

It also may need to be written in a specific format (+country code (area code) number, for instance).  <answer293305> I agree with @jaime Santa Cruz and the issue with Facebook integration screwed up my contacts from 200 to 1800 contacts and it was a pain made extra duplicates and numbers missing.  thank goodness in iOS 11 apple remote the social network like twitter Vimeo Facebook and more.  less fuss to worry about with those items removed.

Where there phones at some point, and now there aren't? Do you remember any changes, installs updates that happened between those events?
