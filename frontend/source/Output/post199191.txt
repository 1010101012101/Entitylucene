How to stop TextWrangler changing the text file icon? <body> I use a several text editors, but every time I save with TextWrangler it changes the file's icon in Finder to a TextWrangler icon with the following extended attributes;     com.apple.FinderInfobr   com.apple.TextEncoding   How do I get TextWrangler to stop doing this? I can't find a settings that seems to fix this.  <answer199200> I assume this is because TextWrangler sets the "Always Open With" option in your case. I can suggest you to take a look for an option to stop this or to try manually make a file to Always Open With TextEdit (for example) just to test if this is the issue.  <answer199702> A support request was filed and Bare Bones responded quickly.  TextWrangler sets the file type (com.apple.FinderInfo; file icon) when it determines that the file name cannot be used to determine that it is a text file. The exact determination here is not too important; as I found, hence I would assume that source code files would fall into this category. The text encoding is a standard attribute and is set to indicate the file's character encoding.  To disable the writing of these extended file attributes, the following command is used;  precodedefaults write com.barebones.textwrangler WriteExtendedAttributes -string "Never" /code/pre  The command itself is documented in the TextWrangler help files; but not how it relates to the character encoding and file associations.  To find and clear the attributes of the modified file(s), you can use the following standard commands;  precodels -@l # list the files with extended attributes xattr -c filename.sh # where the file name and extension is as required /code/pre  <comment238645> I'm afraid not, TextWrangler doesn't change the "Always Open With". I've set and reset those several times, it makes no difference to the file icon in Finder. <comment238646> Than I can suggest to completely remove TextWrangler, clear cache and then install it again.   You may use AppCleaner (http://www.freemacsoft.net/appcleaner) in order to find all additional files of the App and remove them. Then use CCleaner (https://www.piriform.com/ccleaner) to remove all cache of your Mac. <comment238651> Could you please expand on how reinstalling TextWrangler would correct it adding extended attributes to the files it saves? <comment238652> Have you [contacted Bare Bones Software](http://barebones.com/contact/technical.html) about this behaviour? Bare Bones make TextWangler and are best placed to help. <comment240459> @GrahamMiln. Thanks for the tip, they responded very quickly; see the answer below for the detail.
