Delete incompatible ScreenFlow version from MacOS Sierra <body> ul liI logged into my iCloud account from a fresh install of macOS Sierra./li liI had a very old version of ScreenFlow (from 2011) under Purchases in the App Store./li liInstalling it worked./li liWhen I try to open it (from the App Store or from Spotlight), it says it's incompatible and offers me to search for a newer version./li /ul  Now how do I remove this old installed version? The App Store only shows me an "Open" button under Purchases, but I can't click on the icon to take me to a details page with an option to uninstall it.  It's harmless to just leave it there, but besides taking up a little disk space for nothing, it pollutes the Spotlight search index and just makes me feel my computer a little "dirty".
