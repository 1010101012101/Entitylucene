Is there any possibility to find my father's lost iPhone? <body> My father has lost his iPhone 6 which was not signed in using an iCloud account. Is there any possibility it can be found?  <answer200027> Using a strongApple ID/strong along with strongFind my iPhone/strong it could have been located if it set up with a iCloud account.  If the device was not set up with an iCloud account, the only recourse is to keep calling it in the hopes some honest person will answer.  However, there is no way to track it without the Apple ID.     Requirements       As of January 2013, the service is supported on   iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch, and Mac computers running OS X 10.7.5 "Lion"   or later. In addition to a compatible device, a free iCloud   account is required to use Find My iPhone. Users can also track   their Find My iPhone enabled devices through iCloud.com on Windows,   but cannot use it the other way around to track their PC.   <comment240991> your only chance is to keep calling it. <comment240993> Please correct the title of your question...
