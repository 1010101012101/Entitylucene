Is Magsafe strain relief covered by warranty? <body> I own a macbook 2012 and the cable snapped due to strain relief. I have strongnot/strong wrapped the cable around the charger box tight considering this could happen but it did anyways.  Is this covered by the warranty?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/StGQX.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer155656> This happened to me as well. Because my computer was more than 1 year off the shelf, it was out of warranty; they charged me $60 rather than the $80 shelf price for a new Magsafe charger. Hurry to Apple Church before your warranty expires! Their Support page for this: http://support.apple.com/en-us/TS4127
