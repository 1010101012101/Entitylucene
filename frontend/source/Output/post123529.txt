Problem Installing Boot Camp Windows Partition on new Mac Pro <body> I am stuck with a Boot Camp installation on a new Mac Pro.   I have tried Windows 8.1 Pro, Windows 8.1 Enterprise, and Windows Server 2012 R2. (Can't try Windows 7, obviously.)  All three give me this at the end of setup:     Windows could not update the computer's boot configuration. Installation cannot proceed.   I've tried letting the Boot Camp Assistant do everything, I've also followed the advice in several posts that suggest interrupting the process by booting back into Mac and using Disk Utility to format the Boot Camp partition as FAT, ExFAT, etc. All lead to the same error after rebooting to the USB drive and commencing with Windows setup.   Windows finishes the installation, seemingly, but it just doesn't seem to be able to update the boot data.  So, what's the trick? How did other codeMacPro6,1/code users get Boot Camp paved? Is this a firmware update I'm going to need to wait for?   I tried support, it was a joke. Apple couldn't pass me off to Microsoft quick enough; and Microsoft couldn't pass me back to Apple quick enough. I think that's the most I've ever identified with a tennis ball.  <answer123541> Finally got this working, thanks to a person named "turbostar" over on discussions.apple.com:  ol liRe-run Boot Camp Assistant to remove the Windows partition and restore the full Mac HD as a single partition./li liRun a PRAM reset (restart, while screen is still black, hold down kbdâŒ˜/kbd+kbdOption/kbd+kbdP/kbd+kbdR/kbd and keep them pressed until you hear the startup sound a emsecond/em time)./li liOpen disk utility and repair permissions on the Macintosh HD partition. strongTWICE/strong./li liStart Boot Camp Assistant again./li /ol  Seems hokey. With those instructions I thought I would also have to stand on one foot, point to my nose, rub my belly, and hope for rain. But it did end up working.  <answer224748> After I read the above answer I decided to 'Think different'. I think, the PRAM reset is the solution.  I had the same error installing Win10. After klicking the error message away my MacPro rebooted. I hold the ALT key to see my boot options. In my boot options I had my Mac HD, the Recovery partion 10.11.3 and two partitions called Windows.  I tried the third boot option (1. Windows) and after a short while my MacPro shut down. I started it again, did the PRAM reset and held ALT key. This time I selected the fourth boot option (2. Windows) and the Windows setup restarted again. This time whitout any error messages.  After some reboots Win10 was running on my MacPro 2013.  <answer243550>         Thats indeed the solution for the problem.     But you have to do it in this order. (Assuming, that your windows-partition is behind your MAC OS partition)     [this steps are additional comments to http://trueweb.pro/install-windows-10-2010-macbook-pro-a1286/]      ul liCreate a partition wirh disk-utility/li liReboot/li liBoot from windows installation media ()/li liExecute the installer/li liWhen you see the screen, where to choose the partition  - delete the partition, which you've just created with disk-utility  - delete any other partition, that exists after the windows partition  - create one new partition instead of the partition(s) you've deleted just before/li liFormat this new partition, by pressing the format button/link/li liproceed with the installation, by choosing the new created partition/li /ul  Then, the error will appear!  ul liShut down your computer, by holding the power-button down/li lido the PRAM reset ?+Option+P+R TWICE/li liExecute the installation for a second time, by booting another time from your installation media/li lidont delete the partition you've created at the first attempt, just format it and start the installation/li liThe error didn't appear in this run/li /ul  So I managed to have windows 10 running at my macbook.  regards, christian  <comment150339> It worked, but how the heck did this guy come up with the idea to *reset PRAM* and repair permissions **TWICE** to get this to work... :P *hmmmm didnt work doing it once, let me repeat the whole process and try repairing permissions TWICE!* <comment150345> @furier yeah, I have absolutely no idea. However, beware, I'm not sure if it was this approach, something else I tried, or one of my ThunderBolt peripherals, but now I get CPU kernel panics when the machine goes to sleep. A fully replaced logic board did not help. I installed an app called caffeine to alleviate the issue, but it is annoying having to be sure it is turned on every time I walk away from the computer. <comment207364> (P.S. the sleep issue was caused by a J4 Pegasus driver, which was updated later in 2014 and no longer causes the issue.)
