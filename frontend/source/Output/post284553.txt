Active Calories VS Total Calories during a workout <body> I'm fairly new to the Apple App- I was a Fitbit user and Fitbit reflected Fat burn, active minutes and Peek time during a work out.  Apple app reflects Active Calories and Total Calories during a work out and I am not able to find an answer to define the difference.  what is the difference in a work out from Active vs Total.  I am still on the fence about this app, fitbit showed when during my work out my heartrate increased, and clearly reflected the calories -  <answer284562> strongActive calories/strong are a result of your activity (running, swimming, etc.) only.  strongTotal calories/strong take into account how many calories your body consumes during that period of time (just to keep you alive) as well as the active calories.
