uptime: /dev/ttys003: No such file or directory <body> When I use the codeuptime/code command on OS X, this error is printed:  precode$ uptime uptime: /dev/ttys003: No such file or directory 20:57  up 36 days, 22:10, 3 users, load averages: 1.77 1.37 1.75 /code/pre  By running the codewho/code command, I see that there is another terminal logged in -- but I don't have any other terminals or SSH sessions.  precode$ who Kevin    console  Mar 10 17:49  Kevin    ttys000  Mar 14 17:45  kevin    ttys003  Mar 14 20:59 /code/pre  This is kind of annoying. How do I get rid of the "No such file" message?  <answer85521> Terminals are numbered sequentially. The first terminal opened was 000, so I opened 3 more so that the 003 number would be used. I closed all extra terminals and uptime worked without error again.  <comment98625> This might make a better resource if you explain what you (or the person who doesn't know yet) doesn't "get". What's the problem to be solved here basically?
