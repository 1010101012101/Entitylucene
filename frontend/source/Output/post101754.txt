OS X: disable CMD-H or "Hide App" command? <body> I emnever/em (intentionally) hide an app with kbd⌘/kbdkbdH/kbd, which emcould/em be rebound for emeach/em app (e.g. Finder), but this is obviously the wrong approach. So, strong(how) can you disable kbd⌘/kbdkbdH/kbd for application-hiding emin one fell swoop/em?/strong img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/AQHk4.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer101766> You might use a private.xml like this with Karabiner (formerly KeyRemap4MacBook):  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt; &lt;root&gt;   &lt;item&gt;     &lt;name&gt;test&lt;/name&gt;     &lt;identifier&gt;test&lt;/identifier&gt;     &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::H, VK_COMMAND | ModifierFlag::NONE, KeyCode::VK_NONE&lt;/autogen&gt;   &lt;/item&gt; &lt;/root&gt; /code/pre  <answer212278> In addition to the accepted answer, this can be accomplished easily with BetterTouchTool.  Open BTT Preferences. If it isn't selected already, select strongGestures/strong.  Under Select Application, select strongGlobal/strong.  strongAdd a New Shortcut/strong: kbd⌘/kbdkbdH/kbd and leave the strongTrigger/strong set to No Action.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LQ6q6.png" alt="BetterTouch Tool Gestures"  Close the Preferences window, and kbd⌘/kbdkbdH/kbd should now be disabled for all applications.  The downside compared to the accepted answer is that this fix involves running an application. However since many Mac users are emalready/em running BTT in the background for other purposes, this fix can be done in a few seconds and might be simpler for some users.  <comment211748> Man, I wish there was a way to do what the OP wants. Is there some kind of regex-like syntax to enable remapping "System" shortcuts in ~/Library/Preferences/.GlobalPreferences.plist, as the OP hinted at in the screen shot?  The problem is that the shortcuts attach to menu item strings, but the quit and hide commands are always prefixed with the application's name :( <comment232532> What if I want to use the keystroke for something else? VK_NONE means that if you hit that key, apps see nothing happening. <comment237006> Who answered this, i do not see the user? But either way this was freaking genius, i have hated this for so long. And have added several of these Hide {Stupid Thing} in System Prefs. No more finally. Thank you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
