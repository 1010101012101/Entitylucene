keystroke when clicking mouse button <body> I want to assign the middle mouse button to the codespace/code key, so I can pan in Photoshop and illustrator without using the keyboard.  I'm sure something like that must exist for Mac OS, but I only find references to the opposite which is making a click with the keyboard.  <answer97412> I found Controller Mate that does exactly what I need, but for some reason it doesn't work in Photoshop or Illustrator. I've tried in other applications and it works...  http://www.orderedbytes.com/controllermate/  The bizarre thing is the hand icon appears, but still no pan, even if I have also set the middle mouse button to perform a left mouse click.  <comment114261> Try Bettertouchtool.  have not used it with 3rd party mic, but know there is an option for other mice  Would not be surprised if it can do middle buttons. <comment114262> Thanks, in fact I already have BTT installed... but I always thought it was only for the trackpad. D'oh! <comment114266> Let us know if it works..  Interested to know and don't have three button mouse lying around <comment114268> It worked... but I had to disable Smooth Mouse for it to work. Using Mac OS without smooth mouse is a PITA... so I need another solution for the keystroke.
