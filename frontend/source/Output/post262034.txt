Removing the BootCamp Win10 partition fails to re-include it to the original SSD <body> My brother created a Win 10 installation on his Macbook Air with the standard configurations. He later decided to remove it again, as it didn't fit his needs. He removed the Win-10 installation via the Bootcamp assistant which caused an error message he doesn't remember. When looking at the "About this mac" window, it clearly shows that there is only one physical hard drive on this Macbook and it has 80GB of Space. The Macbook itself has 120GB or so SSD so something like 40GB are missing.   My guess is that the Win 10 partition was not properly re-added to the original Mac SSD.   What can be done here to fix the problem and make the full 120GB available again?  Thanks :)
