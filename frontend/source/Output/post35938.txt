Triple Boot: Windows 7, Ubuntu 11.10, Lion OSX? <body> I was wondering, is there any possible way to get the lion OSX into my laptop? I already am dual booting with windows 7 and ubuntu 11.10. I've always wanted to try a mac, but never have; thinking now might be just as better than ever. I don't have a lot of knowledge on all this, thus, require expertise. Any idea how I can get Lion OSX and sort of, triple boot it? Thanks! (p.s i don't have a mac. my laptop is an HP, so originally coming with windows 7.)  <answer35942> Making a Hackintosh can be very difficult, and you may not have the right hardware.  But if you do, it may be as simple as adding a third partition.  <comment41004> Welcome to Ask Different! Questions about installing Apple operating systems on non-Apple hardware are off topic.
