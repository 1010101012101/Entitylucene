How do I know if I have purchased an iphone app already? <body> How can I tell if I have purchased an app before I try to download it?

Go to the Updates section, then click on the Purchased listing at the top.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/d8nYn.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  strongOn iTunes/strong  Go to the iTunes Store home screen. At the top right you'll see a list of "Quick Links."
