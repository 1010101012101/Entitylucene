connecting a PS2 keyboard to Mac <body> I have a keyboard that has only a PS2 interface. I tried setting a PS2 to USB connector over it and connected to Mac. The keyboard does not work. It works fine on a Windows XP though.   Is there a way I can get this PS2 interfaced keyboard to work for Mac ? (assuming there is no information on support of Mac)  <answer21717> It looks like you need something like this (Good info on the page too). I've never used one of those so I can't vouch for the specific device or vendor.  <comment23875> The option looks great. I remember trying out which said its an adapter, but did not work. <comment30028> Looks like there a lot of variance among the PS/2 to USB converters that actually convert the keyboard signal to USB. Varying support between operating systems, drivers, as well as varying quality (simultaneous keypresses, latency). I could really use a recommendation in this area for use with a Macbook Pro. <comment108077> I bought this and its working - http://www.trendnet.com/products/proddetail.asp?prod=155_TU-PS2&cat=49
