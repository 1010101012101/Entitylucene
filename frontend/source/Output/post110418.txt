Recursive chmod fails <body> I have a folder owned by coderoot:admin/code. I would like to change permissions of all files inside, so I can edit them without codesudo/code, but recursive chmod fails:    precode$ sudo chmod -R u+w some-folder/ /code/pre  does nothing. Any ideas how to fix it?  At the same time changing permission to a single file works seamlessly.  Story:  I installed a Python package from GitHub repository via codepip/code, as an editable install. I am contributing some changes to it, but doing codesudo/code for every edit and every codegit/code command is not convenient (I guess - neither safe).  EDIT:  precode$ sudo chmod -v -R u+w some-folder/ /code/pre  returns nothing.  Path is below:  precode/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/ /code/pre  <answer110438> The issue is that to be able to write to a file you need to be the owner for u permissions or be part of the group for g.  Note as a user you are not root so if owned by root the u permission does not matter. As you are using sudo I assume you are in the admin group (this is not necessarily the case but if anyone  alters this I would expect they fully understand these permissions). These files are owned by admin so the permission that matters is the g one.  Thus the chomd you need is  precodesudo chmod -v -R g+w some-folder/ /code/pre  There are alternatives  ol liAs this is where python is installed you should be using pip, easy_install and setuptools to do these updates which will require sudo. Another way is to use virtualenv and so install will be done to your own directories  /li liYou can change the ownerbr codesudo chown -R user some-folder//code/li /ol  <comment130061> You likely want to edit `o` other permissions and not `u` user (owner) permissions. Any symlinks in the folder? By default `chmod -R` does not follow them. <comment130062> @laalto No symlinks. I do want `u` permissions (for a file I changed it with `u+w` I can edit it without `sudo`). <comment130065> Can you please run `sudo chmod -v -R u+w some-folder/` and *edit* the result into the question? <comment130066> What are the permissions and owner of the files? e.g. ls -l on the files <comment130067> @patrix I did it before. And there is no output of any kind. <comment130068> @Mark Permissions - various (from `drwxr-xr-x` to the most common `-rw-r--r--`). Owner, as I already wrote `root  admin`. <comment130099> Please run `ls -ld /usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages` and add the output to the question
