Microphone / Headphones combo port does not work in BootCamp <body> I have an iMac (27-inch, Late 2013) that has a 4-pole TRRS headphone/headset combo port.  On OS X any  headset works nicely (e.g. the Apple iPhone headset with microphone).   On Windows 7 64bit with BootCamp 5.1,  the same headset on the same combo port does emnot/em work with the driver as delivered by Apple with BootCamp 5.1 (more precise: 5.1.5640 ). Apple phone support just told me it is not their problem,  because it works on OS X.br So I tried installing a better driver on my own.  According to the Windows Device Manager,  my sound card is a strongCirrus Logic CS4206B (AB 07)/strong.  The closest match I could find on the Cirrus homepage was this one:br http://www.cirrus.com/en/products/cs4207.htmlbr (Go to Resources - Tools and Software).    The same page is also linked in this related thread,  including a step-by-step installation guide,  but it doesn't work for me.  Did someone get a 4-pole headset to work including the microphone on an iMac with the Cirrus Logic CS4206B (AB 07) sound card?  <answer176506> According to https://discussions.apple.com/thread/6767136 this is currently not possible. If someone does get it to work I will happily award a bounty to an answer describing how to do it.  <answer276507> It appears that Windows 10 running the latest Bootcamp does recognize the TRRS microphone now:     Hi there.  I've been monitoring and looking for a solution for this for sometime and it seems the latest version of bootcamp released today (Bootcamp 6.0) with Windows 10 fixes the problem.      I had Windows 10 installed through bootcamp and updated to bootcamp 6 today (Aug 13).  Surprisingly, I plugged in my iPhone headset (which is TRRS) and noticed windows installing some drivers. ...      Headset is working just like it does in OSX now, awesome for VOIP or gaming. Very happy camper here!      Should note that I am running Windows 10 with Bootcamp 6 on a late 2013 Retina Macbook Pro.   <comment206842> Search for CS4206B on Apple support homepage: https://discussions.apple.com/search.jspa?type=discussion&q=cs4206b <comment208271> Asked the same question on discussions.apple.com: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/6871937 <comment208438> Helpful thread: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/6767136 <comment208454> Might be a problem with `HDAudio.sys` according to MS Troubleshooting Audio: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/jj123860.aspx#jack <comment348012> Doesn't help those with older versions of Windows, though... <comment348140> I have the latest Windows 10 Pro 64 bit and the latests Bootcamp (it just says Versio 6.0), but my headset does still not work. Is there anything else I would have to consder? Does it depend on the cable? The headset? The Mac?
