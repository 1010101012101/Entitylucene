How do I hide folders in OSX? <body> Is there a way to hide folders in OSX like you can in Windows? And if so then how?  <answer15980> h2The command-line way:/h2  Open Terminal (/Applications/Utilities) and type  precodechflags hidden /path/to/folder /code/pre  replacing code/path/to/folder/code with the POSIX-style path to the folder you want to hide (for example, a folder on your desktop called test would be code~/Desktop/test/code).  To unhide it, type codechflags nohidden /path/to/folder/code.  h2The freeware way:/h2  I haven't used it, but I've seen the app Hide Folders, by Altomac.  <answer15986> Any file or folder that begins with a . will be hidden by default, although you can use a utility like TinkerTool to override this.  <answer91641> In terminal enter the following to show hidden folders:  precodedefaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles TRUE; killall Finder; /code/pre  This will make all hidden folders visible, and will also allow you to prefix a folder with "." directly from finder (making it hidden).  To hide folders again, enter the following:  precodedefaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles FALSE; killall Finder; /code/pre  <comment17438> Unfortunately, in 10.6, Finder won't let you rename something to start with a . <comment17442> @Nathan Terminal lets me rename files to start with a ., but you're right that Finder does not. <comment17446> Hm, maybe that's another feature of TinkerTool or something else I've added, as I'm able to rename files in the Finder with a beginning dot. But using `mv` in Terminal is always available, as per @Troyen <comment107634> If you don't want to always be opening terminal and typing this in, make an automator command so you can assign it to a hotkey or menu option or something.
