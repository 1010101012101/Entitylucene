launchd hitting every modified file every 30 seconds <body> I am on MacOs 10.12.5. I am trying to do high volume I/O but some task managed by launchd hits every modified disk block every 30 seconds. When this happens my high volume I/O has to compete causing a severe slow down. How do I identify the problem task?  I believe it is something to do with launchd because codefs_usage -w -f diskio/code tells me it is. Every 30 seconds it outputs a list like this for every changed disk block in the system (apologies you have to scroll to see launchd):  precode14:34:33.887889    WrData[AT3]     D=0x0068c05a  B=0x1000   /dev/disk2  /Users/simon/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Default/Session Storage/000430.log                                                             0.000145 W launchd.9793620 14:34:33.887893    WrData[AT3]     D=0x00549a2b  B=0x1000   /dev/disk2  /Users/simon/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Default/Session Storage/LOG                                                                    0.000107 W launchd.9793620 14:34:33.887895    WrData[AT3]     D=0x00570119  B=0x1000   /dev/disk2  /Users/simon/Library/Saved Application State/com.apple.Terminal.savedState/window_2.data                                                              0.000070 W launchd.9793620 14:34:33.887897    WrData[AT3]     D=0x0056fab5  B=0x1000   /dev/disk2  /Users/simon/Library/Saved Application State/com.apple.Terminal.savedState/window_3.data                                                              0.000064 W launchd.9793620 14:34:33.887912    WrData[ANT3]    D=0x0056ffd0  B=0x1000   /dev/disk2  /Users/simon/Library/Saved Application State/com.apple.Terminal.savedState/windows.plist                                                              0.000072 W launchd.9793620 /code/pre  I thought it might be my McAfee anti-virus software, so I excluded the files I was writing from real-time scanning, and then tried turning it off.  I then thought it might be Spotlight search, but again excluding the volume my data files are on did not prevent this launchd task from re-accessing the files.   Running codelaunchctl list/code shows a list of 327 tasks. I would love to be able to narrow this down to just one.  Whilst I am sure the task runs every 30 seconds having watched it many times, I cannot find any mention of an appropriate "30" in the configuration files. I have:  ul liNo mention of "30" in /System/Library/LaunchAgents/li liOne mention of "30" in /System/Library/LaunchDaemons  ul licom.apple.powerd.swd.plist sets ThrottleInterval to 30/li /ul/li liNo mention of "30" in /Library/LaunchAgents/li liOne mention of "30" in /Library/LaunchDaemons  ul licom.mcafee.virusscan.fmpd.plist sets ExitTimeout to 30/li /ul/li liNo mention of "30" in ~/Library/LaunchAgents/li /ul  Although McAfee does mention "30", disabling it and excluding the files made no difference.  Any help in identifying the task which is accessing changed disk blocks would be appreciated.  <answer287139> When it happens, try doing  precodelaunchctl list|grep xxxxx /code/pre  int the Terminal where xxxx is the number appearing at the end of your fs_usage output, that is to say the codelaunchd.9793620/code in the listing you provided.  <comment362834> Apologies - I was not able to test until today. The sad answer is "absolutely nothing". I think this is because the number in the fs_usage output is a thread ID, but the number in the launchctl list is a process ID <comment362841> No need for apologies, you are the one in trouble! You are correct indeed: I have just tested my idea does not work on my Sierra. Sorry about that, I should have tested but I was on my phoneâ€¦ <comment362842> I am trying to find a tool to list all running threads. On Linux, there is htop and it can be installed on MacOS, so I went ahead, but there is no support for displaying all threads :-( <comment362889> Can you remove McAfee completely? I recall some very weird things with McAfee -- it was impossible quit normally, and it had two processes monitoring each other so that one could restart the other if it ever died. Basically, I wouldn't trust them to have the disable button actually disable anything. <comment363007> @BallpointBen - unfortunately removing McAfee completely would not make my local IT guys happy and I have to live with them. We do not even know that it is McAfee, except that we would expect McAfee to hit newly changed files. <comment363065> probably obvious, but make sure you don't have a cloud sync active on those directories (icloud etc) <comment363066> you might try turning off time machine in case it builds a list of modified files
