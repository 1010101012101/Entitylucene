Recording a lecture with inputs from Keynote, Webcam and Microphone <body> I wish to deliver lectures using Keynote, and record them while sitting at home. Therefore I wish to have the following:  ol liPlay the presentation using Keynote/li liAt the corner of the screen, there should be my face captured by the webcam./li liMeanwhile, the mic would be on for taking voice input./li liAll the above three should be recorded into a video file and if possible broadcast it on YouTube./li /ol  How to do this on Mac OS?  Comment: Sierra / 4GB / AirBook  Software attempted: OBSStudio. How to redirect a Keynote slideshow, into OBSStudio?   <comment326285> What research have you done and which apps have you tried that have proven unsuccessful? <comment326298> A helpful pointer would be appreciable rather that mere trolling. Thanks. <comment326309> Not trolling at all. The overarching purpose of AskDifferent is for users to pose questions asking for clarification about how to solve particular problems, not baldly asking "I want to do X, Y and Z" without any evidence that you have tried to do it yourself first. Your question will get better answers if you stated the apps and methods _you have tried already_, but which did not work, or which worked poorly. Not to put too fine a point on it, but three minutes of searching on Google gave me several methods I would try to accomplish my needs.
