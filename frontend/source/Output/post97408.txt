New battery stops charging around 85% <body> I have a 17" MBP for about three years and couple of days ago I changed the battery with a new one in an Apple store. The problem is, charging stops at 87%, the charger led remains orange and remaining time until full charge raise to 20 hourse. Funny enough, when I check my battery status with coconut battery, my current capacity is higher than the design capacity of the battery.   I restarted the SMC and it didn't solve the problem. Also the lower bound of charge is not accurate as well (I left it disconnected from the charger and at 12% laptop suddenly was shut down without saving data which cause resetting date and time).   It seems either my charger can not handle the battery or it is a calibration problem but inaccuracy is very high (both on upper and lower charging bound) and any time I want to calibrate laptop has to do a panic shut down!  <comment114263> Return the battery for exchange. <comment114265> Sounds like calibration problem... If bought at Apple store return for exchange
