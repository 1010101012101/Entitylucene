ffmpeg capture of 1366 x 768 desktop is skewed but FaceTime cam capture is fine <body> Per the ffmpeg Capture/Desktop instructions using avfoundation to access input devices the FaceTime camera captures look fine:br codeffmpeg -f avfoundation -i "0:none" facetime_cam.mov/codebr ...but usingbr codeffmpeg -f avfoundation -i "1:none" screen.mov/codebr ...the desktop looks like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/PlCLy.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  How can I use ffmpeg to capture my desktop?  ffmpeg 3.2.2br macOS 10.12.3  -------------------------UPDATE:br the folks @ ffmpeg suggested I "specify another pixel format" - so, I'll try and figure out how to do that. I am confused as to why the desktop looks terrible and the FaceTime camera looks "normal" without any specific parameters tho?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HPYbo.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer271106> Per FFmpeg's bug tracker, I was able to ascertain that the source of the problem is specific to the default resolution of the Mac AirBook: 1366 x 768.     The linesize ... was 1376 ... but   the buffer size was for a linesize of 1366.   After switching the AirBooks Built-In Display resolution, I am able to successfully capture a recognizable desktop movie:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/A8i0Q.png" alt="enter image description here"  To resolve this problem requires implementing a patch which I do not know how to do yet.  <comment340516> Have you tried using QuickTime to do it instead? It's not an answer, but a possible workaround. <comment340517> @NoahL whatTheWHAT?? swEEt!
