Xcode install command via OS X Terminal <body> I have codeMac OS X/code version code10.5.7/code so I downloaded codeXcode/code version code4.6.3/code and launched it.  According to many tutorials (such as this) I am supposed to install further command line tools via terminal: codexcode-select --install/code  But all I get is a little manual page:  precodeUsage: xcode-select -print-path    or: xcode-select -switch &lt;xcode_folder_path&gt;    or: xcode-select -version Arguments:    -print-path                     Prints the path of the current Xcode folder    -switch &lt;xcode_folder_path&gt;     Sets the path for the current Xcode folder    -version                        Prints xcode-select version information /code/pre  I went into the codeApplications/code directory and tried to run the command from there, but the same outcome.  In fact, the content of my codeApplications/code directory revealed through the following command is strange:  precode~ cd Applications  ~ ls Chrome Apps.localized /code/pre  What am I missing or doing wrong?  <answer239928> The command line install works on much newer OS than yours - the tutorial you link is 10.10 and Xcode 6 or 7.  If you can't upgrade to 10.6.8 and then get past Lion, I would suggest run the graphical installer and look for Xcode possibly in code/Developer/code if you don't see it in the code/Applications/code folder.   <comment294650> Thank you. In the graphical installer, under `Preferences` and then `Downloads`, I selected to install the `Command Line Tools` but I get this message that stops the installation: `The package "BluetoothSDK.pkg" is untrusted.` Have you come across this before? How do I proceed? <comment294652> @Joshua It could be as simple as the certificate used to sign that bundle has expired. Are you able to inspect the certificate or try setting the clock back 2 years and re-trying? <comment294667> When you `cd Applications`, you're really going into `/Users/(your username)/Applications`. You need to use `cd /Applications`
