How to set the percentage at which my MacBook warns about low battery? <body> Mine gives a warning at 5% and I'd be much happier if it could warn me at 10%. I assume there's either a way to do in the codeSystem Preferences/code or I have to set a value to some variable in codeTerminal/code.  I've been researching for it for a while, but I couldn't solve it myself. Please tell me how I can set it.  hr  em(Operating system: strongmacOS Sierra/strong Version 10.12.1)/em  <answer261963> Just in case you weren't aware and/or haven't tried this, you can:  ul liclick on the battery icon in the menu bar/li liin the dropdown menu that appears, click "Show" /li liselect whether you want the remaining time or percentage displayed/li /ul  This will display the remaing time or remaining percentage to the right of the battery icon. It is always visible in the menu bar, making it easy to glance at regularly.  With regard the warning, I'm a little surprised it's only triggering at 5%. However, it is designed to trigger once your MacBook is running on reserve power and perhaps in your case that's at 5% because of the overall battery life.  <comment328092> Yeah I knew about this option. I did display it for a while, but usually I'm focusing on my work and I'd rather get warnings/notifications.   I'm pretty sure it's 10% by default and I changed it a while back. I just cannot remember how I did it.
