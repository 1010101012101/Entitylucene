What are the high level steps and limitations for unlocking & jailbreaking an original iPhone <body> My daughter has an original iPhone, aka iPhone 2G.  It is currently unlocked and jailbroken, but that was all done about 2 years ago.  She wants the latest iTunes now, so I am revisiting what the procedure and limitations are for updating, unlocking, and jailbreaking.  I think the right high level steps are:  ol liBackup everything we want to keep. I am pretty sure the phone gets wiped during the process. /li liDownload iTunes current release and install it and let it do whatever it wants to update the phone. /li liFollow the instructions in the iClarified guide "How to Unlock/Jailbreak Your iPhone 2G on OS 3.1.3 Using RedSn0w (Windows)" at http://iclarified.com/entry/index.php?enid=7436 which calls for RedSn0w 0.9.4, BL 3.9, BL 4.6, and iPhone1,1_3.1.3_7E18_Restore.ipsw/li liRe-install apps via iTunes.  Restore backed up personal data./li /ol  Is this basically correct or are there any other gotchas or limitations?    Are there better or more current guides than the iClarified guide?  The phone will be used on T-Mobile.  meta question:  what tag should be used for an original iPhone?  <answer13224> Yes, you are correct on all points.  It's pretty straightforward following the points you listed above.  <comment13946> Yeah I just had nothing to add. <comment13955> Nice to see I'm not the only one still doing this on an original iPhone! <comment13963> Be careful - you generally can't upgrade or downgrade without making sure the break works with both the specific version of firmware / iOS level on the device before and after the break. You may want to be very fastidious about making sure of the firmware levels before you upgrade / reload the device.
