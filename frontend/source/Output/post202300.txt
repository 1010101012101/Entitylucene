Cannot turn off built-in Mac iSight camera in Windows <body> Recently I am developing video-related programs in Windows platform under a MacBook Pro 15â€³ Retina (mid 2014). The programs usually have functions to turn on the iSight camera to capture images. However, I found that even if the program has been closed, the camera was still on, which could be seen from 2 aspects:  ol liIf I re-run the program, the camera cannot be turned on again. /li liThe green light beside the camera is always on./li /ol  This phenomenon doesn't exist if I run the same code under OS X.   So how can I manually or automatically turn off the iSight Camera in Windows for a MacBook?  <comment244007> Are you using Boot Camp? Did you install the Boot Camp drivers? <comment244009> Yes, off course I installed it.
