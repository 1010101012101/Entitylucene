Google Chrome shuts down when my MacBook Air goes to sleep <body> No error messages come up and upon initiating Google Chrome again, it goes to my homepage.  I have gone into System Preferences and then to Security &amp; Privacy and auto logout is disabled.  Any other suggestions?  <answer254984> It sounds like your Mac is set to automatically log you out after a period of inactivity.  Open System Preferences from the Apple menu in the top-left corner. Open the "Security &amp; Privacy" preference pane. Click on the "Advanced..." button in the bottom-right corner. You may need to unlock the pane using the padlock icon in the bottom-left corner.  I think you'll find "Log out after XX minutes of inactivity" ticked. Untick it.  Advanced settings within Security &amp; Privacy  If not work, try to uninstall and re-install software.
