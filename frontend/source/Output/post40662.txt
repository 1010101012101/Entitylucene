In Xcode 4.3, where do I put the additional tools? <body> I'm confused. I just downloaded 6 supplementary packages using codeXcode &gt; Open Developer Tool &gt; More Developer Tools.../code and I thought the .dmg files would contain .pkg files, but instead they contain programs.  Where am I supposed to install these programs?  I suspect the answer might be "Anywhere you want." — But I don't like that idea. I want to put them in some standard or conventional location.  Oddly, there is no README file saying where these should go.  For now, I'm putting them in code/Applications/Xcode Tools/code, but that seems kludgey.  Also odd:  There was a .dmg file for the the Command Line tools, which I installed, but that actually was a .pkg inside the .dmg, which is different from the other 6.  I'm not sure why Apple is providing a .dmg for the Command Line Tools when they are installable via codeXcode &gt; Preferences... &gt; Downloads &gt; Components/code. I think it's just confusing.  And finally: The "Audio Tools" image contains a directory called "CoreAudio", which contains a whole bunch of source code and include files. Where are these supposed to go? I don't want them under Applications.  The packaging of the supplemental tools seems a bit slapdash to me.  <answer40664> Put them wherever you want. Unix and Mac OS do not care where your executable files are.  <answer40706> ol liFind Xcode.app and open it by 'Show package content'/li liDrag and drop new development tool from downloaded .dmg to code/Applications/code inside Xcode/li liAdd yourself to 'Sharing &amp; Permissions' of code/Resources/code with rights to read/write/li liRepeat step 3 for file  precode /Resources/IDEHelperApps.plist /code/pre/li liOpen file IDEHelperApps.plist in TextEdit.app/li liAdd string with name of added tool to first array.

Where makes the most sense? Where did they used to go with older versions? <comment46001> /Applications is the major directory for *.app folders, any location within that folder or sub-directory of that folder is logical. The location where you have them now is perfectly expected. :-) <comment46002> @ToddLehman I don't think theres an outright default location for them. They used to be under /Developer/Applications, so you could put them there again if you want. But I would recommend just placing them in /Applications. <comment46036> There is nowhere you are "intended" to put them. There isn't anywhere that makes more sense than anywhere else. Put them wherever you want. Many people use `/Applications` or `~/Applications` or `/Developer/Applications` but there's no reason for that, it's a personal preference. With older versions they went somewhere in `/Developer/Applications`, but there is no reason to choose that over anywhere else. You can even leave them on the DMG if you want. <comment46071> /Developer/* seems to have fallen out of use, XCode 4.3 even offers to delete the whole directory during installation. <comment46157> Interesting. I'm on Xcode 4.2.1 and it installed itself in /Developer <comment46225> Brilliant, brilliant, brilliant. This is exactly the kind of answer I was hoping for. So is this typically where these things went before? (I never noticed in 4.2.) Do you know why Apple is making it such a pain in the butt for these in 4.3? <comment53271> @ToddLehman they wanted to make Xcode not have to be a multi-gigabyte download for every update. So they split off all the tools you want. I think they make this so difficult because this is really a workaround. I would hope soon they do something more like this automatically <comment53355> Will this remain in effect over an update? <comment62254> Hopefully they will include them in the Downloads section of Preferences in the near future! <comment358150> It seems to me that any new Xcode update might wipe out the additional tools copied into Xcode.app and then you'll have to download them again and reinstall.
