Screen shaking all the time after iOS 7 update iphone <body> I also tried reducing motion in settings, but my phone constantly shakes up and down on the screen. I can't make it stop!! Seems like more problems with the update than without it.  <comment122528> Do you mean the parallax effect on the springboard ? <comment122529> No I mean my entire screen has weird spasms when the whole screen shakes...
