assigning static IP with command line <body> I plugged my coderaspberry pi/code to my codeOSX 10.10/code and I want to give the codepi/code some static codeIP/code. When I run   codenetworksetup -setmanual "Built-in Ethernet" 192.168.1.40 255.255.255.0 192.168.1.1/code   I get :   precodeBuilt-in Ethernet is not a valid IP address. ** Error: The parameters were not valid. /code/pre  I followed the man doc. Someone could help ?   here's the output of codeifconfig/code  precodelo0: flags=8049&lt;UP,LOOPBACK,RUNNING,MULTICAST&gt; mtu 16384     options=3&lt;RXCSUM,TXCSUM&gt;     inet6 ::1 prefixlen 128      inet 127.0.0.1 netmask 0xff000000      inet6 fe80::1%lo0 prefixlen 64 scopeid 0x1      nd6 options=1&lt;PERFORMNUD&gt; gif0: flags=8010&lt;POINTOPOINT,MULTICAST&gt; mtu 1280 stf0: flags=0&lt;&gt; mtu 1280 en0: flags=8863&lt;UP,BROADCAST,SMART,RUNNING,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST&gt; mtu 1500     ether a4:5e:60:d9:e4:51      inet6 fe80::a65e:60ff:fed9:e451%en0 prefixlen 64 scopeid 0x4      inet 192.168.1.32 netmask 0xffffff00 broadcast 192.168.1.255     nd6 options=1&lt;PERFORMNUD&gt;     media: autoselect     status: active en1: flags=8963&lt;UP,BROADCAST,SMART,RUNNING,PROMISC,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST&gt; mtu 1500     options=60&lt;TSO4,TSO6&gt;     ether 6a:00:00:1f:0c:50      media: autoselect &lt;full-duplex&gt;     status: inactive en2: flags=8963&lt;UP,BROADCAST,SMART,RUNNING,PROMISC,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST&gt; mtu 1500     options=60&lt;TSO4,TSO6&gt;     ether 6a:00:00:1f:0c:51      media: autoselect &lt;full-duplex&gt;     status: inactive bridge0: flags=8863&lt;UP,BROADCAST,SMART,RUNNING,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST&gt; mtu 1500     options=63&lt;RXCSUM,TXCSUM,TSO4,TSO6&gt;     ether a6:5e:60:9d:1f:00      Configuration:         id 0:0:0:0:0:0 priority 0 hellotime 0 fwddelay 0         maxage 0 holdcnt 0 proto stp maxaddr 100 timeout 1200         root id 0:0:0:0:0:0 priority 0 ifcost 0 port 0         ipfilter disabled flags 0x2     member: en1 flags=3&lt;LEARNING,DISCOVER&gt;             ifmaxaddr 0 port 5 priority 0 path cost 0     member: en2 flags=3&lt;LEARNING,DISCOVER&gt;             ifmaxaddr 0 port 6 priority 0 path cost 0     nd6 options=1&lt;PERFORMNUD&gt;     media: &lt;unknown type&gt;     status: inactive p2p0: flags=8843&lt;UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST&gt; mtu 2304     ether 06:5e:60:d9:e4:51      media: autoselect     status: inactive awdl0: flags=8943&lt;UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,PROMISC,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST&gt; mtu 1452     ether d6:8c:e1:bd:55:69      inet6 fe80::d48c:e1ff:febd:5569%awdl0 prefixlen 64 scopeid 0x9      nd6 options=1&lt;PERFORMNUD&gt;     media: autoselect     status: active en5: flags=8863&lt;UP,BROADCAST,SMART,RUNNING,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST&gt; mtu 1500     options=4&lt;VLAN_MTU&gt;     ether 20:c9:d0:2a:ee:68      inet6 fe80::22c9:d0ff:fe2a:ee68%en5 prefixlen 64 scopeid 0xa      inet 192.168.1.40 netmask 0xffffff00 broadcast 192.168.1.255     nd6 options=1&lt;PERFORMNUD&gt;     media: autoselect (100baseTX &lt;full-duplex,flow-control&gt;)     status: active /code/pre  <answer205635> I'm going to side step things to get you something that will probably work just fine.  Open System Preferences and delete your WiFi and Ethernet configurations once you have saved all the work you need from the internet.  ul liAdd a WiFi connection and connect that to a WiFi Router with Internet Connection./li liThen add an ethernet connection and make that a static IP/li /ul  I would make two networks initially so you don't have issues with which interface gets the default route:  If your WiFi is something other than 192.168.1.1 - then you can use 192.168.1.1 for the Mac ethernet and the Mac default gateway. If the WiFi is on 192.168.1.1 then put the Mac and PI on 192.168.2.1 and 192.168.2.40 for example.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Flm4t.png" alt="enter image description here"  I don't have an ethernet port on their mac, so forgive the WiFi 2 name - you show have ethernet in that image.  At that point, your internet should work through WiFi and the Mac and the PI should be able to ping each other. The Pi won't see the internet through the Mac. If you want that, open Sharing preference pane and share the internet from the WiFi to the Ethernet port and turn off any firewalls to test things.  At that point, the Pi should use the Mac as it's router and everything should have access to the internet and each other.  <comment247964> What is your "pi" and how does it connect? You can overload OS X network interface using System Preferences and adding a second interface using Ethernet. If your goal is simply to have the Mac listen on two IP addresses, you don't need the command line. <comment247968> @bmike it is `rasperry pi`. Yes I was able to assign static ip by `System Preferences` but I did not manage to do by command line. Btw, now I can't connect to the internet by wifi after setting static ip. Is it normal ? <comment247970> No - you probably messed up your default route. Doing things by the command line might be way more hassle than it's worth. Your call. Without knowing how you want the networks to coexist - it's even harder. Also, you don't explain what hardware you have on the Mac side. <comment247971> @bmike I updated my post with the output of `ifconfig`. In fact, I read that to `ssh` into the `pi` that is ethernet-connected to my `OSX`, I had to give it a static `IP`. That's what I did, but it didn(t work... Perhaps I did not understand the `IP` setting
