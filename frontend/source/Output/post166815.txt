Cannot use AirDrop on my Mac running Yosemite <body> I am trying to use AirDrop to copy some files to my iPad Air 2 but have some problems.  In my AirDrop folder, it never asked me whether I want to share it with Contact or Everyone. I have my ipad AirDrop turned on but it does not appear on my Mac's AirDrop folder.   I have Wifi and Bluetooth turned on on both devices. This is what my AirDrop window looks like:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9kW55.png" alt="enter image description here"  Can someone please help on this?  <answer166829> Your Mac may not meet the system requirements. At the bottom of this page, you'll see a list of the computers that support AirDrop.  (If your computer is one of the ones that should support AirDrop, please edit your question to say so.)  <comment195595> What Mac do you have?
