Buying iphone connected to a carrier for wifi <body> As of right now I don't have a smartphone, but am debating getting one in the near future (although not sure in how long that will be.) My old itouch just broke, so i wanted to know if it is possible to buy an iphone off ebay, one that is connected to verizon (not unlocked) and use it with just wifi until I decide to add it to my network?  <answer96170> Yeah, absolutely. You can buy and use an iPhone without a sim card installed at all and just use it on wifi. However if you want to get a plan later you will need to go with verizon or find a way to unlock it, if that's at all possible.  <answer96197> You need to be sure the iPhone is not blacklisted.  You can use Verizon site:  http://www.verizonwireless.com/b2c/nso/enterDeviceId.do  Depending on the iPhone model (codeCDMA/code or codeGSM/code) you need to enter codeMEID/code or codeIMEI/code code.  <comment112915> Verizon uses also `CDMA` network, a CDMA phone has no sim slot.
