How to redirect MacBook Pro audio to my TV? <body> I just connected my MacBook Pro 2013 to my TV using HDMI. The visuals are working, but the TV does not get the audio from my MacBook. How can I redirect the audio from my MacBook to my TV?  <answer114180> Hold the strongOption/strong key and click on the strongVolume/Sound/strong icon on your strongMenu Bar/strong.  When you're connected via HDMI, you should have an option show in the local menu to select that connection to feed the audio through rather than the standard audio output.  <answer114189> If you've removed the Sound menu bar item, you can also change the output device through strongSystem Preferences/strong → strongSound/strong → strongOutput/strong. There, you can change it by selecting it from the list.
