How to fade out/in in iTunes? <body> Even in iTunes 11, there is no fade out when pausing playback or fade in when starting playback. How can I achieve this?  <answer74140> In Automator, create a new Service, add a Run AppleScript action to it, and enter the following script:  precodeset current_application to (path to frontmost application as Unicode text) tell application "System Events"     if process "iTunes" exists then         tell application "iTunes"             set current_volume to the sound volume             if (player state is playing) then                 repeat                     repeat with i from current_volume to 0 by -1                         set the sound volume to i                         delay 0.01                     end repeat                     pause                     set the sound volume to current_volume                     exit repeat                 end repeat             else                 set the sound volume to 0                 play                 repeat with j from 0 to current_volume by 1                     set the sound volume to j                 end repeat             end if         end tell         tell application current_application             activate         end tell     end if end tell /code/pre  You can assign a keyboard shortcut to it in System Preferences  Keyboard  Keyboard Shortcuts  Services.  <answer192979> you can use this script, Im using this for fade out/in music when I pause or play my music, or skipping songs, its great and works fine with the built in crossfade from playback menu.its great for party play list and works just fine with the latest version of itunes (12.1.2)  http://www.wildbits.com/accubeatmix/  <answer274343> The script above faded out too fast for my taste so I modified it slightly (the 3 modified/added lines are in uppercase - is it possible to highlight text in a code section with e.g., bold? - just change them to lower case if you use it). My version fades out in 4 seconds, just change that digit to something else if you prefer.  precodeset current_application to (path to frontmost application as Unicode text) tell application "System Events"     if process "iTunes" exists then         tell application "iTunes"             set current_volume to the sound volume             SET DEL TO 4 / CURRENT_VOLUME             if (player state is playing) then                 repeat                     repeat with i from current_volume to 0 by -1                         set the sound volume to i                         DELAY DEL                     end repeat                     pause                     set the sound volume to current_volume                     exit repeat                 end repeat             else                 set the sound volume to 0                 play                 repeat with j from 0 to current_volume by 1                     set the sound volume to j                     DELAY DEL                 end repeat             end if         end tell         tell application current_application             activate         end tell     end if end tell /code/pre  <comment140577> This works perfectly and it should be marked as the solution. Thank you, I love it. <comment229842> Hi Kamran, welcome to Ask Different.If possible, add the script here for reference. Links tend to get stale.
