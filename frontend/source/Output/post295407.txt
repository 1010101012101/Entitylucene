macOS can't repair the disk, Invalid map node linkage <body> This link doesn't help me:Why I&#39;m getting &quot;macOS can&#39;t repair the disk&quot;  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/d7ZF4.png" alt="enter image description here"  I was restarting my MacBook Air and I got this message:  emYou can still open or copy files on the disk, but you can’t save changes to files on the disk.

You have to choose the proper slice (i.e. rdisk2s2) <comment372990> Already, I can write & delete again on my external Hard Drive. <comment372991> DiskWarrior has saved my a$$ many times - maybe because I'm hopeless in Terminal, but I certainly trust it to not break things. It doesn't write until you tell it to. It gives you the opportunity to do a file by file comparison before hitting the 'Go' button. Even if I have a full backup already, I'll throw DW at something like this, just to save time.
