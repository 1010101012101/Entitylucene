How does iPhone's compass work? <body> How exactly does iPhone's Compass app work? Is there some kind of chip sensitive to Earth's magnetic field or does it deduce the device's orientation from GPS and other location data? Or a combination of both?  If there are differences among different models of iPhone, of course I'd be interested in learning them. Is the iPhone 7 different in this regard?  <comment281681> Google is your friend! Have a look at: [How does the compass on the iPhone work?](https://www.quora.com/How-does-the-compass-on-the-iPhone-work) <comment281686> @user3439894: Thanks, very useful! That is from almost five years ago, and covers iPhone 4. Do you happen to know if anything has changed since then? <comment281692> Well, I could dig around a bit more on the Internet however you could do the same.  I'd assume there has been improvements in the chips and gyros which have increased/improved accuracy and capability.  Considering that the state of electronics, etc., are constantly improving it's a fair assumption. That said, Apple is, as usual, extremely tight lipid about its electronics, and rightly so.  So if you're looking for more then what was in the link you'll need to do the research. <comment281702> @user3439894, I am not sure whether you are suggesting that this question is too easily answerable for this site or requests too much research, but probably in some sense both are actually true. <comment281711> Not sure what you want as an answer however the iPhone uses an Electronic Compass IC and software to communicate with the IC, along with the Accelerometer and Gyros also built into the iDevice.  Apple has used more then one type/model Electronic Compass IC since it first introduced its Compass.app to iOS.  If you want more specificity I'd suggest you do some research.
