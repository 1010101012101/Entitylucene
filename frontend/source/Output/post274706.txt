Hidden files on Windows machine generated by OS X <body> When I transfer a folder FROM my Mac To a Windows machine by a flash memory, on the Windows system there are hidden files with the same names as the original files inside the folder. If I choose that Windows not to show the hidden files then they become invisible. When the folder contains a huge number of files then the scene is awkward and confusing and sometimes people think that there are malwares on my flash memory.  strongHow can I get rid of these hidden files when I transfer folders from Mac to Windows?/strong  <comment345517> @Monomeeth @Community That other question talks about Spotlight/Trash files. @amin-r seems to be talking about resource forks. Which aren't covered by that question. You know the files which look like `._ExampleFile.psd` that sit beside regular files? <comment345518> This question is more relevant. http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/14980/why-are-dot-underscore-files-created-and-how-can-i-avoid-them <comment345557> @Alistair Communityâ™¦ is a bot, no need to @ mention them (also you cannot @ mention two users in a single comment).
