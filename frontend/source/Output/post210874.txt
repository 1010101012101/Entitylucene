Error in verification/error in connecting to iCloud <body> I am trying to turn off find my iPhone on my iCloud so I can restore a backup.   Every time I try to do this, I get a message saying  precodeVerification Failed There was an error connecting to iCloud /code/pre  ..after entering my password. And if I go to the very top and try to click on my name it tells me:  precodeACCOUNT DETAILS UNAVAILABLE If you are signing into iCloud on another device or at iCloud.com you can get a verification code offline. /code/pre  Then it has the option to get a verification code. I have family sharing with my aunt so I don't know if that has anything to do with it or not but I can't do anything.
