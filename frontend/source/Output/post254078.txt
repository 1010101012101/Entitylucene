logitech anywhere mx mouse keeps on lagging <body> I have a Logitech Anywhere MX mouse that keeps on lagging. I had started to have a similar problem with the old Logitech (M505) and assumed the mouse was dead after years of wear and tear. So I got a new one, and the same issue persists. I think it's a software issue, somehow. What can I do to track the source of the problem?  <comment316274> If you have MacOS Sierra, then please note it's a known problem, and Logitech is working on it. <comment316281> The question is tagged with el-capitan so either it's tagged wrong or its a different issue. <comment316495> @IronCraftMan It's El Capitan. I did not upgrade because I want my matlab to work.
