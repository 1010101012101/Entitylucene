iPhoto - find all photos that look like this photo? <body> All, is there a way in iPhoto to find all the photos that look like a given photo? I suppose I could use Face, but it's actually not for a face, so that's a bit strange. For example, I'd like to tag my pet's photos with the pet's name. I also would like to find all the photos I took of plated food, etc.  <answer207191> There's actually no way to do that in iPhotos/Photos.  But you should take a look at Google Photos which add this feature recently.  As far as I know iPhotos/Photos can only identify human faces, geotagged photos, panoramic photos (Photos only), in addition to various metadata (such as date, descriptionâ€¦).  Nevertheless you can add tag manually (at least in Photos.app) by opening information related to the photo (cmd+i).
