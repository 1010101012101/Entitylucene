Preview: How to set over-under configuration instead of side-by-side in "Two Pages" view? <body> This question is about strongPreview/strong (macOS builtin application). I am not asking for an alternative application, software of emhack/em that "solves my problem". I know that there are plenty of ways of getting around this issue (eg not using Preview).  hr  This is what you see when opening emlandscape/em documents on the em"Two Pages"/em (codeCMD+3/code) view mode in Preview:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kOGGF.jpg" alt="sidebyside"  which is a very bad way of optimizing monitor space! Preview automaticaly puts pages side-by-side when the "Two Pages" view option is selected. This is perfect for emportrait/em type documents. But for emlandscape/em type documents... not so much! Is there a way of emasking/em Preview to render the pages in the over-under configuration, as oposed to the side-by-side configuration?
