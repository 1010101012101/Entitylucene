Retina macbook max USB power output <body> Could someone tell me how much Ampere the retina macbook pro can deliver over usb. I thought that one should be able to charge an ipad with a retina macbook which would mean, that it should be about 1A minimum (Probably rather 2-5A for an Ipad3). However when I plug in my Android phone to charge, it does charge slower than on an 1A USB-Charger.  <answer66111> With the strongSystem Profiler/strong you'll be able to know how much power does the USB delivers, and how much is required for each device connected to a USB. Under the emHardware/em tab, you'll find, listed, all the USB ports, and, within, all the devices connected to them. Just select one of those to get detailed information.  To open emSystem Profiler/em just choose strongApple Menu / About this Mac/strong and clicking emMore Info/em, or go to strongApplications / Utilities/strong.  <answer66116> Macs with USB 2.0 from the last few years can generally provide 1.0A via USB. The USB 3.0 standard specifies 900mA; I suspect that USB3 Macs still provide 1A or even a little more. Note however, that in order for a device to actually draw that much, it must specifically request it from the bus. Apple's iDevices certainly do this, as you can see in strongSystem Profiler/strong (as mentioned in the other answer). For a USB 2.0 device to request more than 500mA, it must implement a special protocol extension, which few devices follow. The reason those devices might still draw 1A from a pure charger is because they detect that the data lines are not connected in the usual way.  Likewise, the iPad only draws 1.0A when connected to a Mac (or even 500mA from most PCs), but 2.0A when connected to the special iPad charger. The charger has its data pins pulled to special indicator voltages via a potential divider, and the iPad only draws that much current if it detects this configuration to avoid damaging whatever it's plugged into.  <answer144202> With a MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Early 2013)  I got this when charging an iPad, which is 2100mA in total.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Zniep.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment140366> `Mac with USB2.0 ... generally provide 1.0A` [This KB article](http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4049) states it's 500mA for USB2.0. Do you have a source for the 1.0A number? <comment256304> Where did you get this information? <comment284463> That's not true, when an iPad connect to macbook, it will give a 2.1A output.
