How to quickly launch a playlist from the home screen in ios? <body> I want to have a "shortcut" on the home screen that launches the music app and starts playing a specific playlist. Can this be done?  I did some research and it seems like Launch Center Pro emcould/em do the trick, except the music app is not supported. I also found an old blog post that mentions the use of URL schemes for ecoute (music player) but it seems outdated as well.  <answer205142> Launcher with Notification Center Widget by Cromulent Labs Will launch any playlist from Notification Center.
