How to export Reminders task to Todoist? <body> Is there a way to export or synchronize Reminders tasks to Todoist?  <answer243808> This is not possible within the App itself. Although you can download an App called IFTTT, it connects the Apps you use and make them work together.  hr  h1Sync Reminders/h1  When you connect two Apps in IFTTT you create a strongRecipe/strong, turns out there's a recipe right for what you're looking for! You can find it here, after you've downloaded the IFTTT App.  Hope this helped you out!  <answer293151> Todoport allows tasks migration between Wunderlist, Asana, Google Tasks, Toodledo, Trello, Todoist, and Apple Reminders.  However the app is not free, it costs $5 (for as many exports as you like).  <comment300431> Do you know if this way can synchronise the existing tasks or if it's only for new created tasks? <comment300432> Mmmm I think it's for the existing ones, but I'll try right away and let you know @Kwadz <comment300433> Mmmm turns out it's achievable using Siri asma a shortcut, so basically yes whenever you create a new reminder with Siri, or will be synced in your Todoist list. I think syncing your existing ones is impossible at the moment, if this cannot be achieved using a third-party app neither @Kwadz
