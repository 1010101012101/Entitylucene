Why kernel log is empty? <body> My macOS 10.12.3 crashed while suspended and I want to look in the log files to determine where the problem comes from.  I opened System Information and in the Logs I found a Kernel log entry linked to code/var/log/asl/code. But this file is empty. Why?  <answer273296> Likely because on MacOS, this log is located at code/private/var/log/asl/code  Here is a tip that I use: given symlinks and hidden folders (plus confusing Unix man), it can be a challenge to find these logs and system reports. Simply open Console, and you will see a list of all the logs and reports.(you will find the one you want under the heading code/var/log/code). Simply right click on the log, and choose 'Reveal in Finder' and it will open directly to the log location!  <answer281408> As of 10.12, macOS no longer primarily logs to text files.  However, you can interrogate the stored log data using the codelog(1)/code command on the command line in concert with the Console application (found in code/Applications/Utilities/code).  For example, to see all log entries generated by the kernel during the last day in old-fashioned syslog-style text, you can do:  precodelog show --predicate 'processImagePath contains "kernel"' --style syslog --last 1d /code/pre  (You can also use code--start/code and code--end/code flags if you want to restrict the time window more accurately.)  Alternatively, you can collect all logs from the past day into a bundle called codesystem_logs.logarchive/code in the current directory by doing:  precodesudo log collect --last 1d /code/pre  You can then open this bundle in the Console app (this takes a little while), and in the Search field type codeprocess:kernel/code to find all the log entries generated by the kernel.  I suggest a thorough reading of the codelog(1)/code man page (as well as the other resources it points to), plus some experimentation.
