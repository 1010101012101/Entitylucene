Is it possible to disable Junk Mail filtering in mail.app? <body> I'm using Mail.app to sync three email accounts on my Mac. I find that usually my Junk Email is usually filled with a lot of emails. It is possible to disable this tab entirely ?  <answer162930> If you simply want no filtering &amp; wish to sort mail manually you can just disable Junk filtering altogether from Mail Prefsâ€¦   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LPql8.png" alt="enter image description here"  emNote:/em That doesn't actually appear to delete the Junk folder - but it does stop it being populated at all.  <comment190631> Are they all always Junk? If not, how would you find a good one & move it back? <comment190632> @Tetsujin I don't want a junk classification. I just want all my emails listed regularly and option to move to trash.
