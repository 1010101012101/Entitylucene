applescript - extract filename from posix path <body> precodeset p to "/Users/myAccount/Desktop/testfilename.txt" set a to POSIX file p /code/pre  I would like to extract "testfilename.txt" from the posix path above?  Anyone know how to go about to do that?  <answer242002> Try this:  precodeset yourpath to ("/YOUR/PATH/HERE/file.ext") as POSIX file do shell script "basename " &amp; quoted form of POSIX path of yourpath /code/pre  This should work for files and folders as well. br I used code"basename " &amp; quoted form of/code... because AppleScript and shell script handle spaces in directories quite in a different way, that should allow you to use also paths with spaces in it.  <comment283122> If you want just the file name you can use: `set a to do shell script "basename $HOME/Desktop/testfilename.txt" as string`
