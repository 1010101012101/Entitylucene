Mac app to show cumulative CPU usage? <body> Activity Monitor will show you how much CPU time the emcurrent instances/em of each process have taken. I want an app that will show the total CPU time emall instances/em of each process have taken, so I can (for instance) see what's draining my MacBook's battery the most on average.  If this exists, I can't find it. Does it exist?  <answer17532> You'll want codesa/code and codeaccton/code commands to dump accounting information to a file.  Here's an article that's a bit old. The perl script at the end works well - look out for * characters in the shell - those might need to get filtered or the input sanitized if the perl script doesn't show you totals.  <comment20158> Gehhh. I don't mind occasional command-line stuff, and I can script a tiny bit, but generating and parsing log files does not sound like my idea of a good time, particularly for something that matters as relatively little as this. Thanks for your answer, though; if my need should ever grow greater I will certainly return here to start down the rabbit hole. <comment20224> Indeed - it's not friendly. Some day, some developer might make a nicer tool that runs in a window. As bad as this is, it's the only tool I'm aware of that attempts to sum the small accounting times to get a bigger view.
