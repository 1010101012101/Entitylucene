is there a way to set the settings on an external webcam? <body> I would like to change the brightness settings of a USB webcam. Is there a way to do that without installing extra software on Lion?  <answer175233> Without - no, not unless your cam manufacturer makes something Mac-specific [but then again, that wouldn't truly be emwithout/em, just emfree/em].  With - I'd recommend Webcam Settings 8 bucks from the App Store.br It's what turned my Logitech from a barely functional lump balanced on my monitor into something actually useful.  <comment206539> what does your about this mac says about that USB camera?
