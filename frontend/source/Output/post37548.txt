Why Is Hands Off Block Local Network Setting Greyed Out? <body> I'm trying to restrict an application's traffic using Hands Off not to be able to connect to servers on the Internet respectively to servers on the LAN. But the when I try to add such a rule, the "Local" and "Local (IPv6)" option is greyed out. Why?  <answer38647> This option seems to be only for outgoing connections, which is too bad. I would also like to be able to restrict some incoming connections to my LAN.
