MacBook Air 2009 using too much battery during sleep - Too old? <body> I have just bought a MacBook Air Mid 2009 and i'm surprised about the speed it uses battery during sleep.  Here are the technical features :  ul liMacBook Air 13" Mid 2009   (MacBookAir2,1)/li liMountain Lion 10.8.5/li liIntel Core 2 Duo 1.86/li li2GB RAM/li /ul  The battery has strong528/strong cycles.  When I use it correctly and gently, it is quite slow but still works fine.  The battery lasts around strong3 hours/strong.  The problem is that when i close the lid, and it goes to sleep, the battery is still draining at a rate of strong4%/strong per hour (based on several tests I have made).  Which means that it can go from 90% to 10% if I just let it sleep during one full day without charging it.  I have checked the stronglight pulse/strong and it is ok (gentle pulse), I have checked the strongsyslog/strong and it doesn't Wake during the night, I have checked the strongpmset/strong and everything is ok (value : 3), I have made strongreset of SMC and PRAM/strong.  Do you think it's a strongcorrect behaviour with an old battery/strong ? or is there an issue about it ?  <comment298429> Yeah, that seems about right, based on anecdotal experience with my 2008 MacBook. <comment298455> @JMY1000 I have ordered a new battery .. it seems there's nothing to do with soft solutions .. It's too old and has too many cycles. Thanks for your experience ! <comment299123> just changed the battery .. almost the same .. it loses 3% per hour .. I don't know what to do <comment299223> It's an old computer that consumes a lot of power, even when idle. TBH, though that seems a tab bit high, it's not too far out of the norm.
