How to install Image Capture by itself? <body> I was googling how to mass delete photos from my iPhone and the consensus was to use Image Capture. However, I couldn't find that application on my Mac. Is there a way I can install it individually?  If that's impossible, is there any other alternative app that does the same thing?  I'm running OS X El Capitan 10.11.3.  <answer237476> The application resides in code/Applications/code, the corresponding (app) bundle is called codeImage Capture.app/code, but the Finder adapts the name to your language settings (it's listed as "Digitale Bilder.app" on a (Swiss) German setting).   One easy way to start it is to use Spotlight and search for "Image Capture". Should be one of the hits (usually the first), just press kbdEnter/kbd to start it then.  <comment290859> Is it not in /Applications/Utilities? It should come pre-installed with your OS. <comment290861> Not there already checked
