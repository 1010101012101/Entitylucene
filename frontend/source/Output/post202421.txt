Add a background to an Excel sheet (printed) <body> I would like to add a background image to an Excel sheet covering the whole page and print it.  ul liA background in Excel is only shown on screen and not printed./li liUsing a large image as header in Excel works but leaves a lot of white space./li /ul  I tried generating a 'background' PDF and using codepdftk/code to merge them, which worked well a couple of years ago but I am no longer able to find a working version of codepdftk/code (see for example https://trac.macports.org/ticket/48528).  precodepdftk excel.pdf background background.pdf output out.pdf /code/pre  Is there another way to achieve the same result?  strongEdit/strong  A screenshot of what I was able to achieve with a PDF background:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wi1JJ.jpg" alt="A screenshot of what I was able to achieve with a PDF background"  All the emExcel/em solutions have some margins.  <answer202888> h1ImageMagick/h1  Consider using ImageMagick's codecomposite/code tool to combine the Excel PDF and your background image:     Use the codecomposite/code program to overlap one image over another. See Command Line Processing for advice on how to structure your composite command or see below for example usages of the command.      h2Example Usage/h2      We list a few examples of the composite command here to illustrate its usefulness and ease of use. To get started, lets overlay a smiley face over a rose:  precodecomposite -gravity center smile.gif  rose: rose-over.png /code/pre   You will probably need to write a short script to deal with each page, but the result should be more resilient and should work across multiple versions of OS X.  You can stronguse Automator/strong to split out each page of the Excel PDF and, after compositing with the background, another Automator Action can recombine the pages.  h1Vector Art Applications/h1  There are numerous vector applications available on the Mac that can achieve the result you are looking for:  ul liInkscape/li liSketch/li liPixelmator/li liiDraw/li liArtboard/li liIntaglio/li /ul  h2pdftk/h2  Working editions of pdftk for OS X 10.9 and 10.10 appear to be available, see How to install pdftk on Mac OS X for build details and various forks.  h3pdftk on OS X 10.9+/h3  For 10.9 and 10.10, try using the quantiverge edition of codepdftk/code on homebrew. Comments suggest this works on OS X 10.9 to at least 10.10.4.  Install homebrew and then use the command:  precodebrew install https://raw.github.com/quantiverge/homebrew-binary/pdftk/pdftk.rb /code/pre  <answer203133> You mention in the comments that you are open to other solutions outside of Excel.  That being the case, I found Apple strongNumbers/strong to do well with using a PDF form as a background image.  This requires no outside software to modify the original PDF.  h2Embedding the PDF/h2  To begin with, select the PDF you wish to use.  If it is a multi-page document, I find it works best to separate the pages by copying them to individual sheets.  (They can still all be printed or exported together as a single document from Numbers.)  This example uses a generic Employment Application.  h3Create a new strongNumbers/strong document/h3  ul liUse the default blank template and delete the table if desired.  Later, we will add tables that can offer far more flexibility of position over the PDF than can be done with a conventional spreadsheet table./li liPaste your PDF onto the sheet./li liSet the size to the strongOriginal Size/strong using the button/li liset the strongposition/strong to 0x and 0y/li liLock the image so it does not get moved again inadvertently (It can be unlocked at any time for adjustment, then re-locked)/li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zaUeOm.png" alt="Inspector change size" hr /  h3Change the Print Setup/h3  ul liEnter the Print Setup by selecting strongFile  Print/strong kbd⌘/kbd+kbdP/kbd/li liSet the Page Margins to 0"/li liSet the Header and Footer to -.5" or -1cm/li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4GVlPm.png" alt="Page Margins"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/X0aBg.png" alt="Resulting printout"  hr /  h3Overlay Tables/h3  ul liAdd tables over your fields.  These tables can be independent and inter-connected, meaning that tricks like merging cells is unnecessary.  They can be inter-referenced for calculations just as can be done in strongExcel/strong./li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZNLzM.png" alt="Tables Overlaid"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DQITH.png" alt="Custom cells"  hr /  h3Formatting Tables/h3  Tables can be formatted to taste.  - Remove borders  - Change font colors  - Use formulas  With a little creativity, I think you would be easily able to use strongNumbers/strong to create your documents.  I would recommend the creation of a template for future use if you need the same document over and over again.  strongemTip/strong: Saving the finished document as a PDF. Use the Print Dialog to export as a PDF rather than the PDF export feature in Numbers./em  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5MAFjm.png" alt="Print dialog"  hr /  h3Resulting PDF/h3  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QYg9a.png" alt="Finished product"  <comment244511> Does http://www.extendoffice.com/documents/excel/1056-excel-print-background.html help? <comment244512> It has the same effect as putting the image as a header. It will not cover the whole page. <comment244645> I may have missed this, but what version of Excel? 2011 or 2016? <comment244667> @bjbk I have both, any solution would be OK (even Open or Libre Office could be an option). <comment244689> I do it routinely with Numbers. But there are limitations with formulas. (No array formulas) <comment244707> I have the same behaviour as with the "official" release. The process hangs with no output. <comment244715> If you can, please report a bug with `pdftk`. I have extended the answer to mention [ImageMagick](http://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php). <comment244737> I will submit a bug report but the dependency on gcj gives little hope. The are several re-implementation of pdftk but none of them seems to support (yet) the background command. <comment244738> As for ImageMagic it works by converting everything to a bitmap. <comment244775> Is a high resolution bitmap unworkable – if nothing else currently works? Alternatively, why not consider a vector art tool like Inkscape or Sketch – both have scripting interfaces and fine grain PDF control. <comment245086> Glad it worked!!
