I cant copy videos from photos to imovie <body> This is so frustrating, I cant copy videos from photos to imovie by drag dropping and if I click on import media I can't select anything site the photos library, I really miss windows without apples hand holding.  If I copy paste the video I get a 4s pic in the timeline, so sad!!  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ycjbn.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment332881> Can you give us some more information? What OS version? Have you tried exporting the video to the desktop and importing it from there? <comment332909> @NoahL I can't even drag into imovie now from finder. <comment332910> Using OS sierra and imovie 10.1.2 @NoahL
