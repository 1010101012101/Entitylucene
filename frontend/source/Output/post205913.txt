iTunes 12 opens automatically when CD inserted <body> I don't use iTunes, but I can't prevent it from automatically opening every time a CD is inserted.   I have already changed the system preferences for when a CD/DVD is inserted to "ignore" or to "open other program"-- but it seems that iTunes 12 overrides these system preferences.    I've also looked at the preferences within iTunes, but there is no option to "ignore" when CD is inserted (though I am almost certain there used to be!)  Any suggestions?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/b4edq.png" alt="My system preferences:"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Te6tY.png" alt="The iTunes preferences options:"  <comment347176> Anyone found an answer to this in the meantime? I experience the same exact problem
