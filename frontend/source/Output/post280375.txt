Metronome app that "listens" <body> I'm looking for a metronome app for my iPhone with a BPM analyzer, so it should be able to recognize if I play too slow, too fast or just in tempo.  <answer280613> Rhythm Sight Reading Trainer seems to do the job.  It's able to use microphone as an input device and other apps like Beatly or CrossBeat offer tap input only.  <comment352631> What instrument do you play? <comment352632> @shallowThought an electric guitar. <comment352633> Uberchord is very good. <comment352670> @shallowThought Yeah, I know, but in Uberchord it's just a "level" in a "game" and I want this function as a standalone app.
