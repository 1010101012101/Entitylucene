how to block youtube in the hosts file <body> I know how to block websites in the host file and it works with others, but with YouTube i just can't get it to work. What am I missing?  precode127.0.0.1 youtube.com 127.0.0.1 www.youtube.com /code/pre  <answer241807> You may need to flush the cache by running  precodesudo dscacheutil -flushcache; sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder /code/pre  Also, the entries in the hosts file need to be DNS names, not URLs (meaning the last two lines are wrong).  <answer241810> You need to restart the entire computer, not just Safari or flushing cache.  <answer241815> Map code127.0.0.1/code loopback address to youtube.com or others except codelocalhost/code may cause some problems.  So map any unreachable IPv6 address is more better such like:  precode200:2:253d:369e::    youtube.com /code/pre  <comment297180> did that, also restarted safari, still not working <comment297185> well i want to block youtube and after applying these settings, running -flushcache and restarting youtube still isn't blocked <comment297207> now it is working, thank you :)
