Created a partition called "HOME" and now it won't delete <body> I'm in the process of migrating my home user directory to a dedicated external drive.  Should be simple enough... but I've hit a weird snag.  I formatted the drive with a single partition I called "HOME".  Now no matter what I do, that "drive" always shows up under /Volumes/ emeven after I delete the partition using Disk Utility!/em  If I create a new partition called "HOME" in DU, I end up with two volumes showing - "HOME" and "HOME 1".  Is "HOME" some sort of reserved name?  What exactly is going on here and how can I clear it up?  EDIT:  I was able to go to /Volumes/ manually in Finder and delete this "rogue" HOME directory.  Everything seems fine now... but I'm still very curious as to what caused this and how to avoid it in the future.  Even reboots had not cleared it out.
