Network: Broken Pipe - can't print through WLAN or upload files <body> Since a few hours, I have a big problem with my Mac: I can't print anything through my network printer, send mails with attachments or upload files to my DropBox.  At first I was thinking it's a problem with my ISP - but then I discovered the printer problem which has nothing to do with my ISP.  I can't give you much details as I don't know where to start debugging as I haven't changed anything in this configuration. Yesterday everything worked fine, this morning the problems occurred out of nowhere.  When I try to print something, the LPG recording of the print job goes very very slow and then stops before reaching 100%. Then I get the info I have a 'Broken Pipe'.  When trying to send a mail with an attachment or upload files to the DropBox, the upload won't start.  ul liMacBook, 2.26 GHz, Inten Core 2 Duo/li li2 GB RAM/li liOS X 10.6.8/li liDrucker: Samsung ML-2850, im WLAN/li /ul  So far I tried to delete both the network and the printer and add them again - both with no effect. After the first time I did this, I could print a page and add something to the DropBox. On second try, it wasn't working again. Of course I also restarted the Mac and the router several times, also without any effect. I also updated both firmwares, which also didn't fix anything.  Do you have any idea what I could try to get this working again?  <comment65822> what do you mean by the second try in "On second try..."? <comment65838> After having deleted and re-added both printer & network for the first time, I could print a page and upload a file. Then I tried to print and upload again and it wasn't working again - that's the second try.
