Increase precision in numbers <body> In Numbers, when I enter code0.981/code, it gets automatically formatted as code1/code. How can I increase the precision?  When I double click on the cell I can see code0.981/code but as soon as I deselect it, it goes back to code1/code.  <answer169278> From the Cell tab of the sidebar you can select the number of decimal places or set it to "Auto". Pick whatever best suits your needs.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kNStF.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment198979> Thanks! How can I change the precision in a corresponding plot? <comment198991> Welcome! I don't know without checking it, but I guess you can find the answer with a quick search! In any case, this is probably a different question.
