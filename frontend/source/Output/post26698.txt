activating screen sharing remotely <body> There is a computer I don't have immediate access to that I cannot screenshare with it. I have an account on the computer and have screenshared before with it.   I believe some setting has been changed to deactivate screensharing.   Is there a way to activate screensharing through codessh/code?  My computer is OS 10.6.8. I'm not sure what the other one is but probably the same.  <answer26699> To enable remote management (including screensharing), issue the following command over codessh/code:    emstrongNote:/em/strong This command sets your vnc password to 'mypasswd' as set by the code-vncpw/code flag in the command, you should change this.  precodesudo /System/Library/CoreServices/RemoteManagement/ARDAgent.app/Contents/Resources/kickstart -activate -configure -access -on -clientopts -setvnclegacy -vnclegacy yes -clientopts -setvncpw -vncpw mypasswd -restart -agent -privs -all /code/pre  hr  To disable the remote management, issue the following command over codessh/code:  precodesudo /System/Library/CoreServices/RemoteManagement/ARDAgent.app/Contents/Resources/kickstart -deactivate -configure -access -off /code/pre  <comment30459> I'm not able to answer right now, but I suspect the solution may involve osascript and the "System Events" application. More later if someone else hasn't already worked out an answer. <comment30463> nice. that worked great.
