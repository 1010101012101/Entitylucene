How do I update my MacBook Pro to the latest version of BootCamp? <body> Running Windows 8.1 on my 2013 Macbook Pro that runs OS X 10.10.5.   Want to update the version of BootCamp (and related drivers) that it is running - I don't think it has updated since I partioned and installed Windows 3-6 months ago and I know there have been updates.  ol liI was notified within Windows via Windows Update of new BootCamp and tried the update via Windows update but it failed/li liRunning codeApple Software Update/code within Windows doesn't give me anything BootCamp related to download &amp; install - this Apple Support Article  says that it will be available via this channel but it's not?/li liThe options from within Yosemite + BootCamp all seem to entail a re-partition and reinstall of my entire Windows partition (naturally not first prize) /li liDownload of drivers onto a USB stick from Apple website but this also seems to involve a re-partition./li /ol  My end goal is to perform the free upgrade to Windows 10 without reinstalling but I am trying to get BootCamp in order from the beginning.  Related question: how can I tell precisely which version of BootCamp I am actually running. From within Windows I can right click on codeAbout Boot Camp/code and it says 5.1 but this is not specific enough.  <answer201198> Open BootCamp Assistant and open the about window. You should be similar to Version 5.1.4 (500) if you are on 10.10.5  BootCamp gets updated when you update OS X so it's really not dependent upon any version of Windows whatsoever so you would be up date on BootCamp even if you deleted your windows partition and started over.  <answer201232> As @bmikeâ™¦ said, BootCamp gets updated when you update OS X: indeed i'm running 10.11 and i've got Boot Camp Assistant version 6.  Now, i did the same thing: i updated from Windows 8 to Windows 10 and i didn't need to update any drivers whatsoever. I had my Windows 8 installed with BootCamp Drivers (but i didn't had the whole partition thingy because I installed Windows on an external hard drive) and i was able to upgrade to Windows 10 without touching the drivers at all. It was really nice and straightforward, just like I was running a proper Windows PC.
