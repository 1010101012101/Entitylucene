Why proxPN cannot connect on my MacBook? <body> I am located in China and just installed proxPN on my MacBook. But it does not connect to the server in Dallas, it always hangs there. What can I do? Thanks!  <answer77247> Many people in China experience the open vpn protocol being blocked. The only way around this would be to use the PPTP protocol which is available with a premium account.  <comment89541> Please contact us directly at support@proxpn.com <comment89870> I concur. I use ProXPN in China and this is the only way to connect... using PPTP.
