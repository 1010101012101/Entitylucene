How to search Mac for files that begin or end with a space " " or period "." <body> I just need to know how to search (within Finder vs Terminal, if possible) for all file names within a specific folder, which begin or end with a space or a period.  For example:br " file.jpg" (begins with a space)br "file .jpg" (ends with a space)br "file..jpg" (ends with a period  Additionally, finding a file name with the characters * or " in it. Searching for this in file name using Finder produces thousands of results which don't actually have * or " in it. Example: "fil*e.jpg" or "fil"e.jpg"  <answer237266> With codeFinder/code as the active application, choose codeFind/code from the codeFile/code menu. In the codeSearching "This Mac"/code window that brings up, select codeKind/code is codeDocument/code, then use code+/code to add another condition with codeName/code as the first item. If you choose codebegins with/code as the second item, you can find files whose names begin with a particular character, like space. The codeends with/code condition won't find files with the names in your examples unless the filename suffix ends with the character of interest, but you can find a particular character, like a space, as the last character before the suffix if you choose codecontains/code and follow that character with code./code. For your codefile..jpg/code example you would use code../code for the search text. This approach will find literal code*/code characters in filenames, if you choose codecontains/code and use code*/code for the search text.  Finding such files with the codefind/code command (in codeTerminal/code) is straightforward if you quote special characters appropriately. For example,  precodefind Downloads -name ' *' -ls /code/pre  reports all files in my Downloads directory which begin with a space,  precodefind Downloads -name '*\**' -ls /code/pre  reports all files in my Downloads directory with a code*/code in its name,  precodefind Downloads -name '*\.\.*' -ls /code/pre  reports all files in my Downloads directory with two consecutive code./code characters in its name, and  precodefind Downloads -name '* .*' -ls /code/pre  reports all files with a space character immediately before the suffix. Finally,  precodefind Downloads -name ' *' -ls -o -name '*\**' -ls -o -name '*\.\.*' -ls -o -name '* .*' -ls /code/pre  reports all of those files in my Downloads directory. You can anchor the search elsewhere by replacing codeDownloads/code on the command line, and you can use other options to restrict the search further (code-type f/code would ignore directories and symlinks).  <answer237275> To illuminate and expand on Eirik's answer a bit:   The instructions he's provided you are essentially the same as you would use in the terminal, but with a few details hidden.   My guess is that you're seeking to clean-up file names, so this is something the terminal is really, very good for: precisely, in fact, why it's retained in any modern operating system at all.   If you're interested, let me know and I'll see about adding further details on what to type to (a) find all files matching your characteristics and (b) correcting their names (while keeping back-ups in case of concern) in a command you can paste into the terminal. :)
