Mac Launchpad icon jumps up <body> I am running OS X El Capitan version 10.11.5 on a Macbook Air.  Recently, on two occasions, I saw the Launchpad icon in the Dock jumping up and down a few times and then it stopped.  On that moment I was not active on the computer.   What could be the reason?  <answer242215> Do you have automatic updates activated for apps in the Mac App Store? You can check this under System Preferences - App Store. (Not in the non-existent Preferences in the actual App Store app, which might be confusing.)  The Launchpad icon jumps when an application has been updated.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YdNOd.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment299356> Thanks for the reply, Lizzan. Automatic updates is indeed activated. Regards. Peter <comment355372> I just noticed the same thing happening; i think its a virus running in the background to be honest. don't know how to get rid of it :(
