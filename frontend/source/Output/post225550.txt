Are mini DVI port and DVI port the same thing? <body> I have an old MacBook and im trying to connect it to a new TV, I have a mini DVI port but can't find adapters for it. Is mini DVI and DVI the same thing? I'm looking for some kind of adapter to HDMI port. Thanks!  <answer225551> Mini DVI and DVI are electrically the same but different physical connectors. Mini-DVI was never a standard, and only was found on Apple hardware until it was replaced with MiniDP. Apple made an adapter that lets you plug in a full-size DVI cable but they haven't produced a computer with this plug in many years so the adapter is no longer available from them, and I don't believe anyone other than Apple ever used the mini-DVI connector so it's not a common cable others would manufacture. You should be able to find an old one online somewhere.   I don't know if there was ever a mini-DVI to HDMI adapter because HDMI wasn't yet common when these laptops were produced, but being electrically identical to standard DVI it should be possible to use a mini-DVI-DVI adapter + DVI-HDMI adapter.   <answer225552> Monoprice sells a Mini-DVI to HDMI adapter (as well as other Mini-DVI adapters).  http://www.monoprice.com/Product?p_id=4852  Mini-DVI and DVI are the same electronically, but the mini connector is much smaller and a regular cable will not fit.  <comment273739> first place i looked had the exact cable the OP needed <comment273741> Many thanks!! :) <comment273742> master class answer! :) Thanks!! <comment273789> @samh your link is broken, at least on my phone, but anyway that wasn't really the question.
