Can't uncheck "Enable full keyboard navigation" <body> I have iTunes 12.3.2.35 installed on my Windows 10 Pro PC.  I open the preferences dialogue box and switch to the "Advanced" tab.  I uncheck "Enable full keyboard navigation" and click on OK.  I open the preferences dialogue box again and the "Enable full keyboard navigation" checkbox is still checked.  Does anyone have a work around for this?  Thanks.
