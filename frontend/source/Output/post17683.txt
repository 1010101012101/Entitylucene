Numbers: hotkeys to choose cells in formula edit mode <body> When I edit formulae in Numbers, is it possible to select nearby cells using the cursor keys?  For example, I might be editting cell C3, and set its formula to "=B2+C2". I would like to select cells B2 by hitting the up-arround and then the left-arrow, to take the cursor from C3 to B2. I've tried hitting the keys, and using combinations of shift, alt, and command. Is there a way to do this?  <answer17685> Yes. While editing the forumla you can use the img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5lgYi.gif" alt="CONTROL" + img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/TRz2g.gif" alt="OPTION" keys with the arrow key's to move around and you can select multiple cells using shift as per normal.
