Internet Sharing not working with my BeagleBone Black <body> Running Mavericks on a 15" MBP. I have a BeagleBone Black running Debian Wheezy. I have connected the two with an ethernet cable. I have a working wifi connection from the MBP. So I turn on Internet Sharing to "share my connection from WiFi to computers using ethernet".  When I run codeifup eth0/code on the BeagleBone Black, I see the following output:  precodeInternet Systems Consortium DHCP Client 4.2.2 Copyright 2004-2011 Internet Systems Consortium.

I do know that if I plug the BBB directly into my Netgear router, then it successfully fetches an IP address via DHCP. So I don't know if the problem is entirely on the Apple Internet Sharing side, but it's at least part of the problem, because the BBB, Just Works(tm) otherwise.  <answer135340> I'm on Debian Wheezy too and this worked for me:  ol liInstall Mac drivers from http://beagleboard.org/Getting%20Started/li liConnect BBB to Mac through USB/li liOn the Mac, go to strongSystem Preferences  Sharing  Internet Sharing  Beaglebone Black/strong/li liIn strongSystem Preferences  Network/strong, make sure BBB is in the left hand side and shows “Connected”/li liAfter SSH’ing into the BBB, run “dhclient” (or "dhclient usb0” if that doesn’t work) and then try “ping google.com”./li /ol  <answer157355> If you are:  ul liConnecting to from a BeagleBoard via USB Ethernet/li lifrom Mac Air running Mavericks &amp; connected to web via Wifi/li /ul  I found this very helpful:  http://makezine.com/2012/07/16/use-your-mac-laptop-as-a-wireless-proxy-for-raspberry-pi/  In short  install/run a proxy server (with Squidman) &amp; your life will be easier.  <comment136099> I just tried the same on my BeagleBone black and it just worked. Here is my bootpd log: http://f.cl.ly/items/2P0h0L3m2j3t373e3J0y/bootpd.txt and I am running Ubuntu precise from the ARMhf folks: http://www.armhf.com/index.php/boards/beaglebone-black/ <comment136109> I'm using debian Wheezy. Is is possible that the Ubuntu and Debian distros for the BBB are using different DHCP clients? Debian seems to use dhclient, do you know what Ubuntu uses? <comment136117> No - it's confusing, since most DHCP errors are firewalls or problems with netmask, but OSX is seeing the request. Can you set the IP address statically to 192.168.2.22 or something and make sure the network stack works otherwise? <comment204193> From your `Console` log, your MBP made a correct DHCP answer toward `c8:a0:30:ac:1f:f4` which is your BeagleBone @MAC. Just to make a basic check, could you include the output of `ps ax | egrep '[ /](PID|Int|boo|nat)`?
