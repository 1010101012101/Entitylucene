Restore scrollbuffer and tabs in iTerm as Terminal.app does <body> I love the restore functionailty of the Terminal.app when the app crashes or I need to restart my computer, Terminal.app will show me the recent scrollbuffer for the tabs I have open with a - strong[Restored]/strong - key word below. So I know what I did in each tab.   Unfortunately, I did not find a comparable option in iTerm2 and I do not mean the Save Window Arrangement option. What I want is the restored scrollbuffer including all tabs when the app closed as the Terminal.app does.  Now why do I want that so badly in iTerm when Terminal does what I want? I want to be able to use the awesome tmux integration of iTerm ;)  <answer191100> What you want is implemented in the night builds of iTerm2. Follow the instructions to enable window restore and you should get what you want.  <comment229572> Thank you Birger that looks very promising and exactly what I want I will give it try :)
