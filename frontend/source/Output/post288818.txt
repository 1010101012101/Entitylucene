Is it possible to connect two 4k monitors to one thunderbolt port? <body> I want to buy the new macbook pro 13" without touchbar and be able to connect two 4k monitors AND the charger. But this macbook only has 2 ports.  <answer288875> What you want to do is possible, but not without either using an adapter, dock, or the right kind of displays. For example:  ul liyou can use a display that allows you to daisy-chain to another display (i.e. you have a charger plugged into one of your ports, and you have one display connected to the other port and a second display connected to the first display)/li liyou purchase a dock such as the OWC's Thunderbolt 3 Dock./li liyou purchase at least one display that will provide charging power to your MBP (e.g. the LG UltraFine 4K Display)./li /ul  You may want to also read:  ul liAbout Thunderbolt ports and displays/li liConnect with Thunderbolt 3 on your new MacBook Pro/li liUse the LG UltraFine 4K Display with your Mac/li /ul  strongNOTE:/strong IMHO, if you're wanting to run two 4K displays you probably should invest in a MBP with four Thunderbolt ports, as this is likely to provide more flexibility in terms of usage and the variety of devices you can purchase to meet your needs.  <comment364891> You're right. For the price of these docks and the ultraFine, I'd rather invest in the touchbar model and be better prepared for the usb-c era. But just curious, do to know of any monitor that you can daisy-chain on a Mac? From my research I found that the apple's old thunderbolt display was the only one that supported that.
