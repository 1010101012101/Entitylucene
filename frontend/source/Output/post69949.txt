Applescript vs. Spaces in Lion (10.7) <body> In Snow Leopard (10.6), I had an applescript that toggled iTunes between "maximised on Space 2" and "mini-player on all spaces":  precodeset app_identifier to do shell script "echo 'com.apple.iTunes' | /usr/bin/perl -pe 'use encoding utf8; s/(\\w)/\\L$1/gi'"  tell application "iTunes"     # if it's not already minimised...     if minimized of front browser window is false then         # switch to mini player         set minimized of front browser window to true         # set it to show on all spaces (the magic here is the "65544").         set app_construct to (run script "{|" &amp; app_identifier &amp; "|: 65544}")         tell application "System Events"             tell expose preferences                 tell «class essp»                     set spaces_bindings to get «class spcs»                     set spaces_bindings to app_construct &amp; spaces_bindings                     set «class spcs» to spaces_bindings                 end tell             end tell         end tell     else         # switch to normal player         set minimized of front browser window to false         # set it to show on Space 2 (the magic here is the "2" - compare to the "65544" in the "set to all spaces" version).         set app_construct to (run script "{|" &amp; app_identifier &amp; "|: 2}")         tell application "System Events"             tell expose preferences                 tell «class essp»                     set spaces_bindings to get «class spcs»                     set spaces_bindings to app_construct &amp; spaces_bindings                     set «class spcs» to spaces_bindings                 end tell             end tell         end tell     end if end tell /code/pre  That's based on scripts from http://soylentfoo.jnewland.com/articles/2007/11/22/spaces-application-assignments-and-applescript .  This doesn't work on Lion.  Does anyone know the equivalent to "assign this app to all spaces" and "assign this app to space 2" in Lion?
