How to add a Google Drive directory to my computer <body> I downloaded Google Drive, clicked on it and dragged the application to the Applications folder. When I clicked on it, it opened up in my browser. There was no further installation process. It didn't add a Google Drive directory to my computer. How can I add such a directory to my computer?  <answer253224> strongNote: When you install Google Drive, you must run it from the actual application in the application folder. Launchpad is just a URL shortcut./strong  strongTo change your settings:/strong  ol liClick Google Drive, the icon is in the menu bar at the top right of  In the top right, click Menu ./li liSelect Preferences./li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rZfwE.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  strongFolder can be seen here as well:/strong img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4cbCF.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer253226> It turns out there's a difference between starting the program from Launchpad and from Finder.  When I tried running the program from Launchpad, it opened up in my browser and didn't give me the option to install anything.  But when I went to the Applications folder in Finder, and ran it from there, the installer started and I was able to do it.  <comment315115> I got it now. I went to the Applications folder in Finder, double-clicked and then the installer started. It turns out there's a difference between running it from Launchpad and running it from Finder <comment315117> lol glad you got it working, now you can use my info. Launchpad is a shortcut via URL only. Hence, me not mentioning it in my post. <comment315118> Did you create/sign in to your account? It won't do a thing until you do. <comment315119> @Tetsujin I solved the problem and posted an answer.
