MouseKeys Cursor Distance Settings osSierra <body> I've been able to correctly turn on MouseKeys via pressing Option 5 times, and the standard movement settings worked for 789uiojkl cursor movement.   But how do I adjust the distance I want it to move per keystroke like with Microsoft MouseKeys or is os inferior?  The goal for me is when i have mousekeys toggled on, I would like to press i to click, k to drop down to a certain distance of pixels so that I do not have to hold down as long for it to move to the area desired.   Please assist.
