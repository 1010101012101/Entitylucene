Downloads stack progress bar "stuck" at 100% after completion of downloads <body> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vdvoi.png" alt="enter image description here"  As you can see, the downloads stack's progress indicator is at 100%, and is permanently stuck there even after the completion of all downloads. The only way I can remove the progress bar is by restarting dock (codekillall Dock/code) or rebooting. Is there any reason this is occurring and/or any way to prevent it?  <answer116079> There's a bug with Google Chrome that seems to have been fixed. Make sure your Chrome is up to date.  ul lihttps://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=150743/li /ul  <answer204546> Duplicate of What is this line on my dock? and Can&#39;t get rid of incomplete download bar underneath dock icon   It doesn't just happen with Chrome.  FinderDock is a good solution.  Or you can just move the Downloads icon to a different place on the dock, then move it back, that usually fixes it.  <comment135879> I use Safari usually D:
