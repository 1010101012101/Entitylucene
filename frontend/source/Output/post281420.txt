How do you set an Burst ID using exiftools on MacOS? <body> To mark pictures as strongburst/strong in Apple Photos.app a random BurstUUID (same one for all bursts) is required.  By trying to set an UUID with zsh: codeexiftool -BurstUUID='A4862FFE-5491-4F15-9AC0-0881859A0802' sample.jpg/code it returns  precode0 image files updated 1 image files unchanged /code/pre  Does anyone know why that's the case? Would be very happy for getting an answer ;)  <answer281421> h1MakerNotes/h1  To add codeBurstUUID/code for non-iPhone taken photos, you need to copy in codeMakerNotes/code from an iPhone created image. See Re: Help with MakerApple metadata for a related discussion and example:  precodeexiftool -v -overwrite_original -m -P "-burstuuid=$UUID" -tagsfromfile IMG_0178.jpg G0232134.JPG /code/pre  Phil Harvey, the creator of codeExifTool/code, says this about MakerNotes in relation to BurstUUID:     No.  Makernote tags may not be created individually. They may only be changed if they already exist.  The only way to create them is to copy the entire makernotes as a block.  I suggest maybe creating a user-defined XMP tag instead, and writing this to your GoPro images.   <comment354430> Thanks! exactly what I was looking for... <comment354533> Is there a way not copy Exif Data like camera model, recording date, aperture, lens information, GPS, ... because in the solution above EXIF data is replaced by the iPhone data. <comment355783> @user234837 consider [asking a new question](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/ask) to see if this is possible and how to achieve it on your Mac.
