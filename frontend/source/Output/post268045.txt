Samsung UE590D external monitor settings <body> I can't get quite the right colors on my external UE590D 4k. Does anyone have the correct settings/colors so it looks as close as possible to the MacBook Pro retina display?   <answer269872> For this particular Samsung monitor setting the Samsung Magic Angle (Menu  Picture) to Standing Mode and having a low brightness (22) did the trick I have the exact same colors as on the Macbook Pro Retina.   <comment336410> Have you tried getting your monitors calibrated?  I had a similar issue until I had it calibrated by a photographer friend with a [Datacolor Spyder](https://goo.gl/nuYMts) which I subsequently bought so I could do it myself. <comment336415> Seems like a good option, still I'm looking for something simpler. I'm a developer so colors/contrast/saturation are not really my expertise. I'm hoping someone with the same monitor share the settings that worked for him. <comment336417> I tried that too,... It was closer, but not enough.  Each display is slightly different from each other.  If it's just for developer work, you may be able to get a photographer or designer to do it for you for a nominal fee, then you will have settings stuff for your display.
