App Store update not working in Mac after upgrading to Sierra <body> I have recently upgraded my Mac to Sierra. After upgrading AppStore update not working. It shows I have to update for apps Keynote, Pages, Numbers and GarageBand. But while I want to update those individually or all at once every time AppStore ask for the password. If I put correct password it ask the password again and again. If I put incorrect password it shows that password is incorrect.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/VBqmm.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer259986> Here's some things to try:  ul liClose and reopen App Store/li liReenter iCloud credentials in System Preferences/li liTurn Mac off and back on/li /ul  If none of those work, it might be an issue with Apple's servers, in which case you'll have to wait it out.
