Facebook Messenger App taking 3.7GB of storage (iPhone 5c, iOS 9.3.5) <body> My facebook messenger app is taking almost 4GB of storage on my poor 16GB phone, and I've deleted almost all of my conversations (leaving only a few necessities) and group chats but it still takes up that much space. Is there any way I can clear up some space without deleting it?? I dont understand why it takes sooo much space up.
