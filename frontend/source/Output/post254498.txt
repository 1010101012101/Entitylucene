How do I edit RAW in Photos on iOS 10? <body> In Photos on macOS it is clear when I am editing a RAW file:  ul liI need to explicitly choose emImage  Use RAW as Original/em, and /li lithe type of the file (e.g., Raw vs JPEG) is clearly indicated in several places in the UI./li /ul  However Photos in iOS 10 lacks both these features.  How can I be sure I'm editing RAW in Photos on iOS 10?  <answer254542> You will need to use an app from the App Store in order to both take photos in RAW as well as edit them. The two apps I am familiar with that do this are Adobe Lightroom and Obscura Camera.  <comment316913> So Photos on iOS doesn't support RAW? <comment316926> No, not at this time at least. The RAW capabilities are new APIs available to 12 MP cameras in iOS 10, not enhancements to the Photos app. <comment316980> That makes sense. Editing RAW on such a tiny screen seems a bit silly anyway. I'd read in several places that Photos on iOS supported editing RAW, which was why I wondered at al; but looking back I see it was just sloppy writing. <comment333841> Photos on iOS does support RAW. I took a RAW (not RAW+JPEG) photo in ProCamera, and Photos on iPhone does display it, and let me edit it. To verify that Photos is indeed displaying a RAW and not a JPEG, I shared the photo to Google Drive, and it was a .dng, not a .jpg.
