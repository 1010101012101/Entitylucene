Is there a fan in the new Airport Extreme? <body> I'm wondering if there is a fan in Apple's Airport Extreme wireless router so that I can plan for a low noise environment. Is there any source measuring the noise from this part or documenting the internal construction?  ul lihttp://store.apple.com/us/product/ME918/airport-extreme/li /ul  <answer139489> Yes, it does. See this article on ifixit.com for instance.  <comment168208> I have set up a few of these. they are **very** quiet. I've never noticed the fan. In warmer environments it might be noticeable tho...
