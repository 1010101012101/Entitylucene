My ipad mini won't allow me to download an app - the cloud icon is there but I can't click it <body> My daughter has previously downloaded an app, and then deleted it.  When she goes to download it again, the small "cloud" icon is there, as if you could re-download it, but it is not clickable.  I can't understand why it won't let us re-install the app.  It has happened with a couple of different apps also.  I have tried re-booting the ipad, reconnecting to the wifi, I ddon't how else to help her.  Any thoughts or ideas??  <comment374303> When you say you rebooted it, did you do this by holding the power and home buttons until the device restarts and you see the Apple logo? <comment374322> That is how I did it.  Is that not right?
