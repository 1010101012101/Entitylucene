Apple iPhone calendar <body> My iPhone 5C dumped information already set from calendar and won't save new events to the calendar. I am able to enter the event information but when I tap on "add" the information is not saved to that calendar date.  it was working fine then all of a sudden pre-entered events are missing and new events are not saved when "add" is tapped.  <answer191829> It looks like an issue with your default iPhone calendar account. How many calendars do you have on your iPhone? I'd suggest that you go to Settings  Mail, Contacts, Calendars and under the "Calendars" section, see what calendar account exactly is set as Default.  The account set as default will be the place where all newly-created events will be saved to.   <comment213787> Do you have any syncing accounts such as iCloud or Gmail?
