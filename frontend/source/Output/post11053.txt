Remove applications in virtual machine (via VMWare Fusion) from Open With options on Mac OS X <body> I am running Windows 7 in a virtual machine. Now all of its applications are available via the Open With (or even as the default for some) on the Mac. I don't want them there. I've remapped the ones where it was the default, but it is still listed on the Open With menu. How can I remove all of them?  I have shared folders turned off.  I've seen this with Parallels too, and I thought I saw a option to turn it off, but I cannot find it.   <answer11086> If you are using VMWare 3.x, you can try the Steps mentioned in this Article from the VMWare-Community.  Additionally, you can trash the file "com.apple.LaunchServices.plist" found in ~/Library/Prefences. The List of Applications listed in the context-menu will be rebuild the next time you try to open a file via the context menu  <answer11088> strongVMWare 3.1.2/strong  ul liGo to Virtual Machine  Settings  Applications  Default Applications/li liUncheck the box: "Open your Mac files and web links using XX applications/li /ul  strongParallels 6.0/strong  ul liGo to Virtual Machine  Configure  Applications/li liUncheck the box: "Share windows applications with Mac"/li /ul  <answer11091> To complete @nuc answer, you also need to   ul lishutdown your virtual machine/li linavigate to it in the Finder/li liright-click codeShow Package Content/code/li lidelete the codeApplications/code folder/li /ul  <comment11605> Where are my Virtual Machine files located? <comment11607> The easiest for you would be to open VMware Fusion, right click on the virtual machine and select `Show in Finder` <comment113790> My PC Gets stuck shutting down since removal of "Application" folder.

Find the rouge app you want to suppress, highlight it in the list and press ⌘+⏎ to open the folder.
