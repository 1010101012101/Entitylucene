Way to determine most popular Homebrew packages? <body> Is there a way to determine which Homebrew packages have been installed the most times, either in the recent past or all-time? It would make it easier to determine which formulae are the most useful, and to discover new software I may not have heard of. Currently, I just use homebrew when I find out "I need to install this" for some dependency.  <comment168274> Good Q - [I asked the same on Superuser](http://superuser.com/questions/775331/how-can-i-browse-through-homebrews-formulae-according-to-popularity-download), to no avail thus far though. <comment257326> We have the information for bottled formulae but not from the source ones. Releasing the anonymised downloads data is on our (long) TODO list.
