WoL Mac from power-off mode? <body> is there a way to wake the Mac out of a complete power off? I normally don't use the sleep mode,but I also want to wake the Mac sometimes for various reasons (it's a part of my entertainment system).  Any way I can do this?  <answer272866> No, not with "standard Macs".  The feature you are looking for is called LOM (Lights Out Management). It enables you to start a machine even if it's powered off.  Apple sold Xserve servers that supported LOM, but with regular Macs it's not possible.  <comment342967> Thank you! I heard that from various sources and just wanted to make sure
