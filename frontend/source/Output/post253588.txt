What does it mean if I see "security recommendation" next to a wifi network? <body> I recently went to a restaurant and found that their wifi network has "security recommendation" next to its name. I've never seen it before, and wonder if it might be a new thing introduced in iOS 10.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YF8jFm.png" alt="iOS wifi security recommemdation"  What does this mean?  <answer253590> It's new with iOS 10.  Here's an overview of the feature by Engadget:     After connecting to an open network, iOS 10 will display a strong"Security Recommendation"/strong notification beneath the network's name in the WiFi menu settings. When a user opens up the Security Recommendation, they're greeted with a notification that "open networks provide no security and expose all network traffic." There's also a recommendation to configure your router to use AES encryption for the network.   <comment315557> Of course, given that this is a public restaurant, I don't think that they are interested in using AES encryption for the network, since they would prefer the patrons be able to log in immediately, rather than have to ask for a password. Convenience vs. security. <comment315572> True, but Apple doesn't know that so they give a generic recommendation.
