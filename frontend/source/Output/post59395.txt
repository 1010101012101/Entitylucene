How to use Dropbox to share files in Finder by right click on Mac OS 10.8? <body> In Mac OS 10.7, when I right click a file in Dropbox folder, there's a "Dropbox" option which could share files or get the URL of the file. Also there's a "Dropbox" button in Finder's toolbar.  But in 10.8, that feature disappeared.  How can I share files using Dropbox by right clicking in Finder?  <answer59396> this might help:  https://twitter.com/Dropbox/status/228603324440657921  long story short.

Right click on a file to share, or the button in the Finder toolbar? Or are both features missing? What is your Dropbox software version number? <comment68440> @ProBackup The issue is answered below (new version needed for ML). Happens with Dropbox on every major OS X update.
