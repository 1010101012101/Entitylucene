Does a locked/unlocked Sprint iPhone 5 work in India with the Airtel network? <body> Can I use the locked/unlocked Sprint iPhone 5 with a GSM carrier (Airtel) in India with both calling and cellular data working properly?   Also, how about the Sprint/Verizon phones with bad ESN? Do they work in India?  This question is similar to another question that is already answered here: verizon iphone in India
