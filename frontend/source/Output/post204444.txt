defaults: command not found <body> i have two users on macbook pro (yosemite). one of them has access to the defaults binary in /usr/bin the other user gets command not found. looking up in /usr/bin -- no defaults. both accounts are administrators...  I have a laggy mouse (impossible to work) and i want to turn mouse acceleration off.  THX  <comment246413> might not fix the defaults, but could fix the mouse acceleration - http://triq.net/articles/mouse-acceleration-preference-pane-mac-os-x [last comment on there shows it still working in 2013, even though it's very old] Not tried it myself. <comment246414> thx @Tetsujin, i've installed the prefpane... will evaluate it. <comment246415> What do you mean by " looking up in /usr/bin -- no defaults" I read that as defaults is not in /usr/bin but in the previous sentence you say it is there
