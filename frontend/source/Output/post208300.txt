Issue with creating a symbolic link inside /System folder <body> I am trying to make a symbolic link inside the /System folder and even if I run the command as su I get the following error message.  precodemacbook-pro:~ root# cd /System/Library/Perl/Extras/5.18  macbook-pro:5.12 root# ln -s /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Library/Perl/5.18/darwin-thread-multi-2level/SVN/ SVN  ln: SVN: Operation not permitted macbook-pro:5.12 root# ls -ld /System drwxr-xr-x@  4 root  wheel restricted 136 Sep 22 10:37 System /code/pre  How can I get this working?  <answer212917> I am guessing you are doing this to get codegit-svn/code to work. I've tested this on codegit 2.6.2/code. If so, link to non restricted directory:  precodesudo ln -s /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Library/Perl/5.18/darwin-thread-multi-2level/SVN/ /Library/Perl/5.18/SVN sudo mkdir /Library/Perl/5.18/auto sudo ln -s /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Library/Perl/5.18/darwin-thread-multi-2level/auto/SVN/ /Library/Perl/5.18/auto/SVN /code/pre  <comment251254> You need to disable SIP <comment251255> I tried doing that by logging into Recovery mode and using terminal to run csrutil disable and I still have the same issue. <comment251261> hmmm... I don't know what else to do. Where are you running the command from. What user account? <comment251267> There's a bunch of stuff in the Apple Forum Post about this: https://forums.developer.apple.com/thread/3981 also I think there's an option to disable it from the Firmware Password tool in Recovery. <comment275733> This worked for me to fix the error "Can't locate SVN/Core.pm" in SourceTree.
