Curious why do you want to delete it from your computer before you're ready to delete it from your ipod. I wait until I've listened to the podcast, then resync to the computer, podcast becomes marked as "listened" then I know I can delete.  <answer73975> This can be done if you disable auto sync in device settings, and automatic sync manager.  For that however you need to sync the new ones by selecting and dragging to ip*d to sync. That way the ones that got deleted won't be deleted from the device but only from the computer.
