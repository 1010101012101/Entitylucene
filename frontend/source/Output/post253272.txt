Mac partition will not boot after installing OS X on second partition <body> I required a test environment for my Mac Pro so partitioned my hard disk and installed Yosemite on it (I have El Capitan on the first). The installation went smoothly.  I can boot into Yosemite perfectly fine but if I try to boot into El Capitan it brings me to "Install OS X" for about 10 seconds and then switches to the recovery GUI but is booted to the first partition (not recovery).  OS X and all my files are still on the first partition as I can see them from Yosemite and the first partition is now showing as "Install OS X" in the boot selector (alt at boot) but is still called "Mac Pro HD".  Is there any way of clearing the install state off the first partition without having to reinstall El Capitan?  <comment315192> Please add to your question how you installed Yosemite, because AFAIR it can't be done (booted to El Capitan) without modifying some plists. <comment315194> As you said, I modified the SystemVersion.plist to open the InstallYosemite.app (from the AppStore). I changed it back after opening the installer as to not cause any issues on reboot.
