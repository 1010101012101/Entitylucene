Ports Closed on MBP - iMessage Not Authenticating - Apple Engineers Stumped (3 months so far) <body> strongOS:/strong Sierra 10.12.1br strongSystem:/strong Macbook11,3 MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Late 2013) with a 2.3 GHz Intel Core i7 and 16 GB Ram.   Rather than telling you the whole story, I'll catch you up. Basically, three months ago, iMessage on OS X stopped working. Now I talk to Apple's Engineering team to trouble shoot. (Escalated like 25x).  I am running Sierra 10.12.2 on a Macbook11,1 MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Late 2013) with a 2.3 GHz Intel Core i7 and 16 GB Ram. I cannot use Messages to sign into my iMessage account. I get "An error occurred during authentication." This has been for over a month and I have gone to the Apple store and called support. Support passed it to engineering and it faded away. This is the error:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Z5RgG.png" alt="Screenshot Error iMessage Preferences"  I also have a Macbook late 2008 on the same network. On that computer I can log-in no problem. Another Apple ID I have also gets the same error on this computer. So it is a problem on this Macbook, running Sierra.  We partitioned the drive, installed a fresh OS X and messages worked fine. It is my OS.   Somehow, on my own, I got to ports. My theory is that this related to the ports. strongAccording to Network utility, only one port, 631 is open./strong The ports are being blocked somewhere.  I simply do not know how to unblock them.   Now my knowledge starts to taper. Hopefully this will help. /etc/pf.conf seems important.  It seems the ports 53, 80, 443, 4080, 5223 need to be open for FaceTime and Messages. Both of these apps alert the "/etc/pf.conf" file to open the necessary ports while they are running. I believe that Messages and FaceTime are not able to do this. In other words, both apps rely on the same mechanism of opening the correct ports on the Macbook. This mechanism is failing, it seems.  This may have been caused using a VPN (PIA) which I uninstalled.  The only things I can think of -- and I'm not sure if my memory is correct at all, is that I may have ended a process weeks ago that does this. Also, I may have used a command in terminal in an effort to try to turn off IPv6. I can't remember.  I relied heavily on these articles for information:  This article written by Apple seems to suggest this: support.apple.com/en-us/HT202078  This article by Apple may also be of interest: support.apple.com/en-us/HT202944  Any ideas are welcome!  strongEdit:/strong The result of codesudo pfctl -s all/code  precode...
