Disable Cmd + , in Safari <body> I'm currently doing a lot of chemistry writing in Google Docs. Google Docs is great for it because kbdCmd/kbd+kbd./kbd formats as superscript and kbdCmd/kbd+kbd,/kbd formats as subscript... both of which supersaturate chemical writings (fear not, that's my only pun). Superscript works great, but Safari has an overriding kbdCmd/kbd+kbd,/kbd which brings up Preferences-General and highlights Homepage, so subscript doesn't work. I haven't yet found a way to disable Safari's particular shortcuts, so I'm hoping someone here does.    <answer228565> looks like this answer related to a similar problem might do the trick: https://stackoverflow.com/a/20692071/620141  in short:  ol liEdit ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.symbolichotkeys.plist (you can use Xcode)./li liFind the code for kCGHotKeyLookUpWordInDictionary (70), and set 'enabled' to OFF (if it's not there just create an entry '70' with 'enabled' = OFF)./li liRestart your system/li /ol  strongEDIT:/strong In your case, it should be:  precodeKey Down     Characters: ,     Unicode:        44 / 0x2c     Keys:       âŒ˜,     Key Code:   43 / 0x2b     Modifiers:  1048848 / 0x100110 /code/pre  so you should be using key code strong43/strong with modifier strong1048848/strong   Extra help:  ul lianswer's source &amp; extra guidance/li liTool to find the key code (older macs only)/li liAlternative tool that works on Yosemite (Apple Store, free)/li /ul  <answer274660> System Preferences  Keyboard  Shortcuts  App shortcuts  kbd+/kbd  Title it "Preferences..." and remap it to kbdCommand/kbdkbdAlt/kbdkbd+/kbd, and voila, you can now use kbdCommand/kbdkbd,/kbd in Google Docs.  <comment278681> Have you tried doing it another web browser, like chrome/Firefox/third party browser? <comment278684> 3rd party apps are the answer, here's some idea: http://lifehacker.com/5882684/the-best-keyboard-remapper-for-mac-os-x here's one that has an answer specifically per application http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/148845/osx-10-9-5-different-keyboard-layouts-per-application <comment278848> This looks promising, but the tools to find the key codes are failing me. Either that or I'm having trouble understanding them. Could you help me find the code for Command + , and then, if it works, I'll mark your response as answer. <comment278849> I'd prefer to find the real solution rather than a workaround. I use Safari the majority of them time because it's more power efficient and, honestly, on the Mac it looks best. Chrome's mac application is a bit shoddy. <comment280315> @Silew sorry I couldn't get back to you earlier. I've updated the answer, you should (untested) be using  key code **43** with modifier **1048848**  Lemme know how it went <comment280537> I'm sorry, I must be doing something wrong. There was no 43 key, so I made one. I added an item 'enabled' to 43 and set it as NO. (every time I made a change I restarted to see if it would be fixed) So then I followed the format of the other keys and created a value dictionary. To 'value' I added 'type' and set it as 'standard,' then added 'parameters' as 'item 0 = 1048848' and 'item 1 = 44'. It's still not working. Do you know from that description what I'm doing wrong?
