How to get rid of "what's playing"-notifications in iTunes 11.1? <body> Since I updated my iTunes to the newest version (11.1), these notifications appear every time I play songs or listen to the radio.  I really don't need that. Does anybody know how to turn them off?   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yQYEa.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer104278> You can turn them off in the Notifications preference pane by changing the alert style for iTunes to "None":  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Y5dBU.jpg" alt="Screenshot"
