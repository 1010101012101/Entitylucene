Can't send iOS 7 exchange mail <body> All of a sudden my Exchange email addresses are no longer able to send mail under iOS 7. (They worked fine this morning and mail still comes through - just can't send). I have tried deleting the account and adding again. No joy. I have also tried resetting the network settings. Still can't send email... Any help / advice would be gratefully received.  <comment121443> Have you contacted whoever runs the exchange email to see if there is problem their end <comment121448> Not yet - but my wife seems to be able to send mail from her exchange mail (same ios, iphone model, exchange server just different address). <comment121451> I i remember right. We used to have exchange which was tied into an AD server (controls pc etc logins ) which meant if the AD server had an issue with some users it would affect their exchange email access. <comment207079> I have had many issues with IOS7 and exchange server. I never had issues on IOS6 Initially mail stopped synching. Next all my contacts disappeared. Yesterday, all the mails i sent from my handheld looked as though they had been sent, but had disappeared. Still havent found them! Each time i have had to either reboot the phone, or force close the application.
