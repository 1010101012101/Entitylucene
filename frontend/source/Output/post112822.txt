Can Mavericks behave like Lion on multiple screens? <body> I've switched to Mavericks and like the new features so far. But one thing bothers me - the new multi-screen behavior.  h3New in Mavericks/h3  ul liMultiple status bars/li liseparated fullscreen modes/li /ul  I don't like (need) a status bar on each screen simply because it reduces space and I have to click on the status bar to activate it, and I never use the fullscreen mode.  I have my browser opened on my small screen (MacBook) and all other applications on the big one. When I click a link in Mail, Chrome always opens a new window instead of a new tab (the main reason I don't like it).  Sorry for all the extra stuff, here is my question:  strongCan Mavericks behave like Lion on multiple screens?/strong  Is there anything like a third-party plugin or a hidden setting via the terminal?  <answer112823> emSystems Preferences/Mission Control/em *Screens have distinct Spaces* (last item to uncheck) That should remove the status bar and act as usual. Not that I "translated" from my French configuration, so It may not be exactly the same words.  <answer112825> For your second menubar problem, you can unset the last checkbox in Mission Control preferences panel.  To do this: System Preferences  Mission Control. Uncheck the fifth checkbox "Display have separate spaces"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1fBlZ.png" alt="french screenshot"  <comment132441> Relevant or duplicate: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/106541/mavericks-window-across-multiple-monitors/106544#106544 <comment132448> Didn't find that option.
