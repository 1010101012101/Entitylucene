New DDR3 Memory for Mac Mini <body> I bought a Mini last year and I want to update the RAM.  I was shopping around to find some compatible memory and found (this)from a Spanish retailer. They are selling what you see on the picture and I'm trying to understand if this memory is compatible with my machine or not.  I wrote to the company and they said that there will be no problem but I want to be super-sure.  This info is about my mac:  2.3 GHz Intel Core i5 2 GB 1333 MHz DDR3 And running OS X Lion.  Can anyone let me know if this memory is definitely compatible? Or advise on what else I am able to use?  <answer126165> You didn't actually specify the model of your Mac Mini, but by going off the data from here, I think you have the mid 2011 model (Mac Mini 5,1).  If that is correct, then Apple's technical specifications on this model confirm that the Mac Mini uses 1,333 MHz DDR3, up to 8 GB (4 GB x 2).  emstrongHOWEVER/em/strong, that memory that you linked to is "DESKTOP" MEMORY, a DIMM (dual in-line memory module). The Mac Mini uses "laptop" memory, SODIMMs (small outline dual in-line memory module).  <answer126166> If you're referring to the Kingston RAM module in the picture then no, it won't fit a Mac Mini, this RAM module in the picture is too long, the Mac Mini requires 204 pin module, what you have in the picture has too many pins.   http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5475  2012 model:  precodePC3-12800 DDR3  Unbuffered Non-parity 204-pin module 1600 MHz /code/pre  <comment147709> Check out this offer: http://eshop.macsales.com/item/Other%20World%20Computing/1333DDR3S04S/  -- why are you upgrading RAM? Why not 8GB? <comment147711> I would strongly advise 2x8GB as well. You don't want to end up in a situation down the line where you have to throw out 2 perfectly good 4GB modules just to make room for 8GB ones. <comment147720> The OP said purchased LAST yer (2013) <comment147722> OP listed date of purchase conflicts with the processor specs (the only mac mini with a 2.3Ghz is the mid 2011). I took the processor info to be more accurate than the "last year claim" (it's more precise, and harder to mistakenly guess a valid processor spec combination, whereas any date given can be valid) <comment147728> Good point so it might be a used one.
