How to burn FLAC to audio CD? <body> I want to burn .flac files directly to an audio CD. Is there any (possibly free) OS X application to do this?  <answer75700> Yes, Burn is free and open source software, but it is a bit buggy. LiquidCD is freeware, but I didn't encounter any issues while using it.  <comment87871> Which of these applications does allow the creation auf Audio CDs (suitable for any CD player) directly from FLAC? <comment87876> Both, you can try them. :) <comment87895> Did you research this any? <comment88055> Yes, and as a result of that, I answered my question. :) <comment151202> I'm not so sure.  I was using Burn and it worked, but upgraded to a new iMac and when I installed Burn on the new iMac, it would no longer handle FLAC files.  (And I have ffmpeg installed, so it's not that.)  No help on the forum or from an email to the developer.
