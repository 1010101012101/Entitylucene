How to efficiently mark mail as spam before reviewing it in Mac OS X Mail.app? <body> If my ISP marks an email as spam, and moves it to the spam folder before the Mac OS X Mail.app sees it, Mail.app does not mark these emails as spam.  This wouldn’t be too bad if there was a way for me to efficiently mark these as spam (so that I can review them just in case without triggering one-pix image trackers and the like), but there does not seem to be one:  ul liKeyboard shortcuts are a non-starter, as they require the message to be selected first./li liRight-clicking the emails one by one to mark them as spam (which requires going in a submenu each time) is tiresome./li liIn Lion, I could select multiple of them (being careful never to select only one spam) and mass-mark as spam without viewing any of them, but that stopped working when Mail.app got the ability to show multiple message selections as a pile of messages./li liI can re-position the dividers or resize the window to hide the message view pane and mass-mark at that time, but that requires re-positioning them back manually each time, and that won’t do./li /ul  Is there something I have missed?  <answer288716> One solution would be select all those messages and mark them as strongJunk/strong using an iOS device, which would not load/preview emails until they’re opened.  You can also run the following AppleScript:br codetell application "Mail" to set junk mail status of (messages of mailbox "QUARANTINE" of account "NAME" whose junk mail status is false) to true/code  Replace codeNAME/code with the name of your account, as defined under strongMail/strong → strongPreferences/strong → strongAccounts/strong.  You can then run that script anytime you want to mark all those messages as junk.  You could even setup a rule under strongMail/strong → strongPreferences/strong → strongRules/strong:  ol liIf codeany/code of the following conditions are met: codeEvery Message/code/li liPerform the following actions: codeRun AppleScript/code/li liIn the dropdown click codeOpen in Finder/code./li liDrop your code.scpt/code file into the window that opens up./li liSelect that script in the action’s dropdown menu./li liSet this rule as your topmost rule, so that it runs before any rule that ends with codeStop evaluating rules/code./li /ol  <comment364608> Does the `Trust junk mail headers in my messages` setting not work for respecting your ISP's spam markings? Besides that, I'm not sure, you'd probably have to view them and mass select using `Command + click` <comment365119> Thanks! Of course, for some unfathomable reason my ISP names that folder "QUARANTINE"… You'd think that be standardized.
