Applescript: Keynote 6.6.2 start presentation <body> I checked this website:  https://iworkautomation.com/keynote/document-play.html and   I tried this code to start a Keynote presentation:  precodetell application "Keynote" activate if playing is false then tell the front document to start end tell /code/pre  But it doesn't work. The only solution I found was sending keystroke:  precodetell application "Keynote" activate delay 1 tell application "System Events" to keystroke "p" using {command down, option down} end tell /code/pre  Why the "start action" doesn't work? I'm on Yosemite  <comment357711> The first snippet works fine for me with Keynote 7.1.1. Have you tried other versions of Keynote? <comment357712> No, because I'm on early 2007 Imac and I can't install OSX Sierra, so I can't install Keynote 7.1.1... <comment357713> Is working even this code for you: tell application "Keynote" to set the bounds of window 1 to {0, 0, 200, 400}  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11646342/how-to-resize-a-keynote-slideshow <comment357714> Yes, that works fine for me. Is it not working for you? That would look like there's some other issue with AppleScripting Keynote for you then <comment358277> I tried now with Sierra and Keynote 7.1.1 and it works right :) Thanks for your support :)
