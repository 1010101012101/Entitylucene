Macbook Pro keyboard does not work on startup <body> I'm having this issue since morning. Certain keys on my keyboard don't work when I try to type in my password. A few work and others don't. So I went on safe mode and changed it to no password.   The problem is that my keyboard works perfectly once I've logged into my MacBook Pro. I can type this entire paragraph properly but only only the login screen my keys don't work.   What is wrong with my MacBook Pro?  <answer263356> I would reset both the System Management Controller and PRAM/NVRAM.  strongReset the SMC/strong  Instructions for resetting your System Management Controller (SMC) will depend on whether your MacBook Pro runs from a built-in battery or a removable battery.  As your question doesn't provide the exact model, use the relevant instructions below:  strongSMC 1 - For MacBook Pros, MacBook Airs, and MacBooks where you can’t remove the battery on your own (i.e. it's a built-in battery), here’s what you do:/strong  ol liShut down your computer/li liKeep the MagSafe adapter (power cable) strongplugged in/strong./li liPress at the same time kbdshift/kbdkbdoption/kbdkbdcontrol/kbd (on the left side of the keyboard) strongemand/em/strong the kbdpower button/kbd/li liLet go/li liTurn your computer back on with the power button./li /ol  strongSMC 2 - For MacBook Pros, MacBooks etc that you can remove the battery from, here’s what you do:/strong  ol liShut down your computer/li listrongDisconnect/strong the MagSafe plug (power cable) from the computer/li liRemove the battery/li liPress the kbdpower button/kbd for 5 seconds and release/li liPut the battery back in/li liReconnect the MagSafe cord (or power cable)/li liTurn your computer back on with the power button/li /ol  strongReset your PRAM/NVRAM/strong  Older Macs had what's called Parameter RAM (PRAM), newer Macs use Non-Volatile Random-Access Memory (NVRAM).

I did both of those things and it helped
