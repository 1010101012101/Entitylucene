How can I see a list of my reviews in iPad Apple Store? <body> I want to see a list of my rewiews so I can keep track of apps I have reviewed and perhaps share them to my friends. So, how can I preview my reviews, i.e. the feedback, feature-request and such things for developers to get better, in iPad Apple Store?  <answer65869> In the desktop iTunes application:     ul   liSign in to the iTunes Store.  /li   liFrom the Store menu, chose View My Account.  /li   liIn the Settings section, click Manage next to "Reviews and Ratings."  /li   /ul   from http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5024  <comment84996> Shortly, you need to have iTunes ie OSx or Windows to preview your previews. Haven't found any other way so *ix -users without Windows or OSx cannot preview things.
