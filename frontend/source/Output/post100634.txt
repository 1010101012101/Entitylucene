How To Duck Audio in Logic Pro X <body> In garageband ducking audio was a one-click operation.  However I cannot find how to preform the same action in Logic Pro X.  <answer275389> This can be done using sidechain compression in Logic.  Create a new track and insert a sound (eg Kick drum) on every part you want the sound to duck, then set the output to no output.  Go to the track you want to duck and add a compressor and then set the side chain input to the track you created in the step above.  Tweak the threshold, attack and release settings to get your desired effect.  <comment118441> http://www.logicprohelp.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=99410 might be of some help?
