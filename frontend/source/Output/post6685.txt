How to revert to iOS 4.2 from iOS 4.3 beta? <body> Hello all I just installed iOS 4.3 beta version available for developers on my iPhone4. Now I want to go back to version 4.2. But iTunes displays the version 4.3 installed. How can I do this?  Can somebody throw some light on this?  Thanks  <answer6686> It seems you missed the strong"Read Me Before Downloading"/strong section at the top of the 4.3 beta page:     Devices updated to iOS 4.3 beta strongcan not be restored to earlier versions of iOS./strong Devices will be able to upgrade to future beta releases and the final iOS 4.3 software.   According to Apple, anyway, no, you can't revert to 4.2.  <answer6694> Well technically if you have jailbroken before and saved your SHSH you can downgrade your iphone (this should apply to all ios devices and exact steps may vary)   <comment7025> Yes, these are meant to be deployed on development devices and you cannot rollback. Beta 2 is out since yesterday. Time to update to already lower the issues but you'll have to wait the final release to get a stable version if you installed it on a production device.
