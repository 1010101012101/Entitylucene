Early 2011 MacBook Pro SMC firmware update question <body> OS has been upgraded to Mavericks. Can I still run the SMC firmware update 1.7 said to be for OS 10.75 and 10.82? Would it hurt anything to try this firmware update with the later OS?  <answer175223> If software update doesn't prompt you to update, then either it has been circumvented by other updates or it has already been applied.  <comment206516> SMC needs to work with the OS X , so it might not do well.
