How to disable the docked Finder monitor pop-up on OS X? <body> Attached is the screen shot of annoying screen monitor round cornered box, not sure what thats called. I dont know how it appeared!!! I wanna disable it. The Command+option+escape window doesn't show the Force Quit button for that 'Finder', instead its Relaunch.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/JvrYi.png" alt="enter image description here"  Edit: Its called strongVoice Over/strong  <answer88801> Looks like you have activated VoiceOver mode. To disable either press kbdCmd-F5/kbd or go to System Preferences - Accessibility - Voice Over and turn it off there.
