2007 iMac 24" beach ball at login <body> I just recently installed a Seagate 2 TB internal hard drive and installed Yosemite.  If my WD external drive is connected via firewire during startup, the iMac boots and shows the users, but when I pick a user, all I get is a spinning beach ball.  If the WD external drive is not connected, the login goes smoothly.  If I connect the external drive after being logged in, I can access the external drive just fine.  This WD external drive can only be connected via firewire.  Any ideas?  <comment285135> It could be that your iMac trying to boot from your external HD, and can't, so it gets caught in a loop.
