Is it possible to run Nautilus on OS X? <body> Is it possible to run Nautilus instead of Finder on Mac OS X Snow Leopard? How?  <answer5686> Looks like it's available in MacPorts, so you could install MacPorts and then install Nautilus using that:  precodesudo port install nautilus   /code/pre  You should then be able to run it using the codenautilus/code terminal command.  hr  You may see the following during installation:  precode############################################################################ # Startup items have been generated that will aid in # starting dbus with launchd. They are disabled # by default. Execute the following command to start them, # and to cause them to launch at startup: # # sudo launchctl load -w /Library/LaunchDaemons/org.freedesktop.dbus-system.plist # launchctl load -w /Library/LaunchAgents/org.freedesktop.dbus-session.plist ############################################################################ /code/pre  Running the commands manually should be enough to run codenautilus/code directly after installation (without rebooting).  <answer6004> [EDIT] emWhen I originally wrote this answer, there was another answer and a few comments that dealt with the issue of running Nautilus stronginstead/strong of the Finder: in other words, how to prevent the Finder from running at all. Given that context, my answer as written in its original form clarified and/or provided an alternate method./em  emIt appears that the original author has now removed that answer and the related comments. Without that answer to provide a context, I can understand how my original answer may seem to be coming out of nowhere (hence the downvotes?). I'll try to rework it to provide the necessary context that the deleted answer helped to create./em  While Josh's answer regarding MacPorts addresses how to install codenautilus/code, it doesn't address how to run it "instead of Finder".  In the other answer(s), there seemed to be some confusion about whether it would be possible to prevent the Finder from running.  Unlike an application such as the Dock, the Finder isn't considered a "required" application. For example, if you were to write an AppleScript to the effect of codetell application "Dock" to quit"/codeand then run it, the loginwindow would immediately re-launch the Dock, since it assumes the Dock must always be running. With the Finder, however, as long as you quit it in a way that allows OS X to know that you had a clear intent to do that, the loginwindow won't relaunch it.  To do that, all you need to do is simply tell the Finder to quit rather than trying to kill it. When you kill the Finder forcibly by using the Force-Quit option or by using codekill/code or codekillall/code in Terminal, codeloginwindow/code (or codelaunchd/code for your user account) will immediately try to relaunch it because it saw that it terminated "unexpectedly".  Telling the Finder to quit via an Apple Event won't result in it automatically being relaunched.  An AppleScript like the following could be run at login to quit the Finder:  precodeproperty runningApps : {} property assureQuitMenuItem : true  tell application "System Events" to set runningApps to name of every application process  if (runningApps contains "Finder") then     tell application "Finder" to quit end if  if (assureQuitMenuItem) then     set quitMenuItem to missing value     try         set quitMenuItem to (do shell script "/usr/bin/defaults read com.apple.finder QuitMenuItem")     on error         set quitMenuItem to "0"     end try     if quitMenuItem = "0" then         do shell script "/usr/bin/defaults write com.apple.finder QuitMenuItem 1"     end if end if /code/pre  A saved version of this in application form is at: QuitFinder.zip  (You can open the application in AppleScript Editor to see its contents by dragging the script app icon onto AppleScript Editor's application icon).  <comment6683> Great answer, +1. <comment257409> It tells me `Error: Port nautilus not found`. <comment257506> @BenC.R.Leggiero see https://trac.macports.org on how to get support on MacPorts <comment372204> On OSX 10.12 Sierra it tells `Error: Failed to build gstreamer1-gst-plugins-bad`. <comment372207> Hm, not sure why that is @AnthonyB. This answer is over 6 years old. You might want to look what the build error for `gstreamer1-gst-plugins-bad` was, or better yet, if there's a config option to exclude building those. <comment372209> I posted a comment mainly to inform other users that it may not work on OSX 10.12. I didn't expect an answer to my comment but thanks for that @Josh. It seems gstreamer1-gst-plugins-bad is not maintained anymore. I have an error code `CHILDSTATUS 660 2`. I'll search deeper in order to be able to install nautilus on OSX 10.12.
