How do I move to the beginning of text in a line, not to the beginning of line? <body> I just switched from Windows and I'm giving Xcode a try. It's really nice, but I have an annoyance when coding - I want to be able to quickly move to the beginning of text in a line of text. However, CMD+left arrow go to the beginning of line, leaving me to manually press right arrow until I get to the first letter.  Can I do something to get a similar behaviour as in Windows?  <answer144827> From the online OS X: Keyboard shortcuts page @ http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1343z:  Command+ ▶︎ Move the text insertion point to the end of the current linebr Command+ ◀︎ Move the text insertion point to the beginning of the current linebr Command+ ▼ Move the text insertion point to the end of the documentbr Command+ ▲  Move the text insertion point to the beginning of the documentbr Option+ ▶︎  Move the text insertion point to the end of the next wordbr Option+ ◀︎  Move the text insertion point to the beginning of the previous word    with the ◀︎ icons being the arrow keys on full sized keyboard. Happy typing.   <comment170664> Unfortunately, Command+left moves to the beginning of the line, not the beginning of text in a line. <comment274824> Yes, this just restates the same knowledge the asker already knew without providing any help.
