Can't find/run `configure` script on mac os 10.8 <body> I'm trying to install a program called CSIM (neural micro circuit simulator) and one of the steps is as follows:      Step 2. Run:   codeconfigure;/code codemake;/code for Linux/Unix(/Mac OS)   But I can't run, not even find, the codeconfigure/code script. I've already installed Xcode and command line tools.  Can anybody help me?  <answer72210> That's the typical sequence of build steps for many cross-platform Open Source projects.  The codeconfigure/code command should be part of your downloaded package, so assuming your package is called codeCsimOSS/code you should  ul liopen up your codeTerminal/code/li lichange to the codeCsimOSS/code folder (e.g. codecd/code + dropping the folder into the Terminal window)/li lienter code./configure/code/li /ul  The code.//code in front of codeconfigure/code tells the shell to look for the command in the current directory (which is usually not in the standard search PATHs for security reasons).  <comment83850> I believe my package doesn't got `configure`... I'll try another download first.
