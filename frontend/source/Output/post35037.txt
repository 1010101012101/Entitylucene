How can I switch between the Japanese and English dictionaries on iBooks? <body> For whatever reason, my iBooks dictionary is stuck in Japanese. Even when I read English books, defining a word always causes the app to use the Japanese dictionary. My iPod's language is English, so I have no idea why this might be. Is there any way to switch it to the English dictionary?  <answer110097> Open the Dictionary app, then Preferences, then choose the dictionaries you want. You can even choose the languages to use when searching Wikipedia.  <answer117404> This answer is for iOS 7, maybe 6.  The question might be stale, but the ANSWER (if folks are on iOS7, maybe 6) is this:  ol liLook up a word in iBooks, or in any App that has 'Define' flyouts from text. You'll get to the Definition UI which is in Japaneseâ€¦ if you can't read it go for the button on the lower left./li liAt the bottom of the definitions, you'll see 2 'buttons', from Left to Right: "Manage" and "Search Web". You should see this whenever you get UI to invoke iOS's Dictionary (which is emnot/em an App like it is on OS X)/li liHit "Manage" and now you have a list of Dictionaries that you can enable/disable. AFAIK, enabling and disabling is global, so if you do it in iBooks it'd be the same in TweetBot, etal. /li /ol  To conclude: There's no emdirect/em access to the Dictionary.app in iOS, even in Settings.app. You have to strongdefine a word/strong, and manage dictionaries from there.  <comment129764> You seem to have missed that it is a iPod, not a mac, which us being asked about.
