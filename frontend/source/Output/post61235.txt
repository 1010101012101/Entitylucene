Speeding up switching between multiple desktops (speed up or remove transition) <body>    strongPossible Duplicate:/strongbr   How can I disable animation when switching desktops in Lion?       I am a PC user who switches between many applications and now I use many full screen apps on the Mac (aka multiple desktops) I find the "three finger swipe" animation very distracting.  Actually I've been switching so often between desktops I feel a bit nauseous. (no joke)  I'm sure this effect is exaggerated since I am using a 1680x1050 resolution on a 15 inch Retina display on a Macbook Pro.  My short-term solution is to use windowed mode for now, but I really want to use all my screen real estate.  I think that speeding up the transition animation, or making it act like a "jump cut" would  help a ton.  <answer61281> There's a solution here!  OS X Daily: Speed up Mission Control Animations  EDIT: For the lazy ;): codedefaults write com.apple.dock expose-animation-duration -float 0.1; killall Dock/code  Change 0.1 to 0 to remove the animation entirely.  <comment70720> Does that affect the Dock or the transitions between desktops?  I'll try it out when I get home. Thanks! <comment70743> It only affects the animation for showing and hiding the Mission Control view.
