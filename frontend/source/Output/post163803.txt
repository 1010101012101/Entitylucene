iPhone 5c charger works in wall but not in computers? <body> My second charger did work in my computer and then one day just would not. It still worked in the wall perfectly fine. I wanted to sync it though so I went ahead and bought a new one. It worked in my computer fine until yesterday I was charging it on a computer and it just randomly stopped. I know it's not my computer because it doesn't work on any computer. The charger still works in the wall but it's really frustrating that I can't sync my new music :/  <comment191839> Are you purchasing certified apple cables or cheaper 3rd party non-certified cables?  There is a difference.
