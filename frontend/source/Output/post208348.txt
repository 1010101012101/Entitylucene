Sketch within note app is not available on my Macbook Air 2012 <body> Is there a way to tun sketch on? Because I can't see any icon to start drawing:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MMcbY.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer208573> Here's a screenshot of the new Notes.app from the Apple website. It doesn't have a sketch function, which makes me think that sketch is probably only available in iOS.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/a4ySG.png" alt="What&#39;s new in Notes screenshot"  <comment251576> It is strange, as Mail gained scribbling additions through Preview integration in Yosemite, that Notes does not support them, but for now they are iOS 9 only. You can view them both iCloud and the Mac client, but only create them on iOS 9.
