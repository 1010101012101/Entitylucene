I accidentally "unflagged" gmail messages with Mail.app, is there a log somewhere so that I can restore them? <body> I configured Mail.app to access my gmail account, and I noticed some messages were "flagged".  I didn't realise this meant "starred in gmail", so I unflagged them.  While I was doing it I realised that: I was able to re-flag some of them, but I wasn't so quick to save them all.  Is there a log somewhere, so that I can restore the flag/star to all of them?  (using Mail 6.6-1510 on OSX 10.8)  <answer141783> GMail keeps no such logs, and neither does Mail.app  Unfortunately, you're kind of stuck searching for the messages yourself.  If you read a lot of text-based mail, and want a "buffer" of sorts to prevent yourself from doing this in the future, a command line mail client like Alpine can be configured to only synchronize changes like message flags/folders on a configured interval, rather than immediately on the remote side.  Homebrew has a package for it: codebrew install alpine/code  <comment167076> Given some were more than 10 years old, and I have hundreds of thousands of messages, I'd say they are gone for good :/ I'll leave this open for a while, hoping somehow somebody might have a brilliant idea.
