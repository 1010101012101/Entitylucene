Show all reminders in notification center <body> The Reminders widget for Notifications Center on macOS Sierra only seems to show today's reminders.  I create a lot of reminders that don't always have a deadline or alarm set on them.  How can I show all of these all the time in the notifications center?  <comment335407> You could make your own app with a today widget that accesses the Reminders from the Reminders app and displays all of them; this actually wouldn't be too hard to do. <comment335409> @owlswipe Hey, that's a good idea!  Maybe a Watch extension, too.  I think I might give that a try.... <comment335411> @fsb Thanks :D. You could get fancy and add a way to check-off reminders as well as a shortcut button to create new ones. <comment335412> @owlswipe Um...I'm not that good :-) <comment335454> @owlswipe does apple really provide no way to do this themselves? <comment335490> @theonlygusti I highly doubt they do. Their widgets aren't the most customizable. <comment335512> @owlswipe welp.... *opens xcode*
