How to set up "localhost" document root as Mac's "Sites" folder with MAMP PRO 4? <body> Default MAMP's localhost document root is code/Applications/MAMP/htdocs/code and I want to point it on my code/Users/Me/Sites//code folder.  I can do easily with MAMP PRO GUI but it's not working after I restarted servers and it showing me a red arrow (as an invalid destination):  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/I9QU8.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  I tried some solutions like:  ul liChange default Apache port to code8888/code/li liChange default web user to me/li liDo an alias from MAMP codehtdocs/code folder to codeSites/code folder/li liDo a symbolic link from MAMP codehtdocs/code folder to codeSites/code folder/li liTry to set codeSites/code folder owner (only) to me and group to codeStaff/code (but seems not works)/li liSet "Sites" chmod to code777/code, code755/code and code750/code/li liAdd an codeindex.php/code file inside/li liCreating a new host/li /ul  But MAMP stills don't want of my codeSites/code folder as document root! I tried with websites sub-folders inside codeSites/code or with other Mac's personal folders like codeMusic/code, codePictures/code, codeDownloads/code or my own home and it's working! Only codeDocuments/code or codeDesktop/code folders doesn't works to.  It's seems a permission issue, but I don't know how to resolve it. Does it because codeSites/code folder is used by other Mac apps or service ?  Thanks for help.
