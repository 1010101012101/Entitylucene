Strange IMAP folder <body> I am using an IMAP email account on several OS X and iOS devices.  On one single OS X machine I have a greyed-out Drafts folder with some emstrange/em subfolders:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZJTA2.png" alt="enter image description here"  This is only happening on this particular machine (El Capitan). On other Macs with the same system I see, as expected:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/j6Oag.png" alt="enter image description here"  Is there a way to refresh the IMAP folders?  strongEdit/strong  The subfolders shown by emDrafts/em are not empty: they are a subset of the folders I have on the top level (i.e., Sent Messages).  The option to choose a folder as emDrafts/em is not present:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yTC7M.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer223496> The folders that should not be there are empty, correct? Select the Drafts-Home-Drafts mailbox, in menu point Mailbox, choose "use this mailbox as" and select "Drafts". Do such also for the mailboxes under Drafts-Home that you want gone, i.e. "Drafts-Home-Deleted Messages" to Deleted Messages, and so on. Then do it for "Drafts-Home". Just deleting them might not work.  <comment271073> Thanks: the folders are not empty and the option is not there ...
