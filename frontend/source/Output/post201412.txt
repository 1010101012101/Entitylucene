Thanks!  <answer201414> Go to the Contacts app and tap the little arrow circle in the top left. This will sync your contacts with iCloud and should fix your issues.  <answer201429> You likely have more than one contact "group".  In your case you will want to look two places.  First open the contacts app and note that using the "groups" button in the top left you will be able to 'show' a group that's not showing. That should get back the contacts that are "invisible" now.  Also navigate to 'Settings  Mail, Contacts, Calendars' and look at the "default account" in the Contacts section, which defines which "group" new contacts are stored to.
