It is statiing that my icloud is not verified  <answer150490> You should start with logging into iCloud at https://appleid.apple.com from a computer. Once you're sure your Apple ID is OK, then log in to https://icloud.com to check that iCloud is fine.  Lastly, you can go to settings in the iPhone and make sure the time zone and clock are set to within 4 minutes of the real time. Then try signing into iCloud on the device.
