Kernel_task consuming lots of cpu when macbook is not sleeping <body> I'm using a mid-2013 Macbook Air and it's been shutting down unexpectedly. Initially, to fix that, I reset my PRAM which worked at first, running smoothly for an hour. Then I put it into clamshell mode and returned after 2/3 hours to use the system but now my computer has been running slowly.   The problem started when I had two users logged in at the same time. Activity Monitor shows kernel_task using around 300% CPU which could go up to 1400% sometimes. Fan is at 6500rpm. I have tried all the methods I could find online such as:  ul lirebooting/li liresetting SMC/li liremoving login items/li liremoving launch agents/li liremoving IOPlatformPluginFamily.kext /li /ul  (I did try to remove MacBookAir6_2.plist file too which doesn't seems to be present)  However, none of them worked so far. This CPU usage anomaly only happens when the computer is strongnot sleeping/strong. I checked using iStat, CPU Core PECI temperature is 45°C(is that normal?) &amp; rest of the sensors are at mid 30°C. Some sensors, like Logic Board Top Side, Memory Proximity, T29 Proximity, Trackpad &amp; Wireless Proximity are not providing any info. I do not have any device connected to my MacBook and no application is running.  Thanks.  <comment372391> Can you boot to another OS (even the recovery disk is fine) and try to reproduce the issue?  It's sounding like a hardware issue (logic board) but I don't want to conclude that without trying another operating system first. If it persists then you're looking at a new logic board or, if possible, component level repair on the logic board. <comment372410> Have a look at https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/133001/kernel-task-using-300-cpu-time-high-fan-speed-and-slow-computer-in-macbook-pro?rq=1 & its link. Also https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/264863/security-update-2016-003-10-11-6-issues for a similar chase around with a different cause but potentially same fix. <comment372444> Its fine now but I dont know how long this will keep up. But i unistalled postgresql database. I dont know if thats what was causing the problem. I just deleted it on whim that this was the last software i installed on this machine. And the system seems to be normal for now No, i dont have the ability to get an OS bootup done(atleast not untill next 4/5 days). <comment372496> Now the usb port on right side i.e. the one with microSD reader is dead. I believe SMC is messed up. Cuz hardware test returns these codes: PFM006, PPN001 <comment372498> Found this: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/6078741?tstart=0 could i also have similar issue, i.e. Temprature sensor malfunction?
