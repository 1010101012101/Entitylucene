Search not working in Preview.app <body> Viewing a pdf with Preview, I do kbdcmd/kbdkbdF/kbd to bring up a search box and then enter a word and hit enter.    Basically nothing happens even if it's a word that's obviously present. Sometimes if I smash my hands all over the keyboard and spin around in my chair three times the search suddenly starts working again, but I haven't figured out how to do that trick reliably.  <comment354631> I have the same issue. Seems like the recent Sierra update messed up the Preview.app. It is all over the place. <comment372628> +1 same problem here with 10.12.5 no mention of any fixes in 10.12.6 which is a pending update I have for installing: https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT201222 As an alternative try https://get.adobe.com/uk/reader/
