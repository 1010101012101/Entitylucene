Sublime Text doesn't hide on startup <body> I added Sublime Text to my Login Items, so that it starts up automatically when I start up my Mac. However, even though I have the Hide box checked already, the app still does not hide on startup.  Is there anything else I can try to get it to hide on startup?  <answer170056> Instead of adding Sublime Text to your login items, create an applescript like the one below and add it.  precodetell application "Sublime Text" to run delay 0.5 tell application "Finder"     set visible of process "Sublime Text" to false end tell /code/pre  <comment199883> Okay I'll try that. I'm guessing it runs Sublime Text immediately, then delays for half a second, then hides it. So wouldn't that make it look like ST is "flashing", though? Or, is there a known problem with ST where it will refuse to hide if the hide command is given immediately after the open command? <comment199889> The problem is that can be a delay until the app is visible, so, if you `set visible to false` when it's not visible, it won't work. Maybe you have to adjust to delay value, putting the right value, you won't be able to see the Sublime Text window.
