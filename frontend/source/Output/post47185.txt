Unsupported URL Error on iPod <body> I have an iPod touch 4th generation Jailbroken 5.0.1, and today I started getting this "unsupported URL" error within apps, and on the home screen safari shortcuts. I have noticed that the url's start with "o" so it looks like "ohttp://". I have no idea how to fix this so any help would be great!  <answer47259> Aha! I figured it out with the help of   http://www.iphoneforums.net/forum/iphone-help-15/unsupported-url-after-limera1n-jailbreak-4114/   When I had reset all settings on my iPod to fix my YouTube app, it turned browser changer back on.  <comment54213> Welcome to AskDifferent!
