How to change the default file manager for OSX? <body> I've downloaded muCommander and find it better than Finder. When I open folders with QuickSilver it still uses Finder, though. How do I change this behavior?  <answer77291> According to Apple Tech Note TN2062, you can replace the Finder by telling codelaunchd/code to run something else upon login:     You can change the global codeFinder/code by changing the codeProgram/code property of that plist. However, it is generally preferable to override the system-wide codeFinder/code by placing a modified plist in code/Library/LaunchAgents/code.   Be sure to read the entire thing for warnings. It sounds like a risky idea.  If that doesn't work, QuickSilver might be hard-wired to launch Finder. In that case, you will have to contact its developers and ask them for a new setting.  (Note that things like the File  Open dialog will still use Finder, since that is part of the operating system.)  <answer284047> You cannot change Finder. But you can download a third party file manager and add it to login items: System Preferences - users &amp; groups - login items  <comment89615> That only disables opening Finder at login and reopening it automatically. It doesn't change the default application for opening folders.
