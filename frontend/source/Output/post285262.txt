Mounting via /etc/fstab on OS X, but umount deletes mount point? <body> emThe below is for OS X 10.11.x (El Capitan)/em  I've successfully been able to mount an AFP share (from my NAS) using the commands  precodemkdir /Volumes/V mount -t afp afp://username:password@LANIP/v /Volumes/V /code/pre  Works like a charm.  I can also add this to my /etc/fstab:  precode# device                         mount_point  filesystem  options                     freq  passno afp://username:password@LANIP/v  /Volumes/V   afp         nodev,nosuid,automounted    0     0 /code/pre  So when I issue codemount -a/code, things work as expected.  However, if I unmount, either via codeumount /Volumes/V/code or codediskutil umount /Volumes/V/code, the umount command unmounts (good), and deletes code/Volumes/V/code (bad?).  Then when I try to mount again, I get an error.  Here is an exact set of steps:  precodesh-3.2# mkdir /Volumes/V sh-3.2# mount -a sh-3.2# umount /Volumes/V sh-3.2# mount -a mount: realpath /Volumes/V: No such file or directory sh-3.2#  /code/pre  This seems a bit chicken-and-egg: I can't mount the mount point without creating it, but when I create it and later unmount it (e.g. at shutdown) it blows itself away.  Is there some place I can create code/Volumes/V/code before code/etc/fstab/code is acted upon by automount?  I found this but it refers to code/etc/init.d/code, which doesn't seem to be on Mac OS X (although there is an code/etc/mach_init.d/code which is empty at the moment).  <comment359688> For the directory to be automatically created, you have to use `automount`  See, `man automount` for more details. <comment359691> @Allan, is it a straight call to `automount`?  When I do that, I get the same error.  I'm not sure how to update the `/etc/auto_master`, because looking at it, `/etc/auto_master` looks to call `/etc/fstab`. <comment359693> The minus in front of fstab (`-fstab`) tells it NOT to look in fstab.  You can have direct or indirect mount points specified.  I'm away from my Mac at the moment, so I am doing this all from memory, but have a look at this article:  https://useyourloaf.com/blog/using-the-mac-os-x-automounter/
