"Downloading Additional Components" in loop while installing Mountain Lion using Internet Recovery <body> I changed my Macbook Pro hard drive for a SSD because the other ran out of order. When I do an Internet Recovery install, the status bar on OS X Mountain Lion Install Page (Downloading Additional Components) goes all the way to the end when it says remaining 0 seconds and then the minutes go up again like 18 min remaining but the progress bar is stuck at the end of the bar, like it is in a download loop. I tried again and again and the same thing happens. I tried to format the disk many times. I let the process going for few loops (~5). I have optical fiber connection at home and it takes less than two minutes to boot on recovery mode so it guess it is unlikely that it is still downloading useful things after an hour.  I format the disk with a GPT partition table. It tried with one and two partitions (HFS+, case sensitive or not).  I have a 16GB USB stick but no other Apple product nor Microsoft, so I cannot create a bootable external drive. I have however plenty of computers running on Linux, but I couldn't find any docs on how to do from Linux.
