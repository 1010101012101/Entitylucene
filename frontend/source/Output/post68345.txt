How do I know my last Recently Watched Movies in iTunes? <body> In windows I go to file, and then recent files and it'll show my most recently seen movies or document. How do I do so in iTunes?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/i1I4x.png" alt="enter image description here"  I got these many movies. One of them told me how to convert to objective-c code to use the new object literals. Which movie is the one I last saw?  <answer68346> You can do that using a Smart Playlist:  ol liGo to File  New Smart Playlist…./li liThe settings should resemble this, for your case: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fQiBR.jpg" alt="Smart Playlist"/li liModify whatever settings you wish to modify and click OK./li liThe playlist will appear in the sidebar./li /ol  <comment79335> You can do that with a Smart Playlist. Tell me if that suits you. <comment79337> What is smart playlist? And how do I set that up? <comment79339> Thanks a lot. I'll try this right away. <comment79340> You’re welcome. <comment79341> How do you create such screenshot anyway? <comment79342> Shift + Command + 3. This will bring up crosshairs with which you can select areas. Or you can press space when the crosshairs appear, that will help you capture one window.  And by the way, to convert old code to ObjC literals, You Edit  Refactor  Convert to Modern Objective-C Syntax. :)
