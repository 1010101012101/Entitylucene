Did they remove the number of emails in a folder from the toolbar in Yosemite's Mail.app? <body> Before I upgraded to Yosemite, I used to see the number of unread and total emails in a folder in the title/header bar,  e.g.   strongInbox (23) 64 messages/strong  I no longer see this - is there any way of getting it back?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Wss8b.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer153069> The answer to your question is : No.  Here is a screen of my Yosemite's Mail.app  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FvoR9.png" alt="enter image description here"  Did you tried restarting it ?   <answer159495> It appears to be a bug and has been reported to Apple.  A discussion on the Apple forums mentions this same problem, OS X Yosemite mail stopped showing total inbox message count:     This appears to be a bug. It is triggered when you view a smart folder - once you do, the count in the title bar will disappear until you restart mail.      I filed this as a bug with Apple, so they're aware of it. No ETA for a fix though.   <comment180227> Restarting didn't help, so must be something corrupt with my OS/app/config.  Thanks for confirming.
