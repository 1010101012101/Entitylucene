Adjust formula to add if 2 cells are 0, leave blank <body> I need help adding another rule to my formula, I need it to also say IF U17 and X17 both have 0 in them, then leave blank  Formula Y17 IF(OR(U17="",X17=""),"",IF(X17+V17=U17,"Push", IF(X17+V17U17,W17,T17)))  If two cells have 0, then leave blank and also if two cells are blank to leave blank  Thanks  <answer296485> If I understand what you are trying to accomplish, the formula can be simplified to this:  codeIFERROR(IF(OR(A2,B2),A2+B2,""),"")/code  Since code0/code is resolves to codefalse/code and codeOR/code takes Boolean values, just check for code0/code in both cells and return the empty string.  Otherwise, if both are empty, the codeIFERROR/code will return the empty string as, for some reason, an empty string in Numbers is not treated as a Boolean codefalse/code like in programming languages such as JavaScript.    See the example below.  This will work in Numbers on macOS or iOS.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gxAwu.jpg" alt="Table showing results of formula"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/upZpe.jpg" alt="Formula"
