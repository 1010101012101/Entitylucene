Possible to use a Linux OS as a remote kernel core dump server for macOS? <body> I have a problem with a Mac that is kernel panicking. The system runs macOS 10.12.6 (16G29). I'm trying to get a core dump from it.  From what I understand after reading Apple's TN2118 - Kernel Core Dumps, this typically requires a separate dedicated machine configured to receive these dumps via Ethernet.  I'd rather not dedicate an entire machine for this sole purpose (this is my home) so I'd like to spin up a VM to service this.  I am wondering if anyone knows whether a CentOS or Ubuntu VM might be able to capture these core dumps. I know the service runs on UDP port 1069 but I could not find any info on whether the codekdumpd/code daemon is proprietary or based on something standard.  strongUpdate/strong: I found a bit more information. Apparently, codekdumpd/code is based on tftpd from FreeBSD, with some minor changes.  Also, on pp.1035 of an old book I found called emMac OS X Internals - A Systems Approach (2006)/em, it states:     emIt strongis/strong possible to run kdumpd on a system other than Mac OS X./em   But it does not provide the details to do so. Still, there is hope.
