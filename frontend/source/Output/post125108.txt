Using XQuartz for communicating to the Centos server using local graphical user interface <body> I wonder how to use XQuartz to communicate with the Centos server through a emlocal/em graphical user interface on my Mac? I did the following steps so far, and the result so far is just connect to the server through terminal.    ul liServer side:   ol liInstalled gdm on the server. /li liSwitched run level to 5. /li /ol/li liClient side:    ol liInstalled XQuartz on my Mac OS 10.8. /li liOn Terminal: ssh X root.website.com. /li /ol/li /ul  strongUpdate/strong  After doing what @onik suggested (using the xterm instead of terminal, created a new user other than root, and entered the command gnome-session), I get the following warnings before xterm halts:    img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Q0AhI.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer125112> You don't need to switch to runlevel 5, this only means that the server boots into the GUI, not that it's useable. You can use runlevel 3 and launch remote X sessions.  Furthermore, you'll have to use codexterm/code to start the SSH session, not Terminal.app. If you run XQuartz it should open it by default. Then run codessh -X root.website.com/code to open the session and from this session you can launch the needed applications. If you need the entire desktop, run codegnome-session &amp;/code or your desired VM.  Note that you need to have codeX11Forwarding yes/code in your code/etc/ssh/sshd.conf/code.  <comment146416> This is a bug in at least Ubuntu, you need to set the right permissions to the dbus files under your user's home. SSH to the server and run `sudo chown -R youruser:yourgroup ~/.dbus` and it should be fixed. More details [here](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gconf/+bug/367169). <comment146517> cerated the new user and the problem still exist (updated the question with the list of warnings).
