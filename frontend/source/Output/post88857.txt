Symlink User Folders - Can I keep original Sidebar Icons? <body> I have my user folders (Music, Movies and Pictures) stored on an external drive, so I used terminal to delete the existing user folders on the boot drive then created symlinks to these folders and placed then in my user directory.  They function correctly but when I drag them into the sidebar I can only see folder icons, not the original music, movies and Pictures icons. How can I keep the original icons I'm the sidebar whilst using symlinks to my user directory folders?  <answer91686> I've already posted the solution on a previous question with a similar problem.
