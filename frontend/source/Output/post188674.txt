Clean Install MacBook Pro <body> I have a 13" MacBook Pro that Apple has lent me while my new 15" is being built and I need to restore it to the same condition as the day I received it from Apple. How do I do that?  <answer188676> You can do that by shutting down your computer, then when you turn it on press and hold kbdcommand/kbd+kbdoption/kbd+kbdR/kbd and wait a while (normally about 5 mins)  Once your in Internet Recovery go to codedisk utility/code and format your drive. After you have done that go to codeInstall OS X/code and follow the instructions. This will create an clean install. Once you do that shutdown the computer and then you can give it back to them. Don't do the setup.
