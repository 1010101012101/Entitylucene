Alert me when a certain app/process isn't running <body> Is it easily possible to have some sort of cron job or something run on my Mac that alerts / notifies me when a certain program isn't running?  I use an app last.fm, and since it doesn't run in my dock I don't notice that the process might not be running any more.  <answer180042> I ended up writing a simple applescript and creating a cronjob to run it every 10 minutes.  When Last.fm is not running, this launches it.  when it is running, it does nothing.  AppleScript:  precodetell application "Last.fm" to run /code/pre  Cronjob  precode*/10 * * * * osascript /Users/Jacob/Documents/AppleScripts/LastFMRunning.scpt /code/pre  <comment208275> so you use the Last.fm Scrobbler for Mac  app ? <comment208282> check this out http://stackoverflow.com/q/16064957 <comment208306> @Buscarì›ƒ yup! will check that out - that seems similar, except that the answer i need is in the question, and not vice versa :p
