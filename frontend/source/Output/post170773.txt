Disable a specific app from ever bouncing in dock <body> I want to stop Filezilla from ever bouncing in my dock.  It just keeps bouncing and bouncing and derails from my work.   Is it possible to stop one app from bouncing?  <answer174334> It's all or nothing with the Dock. You have two options: disable bouncing for anything and everything by entering codedefaults write com.apple.dock no-bouncing -bool TRUE; killall Dock/code into a Terminal window, or modify &amp; recompile Filezilla, which is not something anyone would want to do I guess. (A third option would be to get a new FTP client. Honestly, Cyberduck is really good.)  <comment205350> I have been very close to that last option, but I'm hanging in for five more days to see. <comment205705> This would also be very useful to developers who like to write malware. <comment307520> I just wanted to let you know that a few days after this I did switch to Cyberduck, which rules.
