Really? I've got a previous version rather than the current version and that certainly came with bluetooth as part of the standard build. It seems odd they would remove something like that. <comment17528> [o rly](http://www.apple.com/macmini/specs.html)? <comment17529> This answer is absolutely wrong <comment17537> On the Apple Specs page it clearly states "Bluetooth 2.1 + EDR" <comment17570> Bluetooth has been standard since the last of the G4 Minis in late 2005:   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_Mini
