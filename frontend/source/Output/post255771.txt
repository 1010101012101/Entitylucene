Insignia keyboard becomes unrecognized after system returns from sleep <body> I bought a cheap wired keyboard and mouse combo for my girlfriend's Mac Mini because the old hand-me-downs I gave her were starting to fail. The keyboard and mouse work great.  However, when the computer returns from hibernation, the keyboard is completely unresponsive. The only thing that fixes it so far is to unplug the keyboard and plug it back in again. This is obviously not ideal!  Wondering what the cause of this is and if there's a way to fix it. The operating system version is Yosemite 10.10.5.  <comment318672> Is the keyboard plugged directly into the computer or through a USB hub or some other way? How is the mouse plugged in? <comment318673> The keyboard and mouse are plugged directly into the USB ports on the back of the Mac Mini.
