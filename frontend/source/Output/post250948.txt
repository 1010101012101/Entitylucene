Passing osascript via .Net CORE gets syntax error: A unknown token can't go here <body> The following command,  precodeosascript -e 'tell app "terminal" to do script ("idevicesyslog -u UUID | tee 'ios_syslog.txt'")' /code/pre  (where UUID is the hard-coded device id) works fine in Terminal. It opens a new window and runs the script, but when I pass it in via a .Net CORE api call I get the above syntax error.  Even just codeosascript -e 'tell app "terminal" to do script ("idevicesyslog")'/code fails with the same error.  Any thoughts?  <answer251153> WORK AROUND: I solved the issue by putting the above in an Applescript and calling the script from C#. Meant having to add a non .Net file to the project which can only be edited on a Mac (so far as I know). Script is:  precodeon run argv     tell application "terminal"         activate         do script ("idevicesyslog -u " &amp; item of argv &amp; " | tee '" &amp; item 2 of argv &amp; "'")     end tell end run /code/pre  The script was called by using System.Diagnostics.Process and passing in osascript.exe and the two arguments into the ProcessStartInfo constructor.  <comment311826> Try `osascript -e 'tell application "Terminal" to do shell script "..."'` and where you're using single-quotes in `'ios_syslog.txt'` you might have to escape them, e.g. `\'ios_syslog.txt\'` and I can't test because I don't have the same environment as you do. <comment312091> Thanks for the suggestion but that did not help. In the end I used a workaround as shown above <comment312100> The workaround should be an answer not an edit to the question (and if you need no more you could accept it)
