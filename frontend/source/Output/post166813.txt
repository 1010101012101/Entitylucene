iPad battery level doesn't increase when in use while charging <body> When I plug my ipad 3 in to charge while using it, the battery icon shows it is charging but the battery level percentage doesn't change. If it's at 18% when I plug in, it remains at 18% until I put it in standby.  Is this normal, because generally my ipad charges far faster than I can deplete the battery?  <comment195582> iPads need a fair bit more power than standard USB ports are able to dole out. If you are using multiple USB devices, using a hub, or plugging in to the keyboard then you will only get a trickle. To get a full charge you need to use the iPad's suplied wall-wart or else get a powered USB hub than has a higher rated output. <comment195588> It's plugged into a mains charger. <comment195629> is it plugged into specifically an iPad charger? They put out twice the power of a standard phone charger. iPads on a phone charger will switch to 'not charging' top right of the lock screen after a few seconds. <comment195634> If your doing high CPU activities like watching movies while downloading a bunch of music it may not charge while in use
