How to prevent an automatic network share connection at startup? <body> strongProblem Synopsis:/strong I have a WiFi router that can connect to a USB storage device and then allow access to that device over WiFi. I had once connected my Mac (OS X Lion 10.7.4) to such a storage device using the Finder's "Connect to Server" option. I am no longer using that setup but every time I login to my Mac (after a reboot) I get an error message that says:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/sNaYy.png" alt="There was a problem connection to router"  emrouter was the name I gave to my network share drive./em  strongAttempted Fixes:/strong   ol liI have explored my login items but cannot find an item that connects to "router". In fact the only login item I have is for iTunesHelper. This solution was suggested here./li liI have also cleared the list of "Recent Servers" from the Finder's "Connect to Server" menu. /li liI removed the username/password for "router" from my keychain./li /ol  None of these solved the problem and my Mac still shows that message every time I login after a reboot.  strongActual Question:/strong Does anyone know how to disable this automatic connection at startup or remove this particular device from that list?
