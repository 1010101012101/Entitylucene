You should consider getting iOS apps (e.g. Skype, WhatsApp) that relies on WiFi or data plan to communicate.  <answer148970> Call AT&amp;T and have them unlock your phone. You're eligible for this process. Check out this link for more info. You qualify for the normal unlocking procedure, but you may also qualify for the military phone unlock as well. Double up for double power!  Buy a Koren Microsim Card of your choice from a cell service provider.  Use Skype, Facetime, Vyber, Whatsapp, or any of the other apps available on the market to have free international calling/text, as international calls with most providers are prohibitively expensive.   If you have a good data connection, you can send free iMessages to friends who own Apple products internationally.  <comment94210> Which provider are you using in the States? <comment94332> AT&T, I've heard about a SIM card I can put in it if I get unlocked? <comment94333> Well yeah I know but it'll mostly be used for me to text my people here in the US
