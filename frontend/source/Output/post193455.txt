Screensaver does not offer option to use any photos <body> On iMac with Yosemite, my screensaver has lost the option to use photos.  Where there should be an option to select a photos folder there is only a bar "Screen Saver Options" i.e. color, speed etc of the cg saver options which are still available.  If I try to select a photo option e.g. "Photo Mobile" I get an endless rotating color disk.  I have tried reinstalling Yosemite, deleting all screensaver-related plists in preferences and rebuilding iPhoto, with no luck.  Any suggestions?  <answer193461> em[[Note: if you see a spinning "Beachball" it may be that your photo library is quite large so the processor may need time to display everything.
