Web Sharing Can't Start <body> It worked before, and I'm not sure when it stopped working, but I'm unable to start Web Sharing at the moment.  Attempting to start it from the Sharing screen results in "Web Sharing Starting..." immediately followed by "Web Sharing: Off".  I've tried reverting to the httpd.conf in /etc/apache2/original, but the result is the same.  What else could I try?  <answer29663> First, take the time to check your httpd.conf with:  precodesudo apachectl configtest /code/pre  If it's all ok, then try to restart Apach once or twice (look at the log):  precodesudo apachectl start (or restart) /code/pre  It worked for me. If it still doesn't start try finding another default httpd.conf  <answer34942> There are a couple of solutions in the Apple Support Forums. I remember having the same problems and I think the module was the problem.  <answer38078> In code/usr/lib/code there is a file codelibpq.5.3.dylib/code while apache looks for codelibpq.5.dylib/code.  After I copied the file and named it codelibpq.5.dylib/code it worked.  <answer110889> Run this Terminal command to symlink the different versions of libpq:  precodesudo ln -s /usr/lib/libpq.5.3.dylib /usr/lib/libpq.5.dylib /code/pre  <comment34061> The apache logs are in `/var/log/apache2`. If the problem is not solved by @Satreix answer below please have a look at error_log and post any error message you get. <comment37167> The logs should also be easily viewable in `Console.app`. /Applications/Utilities/Console.app
