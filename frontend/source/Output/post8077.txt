Can I access TimeMachine data from a machine other than the one that was being backed up? <body> I have an iMac with a dead internal drive. And I have it's TimeMachine drive. I'd like to know that the TimeMachine-based data is safe and sound so I'd like to restore it to my MBPro. But not emover top/em of my MBPro data.  Is it possible to connect the iMac's TM drive to the MBPro and rebuild my Documents folder in to a random location (not over top of the MBPro's Documents folder) on my MBPro?  <answer8079> You can navigate your backup drive in the Finder.  Mount it, go to the Backup folder  [name of machine]  [name of volume]  latest  Users  [user name] and restore the files you want.  (You can also choose a date instead of latest to restore earlier versions of the files/files that have been deleted.)   <answer8126> You can use the Time Machine UI to restore from the backups of a different Mac by option-clicking the Time Machine icon in your menubar or right-clicking the Time Machine icon in your Dock, and selecting "Browse Other Time Machine Disks".  (See question 17 from the Time Machine FAQ for more details.)  You'll still need to navigate to "Latest" (or an earlier backup) as zevlag describes in his answer if you choose to do this.  If you do elect to use the emcomfort/em of Time Machine to choose what to restore, you'll want to read question 16 from the FAQ: "How can I restore a file/folder to an alternate location?"  <comment8706> TimeMachine would totally miss his target if it wouldn't be possible, don't you think ? <comment8712> Look at that. Very cool. It's all there, safe and sound. Thanks! <comment8714> @Pierre W: Not really. Apple makes no claims the data is stored in a format that'll be accessible piecemeal from any other machine. Thankfully it is.
