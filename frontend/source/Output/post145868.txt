Yosemite Startup Manager After Downgrading to Mavericks <body> I downgraded from Yosemite Public Beta to Mavericks by:   ol liCreated bootable Mavericks USB/li liBooted Mac to the Mavericks USB/li liWent into Disk Utility  Selected HD and Erased HD /li liRestored to Mavericks Time Machine Backup which was successful/li /ol  However, when I boot the Mac and hold option to go to the Startup Manager screen it is still the Yosemite startup manager. Is there any way to revert to the Mavericks Startup manager? The Yosemite Startup Manager is Black background with the disk selections, and the Mavericks is light gray background with the disk selections. Has anyone else seen this?

I was googling a little bit and it is said that the Yosemite automatically updates efi or smc on 2013+ models, which causes the black boot screen and also startup manager having the black background. Is your Mac running OK after the downgrade?
