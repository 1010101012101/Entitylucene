Swimming workout on "original" Apple Watch <body> watchOS 3 introduced a new workout type, swimming. However, this seems to be available only on the new series 2 Apple Watch.   Is there a way to start a swimming workout on the old Apple Watch (not Series 1, the original from 2015)  <answer253312> No.  Also the original Apple Watch is not made for swimming - it probably won't survive it if you take it swimming every week. The water will simply get in and destroy it.  I would advise buying the new watch for this purpose.
