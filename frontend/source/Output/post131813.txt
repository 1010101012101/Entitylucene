Is it possible to make screenshot of a panel window <body> For example I want to make a screenshot of a panel window "Fonts" in Mail. But I can't do it, because panel window is hidden when its parent app is not in foreground and to make screenshot of it, I need to open "Preview" first.  So, is it possible?  <answer131815> Use shortcut kbdcmd/kbd+kbdT/kbd to show the Font window  To take a screenshot using a manual rectangular selection, use kbdcmd/kbd+kbdShift/kbd+kbd4/kbd.  To take a screenshot using an automatic selection, press space as well.
