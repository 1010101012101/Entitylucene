Is there a way to pass keyboard shortcuts from a PC to a Mac while using ultraVNC? <body> At work I normally use a Windows laptop. My group recently bought a Mac mini to start playing with mobile. A monitor was not purchased. Instead it was deemed that we would access the mini with ultraVNC viewer.  This works for most things, but I am a heavy keyboard shortcut person. Trying to use cut and paste shortcuts just jumps my editor all around. It is very frustrating and slows down my productivity. Is there a way when I hit ^-c on my PC, in the viewer that it emulates âŒ˜-C?  <answer51022> Try hitting Windows-C when in the VNC viewer.   <answer51141> You may be able to make use of keyboard combinations by using the ALT or possibly the Windows Key.  Example to Copy: Use ALT C or Windows Key C.  <comment58408> That didn't work for me. <comment58410> You'll have to look around at different VNC viewers to see which have Mac support. <comment58519> Alt C worked.  Not awful since it's about where command would be. <comment72993> That's great! But how about the other modifier keys? How can I emulate the remote Mac's Alt key from a Windows PC?
