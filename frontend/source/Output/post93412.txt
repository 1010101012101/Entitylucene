How to resolve netbios names with osx <body> Hi I'm new to osx and trying to resolve the netbios name of a windows machine. When I try to ping it I get the error cannot resolve hostname. When I use the command smbutil lookup %hostname% it will resolve.   When I ping the ip directly it works fine and this was working on a previous mac which I had to return and replace with my new one. I am able to resolve it from another windows machine on my network.  Essentially I just want to be able to ping my windows machine. Any help would be greatly appreciated.  <answer162642> As you mentioned, codesmbutil lookup/code will resolve the name to an IP address:  precode$ smbutil lookup qx-2000 Got response from 10.0.1.21 IP address of qx-2000: 10.0.1.21 /code/pre  We can extract the IP address from this output:  precode$ smbutil lookup qx-2000 2&gt;&amp;1 | tail -n 1 | cut -d : -f 2  10.0.1.21 /code/pre  Then we can use that in our argument to ping:  precode$ ping $(smbutil lookup qx-2000 2&gt;&amp;1 | tail -n 1 | cut -d : -f 2) PING 10.0.1.21 (10.0.1.21): 56 data bytes 64 bytes from 10.0.1.21: icmp_seq=0 ttl=128 time=4.823 ms 64 bytes from 10.0.1.21: icmp_seq=1 ttl=128 time=7.373 ms 64 bytes from 10.0.1.21: icmp_seq=2 ttl=128 time=4.820 ms ... /code/pre
