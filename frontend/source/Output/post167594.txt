How to add location to iOS calendar, when location doesn't have an address <body> I'm trying to create a calendar event and want to add a location for which there's no address. It's a run in the forest, and in the map application itself I can set the pin at the location I want (start area), but the address it tells is just the nearest. I want to have the location in the calendar to be the exact location, so I can find it in the forrest when I arrive. Is there I way to manually place the pin for the location in the calendar app?  <comment196490> not an answer, but Maps can use longitude,latitude as an address, if you can get that from anywhere e.g. 52.48,1.23456 <comment196668> Well, thanks alot. Actually helps me to get closer to what I wan't. Now it works and show the correct location at the small  map in the calendar. However, when I click it opens up in Google Maps (which is good and what I want to use), but then the longitude, latitude has been changed to another format, to which Google Maps just says no result. <comment196669> Example: If I enter the place 55.768035, 12.383359 in the calendar, it seems to be fine. But when send to Google Maps it tries to locate +55° 46,082', +12° 23,002'. Don't know how to fix this. If I enter the place manually in Google Maps it works fine. <comment196673> I've tried Maps & Google in Safari on Mac & iOS & all return the same road in the middle of nowhere. format preferred is without a space, for ease of copy/paste, but they seem to accept either
