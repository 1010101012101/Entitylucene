How can I mass-move POP emails on an iPhone to an IMAP account? <body> I have an iPhone with a whole lot of emails downloaded via POP from Account A (and they've been deleted from the server). I want to move them all to Account B, which is IMAP (so they'll sync to Account B's server and be safe). What is the best way to do this?  This guide says you can Move All in the iOS mail client, but when I tap Edit, the Move button grays out (probably because this is a POP account). I'm hoping I don't have to select and move them all individually.
