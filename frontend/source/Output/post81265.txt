Error 2009 when restoring iPhone <body> I have a jailbreaked iPhone 4 and I updated from version 5 to v6 in wifi.  The screen shows only the recovery mode, but when I connect it to iTunes, it detects the iPhone but needs to update it.  When I restore it to the last version or to v6 I get a coderestore error 2009/code  I tried with 2 different computers (win7-8) and 2 different cables, but I still get this code2009/code error.  I tried to enter DFU mode with redsnow but it didn't work, as the power button doesn't work, and it showed again the recovery mode.  Any thought ?   <answer280804> You can try entering DFU mode by using the DFU IPSW feature with redsn0w.  From what I understand it will create an IPSW and you can click Shift+Restore in iTunes, point to the IPSW redsn0w made and iTunes will put your device in DFU mode.  From there you can try restoring normally with iTunes.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/VfBf8.png" alt="Redsn0w"
