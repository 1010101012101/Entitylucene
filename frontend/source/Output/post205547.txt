Dollar sign on danish keyboard <body> I'm running a macbook pro on English language, with a danish keyboard (Microsoft Ergonomic 400) - for the life of me I cannot figure out how to get the dollar sign out of it.  I'm used to press AltGr+4 to get it. Now it just gives me the £ sign.  <answer205549> It seems the layout may have been modified.   Try using kbdAltGr/kbd+kbdShift/kbd+kbd3/kbd.

Both the topmost leftmost key and alt shift 3 should give you $, assuming you have your OS X set the Danish input source. <comment247877> Thanks, this one works - I didn't try the combo of altgr+shift, and rest of my programming needs seem to come from that combo for now. <comment247882> Just curious, do you not also get $ with the topmost leftmost key (or if not that, the key to the left of the z)? <comment248099> Damn, apparently the one left of z also gives $, the one left of 1 gives
