Uninstall OpenZFSonOSX on OS 10.10? <body> I installed OpenZFSonOSX even though it is not compatible with OS X 10.10. The zfs commands are not working and make the Mac to restart immediately.  I tried "uninstall-openzfsonosx.sh". It causes a kernel panic either.  <comment246401> 10.10.what? You might be falling foul of the unsigned kext 'protection' from 10.10.0 to 10.10.3 & did you read https://openzfsonosx.org/wiki/Install ? <comment246403> 10.10.5. yes i read it. it was the official release (1.3.1-r2)
