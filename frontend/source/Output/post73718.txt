Is the macbook retina's soldered RAM in any way faster than typical RAM? <body> You would think it would make some kind of difference...  <answer73720> Not really. Access times might be faster by a handful of picoseconds, since the electrical impulses would travel a slightly shorter distance by taking away the circuitry in the socket. However that distance is dwarfed by the variance in placement of the RAM on the logic board â€” sometimes it's closer to the CPU, sometimes farther away.  The predominant factors for speed of RAM are the clock speed and bit width, not the physical layout.  <answer232133> Faster, probably not.  Otherwise the difference is twofold, IMO.    ul liWith no physical RAM slots, they can more closely integrate the components to save on space and make a thinner machine.  /li liFrom a commercial perspective, you have to pay up-front for more RAM, as you cannot add more later on (you have to buy a new computer)./li /ul  <comment85641> It will be interesting if anyone has actually done a measurement to show that this controller is faster or slower than [SO-DIMM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SO-DIMM). I would expect the opposite - no measurable difference with only the CPU/memory controller/cache and RAM speed itself making any difference.
