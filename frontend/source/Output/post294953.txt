can i unlock my iphone 6 with a sim card? <body> Okay, so I recently bought an iPhone 6 that is locked. It's locked to AT&amp;T I believe and I'm pretty sure the fees and bills and whatnot are paid. It had no sim card when I got it so can I buy a sim card that is activated or not, will it "unlock" my phone or set it up as a new device? On the screen it says "Activation Lock" and it's linked to the other person's apple id but I have no sort of contact with that person. Help  <comment372248> Carrier lock and Activation Lock are very different things. You carrier-unlock a phone by contacting the carrier once the phone is paid off, etc. Activation Lock is an Apple security measure that cannot be bypassed without contacting the previous owner. If you paid for that phone but cannot reach the seller, you should look to getting a refund.
