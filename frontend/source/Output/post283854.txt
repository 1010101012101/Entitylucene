Can connect from local to remote but not the other way round? <body> I can connect to a remote server through codessh/code from my mac laptop, i.e.   From local : codessh &lt;user&gt;@&lt;remote IP&gt;/code  is successful.  Now after logging into the remote server, I can't ssh back to my local laptop, i.e.  From server : codessh &lt;user&gt;@&lt;local IP&gt;/code   fails!  Why's so? Am I using a wrong IP? I tried with both local (using codeifconfig | grep inet/code) and public IP (using codecurl ipecho.net/plain ; echo/code). My codeFirewall/code setting is off.  <comment357982> Sounds like you might have some confusion on network addresses. Neither local nor public IPv4 address alone will allow you to reach your laptop; the router providing NAT must know to forward that type of incoming connection to a specific one of its clients. [See these steps.](https://askubuntu.com/q/716184) (The server is either sitting directly on its address or has had port forwarding configured for it.) <comment357983> It's also probably worth mentioning that you have to [enabled `sshd`--distinct from the `ssh` command!--on your Mac](http://stackoverflow.com/q/12369172) in order to SSH into it. <comment358009> @Merlin The first link suggests to provide the port while `ssh`-ing. But couldn't find how to do that from terminal (`ssh -p` didn't work!). Following your second answer, I have turned on `Remote Login` and allowed `All users`. And you didn't tell how to use `sshd`! Is it possible for you write the steps (if not too lengthy) so that other mac users get benefited from this single page? And if the steps can be followed using `terminal` only, it will be wonderful.
