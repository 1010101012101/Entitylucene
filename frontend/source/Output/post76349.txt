iPad mini, reminders doesn't seem to work <body> Reminders app in iPad mini doesn't allow for typing in reminders, and dictation through Siri doesn't work to set reminders either. Also, when the edit button is pressed in the reminders app, it closes.  <comment88609> Could you include some screen shots? That might help me picture exactly what is going on here. I suppose reinstalling the OS might fix the problem. What does Siri reply when you try to set a reminder? <comment92110> is your devise jail broken and what's the firmware version
