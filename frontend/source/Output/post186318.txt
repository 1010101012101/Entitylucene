Scaling different amounts on each axis in Keynote <body> In Keynote it's easy to build an animation wherein you scale or rotate an item uniformly on horizontal and vertical. But is there a way to scale an object only on the vertical axis?  This is on the latest version of Keynote (6.5.3).  <answer186337> I don't think you can do it through the usual Actions applied to the object, but you should be able to get what you want using strongMagic Move/strong.  Get your slide the way you want it, then duplicate it.   In the second copy, scale the object to the new stretched out size (deselect strongConstrain proportions/strong to stretch the vertical axis).   Then click back on your first slide and in the strongAnimate/strong tab, choose strongMagic Move/strong.   When you play your slide and go to the next, it should scale your object to its new vertically stretched size.  <comment219955> Aw jeeze, I wish I'd known about that about three hours ago. :) I'll try that out!
