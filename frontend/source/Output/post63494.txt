Is there a replacement for the Leopard software accentuer on Lion? <body> Back on leopard there was a extremely useful application called "accentuer" which would through a service add all french accents to a given text. I was doing an almost perfect job at it too.  Would anyone know what happened to this application, if it has been ported to OS X Lion or better an alternative?  My queries on google does not return anything suitable for this use.  <answer64958> I have finally found this application; it is now called reacc: http://rali.iro.umontreal.ca/rali/?q=node/1229  This application is brilliant for people like me who write french with  a US keyboard: its almost magic.   Unfortunately it is still not ported to Lion. Pity!
