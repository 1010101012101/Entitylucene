Is the 120 FPS video recording's quality 720P? <body> Is the quality the same as taking a normal video at 30 FPS ?   <answer108876> According to this lengthy review the recording is at 720p.  The specific recording details are:  ul liH.264 codec/li li1280 x 720 resolution/li liMillions of colours/li liAAC, Mono Audio @ 44.100 kHz/li li120.15 FPS/li li29.72 mbits/s/li /ul  This all matches the recording quality of a 'regular' iPhone video @ 30FPS, apart from the data rate which will vary from recording to recording.  Note that the iPhone can record 30 fps @ 1080p, according to the apple tech specs which means that the higher frame rate is at a lower resolution.  <comment128619> I just made an edit there @grgarside, hopefully the answer is clearer now. 120fps recording only at 720p.
