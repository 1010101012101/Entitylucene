How to view all the downloaded podcast episodes on the iPhone? <body> I've noticed on an iPhone I am unable to view all (and only) downloaded podcast episodes. I can connect the phone to a Mac and via iTunes I can see all the downloaded episodes but I am unable to delete any of them...  So my question is how to view all (and only) downloaded podcast episodes on the iPhone?  <answer268229> You can go to codeSettings-&gt;General-&gt;Storage &amp; iCloud Usage-&gt;Manage Storage-&gt;Podcast/code there will show all the podcasts you have downloaded.  <comment296986> I'm not sure, but to make it simpler for me, the way I do it is turn off automatic downloads, have it set so it automatically deletes downloaded podcasts, and then if there's anything I want to keep, I download it and save it, and then it shows up in the Saved tab of a podcast. If you do that, there's your answer. <comment297002> How to access the "saved tab" on an iphone? <comment297037> Podcasts  My Podcasts  choose a podcast  above the list of podcasts, you can choose I played, feed, or Saved. If you downloaded *and* saved a podcast, it'll be in that Saved area. <comment297054> No, I only saw unplayed and feed. There is no saved tab while I have podcast episodes downloaded and saved. All my other settings are identical to yours. <comment297056> Just to check, could you provide me with your current iPhone model and iOS software version? I also don't see a Saved tab unless I have at least one saved podcast episode. In iOS 9, you need to hit the three dots to the right of a podcast episode and press Save Episode. You'll also want to press Download Episode if the option is available. Then it will download and will show up under Saved. <comment297117> Oh I see. I only tapped the cloud to download the episodes. The problem is I want to delete some of them but now I can't since I can't dig through the list to see all the episodes downloaded. <comment355994> That will show podcasts, not podcast *episodes*, which is what the OP is asking about.
