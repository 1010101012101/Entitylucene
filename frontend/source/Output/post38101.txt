My Finder file detail headers looks weird <body> My Finder's file details header looks weird.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NvlB1.png" alt="enter image description here"  It looks translucent and not clickable :( I used many command-line tools on this codeTemp/code folder, so I could be happen from accidental deletion of some system file. But I can't figure out what actually happen in there.  How can I fix this?  <answer38106> You used emView » Arrange By/em or a kbdctrl/kbd+kbd&#x2318;/kbd+kbd[number]/kbd shortcut. It's new in Lion. Remove it by selecting emView » Arrange By » None/em (or pressing kbdctrl/kbd+kbd&#x2318;/kbd+kbd0/kbd).  Hold down kbd&#x2325;/kbd while opening the emView/em menu to get the older emSort By…/em menu, or press kbdctrl/kbd+kbd&#x2325;/kbd+kbd&#x2318;/kbd+kbd[number]/kbd instead.
