Force the resolution on a headless mac mini server <body> I have a Mac Mini server running Mavericks.  It has no monitor connected.  I use Remote Desktop on my laptop (also running Mavericks) for I/O to my server.  When I use Remote Desktop and go Full Screen I get a 1280x1024 screen sitting in my 1680x1050 screen.  Is there any way to force the client (Mac Mini) to use a setting of 1680x1050 so I get a real full screen?  I tried holding down the option key while clicking on Scaled in Display - System preferences.  All I see is a new button in the bottom right that says detect displays.  Clicking on it does nothing.  The only resolution shown is 1280x1024.  My Mac Mini Server is a late 2009 with an Nvidia GeForce 9400 graphics card.  <answer116836> Many people seem to have good luck using the AirDisplay drivers to achieve this. There's also headless dummy adapters you can buy, although that might be overkill. If you're keen to building your own there's a way to do that as well.  More information here.  <answer122244> I'd like to offer an improved answer, that the author may consider for the question. The previous answer's AirDisplay drivers actually messed up my remote client, and left me with 16 virtual displays, all with the same information, where I couldn't click anything. Luckily I know how to navigate Activity Monitor with the Keyboard :-) .   I found the following to work perfectly, assuming that you are using Apple Remote Desktop:  ul liDownload Display Menu (Free on Mac App Store)/li liInstall the app, and for my use cases, 1680x1050 was the proper resolution./li liYour screen will go black and you will be 'locked out', despite the resolution properly switching./li liYour screen will black out. Many recommend something similar to the following Terminal commands. I strongDO NOT recommend the following:/strong     sudo ps auxwww | grep loginwindow | grep -v grep | awk '{print $2}' |   xargs sudo kill -9 /li liThe reason the last line does not work is because it actually terminates your login session. That forces the screen resolution to revert (in my case, back to 1280x1020), and you'll be back where you started./li listrongInstead,/strong use the following command over Apple Remote Desktop or via SSH:      killall ScreensharingAgent /li listrongNOTE/strong - if using Apple Remote Desktop's codeSend Unix Command/code, instead of using codesudo/code, click the radio button to 'Run as User', and just enter coderoot/code./li /ul  This command terminates the Screen Sharing session, which at its core is what Apple Remote Desktop uses. It retains the logged in session, which retains the screen resolution you set with Display Menu in earlier steps.  ul listrong2nd Note/strong - if your dock is screwed up, simply send codekillall dock/code/li /ul  I have yet to log out of my current session on my client machine, so this may only be a temporary fix. However, its the only way I have found that satisfies my OCD with proper screen real estate consumption.  Some things that helped me find this answer:   ol liAlternative to this answer on SuperUser, doesn't accomplish what I wanted, but good to have for reference material/li liMacWorld Hints, which held the elusive answer!/li /ol  Some alternatives that others have presented below, in case this answer does not work for your system:  ol liQuickRes App/li liSwitchRexX/li liResolutionator/li /ol  <answer128712> Here's an alternative, based on CDD's answer that will work for Lion.  The Display Menu application doesn't work on Lion.  ol liGo to System Preferences, Displays, and choose the resolution you want.  Switch to this resolution.  The VNC display will freeze.  Press Return a couple of times to accept the resolution anyway.  You'll see the menu bar getting wider for a moment, but not the VNC windows.  Then it'll auto-revert to how it was.  This step is necessary to allow this resolution to show up in the menu chooser in later steps./li liEnable "Show displays in menu bar"./li liThe display chooser may still not show up in the menu bar for lack of space.  To make space, go to Preferences, Users &amp; Groups, Login Options and disable "Show fast user switching menu".  Disable anything you don't need in the menu bar until there's enough space for the display chooser to show up./li liClose Preferences.  Log in to the same computer using ssh separately.  Choose the desired resolution from the menu bar display chooser, press return a couple of times, and emnow/em you can run codekillall ScreensharingAgent/code from the ssh session.  The VNC window will now resize to the correct resolution./li /ol  This convoluted method has worked for me.  <answer141777> This worked for me. Dummy solutions are easiest. Maybe overkill, but I'm all about easy.   <answer150405> SwitchResX worked for me.  It is a shareware utility that installs itself into System Preferences. From within the panel, it allows you to force the default resolution of an external monitor.  <answer168716> Just downloading Display menu from App Store (free) and choosing highest resolution worked for me on Yosemite. Now running headless with great remote screen resolution. No other actions required.  <answer213256> For its simplicity, I prefer the QuickRes application.  <answer217293> This Finally solved a similar annoying work-related monitor problem of mine. Might help you too. My development-work computer is an iMac sitting on my Baby Grand Piano. But for ergonomic reasons I prefer to work remotely from my old MacBook Pro 17” over home wifi to the iMac using Apple’s screen sharing app. Works fine but theres a niggle. My MacBook screen res. is 1920 x 1200 but the iMac is 1920 x 1080 maximum native. So for remote work my screen real estate is squashed. I get to use only 1080 lines out of the 1200 available on my MacBook Pro, with black letter boxing above and below the video. A waste. To my rescue comes a tiny product: fit-Headless by CompuLab for £21 - sold on Amazon. You plug it into the second monitor video port where it acts as a dummy second display with variable screen resolution options up to 4K. However on receiving it - I plugged it into my VDI port. It appeared in preferences as a second screen. BUT..... woe woe woe .. with all the options of screen res - going all the way up to 4K..... NO BLOODY 1920 x 1200 !!!! W T F !!! Googled around. And came across and downloaded demo of an app called SwitchResX which does all manner of things to do with monitors. It too had tons of resolution options BUT STILL NO 1920 x 1200 !!. BUT..... hidden away was a tab where you can set up your own custom screen res. So added one for 1920x1200. And HEY PRESTO ! for an extra £18 for SwitchResX I can now work remotely on my iMac from my Macbook at the same high resolution as my macbook. No letterboxing. More pixels to poke, drag and mouse around with.. HAPPY DAYS ! [ PS: these fit-Headless adapters are actually intended for people using Mac Mini’s as “headless” servers etc where they administer them remotely and don’t want to have an actual monitor attached. For example because it sits in a rack or on a shelf... ]  <answer219944> Resolutionator worked for me on El Capitan.  <answer233839> Display menu from App Store (free) worked for me too, running OS X 10.10, Yosemite.  I wonder is there a way to force it through command line / conf files. For now Display menu is the way to go for a Mac headless computer.  <answer255158> Use codecscreen/code from Brew. It's free and surprisingly easy.  precodebrew install Caskroom/cask/cscreen cscreen -d 32 -x 1920 -y 1080 -r 60 /code/pre  <comment144008> Unbelievable how difficult Apple can make simple things like setting headless computer VNC resolution, why? I am using only Apple computers, but I totally hate this kind of... I do not know what. <comment146198> Well, to be honest their development time for something like this is better spent getting the new 4K displays to work with the Mac Pro's drivers... I don't really blame them, but it is kind impressive that the Apple Remote Desktop team doesn't support this more natively. Anyways, if this helped more than the selected answer, please up vote it, as I found the AirDisplay drivers to really break my experience, wouldn't want another going down that path. <comment167063> Welcome to Ask Different! While this link may answer the question, it is better to include the essential parts of the answer here and provide the link for reference. Link-only answers can become invalid if the linked page changes. <comment167071> Also, please have a look at http://apple.stackexchange.com/help/behavior, especially the part about self-promotion. <comment175368> Useful tip for planning advance for the screen to go black and not getting locked out: Before changing the resolution with Display Menu, open a terminal window. Type "killall ScreensharingAgent" but do not press return. Make sure that terminal is the frontmost application. Change the resolution with Display Menu. The screen will go black. Press return. The screen will now display as intended without locking you out. <comment179466> Simply using Display Menu worked for me on Yosemite; no terminal commands were required. <comment191727> Will it work with Team Viewer? <comment206553> -1. AirDisplay was not intuitive for me and I somehow ended up with 8 mirrored desktop squares on my Mac Mini. I think it is odd that you post a direct download link in your answer and don't link to a the AirDisplay website or elaborate on how to use it. <comment206559> @cwd, There are no instructions, other than download, unzip and double-click the installer. I direct linked it because it's convenient, although if you want to go through one more step [click here](https://avatron.com/support/downloads/). "-1" all you want, even though I think it's rather silly since you can't figure out how to use something, or don't think it's "intuitive". I've given a couple alternatives as well - which I think might be better anyway. <comment242834> The AirDisplay drivers also did nothing for me. <comment247120> Down votes are for incorrect answers, not answers you don't like. It's down votes on helpful answers that drive helpful people away. This is actually an excellent answer because SwitchResX doesn't black out the menu bar like Display Menu does. This should be the accepted answer for that reason alone. <comment250145> This is the solution that worked for me.  I needed to display at 1440 x 900 HiDPI to optimize my screen use on my client a Retina MacBook Pro.  But both Apple and Display Menu were limiting my resolutions to presumably what made sense for the server, not the client.   SwitchResX solved my problem.  Now connecting to my server from my Macbook in full screen mode is a joy. <comment260097> worked fine on El Cap too. <comment261640> Display Menu is just awesome 2-clock solution for this issue I had on my Mac Mini with 4000x2000px. <comment269758> Not to toot my own horn here, but perhaps my submission could be considered as the proper answer for this question @everett? Commenters to the 'answered' submission claim AirDisplay is no longer working. I just set this up again on a new machine and this process still works. <comment269759> Depending on what OS version you are running, this is a good answer! I apparently tend to use old OS 10 versions on servers, while using 10.9+ on my personal machines. Still pretty frustrating that this is still an issue in 2016... <comment314728> Display menu worked for me: http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/168716/218 <comment322743> Nice.  I didn't have to run any terminal commands or anything.  Just installed Display Menu and changed the resolution just like that!  Perfect! <comment328080> worked fine on sierra <comment330488> For anyone stuck with multiple displays Air Display's uninstaller is in your / Applications / Utilities folder. It's called "Uninstall Air Display." <comment346163> Was using TeamViewer, everything went as expected, no terminal commands were required too! But in my case I was remote and didn't have access to SSH or to the Mac Mini, instead I used: `sleep 10 && killall ScreensharingAgent` right before I set the new resolution, just to make sure! <comment353001> Display Menu works perfectly. It blows my mind that this feature is not standard in OSX or Apple Remote Desktop. <comment358864> doesn't work at all.
