Console.log filled with "stopping Handoff advertising" <body> My console.log is filled with "stopping Handoff advertising" messages, I counted 29 in the last 3 minutes. I also get the occasional:     10/24/14 01:21:35.089 lsuseractivityd[245]: -[LSUserActivityClientProcess doUpdateUserActivityInfo:makeCurrent:completionHandler:], refusing to register user activity from client, and returning error Error Domain=LSContinuityErrorDomain Code=-108 "The operation couldnâ€™t be completed. (LSContinuityErrorDomain error -108.)" for item &lt;__NSConcreteUUID 0x7ffe10c1f0a0 [redacted]-[redacted]-[redacted]-[redacted]-[redacted] NSUserActivityTypeBrowsingWeb (LSUserActivityClientProcess.m #1148)   Is this normal or expected behavior?  Update, from my comment below:     Thanks for the help. Looking at it, my console is emfull/em of all sorts of error logs. I've Googled each and every one of them, and most resulted in the emsame/em threads about Yosemite. At this point, I prefer to wait for 10.10.1 to see what's fixed as my machine is running mostly fine.   <answer152634> Just to make sure do clear your browser's cookies and history.  But with your limited Console log it could be this.     Yosemite is designed to handoff integrated app statuses to other Apple   devices, the "advertising" may simply refer to the fact that my   Yosemite Mac is advertising that there is stuff to handoff to an iOS 8   device, but that functionality is not yet implemented   <answer166726> Here is the answer:   http://asdfsafds.blogspot.com/2014/11/yosemite-log-shows-sharingd-stopping.html  Preferences General Uncheck "Allow Handoff between this Mac and your iCloud devices"  <comment179650> could you expand your Console log please. <comment179654> Thanks for the help. Looking at it, my console is *full* of all sorts of error logs. I've Googled each and every one of them, and most resulted in the *same* threads about Yosemite. At this point, I prefer to wait for 10.10.1 to see what's fixed as my machine is running mostly fine.
