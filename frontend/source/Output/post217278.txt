Force screensaver slideshow to desynchronize images when using multiple displays <body> This has been asked previously [1], but the question may not have been precise enough. Respondents didn't understand the problem.  All of the versions of OS X that I've used could display photos in a screensaver slideshow. Prior to Lion/Mountain Lion if multiple monitors were available, and mirroring was disabled, a different image would show on each display.  Sometime in the past few releases the screensaver slideshow changed (Lion? Mountain Lion?). Since then when I start a slideshow I sometimes get different images, but sometimes I get a synchronized image -- one after the another images match. NOT what I want. Very annoying. I have this on Yosemite and I'm told El Capitan is no better.  After anywhere from 5 to 60 minutes the images will often desynchronize, so I see different images. Behavior is the same whether sharing from a photo Library (photos.app, iPhoto, Aperture) or a folder of images.  Given the unpredictable behavior I assume this is a bug, but I'm told it's unfixed in El Capitan.  Has anyone found a way to force desynchronization so each display has a different image? I've tried toggling shuffle, rapidly engaging and removing the screensaver, rebuilding Aperture Library, removing slideshow/screensaver files from Library etc. [2]  Some hints for further research:  defaults -currentHost read com.apple.screensaver {     CleanExit = YES;     PrefsVersion = 100;     idleTime = 60;     moduleDict =     {         moduleName = iLifeSlideshows;         path = "/System/Library/Frameworks/ScreenSaver.framework/Resources/iLifeSlideshows.saver";         type = 0;     }; }  Most recently I found  /System/Library/Frameworks/ScreenSaver.framework/Versions/A/Resources/ScreenSaverEngine.app  I created an alias for ScreenSaverEngine on my desktop and found I could start the Slideshow by double clicking it. I got desynchronized unique images on two consecutive tries launching this way. (Might be chance.)  Anyone find a workaround for this bug?
