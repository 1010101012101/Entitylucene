Notes.app is blank <body> I'm having a very weird problem. I'm not sure when it started happening or what I did but I cannot seem to fix it. When I open up my Notes app, its entirely blank. If I attempt to create a note and start typing, it just beeps at me.  When I open the console, this is what I get:     11/24/14 11:14:34.146 AM com.apple.xpc.launchd[1]:   (com.apple.imfoundation.IMRemoteURLConnectionAgent) The   _DirtyJetsamMemoryLimit key is not available on this platform.      11/24/14 11:14:34.000 AM kernel[0]: Sandbox: TextEdit(550) deny   mach-lookup com.apple.webinspector      11/24/14 11:14:34.403 AM Notes[2917]: strong* WebKit discarded an uncaught   exception in the webView:didFinishLoadForFrame: delegate:    */strong -[__NSPlaceholderArray   initWithObjects:count:]: attempt to insert nil object from objects[0]   If I search a note through spotlight, I can open it, but the window with all the other notes still doesn't work.   I verified that all my notes are still there with the following command:  precodecd ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.Notes/Data/Library/Notes; strings NotesV3.storedata | grep body | open -f /code/pre  Any ideas what this is or how I can fix it?  <comment185803> Have you looked at the directory using either ls command or the GUI? If so were there 3 files in it? <comment185805> Is your iCloud hogging them ? and did you repair the permissions?
