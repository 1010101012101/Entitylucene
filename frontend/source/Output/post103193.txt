How do I drill in to calendar information from the notifications screen on iOS7? <body> Lock screen- pull down notifications, see "Tomorrow, there are 2 events scheduled and the first one starts at 11.30"  but how do I view them?  No amount of poking or swiping will open this up (unlike say weather information)  Is this a bug or is there some buried setting I don't have set?  Yeah yeah, I could unlock the phone and go to the calendar but it sort of defeats the object.  <answer104271> There’s no way to view tomorrow’s events from the Today view. If you’d like to be able to do that, you should file an enhancement request.
