Right clicking on hyperlink in chrome always behaves like left click (/open) <body> Although right click in chrome is emgenerally/em working - as shown in screenshot - it does emnot/em (with any kind of reliability at least..) on links.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bzrmz.png" alt="enter image description here"  Instead when right clicking on a link it just opens .. the same behavior as left clicking.  I really want the context menu to come up instead - in particular to use the codeSave As/code option.  <answer242744> Found a workaround:  codeDisable the Chrome PDF Viewer plugin/code  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/esc35.png" alt="enter image description here"  Now this is not a emperfect/em solution - since it would be convenient to allow that plugin to run .. but I'll take it. This is a time savings.
