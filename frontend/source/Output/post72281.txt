Is there a Firefox Task Manager? <body> strongThe previous question provides answers for Windows and other addons are for older versions of FF, or do not answer the question.   This is a specific question for OSX./strong  Chrome has a built in task manager under "Tools" to look at the process within Chrome, extremely beneficial in locating a stuck page.   What is the similar feature in firefox?  I need to identify what is causing it to run slowly, and the addons they suggested dont work for OSX or are outdated, and Chrome's about:memory isn't recognizing FF  FF Version code17.0/code, OSX version code10.8.2 Build 12C3006/code  How to get to Task Manager: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/a727y.png" alt="where to access task manager"  Task Manager: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3HATn.png" alt="task manager for chrome"  strongTHIS IS NOT A DUPLICATE OF:/strong     strongPossible Duplicate:/strongbr   “Task Manager” addon for Firefox?     <comment83931> I don't know for sure whether something like this exists or not, but I suspect it may not be possible, due to the way Firefox is architected. Chrome uses a separate process for each tab, which makes it fairly easy to see on a per-tab basis what's using CPU and RAM. Firefox has a single process for the entire browser, which makes getting specific per-tab information much more difficult. <comment83952> yes, per tab is likely not possible,  but is there not a way to identify the rogue code/script/addon, similar to the network portion of the debugger?
