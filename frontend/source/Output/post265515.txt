iCloud bluetooth based wifi tethering stopped working <body> For about a year or so, my iPhone 6+ and 6S+ could be commanded to tether to my MacBook Pro by simply selecting it from the special devices list under the Wifi menu.   In the past few months, this has stopped working.   I have tried to log out and back in to iCloud on both devices, but alas the functionality has not returned. I must go back to the iPhone's settings/hotspot menu in order to produce the hotspot in the main SSID list to join. Not only this, but I have to keep the phone unlocked for the duration that I find it inside the list. Furthermore, before, I could leave the mobile hotspot slider in the OFF position so my phone wouldn't ever need to be broadcasting its Wifi tethering SSID, and it would still work flawlessly.   Although this only takes a few seconds, it is still a great inconvenience when on the bus compared to being able to leave my phone in my pocket.  So I'm hoping for some instructions to help me try to get this brilliant functionality back. However since it only saves me maybe 20 seconds on a once-a-week basis at best, I cannot justify a solution that takes more than 20 or 30 minutes to troubleshoot...  <comment334028> The functionality magically started working again, and I did not have to update my laptop to Sierra. This may have coincided with the upgrade on my iOS devices to iOS 10.2, though. Or possibly with the latest "security update" for OS X 10.11.6. I guess this question may remain a mystery. I hope it stays working. Doesn't look like I will upgrade to Sierra soon because it might break this.
