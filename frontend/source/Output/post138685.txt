Outlook 2011 won't close in Macbook Air <body> Outlook 2011 has frozen in the middle of moving an email and won't close. How can I close it?  <answer138690> There are multiple ways to Force Quit a application.  The following is probably easiest.  Bring Up the “Force Quit Applications” Window  Hit kbdcmd/kbd+kbdOption/kbd+kbdEsc/kbd to bring up the “Force Quit Applications” window, then click to select the app name, followed by clicking the “Force Quit” button to end the app immediately.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zfQdJ.jpg" alt="force quit"  Or, you could use the Activity Monitor to Force Quit application.  subPS, it is also a quick way to see what apps are running/sub :)  <comment163623> beside force quit, are you trying to fix outlook ?
