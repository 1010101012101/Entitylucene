0% Battery, and not charging again <body> My battery died last night, and since then the MacBook Pro (2012) is not charging. Any ideas (except for take it to an Apple store, which I cannot for a couple of hours)?  <comment233749> Is there any stuck pins/dirt/debris in the MagSafe connector port? <comment233753> Did you reset the SMC ? Magsafe is a dirt collector (due to the magnets) You can use it without battery, but it will be slower.
