Double Apple ID <body> My iPhone 4s was recently stolen and I immediately changed my Apple ID password. Now I have an iPhone 5 and even though at first they asked for my regular Apple ID to restore backup, after then another Apple Id appear and I don't recognized it at all. When I want to download an app, the Apps store asks me for both Apple ID accounts.   <answer262836> The question is little unclear.br However, if you want to get rid of Unknown Apple ID, sign out of iTunes &amp; App Stores and iCloud from your phone:br Go to codeSettings &gt; iTunes &amp; App Stores/codebr Tap the very first codeApple ID: abc@example.com/codebr codeSign Out/codebr Similarly, in order to sign Out from iCloud.br Go to codeSettings &gt; iCloud/codebr Select codeSign Out/code which is at very last.br And now try logging back in using your APPLE ID.
