How to repair and/or reinstall Homebrew safely? <body> I am trying to repair Homebrew.  I recently tried to reinstall it but when I typed "brew doctor"  My output was:  precodeshell-init: error retrieving current directory: getcwd: cannot access parent directories: No such file or directory chdir: error retrieving current directory: getcwd: cannot access parent directories: No such file or directory chdir: error retrieving current directory: getcwd: cannot access parent directories: No such file or directory The current working directory doesn't exist, cannot proceed. /code/pre  I have tried to re-install it by typing this into the command line again:  precoderuby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)" /code/pre  But my output is:  precodeIt appears Homebrew is already installed. If your intent is to reinstall you should do the following before running this installer again: rm -rf /usr/local/Cellar /usr/local/.git &amp;&amp; brew cleanup /code/pre  How can I fix my Homebrew install?  Thank you.  <answer171792> Why don't you do what it says?  precoderm -rf /usr/local/Cellar /usr/local/.git &amp;&amp; brew cleanup ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)" /code/pre  The first line is going to delete homebrew completely and then you should be able to reinstall it.  NOTE: If you do this you'll have to reinstall all the things you installed via homebrew.  <answer274613> This happened to me because I had two tabs open in my console. In Console A I removed the current working directory of Console B. Then, without thinking about it, I ran codebrew upgrade/code in Console B. Of course it threw the above error.  Simple solution: just codecd/code to a different directory in Console B and codebrew upgrade/code again.  Me and my infinite wisdom.  <comment202163> Why don't you read your output? It will explain pretty well. <comment202210> Thank you. For some reason when I did "brew install php54 --with-fpm  --with-imap  --without-apache --with-debug" it was giving me the first output error from my post. When I tried using "ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"" it gave me the second output error. Restarting my computer and doing what you told me to do really helped. Thank you! <comment265912> As of today, I have the same problem described in the original post. I have a feeling this started right after upgrading OS X to 10.11.2 via the App Store. No matter which parametres are passed to brew, be it 'doctor', 'cleanup' etc., all produce the same output. At least the instruction "brew cleanup" can therefore not be followed. May this have been caused by OS X's SIP? Does anyone have any other ideas? <comment265913> Welcome to Ask Different. there are two options - you could ask a follow on question showing the results of the `rm ` command or we can vote up / promote this with edits. Also - you could ask - how can I tell if SIP is affecting a specific task. that is answerable and seems a little past the scope of this question so I've be happy to answer that for you elsewhere. The answer is almost surely "no" in homebrew's case. <comment295459> If using rvm it fails with some "image not found" ruby error; make sure to use sys ruby: `/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"`
