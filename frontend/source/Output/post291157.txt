Change Case to Title Case Exceptions in AppleScript or Automator Workflow <body> I am looking for a script I could use in place of strongAutomator's/strong built-in workflow:  ul listrongRename Finder Items/strong  strongChange Case/strong  strongTitle Case/strong/li /ul  Generally speaking, this works fine, but there isn't an options to add exceptions, manually or otherwise.  These exceptions really fall into two categories.  First, we have words, names, acronyms, and so on, which should emalways/em be written in CAPS: such as strongemCD/em/strong or strongemDVD/em/strong.  Second, are those words, compound-words, phrases, etc which are meant to be rendered in a combination of upper and lower case: think strongemBluRay/em/strong, strongemmacOS/em/strong, strongemAppleScript/em/strong, or strongemLaTeX/em/strong for example.  I often use other software such as strongTypinator/strong, which not only contains entire dictionaries that include capitalised proper-nouns and acronyms, but also built-in support for scripting, and even exceptions for capitalisation as well.  I currently use an strongAutomator/strong strongService/strong to rename files and folders in the Finder to Title Case.  strongQuestion:/strong How might one script a workflow to pass over items with the kind of exceptions described? Ideally the workflow would still process the rest of the words in those files, and ignore expressions that are either manually listed within the script, or that appear in a secondary document, such as a dictionary file listing words such as the above examples.  I tried to do my homework in search of a solution.  But Typinator seems like a dead-end.  While it is an impressive productivity tool with built-in scripting, AppleScript integrations, and extensibility through extras and add-ons â€”these are for expanding text as it is typed, not title-casing files and folders after-the-fact. So I tried consulting other questions here at strongAskDifferent/strong, as well as strongStackOverflow/strong.  I looked at some other AppleScript websites and into possibilities involving some other utilities I have purchased (strongHazel/strong, strongKeyboard Maestro/strong and strongFastScripts/strong).  The first I have a fair amount of experience with, but not the others.  Thoughts anyone?
