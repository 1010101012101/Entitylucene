Why do I have to source ~/.bash_login every time I open Terminal <body> When ever I close and open Terminal.app, it never loads my ~/.bash_profile. I have my RVM setup at the top of the file but it never loads it.   As you can see, when I type codervm/code into Terminal, it says codecommand not found/code this is a pain as I have to run codesource ~/.bash_login/code every time I open Terminal.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/esUZ2.png" alt="rvm command not found"  Am I the only one with this problem? What am I doing wrong?  <answer21847> Does it have to be code.bash_login/code? Try renaming it to code.profile/code.  <answer21848> Bash only reads the code.bash_login/code file if it's started as a login shell (was passed the code--login/code flag). Try renaming it to code.bashrc/code instead, which is evaluated when codebash/code was invoked as an interactive shell without the code--login/code flag.  <answer22110> Make sure your .bash_login script doesn't contain relative paths like  source .profile  Change to  source ~/.profile  Lion changes the directory to your current tab or where your last session is, so all paths have to be absolute now.  <answer24361> Changing .bashrc from  precodesource .bash_profile /code/pre  to  precodesource ~/.bash_profile /code/pre  did the trick for me.  <answer42656> For me bash in Lion does not load ~/.profile either.  Adding codesource ~/.profile/code command to run at startup in shell preferences helped, but is quite unelegant.  <comment24057> I have tried .bashrc but it does the same <comment24058> Or `.bash_profile` - which works <comment24059> Looks like renaming to `.profile` worked. Thanks <comment24522> Out of curiosity, what does your Terminal preferences window, under the 'Startup' tab look like? <comment24525> They show this:  http://i.qyk.in/loD8A.png <comment24543> Strange, considering the bash man page:  `When bash is invoked as an interactive login shell, or as a non-interactive shell with the --login option, it first reads and executes commands from the file /etc/profile, if that file exists.  After reading that file, it looks for ~/.bash_profile, ~/.bash_login, and ~/.profile, in that order, and reads and executes commands from the first one that exists and is readable.  The --noprofile option may be used when the shell is started to inhibit this behavior.` And that /usr/bin/login setting is self-explanatory... <comment25061> Prior to Lion, Terminal creates login shells unless you provide a custom command in **Preferences  Startup** or **Preferences  Settings  [profile]  Shell**. As of Mac OS X Lion 10.7, Terminal always creates login shells, even for custom commands, if they're listed in /etc/shells. <comment25062> "it never loads my ~/.bash_profile" "I have to run `source ~/.bash_login`" Which is it? Are you using ~/.bash_profile or ~/.bash_login? Only one of them will be run. <comment25064> This is very surprising. ~/.bash_login should work just as well as ~/.bash_profile. It works for me. You can put an `echo .bash_login` at the start of ~/.bash_login to see whether it gets run. Of course, it won't be run if you also have ~/.bash_profile. <comment27460> I recommend going the other direction: Have ~/.bash_profile source ~/.bashrc. Put all the stuff you want to be common to login and non-login shells into ~/.bashrc. ~/.bash_profile should only contain configuration commands for login shells. <comment49154> Check your preferences to ensure you havenâ€™t done something to suppress the creation of a login shell. Is anything in **Terminal  Preferences  Settings  [profile]  Shell  Startup** or **Terminal  Preferences  Startup  Shells open with** customized?
