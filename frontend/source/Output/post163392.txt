Why does updating Garageband 6.0.5 to 10 cost money? <body> I have Garageband 6.0.5. Why does updating to Garageband 10 (next version, don't get fooled by numbers) cost money? I thought updates were free!  <answer163398> When you bought garageband 6, you cannot update to the new version because it was released as a new program, not an update.  <comment191308> Oh... I never knew that.
