Enable touch indicatior for iOS app demo video recording <body> I would like to record a demo video of an iOS app with QuickTime on Yosemite. (I found this tutorial) Is it possible to enable a tap indicator, like a small circle, for touch events so users can easily spot where the author tapped?    <answer203050> The touch events don't get captured on iOS 9 and lower, so you'll need to either set up a camera to capture the taps and present that side by side with the detailed capture or use it to overlay the taps in post production.  This is such a great idea, that I've filed a bug report to officially ask Apple to support this.   ul lihttp://openradar.appspot.com/22538143/li /ul  <answer250290> You can do it creating your own tap gesture through Settings  General  Accessibility  AssistiveTouch  CreateNewGesture as it is explained in the following link: record-iphone-ios-screen-showing-touches-tap-signs   Then, select the gesture as a favourite before recording the movie with QuickTime player.  <answer256410> If you want to demo your own applications (i.e. where you have the actual source code and can make a special demo build), then the best way is to add a helper to your Xcode project, such as https://github.com/toddreed/Touchpose or https://github.com/mapbox/Fingertips. Both overlay your touches with a (customizable) fingerprint indicator when connected to an external mirror (such as when using AirPlay or Quicktime to record).  <comment280477> I'm using iOS 9.2 and OS X 10 - I don't see the touch events when I record my iPhone demos. You said "don't get captured on iOS 9 and lower" but both my OS's are up to date. What did you mean? <comment308379> He is just making this post future proof :) <comment310736> Welcome to Ask Different! Please refrain from providing primarily 'link' answers.
