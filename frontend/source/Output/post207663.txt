How to delete App Documents and Data? <body> Some apps like Whatsapp, Twitter and Instagram end up storing a lot of Documents and Data, way more than their actual size. Is there a way to remove them, just the Documents and Data?  <answer207668> Actually, most of that dad is cache. Twitter and Instagram cache images, tweets, posts, etc. from the Internet. There is currently no easy way to remove them, however, you can send feedback to Apple here, and tell them you want a way to delete app cache.  You can restore from iTunes to remove it, as it's not backed up. If you run out of space on your device, iOS will automatically remove the cache.  <comment250571> Why do I have to send feedback to Apple for this feature? Isn't it supposed to be inbuilt? And I often hit the wall with no space on my phone, but I never see cache of the Apps being deleted, it's just increasing.
