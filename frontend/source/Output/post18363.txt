Is it possible to do a "clean" install of Lion? <body> Is it possible to take a Lion install burned by the method outlined in this question and preform a clean install with it?  I just want to make sure that if I buy Lion from the App Store in the near future that when the mood strikes me I will be able to reformat and install Lion without some previous install of Snow Leopard.  <answer18364> Yes, it is possible. It is bootable, and will be able to do a complete clean install (with you having to format the hard disk first).  Also, if you have installed Lion already, you would be able to do a reinstall by holding kbd‚å• Option/kbd on bootup and selecting Recovery HD. Wait for it to load, and you will be able to see an option for reinstalling.  <answer20940> Yes - Apple have published a very nice how to install lion that goes over the steps to install it internally as well as on a second drive.  http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4718  <comment20057> leopard or lion? <comment20058> @bckbck, lion, sorry I got distract while writing the question, just fixed it. <comment20066> But note that the Recovery HD reinstall will download Lion from Apple again -- the recovery partition isn't big enough to contain a complete install of Lion. <comment20090> Thanks for the answer, I figured as much but just wanted to sure. <comment20376> Just to note - I did a clean install on my mid-2007 Macbook and it worked perfectly. There was one issue - it inexplicably failed mid-install and restarted to a circle with a slash through it. Subsequent installation attempts failed, until I reset the PRAM. <comment32786> Will doing a re-install using the Recovery HD perform a *clean* install (IE: throw away user files + settings)? If not, what is the recommended way to do this?
