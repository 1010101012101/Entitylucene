FaceTime call from Mac to iPhone 4S over 3G doesn't connect <body> I tried to FaceTime my brother (who is using an iPhone 4s) from my MacBook Pro using the FaceTime app. The iPhone is on a 3G network, the MacBook is on my own Wi-Fi network.    The FaceTime app doesn't say that the iPhone is unavailable; it just keeps trying to connect, but the iPhone doesn't ring or do anything.  What might be the problem?  <answer75073> Has your brother updated his phone to iOS 6?  If he has a jailbroken iPhone on iOS 5, he can use this.  And if you're in the US, this might help. To bypass all of this, just have him go on Wi-fi.  <answer76118> I have the same problem. I assume that your brother's iPhone is on iOS 6 (which officially comes with the cellular FaceTime feature) and uses AT&amp;T (which blocks this feature). I've heard someone say AT&amp;T might start letting all iPhones use cellular FaceTime, but I believe the official word is that cellular FaceTime only works with AT&amp;T if you have a Mobile Share plan or if you have an iPhone 5. Meanwhile you'll have to call him with Skype or Google Hangout, or he'll have to go to WiFi.  <comment87285> Welcome to Ask Different! While having links is nice, could you maybe summarize the most important parts of the links here, on-site, instead of just pointing users somewhere else? That'd be extremely helpful.
