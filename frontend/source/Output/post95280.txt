How do I import an MP4 video created using the GoPro Hero Camera into the iPad? <body> I have recorded some videos using the GoPro Hero Camera set at 960p resolution and 48 frames per second. These videos come out in MP4 format and I an play them on my computer (PC) just fine. However when I try to import them into iTunes and sync with the iPad 4 it says that the video is not in the correct format and can't be played. This is surprising because I was able to do this before on an iPad 2 with no problems. How can I fix this?  <answer95281> From Apple iPad 4 tech spec:     MPEGâ€‘4 video up to 2.5 Mbps, 640 by 480 pixels, 30 frames per second   So based on that info, FPS and resolution for mp4 are too high. Use Handbrake and convert to H.264 that supports HD on iPad.  Otherwise you can try Azul media player for iPad that can play almost all formats.  <answer128220> I had the same problem. So i changed my settings to 30 frames per second and it solved the problem. I can now view my go pro vids on ipad. I use the 1080 resolution, by the way, but i dont think youll have a problem using 960. Good luck!  <answer131896> I had the same problem and just found the answer, set your GoPro to NTSC instead of PAL. Fixed it instantly.  <answer137280> Importing the MP4 files to another iPhone app (not the default Videos app but say the VLC player app for iOS). Here's an example of how it works: How to transfer GoPro videos to iPad or iPhone  <comment154991> NTSC is specifically for USA.
