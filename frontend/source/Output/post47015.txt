What sets the language of iCal invitations? <body> I am using Mac OS X 10.6 configured for English. I am using iCloud configured for English. Why are iCal invitations sent in German?  <answer94205> Go to appleid.apple.com and set the preferred language for your account.   strongiCloud/strong calendar invitations will use that language.  <comment110612> You are right. It was set to German. Now I guess the correct question is: _why_ was it set to German???
