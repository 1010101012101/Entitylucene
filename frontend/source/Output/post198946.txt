My laptop got cleaned but now there is a different password, but I don't know it. How do I change it? <body> My laptop got cleaned (MacBook Pro OSX Yosemite, vesion 10.10) just before the summer (2015) and I came back after my holiday and picked it up. I opened my laptop and it logged in automatically, but I logged off and the password is different. I can log in if I click the picture in the opening screen but if I want to add a user on the computer it won't let me because I need to type my password in. strongWhich I don't know!!!/strong If you know how to fix this please please help!!!!   <answer198951> strongHow to reset a forgotten password:/strong  ol liShutdown and then boot to the strongRecovery HD/strong by pressing kbdCommand âŒ˜/kbdkbdR/kbd upon startup./li liGo to the strongUtilites/strong menu and select strongTerminal/strong then type coderesetpassword/code and press Enter./li liUse the strongReset Password/strong app to reset the users password./li liGo to the strongApple Menu/strong and click strongRestart/strong.  ul liHave a look at: Reset Forgotten Admin Password OSX 10.10 Yosemite/li /ul/li /ol  <comment238229> What do you mean by cleaned - whoelse had admin passwords? <comment238231> You need to go back to whoever "Cleaned" it and ask what they did.
