Why are tag contents disappearing from open file dialog? <body> I use tags rather extensively, and usually have the tags on top of my favorites in the sidebar.  For a while now, I've seen a problem when opening documents in some applications (for example, Excel and Numbers): the tags emdo/em show up in the open dialog window, but when I click on one, the contents flash briefly and then disappear. As far as I can tell, this only occurs with the open file dialog, not the save as (or, say, the move to dialog).   Any ideas of what would cause this, and how to fix it?  The only thing I've tried so far is to remove the com.apple.finder.plist file in ~/Library/Preferences. This didn't solve the problem.
