What application can record a cursor location and multi-touch input heatmap? <body> Are there any applications out there that can record mouse interaction, and save a standard imagesup1/sup that adequately conveys the exact situation that using the mouse created?  Due to the proliferation of gestures in Lion, I would like to include an image conveying exactly what I do in bug reports. Take for example my question regarding Chrome's use of Two-finger forward/back gestures. I would love to attach an image that conveys my exact touch pad usage (and a standard mouse could be beneficial too in other cases) when filing a bug report regarding my gesture grievance.  hr  sup1/sup Where standard image file is something like an animated gif, or perhaps an annotated jpg/png with indicators of finger number, and stroke direction.  <answer22615> I don't know of an app that displays gestures, but FingerMgmt displays the locations of your touches (and the size, dimension, etc.) in a window. You could record that to attach to your bug reports.  <comment24536> With different color overlays for different finger gestures, YES PLEASE!! <comment26093> Nice application, I could couple that with screen recording software to make a very sophisticated Bug Report. I'd still love something that does the recording and exporting for me.
