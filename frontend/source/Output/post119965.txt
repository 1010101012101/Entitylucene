Magic trackpad keeps returning to 'Slow' in tracking speed <body> Apple's trackpad keeps returning to emSlow/em as it's tracking speed.   I have tried everything to correct this problem. What could be causing this behaviour?  <answer168906> I have the same issue with Yosemite... it is not associated with power off. i.e. it happens when machine has not been powered off. It doesn't happen if machine sleeps. i.e. a sleep test retains the fast settings. But it regularly drops the speed setting.... Keeps all others correct though. Battery fine. OS X up to date. Annoying really. So no help I'm afraid, but a little more info for anyone that can suggest something to do.  <comment139932> Consider elaborating on what you've already tried as this may help others diagnose your problem. <comment139939> Considering you've tried **everything** there's nothing left you can do... But I seriously doubt it!
