USB devices are greyed out in VirtualBox <body> I'm running Windows XP on Virtual Box. I'm trying to write to a USB pen drive. VirtualBox detect the pen drive but its name is greyed our in GUI. And I couldn't pick it from the list. How can I use this pen drive with the virtual machine?   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jP28b.png" alt="USB device greyed out"  <answer179681> I found the solution myself. All I need was to eject usb pen drive from mac's desktop. When the drive ejected, it became available in VirtualBox.  <comment244662> This works for me, thank you! <comment323240> worked for me as well, VB 5.0.20 r106931 running win10
