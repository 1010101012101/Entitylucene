Killing the cfprefsd process to restore toolbars and functionality in SPSS <body> Nothing will kill this process! Tried via activity monitor (can't force quit or drag to trash). Tried by killall -u (nothing happens, still showing up as a process) and kill -9 (says 'arguments must be process or job IDs').  The process is cfprefsd, which I need to kill in order to restore default settings on SPSS (my stats software), as the toolbar is missing and IBM solutions states that I need to kill this process before deleting the saved preferences.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/H0Drz.png" alt="enter image description here"Really hope to get some help soon, thanks  <comment238779> Are you sure you're running `killall` and `kill -9` correctly? The first requires the name of the process (e.g. `killall cfprefsd`), while the second required the process ID (PID) of the process you want to kill (e.g. `kill -9 405`).
