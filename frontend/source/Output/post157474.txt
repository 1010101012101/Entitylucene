Office 2011 - option + left / right keyboard shortcut not working <body> When using Microsoft Office 2011 (Word, Powerpoint and Excel) on my Macbook Pro (running OS X 10.9.5) the codeoption + left arrow/code, codeoption + shift + left arrow/code, codeoption + right arrow/code and codeoption + shift + right arrow/code keyboard shortcuts don't work as they should e.g. skip (select) forward or back a word. This functionality works in non-Microsoft programs such as at the command line. All other keyboard shortcuts are working as they should.  I have checked under codeTools &gt; Customise Keyboard/code and they are assigned correctly. I have tried resetting shortcuts both within Office and in System Preferences without success. This has been going on a while - through successive Office updates. As a work-around I have reassigned this functionality to another shortcut but would like to know what the problem is.  Anyone experiencing similar or knows a solution?  <answer237934> I had my keyboard set to codeUnicode Hex Input/code. Setting this to codeAustralian/code or codeEnglish/code resolved the problem.  <comment185172> option left? left what? left arrow? <comment185645> @Buscarì›ƒ: `option + left arrow`
