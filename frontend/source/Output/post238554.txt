Is there a way to differentiate in iOS mail notifications by account? <body> Specifically, the notification (both unlocked &amp; locked screen) in iOS. I have setup two mail accounts (iCloud and another server). When I receive a new message, the notification shows the sender, subject and the first row of the message’s body.   Is it possible to show the account where the mail was received?  <answer238678> That is not possible using the default Mail app. It only allows you to differentiate between VIPs and regular senders (by placing a ☆ next to VIPs).  If you want to differentiate which account received an email within a notification, you would need to use a separate app for one of your accounts. You will then get separate notification settings for that app, and a different notification icon as well.  <comment292778> Thank you, I am using the Inbox by Gmail app also, so I just wanted to use the default Mail app. Whereas it's not possible, i am closing this thread. Thanks again.
