Setting locale via launch daemon - downside to this approach? <body> I have the same problem as in this post here that R started in ESS / Emacs can not set the locales:  precodeR version 3.2.2 (2015-08-14) -- "Fire Safety" Copyright (C) 2015 The R Foundation for Statistical Computing Platform: x86_64-apple-darwin14.5.0 (64-bit)  R is free software and comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY.

I have already set the locales in emacs  precode(setq utf-translate-cjk-mode nil) ; disable CJK coding/encoding (Chinese/Japanese/Korean characters) (set-language-environment 'utf-8) ;; (set-keyboard-coding-system 'utf-8-mac) ; For old Carbon emacs on OS X only (setq locale-coding-system 'utf-8) (set-default-coding-systems 'utf-8) (set-terminal-coding-system 'utf-8) (unless (eq system-type 'windows-nt)   (set-selection-coding-system 'utf-8)) (prefer-coding-system 'utf-8) /code/pre  but this does not solve the problem.  Now the following solution has been proposed here to set the environment through launchd.   Now I am asking myself: This solution will set the locales for strongall/strong processes started via launchd - is there a downside to using this approach?  <answer212354> I can't see any reason why it would cause a problem, but if it did you could always remove it and things would go back to normal. Then, you could use the app specific changes listed further down in the linked answer (which is what I'd use anyway).  <comment256402> The problem is that I compile emacs regularly and that I would have to change the settings each time - which is not really convenient. <comment256407> I just found a solution in emacs: add ```(unless (getenv "LANG") (setenv "LANG" "en_US.UTF-8"))``` to the .emacs.el file. Thanks.
