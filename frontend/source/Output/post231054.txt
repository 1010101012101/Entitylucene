show sender name from mail headers in Apple Mail <body> How to configure Apple Mail.app to show name from mail headers "From: " field and not from Contacts.app???  Apple Mail.app shows me always the name from Contacts.app (card is a read only download from global catalog), e.g.:  ul li"Service Address" front-desk@ourcompany.net/li /ul  But we have more than one who use this address. And this people configure there clients as follow:  ul liname: "person1 first last" / address: front-desk@ourcompany.net/li liname: "person2 first last" / address: front-desk@ourcompany.net/li liname: "person3 first last" / address: front-desk@ourcompany.net/li /ul  When I look to the mail headers, there are the correct names inside, but in Apple Mail.app the list view shows only:  ul li"Service Address" front-desk@ourcompany.net/li /ul  So I'm not able for differing the sender of mail without reading this.  And I do not want to manage a private address card for this address, because the people behind this address are changing all 4-6 weeks! The version I use before has done this correct, is El Captain a downgrade or have I to change to Thunderbird?  <answer231056> Simply switch off Smart Addresses.br Prefs  Viewing  Use Smart Addresses  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fpRIB.png" alt="enter image description here"  Then, instead of codeFred Bloggs/code it will read codeFred Bloggs &lt;f.bloggs@abc.com&gt;/code  <comment283200> this depends not on "Smart Addresses"! the "Smart Addresses" option do only change the view between "Addressbook Name" and "Addressbook name user@email.address" <comment283201> this depends not on "Smart Addresses"!
