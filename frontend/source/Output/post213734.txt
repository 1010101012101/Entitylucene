Why does "ls -l" display the year of my (jar) file as "16:18"? <body> I was looking through my file system and noticed that the date of codemysql-v5.jar/code is formatted incorrectly.  pre ~/Dev/Lib$ ls -l   total 29128   -rw-r-----@ 1 johndoe  staff   2256213 Mar 16  2015 guava-18.0.jar   -rw-r--r--@ 1 johndoe  staff  11684781 Jan 30  2012 kuromoji-0.7.7.jar -rw-r--r--@ 1 johndoe  staff    968670 May  4 b16:18/b mysql-v5.jar /pre  What is going on?  (So far, all 3 codejar/code files have worked just fine for me. I can't remember where I downloaded those files from.)  <answer213735> From codeman ls/code (The Long Format):     If the modification time of the file is more than 6 months in the past or future, then the year of the last modification is displayed in place of the hour and minute fields.   Or in other words: It works as designed.  <comment258026> I especially like the "6 months in the ... future" part :-) <comment258030> 3 days and 5 hours from now, I would not have been able to notice that about the long format! <comment258053> @Tetsujin the reason I did the tag I did was to make the `16:18` bold (which is impossible with standard markdown). However, if you are going to use the four space indent, one should put `!-- language: lang-none --` in front of it to disable the syntax highlighting that is distracting when it isn't a programming language. <comment258054> I hadn't even noticed the bold - doesn't stand out much & have no idea how to get the no lang tag to work, so I just rolled it back. Usually the pre tag just messes up SE markdown so I binned it without even really thinking about it. Rolled back, looks fine. <comment258071> @Tetsujin the bold is a subtle look in `pre`, and it does take some care to get it just right (especially if you *do* want code formatting in there - [example](http://codereview.stackexchange.com/a/88138/22048)). Its doable, though it often takes a try or two to get it just right without messing up the rest of the formatting (insert rant about [grey lines with just white space above and below the preformat block...](http://programmers.stackexchange.com/posts/301231/revisions)). Always, thank you for the revert back. <comment258204> Worth mentioning there are a couple of date parameters to `ls` that make this less ambiguous. Try `ls -T` on OS X. <comment258269> @miken32 For me, in an OS X bash shell,  `ls -lT` gives the consistent date format. <comment258766> confirmed. This afternoon, the year, instead of the time of `mysql-v5.jar`, began to be displayed.
