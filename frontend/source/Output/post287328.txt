In-app purchase from Japanese app <body> So I tried to buy some in-app offers from a app that I downloaded in a different app store region, after putting in my billing information it won't go through. I'm using a US debit/credit card.   Is there anyway to go around the problem like buying a iTunes card then use it for my iTunes account to buy in the in-app offer?  <answer287330> Yes that is possible. You can buy gift cards from other country iTunes Stores.   One quick search and I found https://japancodesupply.com/, where you can buy Japanese iTunes Gift cards. When you order it takes approximately 1 minute to send you an email with your code.  There are many other websites that offer iTunes Gift cards from other countries. So do a quick search, check the credibility of the website and buy a giftcard.  emI'm not affiliated with japancodesupply.com/em  <comment362764> Is this safe/legitimate? <comment362765> Check the customer reviews. Pay with PayPal.. you can always reverse the payment if there is any issue.. and start a case against them.. <comment362768> I'll try this when I'm free. Thank you for your answer!
