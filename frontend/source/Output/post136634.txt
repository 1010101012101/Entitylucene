Keyboard shortcut to open context menu <body> Does OS X have a Windows kbdShift/kbd + kbdF10/kbd equivalent? I need a keyboard shortcut to open the context menu without a mouse.  <answer136637> As far as I can see, you have two options.  h1Mouse Keys/h1  When using Mouse Keys, you can use the keyboard to move the cursor. If you have a numerical keypad, the numbers around 5 are used to move it and 5 is used to click. Without a keypad, it's mapped to the nine keys surrounding I (789/UIO/JKL).  Just like with a mouse or trackpad, you can hold kbd⌃ control/kbd while pressing kbd5/kbd or kbdI/kbd to bring up the context menu.  You can turn on Mouse Keys in System Preferences  Accessibility  Mouse &amp; Trackpad, or enable the press-kbdshift/kbd-five-times toggle shortcut, or press kbd⌥/kbd+kbd⌘/kbd+kbdF5/kbd to bring up a window of Accessibility toggles, including Mouse Keys. This is important to know, as Mouse Keys makes typing impossible, at least without a number pad.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/sBl28.png" alt="Accessibility preferences"  h1Third party utility/h1  There are many applications that let you customize keyboard shortcuts, etc. There's BetterTouchTool (free), or Keyboard Maestro ($36), or several others. Any of these should let you create a shortcut to “right-click”.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1SoxW.png" alt="BetterTouchTool"  <comment162145> nice answer, cool utilities. wish apple would build in the shortcut natively ... <comment260197> This is a duplicate of http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/32715/how-do-i-open-the-context-menu-from-a-mac-keyboard?rq=1
