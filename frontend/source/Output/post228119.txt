How to disable screensaver for newly created user? <body> I am fairly new to OS X, I am trying to disable the screensaver of a user that I recently created with the following commands on the terminal of an account that I'm currently logged in as:  precode    sudo dscl . create /Users/NewUser      # More commands are run after this one, but skipping to the important part...      sudo defaults write /Users/NewUser/Library/Preferences/ByHost/com.apple.screensaver.MAC_UUID.plist idleTime 0 /code/pre  However this doesn't seem to be working. I've noticed that when you create a new user, there is no screensaver plist that exists until the user actually logins. I am not too familiar with plists and Apple in general, any help would be greatly appreciated!  <answer228339> Have you tried running it as the other user using:  precodesudo -u NewUser defaults write /Users/NewUser/Library/Preferences/ByHost/com.apple.screensaver.MAC_UUID.plist idleTime 0 /code/pre  The command I found for setting the screensaver to never start was:  precodesudo -u NewUser defaults -currentHost write com.apple.screensaver idleTime 0 /code/pre  <comment278388> what OS version are you using? <comment278787> The second command works perfectly. Thanks for your help! <comment278788> Sorry for the late reply, but I have been experimenting with Yosemite and El Capitan. The answer specified below works for both.
