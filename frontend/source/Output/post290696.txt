Mail messages aren't gone, but they are invisible <body> Since I upgraded my 2011 iMac to Sierra, I have had a problem with mail disappearing from my main POP account. Many people have complained about losing the message body, but I am losing the body and the message information (sender, subject, date, etc.) in the message browser above. The message is still present; if I remember the sender’s name or subject words, I can call the message up by searching for it, but it disappears again as soon as I close it. I have tried rebuilding the mailbox from the Mailbox menu and I’ve tried the more ambitious rebuild described in the Apple Support Communities thread, "Mail windows no longer visible after OS X update to El Capitan”, but neither works.  Any ideas out there?
