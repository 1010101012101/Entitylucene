Auto-Refresh Page for Google Chrome on iPad <body> Is there an extension I can download on an iPad to auto-refresh a Google Chrome page?  <answer252450> Chrome for iPad doesn't have extensions, but you can accomplish what you're looking for (in Chrome or Safari) using a bookmarklet.  I tested Evan Culver's and it works beautifully:  codejavascript: timeout=prompt("Set timeout [s]"); current=location.href; if(timeout&gt;0) setTimeout('reload()',1000*timeout); else location.replace(current); function reload(){ setTimeout('reload()',1000*timeout); fr4me='&lt;frameset cols=\'*\'&gt;\n&lt;frame src=\''+current+'\'/&gt;'; fr4me+='&lt;/frameset&gt;'; with(document){write(fr4me);void(close())};}/code  How to install it on Chrome:  ol liOn your iPad, copy the above line of in its entirety (starting with codejavascript/codeand ending with the final code}/code)/li liIn Chrome, create a new bookmark (of any page) by tapping the star icon in the location bar. Next, immediately tap the codeEdit/code button in the note that will appear at the bottom of the screen, which will let you edit the new bookmark and turn it into a bookmarklet./li liSet the name of the bookmark to "Auto Refresh"/li liDelete the whole URL and paste the code above in its place. Tap codeDone/code to finish creating your bookmarklet./li /ol  To use it:  ol liVisit a page you want to refresh/li liTap the location bar and emtype/em "Auto Refresh". Select the bookmarklet from the drop down options/li liChoose your refresh interval (in seconds)/li /ol  Note: this particular bookmarklet doesn't have an option to emstop/em auto-refresh; to do that, just reload the page emmanually/em.  <comment314099> Nope.
