Move through images in a folder with Preview.app <body> When looking at an image in a directory with the Preview application, I'm used to the Windows behaviour of using the kbd&#x2190;/kbd/kbd&#x2192;/kbd keys to move through all the other viewable images in that directory.  codePreview.app/code doesn't do this - I first have to select all the images and then open codePreview.app/code. This is a little annoying.  Is there something I can turn on or install to get this behaviour?  Also, how do I open an image in a new instance of codePreview.app/code, say for comparison purposes?  <answer37918> If you are just skimming the pictures do this:  Instead of opening a picture in codePreview.app/code by double-clicking it, just press kbdspace/kbd to preview the picture when selected in Finder.  This way you can still use the arrow keys to navigate between the pictures.   ul likbd&#x2191;/kbd and kbd&#x2193;/kbd in list view/li likbd&#x2191;/kbd,kbd&#x2193;/kbd,kbd&#x2190;/kbd and kbd&#x2192;/kbd in icon view/li /ul  You can still open the picture in codePreview.app/code when needed (top right corner).  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YJTf7.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer37919> I recommend using Xee instead of Preview, and that will allow you to jump from photo to photo in a directory after only opening one.  If you wish to change Xee to the default photo viewer, just right click on the file with the type that you want to change the default for, choose "Get Info", and select "Xee" under open with.  Then, press "Change All..."  To answer your second question, you can open a new instance of Preview by opening one image, then double-clicking and opening the second image.  Preview automatically realizes that you want a new instance (that is, of course, if Preview is your default application for that file type).  <answer37930> Preview can be used for much more than just a quick glance at an image file when you get out of the habit using it like on a windows machine. To open up the power of Preview I keep it on the dock so it is handy all the time (doesn't have to be open and running). Select the group of files you want to see or just drag the whole folder to the dock and drop on Preview. Check in Previews presences under the General tab and check the "Open groups of files in same window" is checked. Preview will open with all the images in a side bar and some buttons will appear on the bottom right in OSX before Lion. On Lion there wil be buttons at the top by the Search box. Before Lion one of these buttons is "Contact Sheet" when you click on it a Slider will appear and you can adjust the size of the thumbnails. In Lion one is called thumbnails and you can drag the diveder bar to change the size. By dropping multiple files on Preview you can now do Batch operations too, like Adjust the size or flip and rotate. You can easily Crop images and do Color Adjusts in Preview as well. Preview does more than these things too if you will spend a little time learning about it too.  To open an image in a new window after you have done the above just right click on the image in the side bar and choose "Open in a new window".  <answer60989> You could also try Sequential. The last update was in 2010, but it's still less buggy than Preview.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qBaJX.png" alt=""  <answer183165> Select all of the photos by pressing  " Command + A" and then right click "open with preview" it will open all of your selected photos and you can scroll through them!img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rNAjb.png" alt="example screenshot"  <answer186425> strongSelect all of the pictures in the directory at once and double click them./strong   That will open them all up in Preview at the same time, and you can use the down/up arrow keys to view them sequentially, just like you mentioned in windows.  <answer240101> You can use Hot Simple Image Viewer  It has keyboard shortcuts you are looking for.  <answer280706> Since I prefer using keyboard shortcut, I generally use like:   ol liOpen the directory &amp; select all pictures using -  "⌘ + A"/li liUse - "⌘ + ↓" to open the selected images using default app (Preview.app)/li /ol  <comment42979> Welcome to AskDifferent! When you have several questions you should split them up. <comment86674> I couldn't agree more about wanting a way to flip through images. I use this all the time. I ended up using Sequential. Previewing the picture doesn't navigate as cleanly for presentations. <comment86675> Using preview shows both images and non-image content, making it impractical for presentations. <comment86676> I have used Sequential for a year as a way to present folders of wireframes/screenshots. Works great. <comment86851> @SimpleAsCouldBe Which I actually a nice feature, don't you think? Without having to open all the appropriate applications you can view documents, spreadsheets, videos and images. If you require a more complex selection you can still search in Finder for pictures only using search rules: [example](https://www.dropbox.com/s/3pveqaogs00csa2/Image%20Search%20in%20Finder.png). <comment229544> Too many steps for an operating system thart claims to be superior to the rest. <comment231975> Not an answer to the original question, but you can get a simple quick mini-preview using Finder with the _preview panel_ enabled. You can toggle it in Finder via **View**  **Show Preview** or with **Cmd+Shift+P**. Then you can quickly move with Up/Down arrows (works best with List mode). This works since Yosemite. <comment240050> Someone give this man a medal - works great! <comment294990> True, but it doesn't solve the question at hand. They asked specifically about Preview.app.
