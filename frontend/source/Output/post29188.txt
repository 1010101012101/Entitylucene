Can the macbook air trackpad play nice with the iOS simulator? <body> Does anyone knows if (and how) I can get my MacBook Air trackpad to feel more natural when used with the iOS simulator ?  It should be easier to use the iOS simulator with the trackpad - but it's not, it's way more difficult to scroll :-( It feels weird but it's the only time I wish I had a emmouse/em on my mac book air - to emulate a touch screen :-|  <answer29199> Unfortunatly the simulator was not built to understand multi-touch gestures which is strange considering the rest of the OS has. I think you will just need to wait until Apple updates the simulator.  <answer112814> Have a look at the iOS Simulator Plus utility I wrote. It's not really a 100% solution but I think it is one step more convenient.  <answer228304> This might help, I posted this elsewhere:  strongEnable 3 finger drag/strong:   ol liFrom the Apple menu, choose System Preferences./li liClick the Accessibility icon/li liChoose Mouse &amp; Trackpad from the options on the left/li liClick Trackpad Options/li liPlace a checkmark next to "Enable dragging" /li liFrom the related pop-up menu, choose “three finger drag” so there's a checkmark next to it/li liClick OK/li /ol  https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204609  <comment132435> It's not a problem to spread your own software. However, then you should reveal your affiliation with the product. Please add a full disclosure to your answer.
