MacBook Pro reset password <body> My Macbok Pro is wanting me to reset my password.  I know my password but I can't get past this screen because the touch mouse doesn't work in this reset mode.  <answer159167> Keyboard navigation using Tab &amp; Enter strongOR/strong Connecting a cable/wireless mouse emthat has been unified/set up/em  One more thing, I think the title of the question is misleading.  "Trackpad doesn't work in Reset mode" That should get more answers quickly!  <comment186994> Which password is it asking for specifically? <comment186998> Is it a terminal environnement? If so, you might want to know that password characters aren't hidden with 'â€¢' as you type, and there is no feedback at all. Maybe you have an issue with the keyboard localization? <comment187009> No, that doesn't seem to be the problem. Thanks though! <comment187015> @Pixelwiz, it's asking for my Apple ID but that's not the problem. When it's in the reset mode my trackpad doesn't work and I can't seem to figure out the correct keys to use that will work in place of it.  I'd up, down, double click, etc.
