Apple TV YouTube "Error occured loading this content" <body> So my YouTube application for my Apple TV is not working. When I go to play a video, it shows "An error has occurred loading this content. Try again later." This first started happening yesterday out of the blue, and I double-checked to see if any of my other applications had the same problem but YouTube's the only one. I've unplugged and plugged back in the cords on the back of the box, and I've restarted Apple TV and still no luck. If anyone has any suggestions, please reply!  <answer224428> Had same issue.

As written, this answer is very vague and will likely attract down votes even if it does ultimately solve the problem. Thanks!
