The operation can’t be completed because the original item for “Foo” can’t be found <body> I have a little NAS at home which makes some volumes available through AFP. This all worked great. Until I shut it down for a while and reconnected it recently.  I can see the device on the network and I can open it and select a share. But when I try to mount the share, I get the following error:  precode"The operation can’t be completed because the original item for “Foo” can’t be found" /code/pre  I think this is because my little NAS changed to a new IP and OS X somehow cached the original (alias?) somewhere.  The fact that I can successfully open these shares from another Mac, which had never seen these before, confirms that I think.  Does anyone know where this is potentially cached? Is there anything I can reset or throw away to get past this error?  <answer131615> Ok so I am going to answer my own question. In my case the solution turned out to be really 'simple'.  I looked at another Mac and I noticed that the code/Volumes/code directory had different permissions. On the problematic Mac it was set to codedrwxr-xr-x/code and on a recently installed Mac it was codedrwxrwxr-x/code.  So I fixed my problem with:  precodesudo chmod 775 /Volumes /code/pre  (You can also do that in the Finder of course, via Get Info)  Problem solved. I can now mount any file share again.  <answer135798> I had the same issue. Also for me it worked on another Mac. It turned out that I had to change the codeVolumes/code's group to codeadmin/code which was codewheel/code befor.  So I fixed my problem with:  precodesudo chgrp admin /Volumes /code/pre  <answer151416> I had the same problem on my MacBook Air; I could not mount shares from a mac OS X Server, when other Macs could.    I had to apply both the chmod and chgrp commands to fix.  I would also recommend restarting into Recovery Mode and running repair disk and repair permissions.   <answer161708> In my case (iMac trying to access files on a Win7 machine) the solution was to add permissions for "Guest" to the Win7 directory. This was previously not necessary. The directory was shareable to everybody and it worked. But apparently now the iMac is trying to connect as "Guest" and adding permissions specifically for "Guest" (Properties…Sharing…Share…Add…Guest) solved it.  <answer179207> I have a Drobo 5N, and it's network name is "Drobo5N" - I get this error occasionally, and I have noticed that when I get the error, and I look in the Finder, my Drobo is named "drobo5n" (all lower-case). I have not found a way to fix this without rebooting my computer... but, I'd love to find one. (I do not have to do anything to my Drobo - just reboot my Mac.)  After rebooting and running disk repair, my /Volumes ownership and permissions are (OS X 10.10.2):  precode[~]$ ls -ald /Volumes/ drwxrwxrwt@ 5 root  admin  170 Mar 31 23:41 /Volumes/ /code/pre  and I am currently able to mount my Drobo without any problems.  <answer183175> I just had this issue running on a Macbook Air OS X 10.9.5.  The permissions were all fine.  I opened the terminal and did     ls -la /Volumes   and got     ls: Photos: Invalid argument      ls: Videos: Invalid argument   These two mounts did NOT show up in Finder.  When I tried to unmount them, I get another error:     umount /Volumes/Videos       umount(/Volumes/Videos): Resource busy -- try 'diskutil unmount'   So then I forced an unmount:     diskutil umount force /Volumes/Videos       Unmount successful for /Volumes/Videos   Once I removed all mounts to the network drive (there were 3 of them), I was able to go into Finder - Go - Connect to Server and it mounted properly.  I am thinking the IP change may be causing this problem to crop up and for some reason the mounts are tied up and won't unmount.  At that point Finder doesn't know how to remount because the old mounts will not unmount properly.  At least that seems to be what my issue was.  <answer191947> 17 JUN 2015 I'm running Yosemite latest.  After hours of searching and trying everything, I ended up renaming the network share on the router, restarting the mac, and, it took a while, but I was then able to access the share under the new name.  <answer208154> OS X may have stale mount points; unmount the remote shares so that fresh mount points can take their place.  This does not happen automagically.  strongThe GUI way/strong  Try the "eject" icon next to the share in finder, then wait for it to reconnect (or force it with Finder-Go-Connect to Server)  If that doesn't work try the commandline...  strongThe command-line way/strong  Find the existing, probably stale, mounts with codemount/code, then codeumount/code them like this...  precode$ mount //GUEST:@OPENELEC._smb._tcp.local/videos on /Volumes/videos (smbfs, nodev, nosuid, noowners, mounted by user) $ umount /Volumes/videos /code/pre  Now try connecting with Finder again.  In my case I'm trying to connect to a remote Samba share, which has been reconfigured and restarted.  <answer210625> strongTL;DR/strong - Check the permissions on your remote share, too. Make sure the Samba daemon emand/em the AFP daemon have access to the shares.  strongLong version/strong - My issue was not with my Mac, but with the remote shares. They had code750/code permissions, which seemed reasonable since I only wanted the owner and appropriate groups to get access to the folders. But the codeafpd/code (Apple File Protocol Daemon) process wasn't in the group! So it was unable to access the files. When other clients, such as my Windows machine accessed the share, they accessed it via Samba (codesmbd/code), which was running as coderoot/code. Thus my Windows machine ran fine, and my Mac client seemed "buggy".  precode$ ssh myremoteserver $ ps -eaf | egrep -i smbd\|afpd  12902 root     34784 S    smbd -D 24642 admin    23680 S    /usr/sbin/afpd -d -F /etc/netatalk/afp.conf /code/pre  (So Samba's running as root, but AFP is running as "admin".)  precode$ cd /mnt/myshares $ ls -l drwxr-x---    6 nobody   allaccou      4096 Jun 25 02:50 foo drwxr-x---   11 nobody   allaccou      4096 Jun 10 20:39 bar drwxr-xr-x   12 nobody   allaccou      4096 Jun 24 23:18 baz /code/pre  (Here, "baz" works everywhere, but "foo" and "bar" only work on my Windows machine.)  precode$ sudo cat /etc/group root:x:0:root administrators:x:1001:admin share:!:1000:admin,nobody allaccount:!:501:bob,jane,sue netdev:x:1002: /code/pre  (So AFP--running as codeadmin/code--isn't in the group codeallaccount/code.)   Add him to the codeallaccount/code group and emvoila/em, a happy Mac.  <answer225069> Apparently this problem can occur for many different reasons.  In my case it was solved by re-launching the finder.  A description and solution for this was at http://www.cnet.com/news/fix-shared-computer-not-found-in-finder/ .  <answer231266> Aloha. I had this same issue with a shared volume on OS X Server 5.1 under OS X 10.11.4 beta. Regardless of the fact that these were beta releases, I have had this issue before. Here's how I managed to solve the problem of the "original item" not being found:  ol lilog out of the server in Finder/li liForce-Quit Finder/li liconnect again using Command-K in Finder (or, Go  Connect to Server…)/li ligo back to the shared folder that didn't open before, and it should open fine now/li /ol  It worked fine for me after that. Note that I do emnot/em have the Connect dialog (Command-K in Finder) ever remember my password in the Keychain since I often want to log in as different users. This also helps me troubleshoot once in a while. Also, before doing the above 4 steps, I had gone into the server and removed the shared folder from the File Sharing area and then re-added it, thinking that this would solve the problem; it did not. So therefore, I think the four steps I took (above) were the fix in my situation.  Hope this helps someone.  <answer254474> In my case, similar to some of the others, it was a permissions problem on the Windows 10 machine that hosted the share I was trying to access. I needed to add permissions to the files (not just the share permissions, but the actual file permissions). Specifically, I needed to either add the "Everyone" group as having access, or (because I didn't really want "everyone" to have access) the specific users I wanted to be able to access the share.   For the specific users, it did work to give access with the Windows Live accounts on a Windows 10 Home machine (in case anyone is thinking, as I initially was, that maybe you need local users and/or a Pro version of Win10).  <answer257249> I experienced this issue shortly after upgrading to macOS Sierra and thought that perhaps permissions or something were messed up in the process. After reading through the other replies here and trying to both force restart Finder, check folder permissions, play with the network share from my router, I finally decided to re-enter the credentials (which were saved in my keychain) for the user I had been logging in as, routinely. This fixed the issue for me.  Takeaway: Try clicking "log in as..." as re-entering credentials for your user, as it worked for me.  <answer263248> After upgrading machines (new one running Sierra) I was setting up my standard favorites and dragging my NAS share (hosted on a Linux box) and always ended up with a "?" in the favorites. After trying everything in this thread, nothing worked.  I found a different solution.  For reference, here's what I've always done (which stopped working as of Sierra):  ol liClick on my network share in the "Shared" section of the finder sidebar/li liSelected one of the shares in the list/li liWait for it to populate in finder (without doing this, the drag operation wouldn't work)/li liDrag the highlighted share over to the finder sidebar./li /ol  Here's what did work (for me):  ol liGo to your network share - just go look at the root directory. This gets it mounted./li liIn the Devices section of Finder's sidebar, click on your computer (not Macintosh HD.) You should see an entry for each drive connected to your machine, a Network entry, possibly a Remote Disc entry and of course, your share will be listed./li liDrag your share from that view into the sidebar./li /ol  <comment253902> This of course bypasses any security you've set up (Guest=public access). So long as you're cool with that, this is a fine solution. <comment287560> I had a weird situation where the mounted server in the 'Shared' subsection resulted in broken links, but connecting using the 'Connect to server' dialog did end up letting me mount the folders. This happened after server updates, so I'm hoping that the submenu entries will work after all of Finder's caches are flushed at some point, but at least it works for now. <comment293062> Relaunching the finder worked for me too. Apple menu (top left) - Force Quit - Finder - Relaunch. <comment297235> WFM too: OSX El Capitan, Force quit finder and now able to re-connect to a late 2008 macbook. Thanks <comment298628> I have a Netgear ReadyNAS system and have been having the same issue as OP on all my Mac devices. Your suggestion prompted me to open the admin interface and check out my network shares. Turns out my AFP permissions for each share were too restrictive. So +1 points for you :) <comment336074> Same prob here on Sierra, annoyingly now it also closes the finder window after dismissing the alert. Relaunching Finder allowed the network volume to mount again. <comment353936> WFM too however it's a pain in the ass, I almost always have o restart finder in order to be able to connect to shares.
