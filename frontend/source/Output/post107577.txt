Where that icon on my OS X menu bar comes from? <body> Anyone could tell me which application stands behind this icon on the menu bar?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QvUvQ.png" alt="Unknown icon"  I tried to figure it out but I couldn’t. Nothing happens when I click on it.  <answer107584> I don't recognize the icon, but I may have a way to find out which app it belongs to.  Bartender is an app that organises the menu bar apps, but can also show which apps are already there. It's a paid app, but you can install the trial, find the mystery app, then uninstall Bartender.

As to the Bartender, I just installed it but even there I couldn’t find a clue what might be the holder of the icon. I tried to hide every single icon, and made all of them hidden, but that one stayed. <comment126189> @MK The linked question is about removing icons from the bar, not about identifying the one shown in the question. <comment126193> Yes, that's true. I thought the pointers in that questions may help. I'll unflag and just link it here. <comment126194> See http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/93461/removing-an-icon-from-mac-os-x-menubar-when-cmddrag-wont-work for some ideas on how to identify the app. <comment130462> @MartinMetodiev That's so weird. Maybe try going through your Applications folder (sorted by date modified, probably) to see if you can find it.
