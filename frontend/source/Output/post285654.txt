Late 2015 iMac (purchased early 2017) running very slow <body> My iMac has been running very slow since purchase. I've done all the tests and checks I can think of, below is a copy of the EtreCheck report that was done today. Reviewing it, other than not enough RAM (which is not fixable) I'm not sure what else to do.  hr  precodeEtreCheck version: 3.3.3 (397) Report generated 2017-06-02 15:29:35 Download EtreCheck from https://etrecheck.com Runtime: 9:27 Performance: Below Average  Click the [Lookup] links for more information from Apple Support Communities.

What does activity monitor report when everything is slow? <comment360318> @Allan is right, you should be checking Activity Monitor. Basically, not having *enough RAM* depends on what you're using your iMac for (8GB is enough for many users, but won't be if you're performing heavy tasks). So, on that note, could you [edit](https://apple.stackexchange.com/posts/285654/edit) your question to list *al the tests and checks* you've already done and a description or screenshot of your Activity Monitor report (taken when the iMac is running slowly). <comment360322> Thanks to @Monomeeth for cleaning up the post.  After scanning through I see two major issues:  1)  you are out of memory so your Mac is going to swap space and 2)you have a 5400RPM spinning drive.  This means that being out of memory, your Mac is forced to go to the absolutely slowest spinning HDD out there for virtual memory.  You will see an immediate bump in speed if you upgrade to an SSD, but only by a marginal amount.   For all intents and purposes, you have outstripped the capacity of your iMac - look at getting something with more horsepower.
