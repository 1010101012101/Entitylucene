1080p movies won't play on my PC laptop <body> Is there a problem with the specs on the iTunes help page regarding 1080p requirements?  I have Windows 7 64-bit, an i7 quad-core, iTunes 10.7, 16 GB of RAM, NVIDIA GT 540M 2GB, and a 1080p display.  iTunes refuses to play these videos, giving this error:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1w8Vv.png" alt="Screenshot"  However, QuickTime will play the videos just fine if I browse and open them myself. So I know its not a hardware problem.  <comment81980> I suspect that iTunes may have been corrupted, especially considering the strange logo shown in the above dialogue box. Have you tried reinstalling iTunes? <comment81982> @XAleXOwnZX ~ Yes, the logo stays the same. I believe that is rather related to the system DPI setting.
