How to create a text file and a folder from terminal? <body> How, from a Terminal, do I make a plain text file and a folder?  <answer221734> A directory can be made using the mkdir command. To make a child directory of the current directory it's simply:  precodemkdir somechild /code/pre  This will create a directory (shown as a folder in Finder) named codesomechild/code.  A text file can be created in a few different ways. The simplest being the echo'ing of text and redirecting it in to a file like so:  precodeecho This is some text &gt; myfile.txt /code/pre  This will create codemyfile.txt/code and its contents will be the string codeThis is some text/code.  You can also use a command line text editor such as vim or emacs or nano to start a new text file. The following start a new text file and open them in the editor for each of the aforementioned editors:  precodevim myfile.txt emacs myfiles.txt nano myfile.txt /code/pre  The nano text editor is probably the most new-user-friendly of those three choices.  <comment268521> What kind of file? An empty file? A text file? An image? There's not enough information here to really give you a succinct answer. If you can clarify, I'll reopen the question. <comment268525> I suppose `touch file` is far too brief to serve as an answer... <comment268542> @bmike I'd say yes it's to short, since it could be argued that the primary function of `touch` is to "change file access and modification times" (from `man touch`), unless you mention that `touch filename` only creates _filename_ if it doesn't already exist.  Otherwise it does its primary function. <comment268556> @IanC sorry, a txt fire and a folder.
