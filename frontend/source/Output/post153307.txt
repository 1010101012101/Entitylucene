How can change hard disk name (not partition) <body> The title is self-explained: I want to change the hard disk name (not the partition). I am not able to do it with Disk Utility. Any solutions?  I'm on Yosemite  <answer153315> If you go to codeFinder &gt; Preferences &gt; General/code, mark codeShow hard disks/code it appears on the desktop, then select it with single left click and press kbdEnter/kbd.  <answer153353> The device name is probably hard coded into the codePCB/code or soft coded into the codeService Area/code of the platter (aka hard drive firmware) and might be changed by the manufacturer but not by the customer.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uXIRZ.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  The partition name (green) might be changed easily, the device name (red) not.  <answer171320> Try codediskutil cs rename lvgUUID "newName"/code. You will need a lvgUUID(Logical Volume Group): codediskutil cs list/code.  <answer205151> want to know how? Connect it to a windows computer. Press rename. Done  <answer222322> Easy Fix  Go to System Preferences - User and Groups, Righthand click on Admin User this will open advanced options, account name and Full name can be changed from there!!  <comment180519> I was asking for the hard disk, not the partition <comment180520> Thanks for the answer. I was asking that because the hard disk I installed (Samsung SSD 850 PRO) has not that name but it's called "Untitled"! It's horrible. Then I can't change it? Is it normal that the SSD is called Untitled? <comment180572> that **is** the hard disk, you can't give a partition a name as the user never sees it. <comment180632> ermm... no - that's the partition. That's *all* the user usually sees. <comment180635> @fred k I'm searching for a better answer. Maybe it's working like that: the firmware provides some (fixed) hex values for size, manufacturer, product number etc. and one **editable** file in the depth of the system contains human readable transliterations where your disk might be added. <comment180795> I'd like to see a picture attached to the question, similar to klanomath's, but showing the entire Disk Utility window so we can see format type etc. I've never seen a drive that cannot identify itself... but many partitions called UNTITLED (especially if they're FAT/NTFS) <comment201561> Could you elaborate on why or how the physical name of the disk would be enmeshed with the core storage volumes (if any) on that drive? <comment247396> Same result as changing the Volume name on a Mac, it doesn't change the device name, which is hard-coded
