Add info to Dock/Menubar from Shell in macOSX <body> I'm working on MacOSX environnement, but I would like to tweak it a bit. I have a few bash scripts I used in Linux to retrieve infos such as IP, average ping and so, that I would like to be displayed in a persistant place. (I.E. the doc, or the menu bar).  I did not found any documentation on this topic, can someone provide a few link or the name of the correct man page to read about that?  thanks  <answer19551> The Dock and menu bar are both for use by applications only. Dock icons are managed by the codeNSDockTile/code class, and items on the right side of the menu bar are managed by codeNSStatusItem/code. If you want to display this information in one of those places, you'll have to create an application to do so. (If you can't convert your bash scripts to C/Obj-C, you can use codeNSTask/code to run them.)  <answer179408> I just found this: https://github.com/stretchr/bitbar. Works like a charm.  <answer180366> How about a small tool: shellwrangler? - http://shellwrangler.com  <comment21461> I could have converted them to Obj-C, but hadn't because I wanted to keep most of my script compatible with a classic Linux/UNIX environnement. I hoped that there were a hook somewhere to acces them through SHELL. <comment252828> I haven't tried this tool yet, but it looks useful, and like it would fit the asker's requirements just fine.  Why all the downvotes?  Is it secretly terrible? <comment253529> Hmm... Jonathon Livingston only has two posts, and they're both linked to shellwrangler.  That's kind of weird. <comment259707> Downvotes most likely are from competitors in this particular area. In terms of posts: youâ€™re right, not much is there as I was advertising it to public. Shellwrangler is totally free as I made if for my self because I was not able to find similar tool at that time.
