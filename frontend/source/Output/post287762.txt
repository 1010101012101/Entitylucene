Mac doesnt boot from bootable macOS Sierra USB? <body> I have a mid-2009 MacBook Pro 15" that was given to me by a co-worker and on first start up I realized that it has that boot loop issue. The screen is stuck on the apple with the ring going in circles underneath it.    I've tried everything I could find about it to no avail.    As a last resort I created a bootable macOS Sierra USB drive using an official Sierra installer copy I created on a Sierra VM. Everything worked fine, the broken Mac was able to see the installer USB drive when booting up with the option key, BUT when I proceed to start the installer, the screen displays a circle with a line through it in middle of the screen before shutting off moments later.   How can I get this macbook to work ?  <comment363352> I'm pretty sure El Capitan is the last OS you can run on that machine - http://www.everymac.com/systems/apple/macbook_pro/specs/macbook-pro-core-2-duo-3.06-aluminum-15-mid-2009-sd-unibody-specs.html
