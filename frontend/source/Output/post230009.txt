iphone 5c bluetooth pairing with Mac: "the device does not have the necessary services" <body> As seen in the screenshot the iphone 5c is discovered via bluetooth; but the pairing is not successful due to missing codeservices/code.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Vnnmj.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  The Iphone says   precode  My Devices        mellyrn     Not Connected /code/pre  where codemellyrn/code is the hostname of the mac.   So what codeservices/code are referred to here?  I am on codeEl Capitan/code.  <answer249166> from what I've gathered, the "services" can be related to filesharing or simply because either one of the devices refuses to understand the other...  based on the following     iOs devices will not pair to computers except for Personal Hotspot. For AirDrop, you need to have bluetooth and Wifi on, and simply turn on Airdrop on each device. Pairing is not necessary.   source: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/6795203?start=0&amp;tstart=0  it seems to use airdrop, the personal hotspot needs to be disabled  and also      ul   liInstead of connect to the devices using the "Browse device" where I have the same error than you, I went to "Set Up Bluetooth Device" and it works  /li   liwent to preference- sharing- turned bluetooth sharing on /li   libottom of options where you'll see "Send File To Bluetooth Device". The device may show as "Disconnected" but click on it anyway  /li   /ul   from https://discussions.apple.com/thread/4207524?start=15&amp;tstart=0  see also  codemacworld co uk /how-to/mac-software/how-use-airdrop-on-macs-wirelessly-share-files-update-3500407//code which basically says airdrop can be buggy - turn on wifi and bluetooth, open airdrop on mac and "be patient"  in my case I got the same error message, but pairing/connecting wasn't working as I was using an iPhone 4s (and it needs 5 or later).
