Why does my MacBook take a lot of effort to restart when it sleeps due to battery drain? <body> Sometimes I just fall asleep with my MacBook Pro on and it turns off because of low battery.  When I connect it and try to turn it on again, it just stalls with a black screen after the login screen â€” I only see the mouse pointer and nothing happens. It only comes back to life when I force it to turn off and restart.  Any suggestions?
