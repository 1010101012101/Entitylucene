Can I use the octopus cable to connect a Thunderbolt Display to my 2012 iMac? <body> I tried connecting a Thunderbolt Display to my 27" iMac (2012) using the Thunderbolt end of the displayâ€™s octopus cable, but the display did not turn on and was not recognised by the iMac.  Is this configuration not supported, i.e. does it only work when using a Thunderbolt &lt;- Thunderbolt cable?  <comment116159> What version of Mac OS X are you using? Have you run Software Update to install all available software and firmware updates? <comment116247> The iMac is running 10.8.4 with all updates installed. I tested the display on a MacBook Pro, there it works fine.  I also checked in System Profiler. It lists no devices connected to either of the Thunderbolt ports, even though the display is plugged in. <comment116265> If you go to Utilities  System Information  Thunderbolt while it's plugged into the MacBook Pro, what is listed for the firmware version?
