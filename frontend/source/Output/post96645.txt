Internet access through Wi-Fi trobleshooting <body> i have iPad2 (Wi-Fi and 3G).  strange thing is:  First time after purchasing it 1 year back, i have used internet thro Wi-Fi in Australia 1 week back.  when i tried the Wi-Fi network in Australian library, it got connected but the 'safari' is not getting connected to internet.  it says " server is not responding'  tried all types of possible options in settings but in vain.  then i went to a computer shop to check, it worked there with their Wi-Fi connect and also internet thro "safari".  when i am back in library, it did connect to Wi0Fi but NO internet through 'safari'.  whats to be done? any suggestions.  i have old version of iOS at the time of purchase.  also let me know how to upgrade the iOS? rgds  <comment113483> You should cast your "upgrading iOS" query as it's own question (be sure to search for an existing answer first). <comment113484> This would be a better question if there was a little more detail.  Rather than saying "I tried all possible options" you should state the things you tried and what the result was. Did you get an IP address? Could you connect to resources on the LAN? Could you ping the router?  Can you get internet through any other iOS app (mail, stocks, weather etc). Did other library wifi users have the same issue?
