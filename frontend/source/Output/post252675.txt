10.8.5 wrong log-in screen <body> I have iMac with 10.8.5. For the 3 years I have had this computer, start-up screen at log-in showed user icons and required a PW. Yesterday, this changed into a gray screen asking for username and password without displaying user icons. I cannot go back to the original option because that field is blocked (gray) in System Preferences. Stranger still is that the grayed option still show the little dot in the 'list of users' option but this is not what the Mac is doing a start up. I do not use FileVault or any unusual security software.
