Run MacBook Pro with lid closed <body> Is there a simple setting to allow a MacBook to continue running with the lid shut?  All signs that I found pointed to no supposedly due to concerns about overheating, but when docked, a MBP is able to be used if the monitor and keyboard are plugged in.   My use case would be running a terminal command that takes awhile, leaving my desk, locking my account, and closing the lid to keep nosy people out.  <answer164623> After looking a little further, I found what I was looking for on this page: How can I prevent my Macbook Pro 2011 from going to sleep when I close the lid?   <answer164624> No. I have run mine with external display, for presentation purposes, but you need something like this.  Why not just lock the display.
