Daisy chain two monitors on a single thunderbolt port <body> I currently have 3 monitors (Asus VN247H) connected to a mid 2014 15" MBP Retina. Two connections are on thunderbolt (with TB-HDMI adaptors) and one on the HDMI port. I would like to use one of the thunderbolt ports for another peripheral. Is there a way to daisy chain two monitors on a single TB port?   <answer186123> You can chain up to 12 thunderbolt devices of any kind. If you want to connect a non-thunderbolt device, make sure you put it at the end of the chain. Also keep in mind that Apple, for some reason, doesn't allow 3rd party-non-thunderbolt-displays chained emdirectly/em after their own Thunderbolt Display. However it will work if another thunderbolt-device is inbetween.  <comment219645> Only if the first screen in the chain is Thunderbolt <comment219652> Okay so this setup should be possible if I put a thunderbolt hub as the first device in the chain? <comment292092> Short answer.. no.
