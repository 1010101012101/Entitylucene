Can I use the camera connector for iPad with the iPod touch? <body> I want to use the camera connector for the iPad with my iPod Touch 4G. I know there is a jailbreak to do it: http://www.ijailbreak.com/cydia/cameraconnector-cydia-tweak-ios/, but it's not working very well. Sometimes works and sometimes doesn't.  Does anyone know another way to do it?
