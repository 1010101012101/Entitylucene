How to access data in iPhone backup file directly <body> I have just gotten rid of my iPhone 5 but did a full  backup of picture and such beforehand. I do not plan on getting another iPhone. Is there a way i can get my content back? I have the backup file location but the files are not what i expected them to be.  <answer91782> I recommend iPhone / iPod Touch Backup Extractor (for Mac) and iPhone Backup Extractor (for Windows).     Recover lost iPhone calendar events, contacts, photos, videos, SMS messages, notes, location data and app data from iTunes backup files.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ea3ip.png" alt="iPhone Backup Extractor screenshot"
