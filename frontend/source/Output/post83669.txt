Duplex default in Acrobat X <body> My MacOS and Acrobat Pro version are as follows. Mac OS X 10.7.5 Acrobat 10.1.6  When I'm printing PDF documents, I can never set 'duplex printing' as a default setting. I think I could do it in previous versions. What should I do?  <answer83712> Try upgrading to Acrobat XI if you can. I've found it's so much better than X in so many ways that it was totally worth the price. I'm not at my Mac now, but you should be able to set the profile you want in either the codePrint/code or codePrint Setup/code dialog, then save it as a default.
