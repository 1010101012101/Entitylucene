Can I get power from my Belkin Express Dock HD (Thunderbolt 2) for my MacBook Pro Retina? <body> I plug my MacBook Pro to my Belkin Express Dock HD via Thunderbolt, but I see that my battery is getting down. I was hopping to get power from the Dock. Is there any solution to this problem?  <answer182937> The MBP is not a thunderbolt device; it is a laptop with its own power source, and a thunderbolt port.  If you need to replace the power adapter for your MBP, then take care to obtain the correct wattage.  <answer182942> A Thunderbolt port can provide up to strong10W/strong. That's enough to charge a phone or a tablet but definitely not a notebook.   A Macbook (Air/Pro) needs  between 45 and 90W.
