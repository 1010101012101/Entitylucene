Mac OS X 10.7.5 Keychain hangs forever <body> Actually not only keychain, but any other apps that request it in any way.  The problem first appeared when Adium asked me about untrusted certificates, I selected "Always trust" in system "view certificate" window, and it hung. Then I killed adium, and since then no app can access keychain.  After killing any hung app we can see the following stacktrace:  precodeDate/Time:       2013-06-23 15:06:13 +0300 OS Version:      10.7.5 (Build 11G63b) Architecture:    x86_64 Report Version:  9  Command:         Keychain Access Path:            /Applications/Utilities/Keychain Access.app/Contents/MacOS/Keychain Access Version:         5.4 (55120.6) Build Version:   54 Project Name:    KeychainAccess Source Version:  55120006000000000 Parent:          launchd [281]  PID:             87327 Event:           hang Duration:        1.06s Steps:           11 (100ms sampling interval)  Pageins:         13 Pageouts:        0   Process:         Keychain Access [87327] Path:            /Applications/Utilities/Keychain Access.app/Contents/MacOS/Keychain Access Architecture:    x86_64 UID:             501    Thread 0x217de6     DispatchQueue 1   User stack:     11 ???

But I don't like this option, there should be some way to manually delete a failing certificate.  <answer94741> I would recommend resetting to a new/default keychain and see if that resolves the issue. Keep in mind that any stored passwords, keys, secure notes, or certificates will be deleted when you do this.  In Keychain Access.app under Preferences choose "Reset My Default Keychain" and then restart (for good measure). See also: Reset Mac OS X Keychain.  <answer143384> I always get this problem when using Remote Desktop.  Even though race_carr's answer to reset the keychain will likely work, I think the process is too destructive.  What I just did was go into keychain and clean up the login-certificates section by removing duplicate, untrusted, and old certificates.  That fixed the freezing problem.  <comment151253> Thank you race_carr. I have been fighting with this problem for months! <comment151256> Maybe an up vote? <comment151258> Just to add to this, if you can access Keychain Access long enough you can also use Keychain First Aid (under the Keychain Access menu) to verify and if needed repair your keychain. <comment218568> A quick fix for the dialog is (usually): `sudo pkill SecurityAgent` <comment219814> Thanks for this, I visited the KeychainAccess and saw I had already trusted the RDP host, but with another IPadress. I removed this cert and now iy works again :)
