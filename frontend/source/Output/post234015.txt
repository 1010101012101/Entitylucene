How can I disable animation when switching desktops in El Capitan? <body> I would like to disable the switching animation when switching the desktop in mac os El Capitain.  Do you know how to do that?  Thank!  <answer234020> There is a program named strongTotalSpace/strong, that has the feature you need. Once installed, you should open it up, go into "emTransitions/em" and disable "emUse transitions/em", this will remove the animation you get when you switch Workspace em(aka Dekstop)/em  If you're on OS X 10.11.x El Capitan or later, you will also need to disable a feature known as "codeSystem Integrity Protection/code" which prevents you to edit or access system files. To disable it:  ol liRestart the Mac, then boot it in recovery mode, by holding down codecmd/code (or Windows key) and codeR/code keys, before hearing the sound of your Mac startup. Hold them down for 5 secs./li liClick on "emUtilities/em" on the top of your screen, then select terminal./li liOn the new opened window, enter codecsrutil enable --without debug/code ./li liReboot/li liEnjoy :)/li /ol  csrutil enable --without debug is the better solution suggested by [http://totalspaces.binaryage.com/elcapitan][totalspace].   <comment313043> Note: TotalSpaces2 versions 2.3.5 and above have support for El Cap but cannot run on a normally configured machine due to system integrity protection. See: http://totalspaces.binaryage.com/elcapitan <comment313432> Well, not hard to disable it <comment313433> Upvote still for the suggestion <comment313448> Sure! AFAIK this is the best solution out there however imperfect. <comment313514> Lemme update the answer <comment362382> I wish I could downvote this, why would you advise people to disable System Integrity Protection? <comment362385> @David天宇Wong after you made the change it can be reenabled
