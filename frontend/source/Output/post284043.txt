How To Get Safari History Domain Images Form Cache In Safari v10.1 <body> I want to get images from safari which i show in my app. I have to differentiate all cache images domain wise, so before new update of mac os x12.4 and safari v10.1. i was getting images from below location  ~/Library/Caches/com.apple.Safari/WebKitCache/Version for example I was getting images of google.com from the location -: ~/Library/Caches/com.apple.Safari/WebKitCache/Version 9/Records/google.com  in this location OS was saving images by domain name's folder. But after update they have changed domain into a different string which is like this  ~/Library/Caches/com.apple.Safari/WebKitCache/Version 9/Records/1A71C22C3069617815FB52ACDEB96918BD33D7DD  in this situation i cant specify images by domain name.
