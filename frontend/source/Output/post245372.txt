Unable to recover disk space Mac OS X EI Capitan <body> I deleted one partition on my mac and now I am not able to recover that space.  codediskutil list/code shows below output. Here I see total space is 500 GB and size of Yosemite(installed El Capitan on it) is 248 GB. So where is remaining 250 GB.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WzRTa.png" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/n3Nsl.png" alt="enter image description here"  precodesudo  fdisk  /dev/disk0  Signature: 0xAA55          Starting       Ending  #: id  cyl  hd sec -  cyl  hd sec [     start -       size] ------------------------------------------------------------------------  1: EE 1023 254  63 - 1023 254  63 [         1 -  976773167] &lt;Unknown ID&gt;  2: 00    0   0   0 -    0   0   0 [         0 -          0] unused        3: 00    0   0   0 -    0   0   0 [         0 -          0] unused        4: 00    0   0   0 -    0   0   0 [         0 -          0] unused      sudo  gpt  -r  show  /dev/disk0        start       size  index  contents           0          1         PMBR           1          1         Pri GPT header           2         32         Pri GPT table          34          6                   40     409600      1  GPT part - C12A7328-F81F-11D2-BA4B-00A0C93EC93B      409640  488816512            489226152  485912608      2  GPT part - 48465300-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC   975138760    1269536      3  GPT part - 426F6F74-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC   976408296     364839            976773135         32         Sec GPT table   976773167          1         Sec GPT header /code/pre  <answer245414> Normally, to fix your drive, all you need to do is enter the following command.  precodesudo  diskutil  resizevolume  /dev/disk0s2  R /code/pre  The command should move code/dev/disk0s3/code to the bottom of codedisk0/code while resizing code/dev/disk0s2/code to maximum size. I am not sure if the codesudo/code prefix is required.     strongIn your case, '/dev/disk0s2' and '/dev/disk0s3' are already at the bottom of 'disk0', therefore the above command will not work/strong.   Fortunately, you should have enough space to clone your existing HFS+ formatted OS X volume labeled "Yosemite". You then can merge the partitions to recover all the lost space. The procedure is given below. To aid in understanding the steps, I preformed the procedure on a Sparse Disk Image. What you will encounter will differ slightly from the posted images. You will need to make the appropriate substitutions.  You will need to boot the Mac from either another drive or from OS X Internet Recovery. If you download the El Captitan OS X Installer from the Mac App Store, you can create a bootable flash drive. The steps are given at the Apple web site "Create a bootable installer for OS X". Using OS X Internet Recovery is described at the Apple web site "About OS X Recovery".  h2The Procedure/h2  ol liOpen the Terminal application. Enter the following commands.  precodeDISK=/dev/disk0 sudo gpt -r show $DISK /code/pre  You should get the same output as posted in your question./li liNext, enter the following commands. The integers given came from your posted question. These commands create a new partition (codedisk0s4/code) containing most of the missing free space.  precodeBEGIN=409640 SIZE=488816512 diskutil unmountdisk $DISK dd if=/dev/zero count=4 bs=512 seek=$BEGIN conv=notrunc of=$DISK diskutil unmountdisk $DISK gpt add -i 4 -b $BEGIN -s $SIZE -t hfs $DISK /code/pre  Close the window and quit the Terminal application./li liOpen the Disk Utility application and highlight the newly created partition. In my case, the device was codedisk1s4/code and label was "Untitled". Your device should be codedisk0s4/code.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/B41l8.png" alt="40"/li liFrom the menu bar, select "Edit-Restore...". Choose to restore from the HFS+ formatted OS X volume on the same drive. In my case, this volume was labeled "keep". Your volume should be labeled "Yosemite". Next, click on the "Restore" button. This step may take a while to complete.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5Ix4f.png" alt="41"/li liWhen the pop up windows below appears, click on the "Done" button. The result should be a clone of both your HFS+ formatted OS X partition and your Recovery partition. Also, the partitions indices should be renumbered in ascending order.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/BHsnB.png" alt="42"/li liWith the newly created partition highlighted, click on the "Mount" button.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/14MBU.png" alt="43"/li liThe label should change to the same as the volume you restored from. In your case this should be the label "Yosemite".  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KTzxv.png" alt="44"  Quit the Disk Utility application/li liOpen the Terminal application. Enter the following commands. These commands will remove your original Recovery partition.  precodeDISK=/dev/disk0 diskutil unmountdisk $DISK gpt remove -i 5 $DISK /code/pre  Close the window and quit the Terminal application./li liOpen the Disk Utility application. Highlight the drive you are working on and click the "Partition" button. Highlight the pie piece that will allow you to click on the "-" button. emThere should be only one piece that will allow this./em  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HxOEy.png" alt="48"/li liClick on the "-" button. The result should be similar to what is  shown below. Next, click on the "Apply" button.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GiquD.png" alt="49"/li liWhen the following pop up window appears, click on the "Done"  button.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FK3z7.png" alt="46"/li liThe result is shown below. You are finished. All the free space  should now be recovered. This should also include the small pie  piece shown in step 10.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Xc0Dh.png" alt="47"/li /ol  <answer245470> If backup is available then remove the recovery HD, resize the main volume to fill the remaining available space (since it appears the recovery HD is what is in the way of resizing) and then recreate the recovery HD with whatever you're comfortable with (suggestion https://github.com/MagerValp/Create-Recovery-Partition-Installer )  <comment302597> It gives "Error: -69742: The requested size change for the target disk or a related disk is too small; please try a different disk or partition, or make a larger change" <comment302609> No CoreStorage logical volume groups found <comment302621> @Akhil: I updated my answer. <comment302684> @DavidAnderson Revised. Thanks. <comment303282> I have edited the question with the results of coomands you asked. <comment303942> I updated my answer with the new procedure.
