I was interested in finding out if the person who also answered at the bottom of this message chat actually installed 8GB. I wanted to clarify if it was 16GB total? I have 8GB installed currently. See the link below http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/34304/can-i-put-more-than-8gb-of-ram-in-a-macbook-pro-5-1 <comment146937> You could put 16GB into it, but it will only be able to address/use 8GB. <comment146938> Makes Since! I was hopping for some hacking miracle... Thanks again for the help. <comment146940> It's a hardware limitation, so there's really nothing we can do about it. If you want to put some speed in your old MacBook a SSD is probably a smarter choice than RAM anyways. <comment211506> This answer should cite an authoritative source for those specs. <comment211571> @DanJ - i have updated the anwser accordingly.
