very noisy Tweetbot messages in Console app (GUI) - where is the log location on disk (path)? <body> Tweetbot generates very much log entries (debug log?) in Console.app.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wPBH0.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  What's the source of those logs? I didn't find a Tweetbot log file.  <answer267902> A couple of comments. Your screencap does not show the sidebar which will generally show the path to the log in question (EG "/Library/Logs" etc.). Also when you select the log to view on one of the left-hand columns you can select FILE  REVEAL IN FINDER to show the actual log file itself in Finder.
