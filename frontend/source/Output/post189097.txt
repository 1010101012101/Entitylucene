Focus on a application <body> Can I create any shortcut to focus on an application?   For instance kbd⌘ CMD/kbd+kbd1/kbd and Safari is active and on top of other windows, kbd⌘ CMD/kbd+kbd2/kbd Pages and so on.  I remember a long, long time ago, that was possible with kbdF1/kbd, kbdF2/kbd...  <answer189099> You can do this with many apps available. I personally prefer Better Touch Tool, because You can do much more than just assign keyboard shortcuts. There's window snapping and most of all - custom mouse/trackpad gestures. Here's example:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fS5bf.png" alt="Better Touch tool with keyboard shortcut assigned to focus on Safari"  With this I can press kbd⌃ CTRL/kbd+kbd⇧ SHIFT/kbd+kbd1/kbd to focus on strongSafari.app/strong.
