How do I revoke Gatekeeper permission to launch from an unsigned app? <body> Gatekeeper is a feature of macOS that prevents unsigned applications from being launched. It can be disabled host-wide in System Preferences, or you can keep the protection in place and exempt a single application by right-clicking and choosing "open" which prompts a dialogue with the option to "launch anyway" (rather than simply double-clicking, which prompts a dialogue with no option to launch, only dismiss).  Forever after, that application will launch without issue. Gatekeeper has presumably whitelisted it. How can I revoke this exemption and remove the application from the whitelist after once approving it?  Apple's support document suggests consulting the manpage for codespctl/code for more information. Going from there, I've tried codespctl --disable/code &lt;empath to app/em, codespctl --remove/code &lt;empath to app/em, and codespctl --add --label disable/code &lt;empath to app/em; codespctl --disable/code --label disable, but the app still launches successfully when double-clicked in Finder.  OSXdaily suggests that codespctl --remove/code &lt;empath to app/em should have done the trick, and indeed after running that command, the application no longer shows up under the whitelist of exempted applications with codespctl --list | grep/code &lt;emapp name/em. But the app still launches. How do I get this revocation to stick?  <comment341654> Is the app still quarantined, or did its quarantine attribute get removed? Without that, the gatekeeper policy will not even be checked. You can see if it's still there with `ls -ld@ /path/to/application.app` and see if "com.apple.quarantine" is listed below it. <comment341655> @GordonDavisson: yes, that command shows the info "com.apple.quarantine  61". Should that mean it should not launch? <comment341656> @ziggurism That means it should be applying the policy. What does `spctl --assess -vv /path/to/application.app` show? <comment341660> @GordonDavisson: path to app: rejected source=no usable signature  While experimenting, I did a `spctl --disable` before I tried `spctl --remove`. Could that be the reason why Gatekeeper is ignoring my revocation? <comment341663> Weird; my understanding was that if it had the com.apple.quarantine xattr and `spctl --assess` rejected it, you shouldn't be able to open it (without some sort of override). So I'm not sure what's going on in your case. <comment341863> @GordonDavisson: Does this work for you? <comment342221> I am reproducing exactly the same issue on Sierra, except that for me the response to `spctl --assess -vv /path/to/application.app` is:  /path/to/application.app: rejected (resource envelope is obsolete (version 1 signature)) <comment346556> This question has been answered.
