Finding geographical address based on a Facetime message <body> My iPhone was stolen. The person who has the phone accidentally face-timed me and agreed to return the phone, but hasn't. Is there any way I can discover an address just from this Facetime message?    Please note the phone was suspended when stolen, but still shows my name and number. If I can't check it that way, do you have any other ideas?  <comment324757> Are you able to go to the iCloud site and check Find iPhone? <comment324782> If the person is clumsy enough to accidentally facetime you, you might be able to get them to absent mindedly accept a "Find Friends" app request.  If you didn't install Find Friends (an optional app written by Apple) before it was lost, it might be tougher for them to accept "accidentally", because they will need to install the app. But to try it, you'd have to have a friend send a request to your Apple ID through the Find Friends app. Just don't respond on any other iOS devices you might have - not sure if that would cancel it for the other guy.
