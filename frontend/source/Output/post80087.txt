iTunes 11 doesn't include words between parentheses for search <body> Today I found out that when searching in iTunes, it doesn't include words in songtitles that are between parentheses. I have lots of remixed songs and they always mention the artist between parentheses. I like the new style of searching, this way I can quickly add artists and albums to 'play now', so I don't want to change that.  Is there any way to search words between parentheses too?  Kind regards.  (iTunes 11.0.1, Mountain Lion.)  <comment97779> I have this problem too, but to clarify: iTunes *does* search for words in between parentheses, only as long as they are not immediately before or after parentheses. For example, if you have a song called "Derezzed (Avicii Remix Vocal Edit)", iTunes will *not* find it if you search for "Avicii" or "Edit", but it *will* find it if you search for "Remix" or "Vocal".
