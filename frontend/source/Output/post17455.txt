iPhone "software" vs. "hardware" keyboard layout? <body> I'm a bit confused. In the keyboard settings of my iPhone are two options: "sofware keyboard layout" and "hardware keyboard layout"  But what is the latter? Isn't they keyboard totally "software"? What does it mean? And why do I need it?  <answer17458> With iOS 4 and above, you can pair a Bluetooth keyboard to the phone. That's the hardware keyboard for which you'd be specifying the layout.  <comment34964> Thanks so much man, makes a lot of sense!
