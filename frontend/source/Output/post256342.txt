Use Caps Lock to switch to and from languages on Sierra <body> Sierra added this feature that allows you to switch from a to Latin layout from a non-Latin layout by Caps Lock.  It doesn't work with Russian, although last time I checked Russian was a non-Latin language.   Does anyone have any luck with working around this bug?  <answer256377> Although both Seil and the classic Karabiner don't work anymore under Sierra, Karabiner rewrite, "Karabiner Elements" (in a very early beta) actually works.  The UI key mapping doesn't yet work, but you can edit the config json file under code~/.karabiner.d/configuration/karabiner.json/code (see an example below) to map Caps Lock to F19. From there it's all the same as before - disable Caps Lock, map keyboard layout triggering to F19, profit.  Example karabiner.json:  precode{  "profiles": [     {       "name": "Default profile",       "selected": true,       "simple_modifications": {         "caps_lock": "f19"       }     }   ] } /code/pre  Downgrade deferred!   <comment319697> I tested a number of them and it looks like Russian and Greek may be the only ones where this does not work.  Probably something Apple has to fix. <comment319702> Oh :( The problem is [seil doesn't work anymore](https://github.com/tekezo/Seil/issues/68). So I am stuck :( Time to downgrade. <comment322512> Did anyone send a bug report? <comment349360> It doesn't work in Bulgarian (phonetic) layout also. There is no checkbox "Use the Caps Lock key to switch to and from Bulgarian". <comment360925> @TomGewecke According to [this source](http://www.macworld.com/article/3123735/macs/how-to-use-cap-locks-in-macos-sierra-to-switch-between-keyboards-that-use-different-characters.html), Japanese isn't working, either (so likely Korean as well. I wonder if Chinese works or not). I didn't test it out as I'm on still El Capitan, though. <comment360926> How did you map the layout triggering to F19? Since Karabiner is not working anymore, it is not working, either, right? <comment360931> @Blaszard  Chinese and Korean do work.  Japanese is a special case, because the IM has an internal version of US, Romaji, which Japanese users normally access via a special key on a Japanese keyboard.  No excuse for leaving out all Cyrilllic and Greek keyboards however.
