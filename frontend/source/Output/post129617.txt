Moving a window between Spaces with Slate <body> I'm currently using Slate as my main TWM but the only thing missing is moving app between spaces with key bindings.  I don't want to use the mouse, I know I can drag and drop the window and I can select the window and then switch to an other Space.  I want to do it with the keyboard, just switch the window on focus. Is it possible? Is there a better TWM for mac os than Slate?  Thank you.  <answer129627> I found this, since not sure what you asking     Switching Windows      Slate allows me to switch to any window I want in one shortcut and a   single key press. I can do this using a feature called “Window Hints”.   If you have ever used easyMotion for Vim or Vimperator/Vimium you will   be familiar with this concept.      When you press a shortcut (I use cmd+e), every window is instantly   overlain with a letter, starting with those on the home row of your   keyboard. By pressing the letter over a window your focus is   transfered to that window. For windows that are hidden behind others   the application icon is displayed in the overlay.   <answer258421> There isn't a spaces support in slate for now. For more info take a look at this issue. You can also use something like BetterTouchTool app for this functionality.  <comment275824> The question is about moving an application to another space, the link does not provide any related information.
