How to update iOS11 Beta <body> I have already installad iOS11 Beta 1 with Apple Beta Software Program.  But there are new beta releases (Beta 2 and Beta 3), when I navigate to settings-general-software update, it says,      iOS 11.0 Your software is up to date   I have also checked version, it's 11.0 (15A5278f) which is actually Beta 1.  Why don't new updates appear in software update section? How can I install new beta versions?  <answer291585> I had the same problem.  On your phone log onto beta.apple.com with the AppleID you used to sign up for the public beta.  There should be a link, once you log on, to tap on to download the correct profile that will then kick off the next available IOS Beta release.  <comment368131> this solved my problem and I installed Beta 2, but I'm not able to install Beta 3, have you installed beta 3? <comment368134> The public betas are not released in sync with the developer betas. They are two different animals and not released at the same time. I imagine that the dev betas are tested by developers before the public betas are released. But I am just guessing on that... <comment368136> :) that's a little bit interesting, I really don't remember whether I installed the developer or public beta for the first time. Anyway, I can handle it with Beta 2, no problem and thanks for help. <comment368142> i've installed Beta 2 but the version number is 15A5318g which is actually Beta 3. https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-11-beta-3-changes-bug-fixes-enhancements-etc.2055891/
