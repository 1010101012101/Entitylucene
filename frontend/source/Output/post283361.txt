itunes account credit transfer <body> I have two iTunes accounts as one was associated with a previous device and employer. I have a a fair amount of iTunes credit still there which I want to move to my main iTunes account. I cannot seem to figure out how. Tried sending a gift card from the old to the new but iTunes won't process, wants a credit card to bill instead of using my current credit. Any solutions
