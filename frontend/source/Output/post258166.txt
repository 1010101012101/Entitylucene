What is App Memory calculated from? <body> I'm trying to use Geektool to keep a running monitor on my system, and wanted to include proper memory usage in my stats. I'm using Activity Monitor as the basis of my memory monitoring, but I'm running into an issue.  I can find and accurately calculate wired memory using the following command:  precodevm_stat | grep wired | awk '{print $4*4096/1024/1024/1024"GB"}' /code/pre  I can't seem to get an accurate calculation of app memory though. I've tried adding up different portions of the vm_stat command to show app memory, but it doesn't seem to ever add up.  I've also tried getting used memory by trying to figure up the used, but it always comes back with more memory usage than Activity Monitor reports. I've looked online, and all Apple's website says is that App memory is the memory used by apps and background processes, which isn't really useful.  Is there combination of vm_stat pages that will add up to the used memory or app memory so that I can correctly show my memory usage in my geeklet?  <comment360905> Did you solve it ? <comment361086> Nope. I tried multiple ways of adding up memory, but none of them lined up with what Activity Monitor would give me.
