There are also a number of techniques that developers can use to reduce the size of their apps. One that was introduced in iOS 9 is App Thinning. This is where a developer tells the App Store which parts of their app are necessary all the time and which parts are optional. For example with a game, a developer might just choose to provide a small number of levels initially, with subsequent levels to be downloaded as and when the player reaches them. This reduces the initial install size and storage size used on your device.

Do you have a reliable source for that? <comment330555> The app was installed, not updated. <comment330557> @haykam Your question stated "While trying to download Pokémon GO...".  Are you now saying the app was already installed and then you got this message? <comment330562> @haykam I've updated my answer slightly. Basically swapped the order of the paragraphs, since I believe now the paragraph about app thinning is more relevant to your question.
