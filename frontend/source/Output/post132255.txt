Why does my desktop picture not change correctly? <body> If I go into the Desktop &amp; Screensaver preference pane to change my desktop background.   The result is that my normal desktop has the old picture I wanted to change:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/CSHst.jpg" alt="Desktop"  If, however, I go into Mission Control to change to another virtual desktop, both thumbnails show the correct wallpaper.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mZOVE.jpg" alt="Mission Control"  How can I correct this issue?  <answer132275> ul liOpen strongFinder/strong and press the keyboard combination: kbdShift/kbdkbdCommand/kbdkbdG/kbd/li liFrom the "Go To Folder" popup window that appears, enter the following bolded path (just copy and paste it): /li /ul  strong~/Library/Application Support/Dock/desktoppicture.db/strong  ul liMove the file to your Trash. /li liLog out of the account and log back in. /li /ul  strongExplanation:/strong There's no property list for Desktop settings in Mavericks, as there was in previous OSXs. Instead, the Desktop values are stored in the database file mentioned above, which I assumed (correctly, here) was corrupted. Deleting it is non-destructive, as it automatically regenerates once you log out and log back in.   <comment155478> Have you attempted to log out of the account and log back in? <comment155522> I have. I does not solve the problem. <comment155564> A little explanation of what you're suggesting to do, what that file is and what might have caused the issue would improve your answer :) <comment155566> @Thecafremo sure. see edits. cheers :)
