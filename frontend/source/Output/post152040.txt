Cannot upgrade from iOS 8.0.2 to iOS 8.1 <body> I have an iPad 2 and it currently has iOS 8.0.2, it says to install iOS 8.1 but when I click on update it brings up the agree or disagree the terms page as normal, and I click on agree and nothing happens, it just freezes and then times out!  What can I do about this?  <answer204975> Just fixed this by making sure I was signed into iTunes, then agreeing to updated iTunes terms and conditions, then hard-resetting. I had not been signed in before, so I suspect that was holding things up.  <comment178914> I'm pretty sure there is no iOS 8.2 - unless you are on about the beta, I suggest editing your question. <comment178916> What did you try? Do you have enough disk space? <comment178930> I have 10gb of disk space avail <comment178936> I always do mine on iTunes - sync, backup, download the update... *then* go for the install. 8.1 is installing right now. First thing you have to do for recent updates is unlock/login your phone when it starts, fingerprint or 1234 passcode
