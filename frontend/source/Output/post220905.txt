Non native 3rd-party apps not loading on Apple Watch <body> Apps like DataMan, Carrot Weather or Runtastic Pro are stuck on the loading screen and eventually crash if I wait long enough.  I'm using watchOS 2.1 with 16 apps installed and have it paired to an iPhone 6 running iOS 9.2. I've already tried unpairing the watch and then pairing it again, reinstalling the apps on both watch and iPhone as well as soft resetting both devices.  I have found these steps describing to fix the issue of not loading for native apps:  ul liStep 1: Perform an encrypted backup with the paired iPhone, using iTunes./li liStep 2: Erase all content and settings on your iPhone./li liStep 3: On the Apple Watch, go to the Settings app and select Erase All Contents and Settings./li liStep 4: Now restore your factory default iPhone from the iTunes backup./li liStep 5: Once the restore is complete, pair your Apple Watch with the iPhone./li /ul  But before going through the steps of completely resetting my iPhone I wanted to make sure that there's no other way.  Thanks in advance.  <answer220907> I have just found an unusual solution to this problem:   Deleting all music from the Settings app on the iPhone and then soft resetting both devices solved the issue.
