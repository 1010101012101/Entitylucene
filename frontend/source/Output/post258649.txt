How to burn Windows 10 ISO to USB? <body> I've been googling for hours; everything I can find either is for Bootcamp or doesn't work.  So, I have a clean PC that I want to install Win10 on; I also have a Mac with a Win10 ISO and a flash drive; how do I put the ISO onto the drive? I've tried using Unetbootin, but the PC doesn't boot from it.   My Boot Camp Assistant does not support burning ISO's to USB; it just installs from ISO directly.  <answer258654> First, by "flash drive" we both understand external USB flash drive, right? :) If not, then get one :) Make sure it does strongnot/strong contain any important information.  ol liInsert clean USB flash drive into your mac/li liStart standard Disk Utility/li liSelect your USB flash drive on the left panel/li liClick 'Restore' button in Disk Utility window/li liIn the dialog window click 'image' button and select your ISO image/li liFrom drop-down list in the same dialog window select your USB flash drive/li liPress 'Restore'/li /ol  You should get properly prepared Windows 10 USB installation disk.  Hope this helps.  <comment323404> Use MS's own Media Creation Tool from within Windows. https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/software-download/windows10ISO but you can't get there on a Mac, you get redirected <comment323405> @Tetsujin The problem is --- I don't have Windows! <comment323406> You said you had Boot Camp, I extrapolated... wrongly, I guess <comment323407> @Tetsujin Boot Camp Assistant, sorry. I've fixed it in the question <comment323410> And all I get is "could not validate source --- invalid argument"... <comment323413> Oops, sorry! I've missed one important point. Between 1 and 2 - simply double click your ISO image to get it mounted (you'll see disk appeared in your desktop). After that follow the steps. This shall fix 'invalid argument' warning :) <comment323416> nope, the error is still there <comment323423> Sad. Then try following this answer: http://superuser.com/a/226148 <comment371707> Unfortunately, I have the same error as @Akiiino â€” and the method (`hdiutil -format UDRW` in the other answer hasn't given me a bootable USB-stick *either*. /= <comment371781> @ELLIOTTCABLE, did you have a chance to try this answer: https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/103874/creating-a-bootable-usb-of-windows-8-1-on-os-x ?
