Can I find a driver or something to make the EarPod buttons work on Windows 10? <body> I have several pairs of Apple EarPods, and I want to be able to use the buttons with music players and the volume on my PC. Is there a piece of software I can install to my computer to let the buttons work?  <answer237100> It shouldn't need any drivers, controls are standardized across systems. It's probable that the computer you're trying to use it with doesn't have the four pole mic/control combo you need.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/heIm3.jpg" alt="enter image description here"
