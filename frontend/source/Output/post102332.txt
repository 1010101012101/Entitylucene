Script to make the x red button kill the app <body> Quick background: new mac, long time windows user; not scared by linux and scripts.  I am currently using RedQuits to make the x red button quit de app, not just close the window.    It is a great program, but has one small problem (for me): one can not select which apps should maintain the default behavior (x close the window, not the app).  So i found a very old (2006) app called Stoplight that does exactly what i want: select which programs should not be affected.  Unfortunately, Stoplight does not work anymore.  So, i tried to see what the script does (it's a .bundle), but looks like it's compiled.  To the questions:  ul liis there a way to decompile the script, so i can make it work again?/li liif not, anyone have an idea about how to make a whitelist of apps that should not be closed by RedQuits?/li liagain, if not, where should i start to build my own script to intercept the signal that closes the windows and make it kill the app?/li liany other hints are appreciated./li /ul  Thanks.  <comment120505> If the app has a single window then the red button will quit the app, if it has multiple then it won't <comment120514> @Mark yes, i've read about this feature. that is why i need to implement my own way to deal with apps and windows <comment122580> I've rolled back your edit because it changed the question into something for which answers will be quite different than for your initial question. Can you please add a new question to get answers on how to turn your script into an always-running service?
