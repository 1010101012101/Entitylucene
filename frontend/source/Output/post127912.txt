Switch between instances of apps in full screen? <body> I can use command tab to switch between apps, and command tilde to switch between windows of the same app (for example, a regular window and an incognito window of Chrome).  However, when I full screen a window of Chrome, I lose the ability to switch between windows of the same app with command tilde. I also cannot switch back to it with command tab.  What I want is to be able to full screen all windows in all apps, and still be able to switch between apps and windows with the keyboard. How can I do this?  <answer127918> you would need to create a new instance of the application via terminal: br/  In general it is simply :  pre open -a 'application' -n /pre  But for Google Chrome it is:  pre /Applications/Google\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\ Chrome --user-data-dir=my-profile-dir /pre  that gives you the ability to switch between two windows in full screen mode that are completely seperate from each other. But i requires some sort of new user, also discussed here on SuperUser : https://superuser.com/questions/415531/how-can-i-have-multiple-browsing-sessions-in-google-chrome  And regarding the ability to switch the full screen-Apps: You know that you can switch between them with CTRL+Arrows (Left+Right = Switching Application) (Up + Down = Overview) ?  <answer233421> I know this post is old, but I came across it in Google when I was looking for a solution myself.  Maybe someone else will look here too.  I have found an answer by using the free app Hyperswitch   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MjQga.png" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3la4y.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  This engages a strongwindow/strong switcher (fullscreen instances included) using cmd+`   It operates the same way as the normal mac cmd+tab strongapp/strong switcher.  I also went to System Preferences--Keyboard and redefined the Mac OS "move focus to next window" command to kbdCmd/kbd + kbdShift/kbd + kbd`/kbd  Then I tied that kbdCmd/kbd + kbdShift/kbd + kbd`/kbd keystroke to a trackpad gesture using BetterTouchTool. This allows me to also retain that "move focus to next window" functionality.  Here is Hyperswitch: bahoom.com/hyperswitch  Here is BetterTouchTool: www.boastr.net/downloads/  <answer233425> A bonus method if you want to do this entirely with trackpad instead: I forgot to mention that HyperSwitch also adds this functionality into the mac's built in kbdCMD/kbd+kbdTab/kbd app switcher.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/AZxwZ.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  You need to enable the setting in HyperSwitch to display window previews on the app switcher.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KLoms.png" alt="enter image description here"  Again, using BetterTouchTool, I used a trackpad gesture to trigger the application switcher. This BetterTouchTool gesture makes the switcher stay open until you click on something, so you can switch windows entirely with trackpad.   <comment149896> This doesn't work. This command just puts one of my open sessions in focus. Also, this is not always a solution since individual windows of an app are not always separate instances (I edited/simplified my question) <comment149898> I edited the answer, is it now working ? <comment149900> It might work, but I do not know what to put for --user-data-dir=my-profile-dir.  Also, this is not a scalable solution. I use several programs that I use with different windows (Sketch, Android Studio, Terminal, etc). It will not always be possible to launch new windows in this way, nor would I ever want to. Thanks for the input though. <comment149901> I also edited the answer regarding keyboard shortcuts, I thought you might be aware of it, but if not, try the CTRL+Arrows Solution).. That is all I know.. Switching Apps in general with CMD+TAB+Arrows | Switching the windows with CTRL+TAB | Switching in FUll Screen with CTRL+Arrows. <comment206283> It drives me bananas that they broke cmd-tilde for fullscreen mode then pushed fullscreen functionality so hard.  I'm currently: making _everything_ fullscreen and using 3-finger lateral swiping to switch.  This is not ideal as I don't want _everything_ fullscreen, but at least it treats all windows equally, same app or different app.  The one thing I miss from Windows (pre Win8) was their equal treatment of all windows when alt-tabbing.  That's just simpler.
