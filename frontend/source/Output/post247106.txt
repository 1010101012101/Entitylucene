Extracting multiple photos from a single quickly <body> I recently went through the process of scanning old photo albums (in an effort to preserve them longer digitized). I would place 2/3/4 photos on the scanner. Now I need to extract the single photos. It would also help if there was an application to quickly recognize the rectangles.  N.B.: I'm running the latest beta of Sierra.  <answer248088> You could use ImageMagick or NetPbm tools to crop the photos from a script, but it isn't going to automatically detect the rectangle edges.  Lay out your photos in roughly the same place every time you scan them. Leaving a small gap between the photos would give you a safety buffer; the resulting scanned/cropped photos will just have a white border around them.  <comment304870> Have you tried using Photoshop? I believe there's a way to do it in there. <comment304871> @NoahL Afraid I don't have the budget for Photoshop <comment304872> if you think it's worth trying, they have a 30-day free trial (you don't need to enter a credit card number or anything)
