Transfer statistics per process or destination, not interface <body> I would like to log upload statistics for an application I run on my Mac.   Now, I know that with codenetstat -ib/code I can access statistics per network interface. I also know that with codelsof -i/code I can get a list of which connections each of the processes is maintaining. And finally I know that with codeiftop/code I can monitor in real time how much is flowing between my machine and a remote address. But none of this achieves what I am looking for.   I am looking to get columns similar to the codeIbytes/code and codeObytes/code columns I get from codenetstat -ib/code, but get those for a specific remote network address OR for a specific local process ID.   <answer238270> Best I've been able to come up with myself is to write a script that runs codeiftop -f "dst net REMOTE_IP" -t/code in the background, redirecting the output, and after a certain timeout kills the process, and then grep/awk my way through the redirected output. Hardly elegant.
