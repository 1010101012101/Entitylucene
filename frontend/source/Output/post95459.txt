macports is not uninstalling a package <body> Earlier today, I tried using codeMacPorts/code to install codegnutar/code.  By doing the following  precodesudo port install gnutar /code/pre  But now I've decided I didn't want to do this.  So I tried to uninstall by doing  precodesudo port uninstall gnutar /code/pre  but the binaries are still in place and functioning.  Why wasn't it uninstalled?  <answer95544> Most likely you have another port installed that depends on codegnutar/code, so the uninstall command didn't remove it. Run  precodeport dependents gnutar /code/pre  to see if this is the case (codesudo/code is not required for some codeport/code actions like codelist/code, codeinstalled/code, codedependents/code, etc.). If you want to uninstall everyone,   precodesudo port uninstall --follow-dependents gnutar /code/pre  will do the trick, but obviously could lead to unintended consequences, as all the dependents of all the dependents will be uninstalled, recursively, and you could end up decimating your port collection. Only do this if you know exactly what you're doing. codegnutar/code is fairly small and unobtrusive, so if you can't easily get rid of it you won't be that bad off in terms of disk space.
