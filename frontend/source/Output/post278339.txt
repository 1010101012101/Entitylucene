Launchd will not execute plist. Where am I going wrong? <body> I am trying to create a plist for a unix executable. The executable works perfectly well when I run it in Terminal. However I simply cannot get it to run from launchd. Here are the steps I took:  precodesudo touch /Library/LaunchDaemons/Parity.plist  sudo nano /Library/LaunchDaemons/Parity.plist /code/pre  Then I input the following data:  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt; &lt;!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple Computer//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN"   "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"&gt;   &lt;plist version="1.0"&gt;     &lt;dict&gt;       &lt;key&gt;Label&lt;/key&gt;         &lt;string&gt;Parity&lt;/string&gt;       &lt;key&gt;ProgramArguments&lt;/key&gt;         &lt;array&gt;           &lt;string&gt;/usr/local/Cellar/parity/1.5.12/bin/parity&lt;/string&gt;           &lt;string&gt;start&lt;/string&gt;         &lt;/array&gt;       &lt;key&gt;RunAtLoad&lt;/key&gt;         &lt;true/&gt;       &lt;key&gt;KeepAlive&lt;/key&gt;         &lt;true/&gt;    &lt;/dict&gt; &lt;/plist&gt; /code/pre  If I run:  precodesudo launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/parity.plist /code/pre  I get the response:  precode/Library/LaunchDaemons/Parity.plist: service already loaded   /code/pre  Does anyone have any suggestions?  <answer278379> It turns out that the cause of the error was a poorly written plist - code&lt;string&gt;start&lt;/string&gt;/code was instructing the exec file to run a codestart/code command when initiating the daemon, which was causing it to crash. I erased that line from the plist and now it behaves as I had intended.  <comment350245> you have to unload it first:  `sudo launchctl unload...` then load it again `sudo launchctl load...` <comment350246> @Allan Thanks for your reply. I followed your advice, but it unfortunately has not made any difference. Do you have any other ideas? <comment350249> Try removing it `sudo launchctl remove...` to remove it.  Then reload. <comment350253> @Allan Unfortunately that didn't work either. However I have found that when I run `launchctl list` I get `- 1 Parity`. Everything else has a 0 next to it. <comment350264> That means the program or script exited with an error so the plist is loading, it's just Parity is erroring out.  What does the log for Parity say? <comment350265> @Allan You're right about that. I got to the bottom of it. I wrote a bad .plist, and had to delete `stringstart/string`. It works perfectly now. Thank you for your help. <comment350280> Glad I could help.  Post your solution as an answer so you can "accept it" and I can vote you up for some reputation points. <comment350292> @Allan I updated my post with the solution. Thanks again for your help. <comment350295> @klanomath My apologies. I am new here. I have now added the answer.
