Paralells Desktop changes default Application to play .mp4 files <body> Even though I have selected the option "Always Open with" Quicktime Player for my .mp4 files. The changes never take effect and instead when I open a video, parallels desktop launches Windows Media Player.  Is anyone experiencing the same problem?  Any help is appreciated.  Thanks  <answer31814> Have you tried same with Info (Cmd-I). This is better way to change default program. Also I've stopped sharing anything else than folders between Windows &amp; Mac since upgraded to Parallels Desktop 7. It helps much also.  <comment36177> Have you tried same with Info (Cmd-I).
