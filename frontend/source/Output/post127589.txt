Is it possible to watch mp4s on an iPod Nano 6th Gen? <body> I have tried to upload .mp4s to my iPod before, but all it would do is show a screenshot of the video and play the audio. Is there a way to actually watch the video and have the audio play as well?  <answer129043> a .Mp4 is not a video format per say, but rather a container.  The audio and video content are then encoded with different codecs and placed into the container.  What matters is the codec that it is encoded with.  Since the video is not playing but the audio is, I'd guess the video codec is not compatible..    I believe the only format that ios devices support is the H.264 codec.  In order to get your video to play, you will need to convert the video file into a format that the ipod can play.  There are many software packages available that can do this job for you.  Some are free, and some are not.  You might look at handbrake.  <answer129110> indeed jamkrillin is right, the iPod can play video files encoded in H.264 which refers to the M4V format and not to the the MP4 one. Therefore, I doubt you would be able to play the video track you have in mind on your iPod.   Having said this, it is worth trying the following:  MP4 videos and for that matter MOV videos too are encoded instead in MPEG-4 format. You can download these sample video files from Apple and try adding them to your iPod to get a clear idea of what the iPod can play and what not: http://support.apple.com/kb/ht1425  Try adding the video files from your computer to the iPod with this iTunes alternative which allows a sync-free transfer to the device for only the video tracks you choose without the usual iTunes bull (i.e. preparing to sync, backing up ipod, etc).  <answer129198> The 6th Generation iPod Nano does not support video decoding or playbacksup1/sup.   However, it can emdemux/em video files and play any supported emaudio/em streams in those filessup2/sup. Instead of the video stream, it displays a single keyframe. This is useful for music videos or podcasts, where you might still want to listen to the audio only, but it's not the same thing as full video playback.  Note that the 5th- and 7th-gen both support video decoding and playbacksup3/sup; its omission from the 6th-gen seems to be an anomaly.  sub sup1/sup Sources: everymac.com, apple.com, wikipedia.org.br / sup2/sup Source: ilounge.com.br / sup3/sup Sources: 5th-gen, 7th-gen. For those devices, handbrake is a great option, as per @iamkrillin's answer.br / /sub  <comment151069> After I convert the file how do I get the file from my iTunes to my iPod? <comment151070> Drag the converted file into iTunes  Movies. <comment151074> @IconDaemon I tried that and then synced my iPod but it would not show up. <comment151144> indeed, handbrake will work.
