Are all four SO-DIMM slots user-accessible in the 27 inch iMac (Late 2012)? <body> I'm going to buy a new 27" iMac, but I think that the RAM on the Apple Store is really too expensive.  My plan is to buy with minimum (2x4GB) RAM and replace everything with 4x8GB.  Are strongall 4 slots/strong designed to be user accessible, removable and replaceable?  <answer74261> The Tech Specs page on the Apple site states:     8GB (two 4GB) of 1600MHz DDR3 memory; four user-accessible SO-DIMM   slots      Configurable to 16GB or 32GB.   so yes, all four slots are user accessible.  <comment86351> Yeah I think it's only the 21" iMac that "forces" you to buy the RAM from Apple (RAM slots under the logic board or something like that).
