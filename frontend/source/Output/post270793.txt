No green light on Mid 2011 13" MBA, continues to charge. Why is it not on? Could this be an issue with the SMC? <body> My magsafe charger has no green light, but my mac is charging. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/09tQO.jpg" alt="No green light"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KXvvM.jpg" alt="Mac charging still"  I have tried a SMC reset and still, no green light.   <answer270915> Please try the following to reset the charging options:  ul liShut down your Mac./li liUnplug the MagSafe or USB-C power adapter from your computer./li liUsing the built-in keyboard, press Shift-Control-Option on the left side of the keyboard, then press the power button at the same time. Hold these keys and the power button for 10 seconds./li liRelease all keys./li liReconnect the power adapter./li liPress the power button again to turn on your Mac./li /ul  <comment340377> I'm not sure what you are asking. The light should be orange while charging, right. Did you try a different charger / different Mac? <comment340379> the charger works on all other computers, what i am asking is, why is my charger neither green or orange, I am aware that this could be an issue with the SMC, why cant you understand what I am asking? <comment340380> because there is no question ;) <comment340381> just poking in the dark here: did you try cleaning the connections and does the issue persist when you connect the Magsafe the other way around? <comment340383> oh and what happens when the battery is full? <comment340385> sometimes it will come on, right now typing this it came on, but it is green, my percentage is 97%, I thought it is orange until fully charged. <comment340391> For all intensive purposes, 97% **is** fully charged. About the no show of light, how'd you do the SMC reset? My [question](http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/256507/205310) about how to do a SMC reset may help. <comment340397> According to Apple's website.
