OSX Lion 10.7.3 FREEZES on Macbook pro 13'' 2009 <body> I've got a macbook pro 13" mid 2009 and I upgraded to OSX Lion immediately when it came out. Never had any problem with it. Also I upgraded to 8 Gb a few weeks ago (because I use a virtual machine (win 7) + Adobe applications at the same time) and that seemed to work just fine.  Since a week or so, the OS seems to freez all the time. Just typing this message it happened more than 6 times.  By Freeze I mean that the system doesn't seem to react for 10 seconds or more, and sometimes it shows the spinning wheel (waiting sign).  I did a clean install of Lion yesterday, but this didn't solve the problem. Any ideas?  <comment56659> I'd point the problem to two possible culprits: 1) Faulty Memory. 2) Hard drive failingâ€¦ <comment56689> Is there a way to test the hard drive? Because I am almost certain it's not the memory failing. <comment61705> I'd take it to an appstore so the genius can run the diagnostics
