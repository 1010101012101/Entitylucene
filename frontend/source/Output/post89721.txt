Swap Mouse Button using AppleScript <body> I use mouse with left-hand. My system is shared with other people who are right handed. So, I need frequently to switch mouse button.  I would like to know how to swap mouse button using AppleScript? I am using default mouse come with my iMac machine.  <answer89725> I only tested this with the normal version of the preference pane, and it doesn't probably work if you have a Magic Mouse:  precodetell application "System Preferences"     reveal pane "com.apple.preference.mouse" end tell tell application "System Events" to tell process "System Preferences"     tell radio group 1 of window 1         if value of radio button 1 is 1 then             click radio button 2         else             click radio button 1         end if     end tell end tell /code/pre  The setting is stored in this key, but I don't know any way to apply changes to it immediately:  precodedefaults -currentHost read -g com.apple.mouse.swapLeftRightButton /code/pre  You could also use KeyRemap4MacBook:  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt; &lt;root&gt; &lt;item&gt; &lt;name&gt;test&lt;/name&gt; &lt;identifier&gt;test&lt;/identifier&gt; &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::F1, VK_COMMAND | ModifierFlag::NONE, KeyCode::VK_CONFIG_TOGGLE_swapbuttons&lt;/autogen&gt; &lt;/item&gt; &lt;item&gt; &lt;name&gt;swapbuttons&lt;/name&gt; &lt;identifier vk_config="true"&gt;swapbuttons&lt;/identifier&gt; &lt;autogen&gt;__PointingButtonToPointingButton__ PointingButton::LEFT, PointingButton::RIGHT&lt;/autogen&gt; &lt;autogen&gt;__PointingButtonToPointingButton__ PointingButton::RIGHT, PointingButton::LEFT&lt;/autogen&gt; &lt;/item&gt; &lt;/root&gt; /code/pre  See the source for the key code values and predefined settings.  <comment105394> Thanks for the reply. I got the error error "System Events got an error: Access for assistive devices is disabled." number -1719 from window 1 of process "System Preferences" <comment105395> You just have to enable access for assistive devices in the accessibility preference pane. <comment105396> Now I am getting "System Events got an error: Canâ€™t get radio group 1 of window 1 of process \"System Preferences\". Invalid index." number -1719 from radio group 1 of window 1 of process "System Preferences" <comment105397> It has drop down under Secondary Click in Point & Click tag. <comment105403> As mentioned in your answer, my mouse is Magic mouse and it is not working for it. <comment105404> I don't have a Magic Mouse to test with, but you could try something like [this script](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11680778/how-to-use-applescript-to-toggle-the-language-setting-of-new-dictation-tool-10/11720145#11720145).
