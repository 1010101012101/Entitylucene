According to iFixit's teardown the Philips #00 should be used for the "lower case". Is the lower case a synonym for the "back cover"?  <answer56516> h2Yes./h2  The back cover is secured with Philips #00 screws.  Note that is says:     The lower case is secured by strongten/strong Phillips #00 screws.   You can see the ten screws on the back cover:  ul lifour each at the top/bottom/li lione each on the left/right/li /ul  <answer100243> The screws are pentalobes and should not be mixed by Philips or torx. If you usa a torx screwdriver you will damage the screws and in worst case you'll make them flat and you will not be able to unscrew them.   More info on pentalobes: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentalobe_screw  <answer199727> Its a pentalobe on the Mid 2012 Macbook Pro retina.
