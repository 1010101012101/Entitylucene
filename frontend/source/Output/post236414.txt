iTunes Match - i thought it gave you back all your Music storage? <body> So I sign up for iTunes Match and expected to see all my music storage- on my phone-go down to zero Gb, so i could use the storage space for other things.  Naive i guess.  So am I correct that every time i want to listen to something on my Cloud Music/iTunes Match, that it downloads to my phone and then stays there taking up storage??  And can I, every so often,n just delete that Music storage under General settingsStorageMusic and wipe it back to zero?  Is there a downside on doing this?  I was hoping to use my recouped storage space from music for stuff like more photos or other.    <comment289305> It should give you back some space.  It will match any song you have as long as it's available in the Match library.  When you want to play a song from Match, it's streamed to your device.
