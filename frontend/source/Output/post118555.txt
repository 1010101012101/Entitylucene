How can I retrieve the complete "Documents and Data" from iCloud to my Mac? <body> Is there a way to get to complete "Document and Data" to the Mac? img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/oI9bJ.png" alt="enter image description here" P.S.: All datas where uploaded via my ipad, most of it is in IBooks, a lot of Pdfs and ebooks (not from the store). The thing is 1) My ~/Library/Mobile Documents is nearly empty 2) My Ibook-app on the Mac is completely empty.  <answer118557> The folder's already on your Mac. Your data is accessible in strong~/Library/Mobile Documents/strong.
