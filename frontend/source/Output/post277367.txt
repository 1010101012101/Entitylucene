How can I modify vsftpd.conf in macOS? <body> I've installed codevsftpd/code via Homebrew, and I found that the codevsftpd.conf/code file should be modified in order to set write_enable=yes and put file.  I googled and tried to find codevsftpd.conf/code in my MacBook, but I couldn't find where it is.  Generally, in Unix and Linux, codevsftpd.conf/code exists in code/etc/vsftpd//code but I cannot locate that directory in my computer.  Could you tell me where codevsftpd.conf/code is in macOS?  <answer277368> You should have gotten the following output while installing codevsftpd/code:  precodeTo use chroot, vsftpd requires root privileges, so you will need to run   sudo vsftpd. You should be certain that you trust any software you grant root privileges.  The vsftpd.conf file must be owned by root or vsftpd will refuse to start:   sudo chown root /usr/local/etc/vsftpd.conf  To have launchd start vsftpd now and restart at startup:   sudo brew services start vsftpd Or, if you don't want/need a background service you can just run:   sudo vsftpd /code/pre  So your codevsftpd.conf/code file is in code/usr/local/etc/code.  <comment349152> thanks! i didn't read output you wrote ....
