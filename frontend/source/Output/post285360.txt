Missing dock icons <body> I've got an issue with my new MacBook Pro 15â€³ (bought it two weeks ago).  Some icons are missing from the Dock:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/19r5V.png" alt=""  The first one is Terminal, and the second one is Todoist  If I close and reopen the application it fixes the issue, but it reappears quite often.  Do you know what could be wrong with my Mac?  Here are the specs:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GcyPg.png" width="262"  <answer285621> Current best answer to my problem thanks to bjbk's comment:  Moving an app to a new location within the dock fixes the issue temporarily.  <comment359824> What have you tried?  Control click and keep in dock. Or drag to new location on the dock when the app is running. <comment359825> Thanks for your reply. I will try it when the bug will happen again. Just temporarily fixed it with the command "killall dock" <comment360242> @bjbk You are right, when I move the app the icon is back. Do you have any fix for that? (even if your answer is a temporary fix) <comment360527> The issue is the opened app permanently belongs to the dock if you move it.
