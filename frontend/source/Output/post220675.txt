Scrollbars will not hide (MacBook Pro) <body> My scrollbars will not hide. I've set strongShow scroll bars/strong (in General) to strongWhen scrolling/strong, but it has no effect, and when I re-open System Preferences, the option has changed back to Always. Is this a known issue? I'm running OS X El Capitan (10.11.0) on an early 2011 MacBook Pro. I've tried rebooting, but the issue persists. Ideas?  <comment269162> Still having this problem... <comment272297> Stillllllllllll having this problem...
