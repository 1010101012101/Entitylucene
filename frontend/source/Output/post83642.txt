TextEdit keeps duplicating my text file and adding a strange extension <body> A lot of the time, when I open a file in TextEdit, such as codetest.txt/code, it will create another file codetest.txt.sb-d7bff531-E4qLT8/code in the same directory.   Why does it do this?  <answer83770> If you also get errors like this, it's probably the same issue I had.     strongThe document “temp.txt” could not be opened. You don’t have permission./strong      To view or change permissions, select the item in the Finder and choose File  Get Info.   There were messages like this in system.log, so it could be related to Versions or sandboxing:  precode9/13/12 10:41:55.118 PM TextEdit[357]: NSFileVersion tried to tried to add a new generation and failed.

It's based on a version of TextEdit that came with Lion, but it's still mostly identical to the current version.  <comment96285> Do you also get [error dialogs about not having permission to open files](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/63925/textedit-shows-dialogs-about-not-having-permission-to-open-any-files)? Is there anything relevant in system.log / the default view in Console.app? <comment96287> Are these files stored on a Mac-formatted drive or on NFS/FAT/SMB/whatever? <comment96296> Have you looked in side the file? I suspect it's the undo buffer. `cat test.txt.sb-d7bff531-E4qLT8` from a Terminal to see what's in it. <comment96417> @LauriRanta Yes, I get that error all the time.
