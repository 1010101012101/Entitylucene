Using the same Apple ID on private and business iPhone <body> I have a private and now a company iPhone. I like to have two phones to seperate business and private.  I need to install an app from the Apple Store on my business iPhone, so I need an Apple ID on this phone. Obviously, I already have a private one.  Currently, I do not sync any data with iCloud (but Google, which will not be configured on my business device), so I wonder if there is any disadvantage of using my private Apple ID on my business phone?   My company allows the use of a private Apple ID. In particular what I want to know, if I use my Apple ID will my company be able to influence or monitor anything on my private phone (iPhone search, etc).  <answer254621> You're able to switch between Apple ID's on 1 phone when you want to install a particular app. Just keep in mind what Apple ID your currently using when installing new apps.  <comment316975> If you are interested in keeping your business and personal life separate I suggest you create a business only Apple ID, otherwise you are mingling the two. Use a business only email address to establish the new ID. <comment316995> @DaveNelson's comment should be the correct answer.  That's the only way to keep the two IDs separate. <comment317150> @Dave: your comment is a pretty good answer: personnal practice since many years.
