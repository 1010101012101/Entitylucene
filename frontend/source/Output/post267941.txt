How tag emails in Apple Mail? <body> strongMy goal/strong?  To tag emails in OS X.   strongWhat I succeeded into/strong?  I use the Find command in /Users/MyMacAccount/Library/Mail/V3/ with a significative word contained in the email I am looking for, then I tag the email.  strongNote/strong:  After this I can easily find all tagged emails with the find command in Apple Mail. I think this tip could please a lot of users.  strongHow could it be done better/strong?  To right click on the email and directly locate it in the Finder.  strongNote/strong:  In past OS X (I am under 10.11.x El Capitan) it was possible to locate an email by command clicking on his title bar. A menu appeared with the actual path on the hard drive. It seems Apple disabled this so we can only see account's name.   strongWhat could I do instead/strong?  To use the colored flags in Apple Mailâ€¦ Frankly, who remembers why he or she colored one email in orange or purple ?     In the past, there was MailTags paid plugin, but it seem it wasn't updated for a long time.  I thought I could easily almost find recent emails if I sorted the V3 folder by Date but this is a slow process to be accomplished by the Finder.  strongAny better idea ?/strong  Thank you.  <comment372415> This is a good idea, and I hope that this will be implemented in a future release of Mail.
