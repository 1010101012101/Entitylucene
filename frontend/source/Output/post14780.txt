VPN connection in OSX fails after a certain amount of reconnects <body> When using a a IPSec VPN in OSX, I'm getting prompted to re-enter my password every ~45 minutes. After a certain amount of re-connects, no further connection will succeed. I have to restart the laptop by then, which means a restart a day.  Is there a way to reset the IPSec cache etc, so that I don't have to restart?  OSX, latest version, using www.witopia.net as provider.  <answer47522> This is actually a bug in Mac OS X, all Cisco IPSec connections have a timeout (hard limit of the lifetime) of 3600 second (60 minutes) because of the soft and hard limit of IPSec connections it is most of the time around 45 to 50 minutes.  You can check the files (with an active IPSec connection) in   precode/var/run/racoon/ /code/pre  for the limits. On a Terminal type  precodesudo more /var/run/racoon/*.conf /code/pre  and you can see the content of the config file for the strongactive/strong IPSec connection, all lifetime values are 3600 seconds  precodelifetime time 3600 sec /code/pre  The bug exists since a long time and is strongstill present for example in Mac OS X Mavericks (10.9.1)/strong. There is a workaround (more or less) for this check  Workaround  or  Apple Diskussion #2163407  or  Apple Diskussion #2743319  For Witopia it is easier to use the Mac OS X Client from Witopia  Witopia Client  <comment82380> Confirming this works now and happily enjoy my VPN.
