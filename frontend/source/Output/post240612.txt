Recover deleted partition space <body> I am having the exact same issue when it comes to not being able to reclaim space as in the answered question below...  Reclaim hard drive space from deleted partition and reclaim Apple bootloader  I went into terminal and compared my data to the solved and could not figure out which index I need to be focused on while in recovery mode.  And is there a way I can send a message or ask a question to a specific person on this site such as the person who had solved the above issue?  Please any help is really appreciated! Some Terminal info is below.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4Rygj.png" alt="terminal info"  <answer240628> Though similar to the linked question your partition table has some specific differences: you have a second Recovery HD with a false partition type and your main volume is part of a CoreStorage stack.  First you have to determine the proper system versions of the Recovery HDs and then remove the older or - if identical - remove the one with the wrong partition type (disk0s4). After removing one of the Recovery HDs you have to resize the CoreStorage stack:  strongPreparation:/strong  ul liRestart to Internet Recovery Mode by pressing kbdalt/kbd kbdcmd/kbd kbdR/kbd at startup.   The prerequisites are the latest firmware update installed, either ethernet or WLAN (WPA/WPA2) and a router with DHCP activated.br On a 50 Mbps-line it takes about 4 min (presenting a small animated globe) to boot into a recovery netboot image which usually is loaded from an Apple/Akamai server.  I recommend ethernet because it's more reliable. If you are restricted to WIFI and the boot process fails, just restart your Mac until you succeed booting.  Alternatively you may start from a bootable installer thumb drive (preferably Yosemite or El Capitan) or a thumb drive containing a full system (preferably Yosemite or El Capitan). If you boot to a full system and login as admin you have to prepend codesudo/code to execute some commands like codegpt .../code or codenewfs_hfs .../code!/li /ul  strongCheck system versions of Recovery HDs/strong  ul liOpen in the menubar Utlities-Terminal/li liEnter codediskutil list/code and codegpt -r show /dev/disk0/code to get an overview/li liGet the product version of the visible Recovery HD:  precodegrep ProductVersion -A 1 /Volumes/Recovery\ HD/com.apple.recovery.boot/SystemVersion.plist /code/pre  depending on the main system version it should yield something like:  precode&lt;key&gt;ProductVersion&lt;/key&gt; &lt;string&gt;10.11.5&lt;/string&gt; /code/pre/li liUnmount disk0s4:  precodediskutil unmount disk0s4 /code/pre/li liMount the hidden Recovery HD partition:  precodediskutil mount disk0s3 /code/pre/li liCheck that only one Recovery HD (disk0s3) is mounted:  precodedf /code/pre/li liGet the product version of the invisible Recovery HD:  precodegrep ProductVersion -A 1 /Volumes/Recovery\ HD/com.apple.recovery.boot/SystemVersion.plist /code/pre  depending on the main system version it should yield something like:  precode&lt;key&gt;ProductVersion&lt;/key&gt; &lt;string&gt;10.11.5&lt;/string&gt; /code/pre/li liIf the product version of the visible is the same or older than the one of the invisible Recovery HD delete the visible Recovery HD partition:  precodediskutil list diskutil umount diskX #Unmount the logical volume residing on disk0s2 with X: 1...~16 (e.g. disk1) like shown in the previous command diskutil umountDisk disk0 gpt remove -i 4 disk0 /code/pre/li liGet the UUID of the logical volume:  precodediskutil cs list /code/pre/li liResize the CoreStorage stack to fill the whole disk:  precodediskutil cs resizeStack lvUUID 0 #lvUUID: UUID of the logical volume /code/pre  The 0 (zero) as magical size sometimes fails.
