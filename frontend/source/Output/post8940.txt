How to get MacVim to autoload ~/.vim/syntax <body> This might be something quirky about MacVim, so I'll ask here.  I put a syntax file in code~/.vim/syntax/code, but it doesn't load. I have codesyntax on/code in my code.vimrc/code.  When I open the editor, code:scriptnames/code doesn't include the syntax file.   Is there anything else I need to do to make sure it loads?  <answer8945> Figured it out. It seems like files in $VIMRUNTIME/syntax are loaded based on the detected filetype when the actual file is loaded.  http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/syntax.html#syntax-loading  So I just renamed the file to the detected filetype, codelesscss/code, and it loaded fine.  <answer8971> In addition to relying on the detected filetype, which may be incorrect, there are at least two alternative ways to force loading of a particular syntax file.   ol liManually run the command code:set ft=lesscss/code/li liAdd the previous setting to a modeline near the beginning or ending of the file.  See code:help modeline/code./li /ol
