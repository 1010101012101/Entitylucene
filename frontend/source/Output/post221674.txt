Using an Italian Windows keyboard in remote management of iMac <body> I'm using TeamViewer on a Windows computer to control an iMac. The keyboard on my side is this, but I set it so that it works like this one (when I push kbd\/kbd I obtain `, when I push kbdShift/kbdkbd\/kbd I get ~, and so on).  At the beginning I thought it was unavoidable, so I started to get used to these changes (hard to do, since I write in LaTeX and the backslash is the most important non alphabetical character). Accidentally I changed the settings such that the keyboard is mapped in the right way, but I don't know how. So far, it's fine; then I unfortunately (and accidentally) turned things back, so I think it's the moment to understand how to manage this settings.  In System Preferences  Keyboard I see there's only the Italian keyboard. Furthermore, even if I add and select other keyboards, I always get ~ when I press kbdShift/kbd-kbd\/kbd (the original behavior).  Could the problem concern being connected remotely?  <answer221677> It was not a problem concerning TeamViewer, nor the preferences/settings of the Mac. Evidently I accidentally pressed kbdAlt/kbd-kbdShift/kbd, thus changing the keyboard input method in Windows from Ita to Eng. I realized this by simply visualizing the keyboard on screen and watching it change depending on which window was active.
