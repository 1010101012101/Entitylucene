There is a blog post I have dug up here  hr  my personal opinion on this is that it would be easy to delete an even when changing it to one hour earlier by draggin it up.  <comment41186> I don't have the iPhone anymore. But didn't this work?: Hold for a second. Then drag to the garbage can that pops up. <comment41187> @gentmatt I can drag, but looks like there is no garbage can or any place I can release it to delete.
