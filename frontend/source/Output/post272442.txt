Where can I find logs for failed sudo attempts on macOS Sierra? <body> I am aware that older versions of OS X use secure.log, but I have been unable to find any definite answers as to where the the output log goes for for attempting to run a command with sudo privileges on a non-admin account, on macOS Sierra. When we see the command feedback "this incident will be reported"; where is that reported to and how can I see it on macOS Sierra.  <answer276780> The sudo logs now go to the new unified logging system in macOS 10.12, which can be searched using the codelog/code command.  For example, to show all sudo logs from the last 3 hours:  precodelog show --style syslog --predicate 'process == "sudo"' --last 3h /code/pre  To search all sudo logs for messages containing the string "user NOT in sudoers":  precodelog show --style syslog --predicate 'process == "sudo" and eventMessage contains "user NOT in sudoers"' /code/pre  Use codeman log/code or codelog help show/code to learn more about how to use the command.
