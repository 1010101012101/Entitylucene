How to remote desktop to Windows 8 with email login? <body> How can I remote desktop to a Windows 8 machine using an email address login?  If enter my username as emmyusername@gmail.com/em and leave the domain blank I will be taken to the Windows 8 login screen and receive the login error:     h2Other User/h2      The username or password is incorrect. Try again.   When I press OK, the Windows 8 login screen will just show my username as emmyusername/em, and if I add em@gmail.com/em I can login.  The next time I open a remote desktop connection the client has split my user name up into:     User name: myusername      Domain: gmail.com   This also doesn't allow me to directly login and I get the same authentication error.  How can I preserve my username as emmyusername@gmail.com/em and login directly?  I am using Microsoft Remote Desktop Connection Client for Mac 2.1.0 on OS X 10.8.4.  <answer96029> Try adding code.\/code in front of your email address. I'm not familiar with Windows 8, but with previous versions this directs Windows to perform authentication on the local system, rather than on the domain in which it resides.  If this doesn't work, try also codehostname\/code, where codehostname/code is the name of the computer you are trying to log into.  <answer121858> Prefixing the email address with code.\/code will allow you to logon to the local system without a domain requirement:  precode.\username@gmail.com /code/pre  This is how I would use the email address codeusername@gmail.com/code to logon.  <answer135322> Use microsoftaccount as your domain, e.g.:  precodemicrosoftaccount\your@email.address /code/pre  Save your connection settings to an .rdp file, then edit it with a text editor and add the following line:  precodeenablecredsspsupport:i:0 /code/pre  Source1 Source2  If at this point the RDP connection complains about the lack of codeNetwork Level Authentication/code, you need to turn it off on the host machine (source):  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kLTAl.png" alt="Network Level Auth"
