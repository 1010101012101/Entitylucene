Script executes in terminal but not in Lingon <body> I have a script that executes well in Terminal but not through Lingon X.  This is what I have in "Run":   precode/bin/sh /Users/novski/Documents/Backups/skripts/restic-backup.sh /code/pre  The test button gives back: coderestic-backup.sh: line 31: restic: command not found/code  But if I go to Terminal and enter:  precodesh-3.2$ restic /code/pre  it opens the manual page of restic. So the PATH variables seems to be set correctly.  How come Lingon X does not execute it correctly?  <comment368100> On behalf of fd0: This is a typical PATH issue: in line 31 of your script add the absolute PATH to the restic executable (e.g. */usr/local/bin/restic* instead of *restic* only) <comment368154> absolutely correct. thanks.
