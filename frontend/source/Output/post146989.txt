iPhoto takes long time to import Photos and Videos <body> From a software standpoint why iPhoto sometimes takes so long to import Pictures and Videos?  Example Scenario:  on the iPhone 5 - iOS 7 there are:  2851 Photos in Camera Roll 1000 Photos in Photo Stream 51 Videos (each videos average of 3 minutes long)  on the MAC - OS X 10.9  iPhoto start to import photo, and more or less, after importing almost 500 photos, just get stop at one particular photo and thats it.  What are the reason?  Thank you
