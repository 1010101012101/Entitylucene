How to enable ssh proxy every time I resume desktop <body> I start ssh proxy by a command similar to the following when I login to the desktop.  precodessh -N awsproxy.vpc /code/pre  Also, I need to type this every single time I resume my desktop from sleep mode. Can you tell me any automated way to switch ssh proxy on if you know, please?  <answer95992> SleepWatcher will let you run shell scripts when the computer goes to sleep and wakes up.  There are step-by-step instructions at http://theglenbot.com/sleep-and-wake-scripting-osx/ but the premise is pretty simple, there's one script which runs when the computer is going to sleep, and another one which runs when it is waking up.  However, I would also recommend checking out Keyboard Maestro which can trigger events off system wake and a emlot/em of other criteria, and it's a lot easier and more fun to use.
