How to turn off icloud when no account has been set up by me <body> I updated my Phone 5S with ios8 mostly just to get rid of the Notification on my Settings Icon. Now every time I open the phone to use it I am asked to enter my iCloud password (yes, same as iTunes) and yet I have never established an iCloud account.   I can't find anything to help me to get rid of the bloody reminder.
