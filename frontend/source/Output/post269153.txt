MBP boot stuck at 100% loading screen <body> For a day now i can't boot my Mac El Capitan. It halts on this screen:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/chHdW.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  What I tried:   ul liNVRAM reset/li likbdCommand/kbdkbdR/kbd Disk Utility checked SSD, I can launch Terminal and browse the files on SSD/li liReinstall OSX; reinstall finished, but when it restarted it gives same result as on pic above./li liApple Hardware Test app didn't find failure/li /ul  Not sure if it's since an OSX software update. The loading bar goes fast as usual till ~70% then it slows down and goes to 100% in 2-3 minutes then nothing happens.   emUPDATE/em: Verbose mode stuck at "pci pause: SDXC"  Any other fix to try? ty  <answer269168> The problem is unsupported code.kext/code files and you need to remove them to get OS X to boot.  Just emmoving/em them to a different directy will have the same effect but will allow you to copy them back.  This article had the solution for me: OS X El Capitan 10.11.x Hanging on Boot  precodemount -rw / cd /Volumes/Macintosh\ HD/Library/Extensions/ mkdir Unsupported mv *.kext Unsupported reboot /code/pre  After solving that issue, I ended up with a black screen where I could only see my cursor.  If that happens to you, try the solution found here:  Black Screen But Can See My Cursor  <comment338116> Do you have an SD card inserted? <comment338162> I had when it started, however removing it didn't help. Why? <comment338166> Because SDXC has to do with the SD card slot and it would be a logical place to start your diagnosis. <comment374198> Just removing third party .kext files should be enough.
