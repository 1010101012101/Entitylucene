What should I be using instead of `dig`? <body> I stopped using codenslookup/code a decade ago because codedig/code superseded it. Now I'm creating custom files in code/etc/resolver//code and finding that everything works... except codedig/code (and nslookup).  Actually, strongI'd prefer to fix dig/strong than to use something else. I write a lots of scripts that use those common tools. I don't like having to code 2 different solutions.  <answer259597> How about codehost/code?  The codehost/code command is very similar to codedig/code except it's much more simple and doesn't have the very technical info (if you don't need it).  So, for example, a codehost/code lookup would look something as follows:  precode$ host apple.stackexchange.com  apple.stackexchange.com has address 151.101.129.69 apple.stackexchange.com has address 151.101.193.69 apple.stackexchange.com has address 151.101.65.69 apple.stackexchange.com has address 151.101.1.69 /code/pre  You can also specify which DNS server you want to use by adding it to the command:  precode$ host apple.stackexchange.com 8.8.8.8 Using domain server: Name: 8.8.8.8 Address: 8.8.8.8#53 Aliases:  apple.stackexchange.com has address 151.101.193.69 apple.stackexchange.com has address 151.101.129.69 apple.stackexchange.com has address 151.101.1.69 apple.stackexchange.com has address 151.101.65.69 /code/pre  And if you absolutely need it, you can add code-a/code to get the same output as a codedig/code command:  precode$ host -a apple.stackexchange.com 8.8.8.8 Trying "apple.stackexchange.com" Using domain server: Name: 8.8.8.8 Address: 8.8.8.8#53 Aliases:  ;; -&gt;&gt;HEADER&lt;&lt;- opcode: QUERY, status: NOERROR, id: 26262 ;; flags: qr rd ra; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 4, AUTHORITY: 0, ADDITIONAL: 0  ;; QUESTION SECTION: ;apple.stackexchange.com.
