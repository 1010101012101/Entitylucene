Is it possibile have different files in different desktop? <body> i'm new with mac, the multiple "space/desktop" function is very cool, but it would be better if i could have different files and folder on each of my space.   For example, i want to set up a space for programming works only, and put on desktop only related to this task files. can i ? is there a way to do it?   <comment108818> On the surface, it isn't setup to easily do this. Desktops are very app-centric, and not file-centric. I'm not saying there isn't a way to rig it, though. However, I think using a Desktop as a folder of itself, may not be the best organization tool. Instead perhaps it would be better to put the programming folder (with all the projects inside) on the Finder sidebar? <comment108823> maybe you're right, thank you!
