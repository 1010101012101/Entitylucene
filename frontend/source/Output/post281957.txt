unload nfsd - Operation not permitted while System Integrity Protection is engaged <body> While I was trying to unload my codenfsd/code instance I found out that I cannot do it anymore.  precodesudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.nfsd.plist  /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.nfsd.plist: Operation not permitted while System Integrity Protection is engaged /code/pre  This behaviour was introduced with the Mac OS Sierra update 10.12.4.   How can I enable/disable the nfsd daemon?   Should I disable the System Integrity Protection, stop/start the service and enable the System Integrity Protection every time? And, if yes, how?  <answer284633> Firstly, you'll need to disable the "System Integration Protection":  How to Disable System Integrity Protection  And now, you'll be able to disable your "Notification Center":  precodelaunchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.notificationcenterui.plist /code/pre  And then, kill the current instance of "Notification Center":  precodekillall NotificationCenter /code/pre  When you reboot, isn't necessary to do that anymore...  I hope I've helped  PS: Don't forget, at this point your root user will have all permissions. I recommend to reboot into recovery mode one more time to enable your System Integration Protection:  precodecsrutil enable /code/pre  <comment357362> [try Googling it](https://www.google.com/search?q=Operation+not+permitted+while+System+Integrity+Protection+is+engaged) <comment358939> Not sure if I have understood your answer. My question was about how to disable `nfsd` aka [network file system daemon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_File_System), so what's Notifications Center?
