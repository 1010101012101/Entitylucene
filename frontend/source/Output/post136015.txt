Time Machine menu bar Icon Location <body> I'm trying to find the Time Machine menu bar icon resource so I can change how it looks a bit. Where is that icon? In Time Machine's package contents  resources, all I see is codebackup.icns/code (the Finder icon), codemenu.plist/code, and 33 code.lproj/code folders for different languages. In the English folder is a single file called codeMenu.strings/code.  <answer136017> The Time Machine menu bar item is located at:  precode/System/Library/CoreServices/Menu Extras/TimeMachine.menu/ /code/pre  The menu bar item uses four PDFs for the four different icon states, in codeContents/Resources//code:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NvS0Y.png" width="100" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/aoyZR.png" width="100" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/v1IK2.png" width="100" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DDF4h.png" width="100"  supAbove icons from OS X 10.10 Yosemite DP2/sup  <comment161260> Are these out of OS X Yosemite? Cause on my Mavericks these certainly look different â€¦ <comment161264> @Asmus Yes they are. The menu bar item itself looks the same as it was in Mavericks as far as I can remember though.
