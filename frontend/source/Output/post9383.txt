How can I control an app on my iOS device from Mac or PC <body> I would like to take control of my app on an iOS device (mostly an iPhone) from my MacBook Pro or Windows, doesn't matter which one.  I know that it can be accomplished via Veency, and that's exactly what I need - but I do NOT want to jailbreak my iPhone.  Is there a similar legal alternative?  If not - is it something I could develop perhaps, or will I run into some SDK limitations for such a thing?  <answer9387> All iOS SDK apps work within a security sandbox, and thus have no access or control over any other apps (with a few tiny exceptions for registered URLs). You could take control of you own app, but no others, including Apple's, on a stock OS device.  <answer200985> Turn on Home Sharing using Remote  1.Connect iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch to a Wi-Fi network on the same local network as your Mac, PC, or Apple TV.  ol start="2" liOpen the Remote app on your iOS device./li liTurn on Home Sharing from the Remote Settings screen./li liSign in to the same Apple ID you used on your other devices./li /ol  <comment9901> Generally, if the only solution you can find is a jailbreak solution, it's the only solution. As hotpaw2 said (accept that answer), the sandbox nature of stock iOS disallows anything like this. You can control a Mac or PC from an iOS device, but not the other way around. <comment9957> Plus the motto of jailbreaking is exactly what you requested: "take control of your iOS". And [it's not illegal](http://www.cnet.com/8301-17918_1-20011824-85.html) for quite some time now. <comment10011> Actually, I really just need to control my own App, for testing purposes. I'll comment below. <comment10012> Thanks! I should clarify - I do want to control my Own App mostly, for automatic testing purposes.  So how do I do that? What is needed on iOS and on PC/Mac? <comment284196> He wants to control his iOS device from a desktop PC, Remote works the opposite way
