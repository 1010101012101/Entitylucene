How can I make the enter key on my extended keyboard act as return only? <body> For some reason sometimes the numeric kbdenter/kbd key acts as kbdreturn/kbd and sometimes it doesn't. (I'm talking of the last key on the keyboard, the one with the "k" symbol tilted towards left.)  I'd like to be able to use it as the regular kbdenter/kbd.  Do you know any tip in order to fix this? At the moment it is totally random. My guess is that some software  I use remaps the kbdenter/kbd into kbdreturn/kbd, but I've not been able to point to which one.  <answer38026> You've got your assumption a tiny bit mixed up. It's not that some software remaps the kbdenter/kbd into kbdreturn/kbd, it's that some software strongtreats/strong an kbdenter/kbd as a kbdcarriage return/kbd and some doesn't.  They strongare/strong two different keys with two differnet histories. One is kbdenter/kbd and one is kbdcarriage return/kbd and they perform different functions.  I hate referencing wikipedia but hell, here ya go ... Differences between Enter and Return.  Usually most programs assume they are the same key - some don't. The AppleScript Editor for example uses kbd&#x2318;/kbd+kbdenter/kbd to force a script parse.  <answer38108> Use Ukelele to create a new keyboard layout that maps the kbdenter/kbd key to kbdreturn/kbd.  Open Ukelele and select emFile » New From Current Input Source/em. Select emKeyboard » Edit Key…/em and confirm to press the key. Then, press kbdenter/kbd. You will be asked what character to replace it with. Enter code&amp;#x000d;/code and confirm.  Optionally assign a new name to your keyboard using emKeyboard » Set Keyboard Name…/em.  Select emFile » Save As…/em, navigate to code~/Library/Keyboard Layouts/code and assign any name.  Your new keyboard layout will be available in emSystem Preferences » Language &amp; Text/em. If you didn't change the name, you can recognize it by the missing flag icon (it's a keyboard icon instead).  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/34fQ7.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment43078> I can assure you that once it's automagically remapped to act as enter, it is across all programs. iterm2, chrome, textmate etc... <comment43082> True, and that's true for any key mapping in OSX but you lose the functionality that the enter key gives you in certain programs <comment43165> Hi, thanks for the nice explanation, I think I may have messed up my configuration. I followed step by step your answer, but the result is that my enter key now maps to the command button. I entered exactly &#000d; but it just resolves to command (⌘)(I am not sure if it was doing it before or not). I can now save a document pressing enter+s which of course is useless! <comment43173> @sathia If you press `Return` instead of `Enter` when asked to press the key you want to edit, what does the dialog say is its default mapping? It [looks like this for me](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Kdjm9.png), so I wrote that when remapping `Enter`, you need to enter exactly that. I can't imagine why it maps to `Command` for you. To revert changes, just enter `Enter`'s default value (`&#x0003`, displayed in the equivalent dialog). Please try again, it just sounds so odd... <comment43176> it's the same here: http://i.imgur.com/gh1hY.png but when I press the enter key, on the virtual keyboard of  Ukelele the command keys are lit... it's crazy! <comment43177> @sathia Could you try to reproduce this behavior on a new user account? Maybe something else interferes here. <comment43178> good point, i'll try later, now I need to stay logged for a while since I should be working :P I'll update later.
