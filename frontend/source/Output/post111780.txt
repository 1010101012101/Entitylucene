Preference files for system-wide configuration <body> Is it possible to set a system wide configuration for Java site permissions in Safari 6.1. I know that to set system wide preferences you have to have the plist file in the /Library/Preferences folder.  Can I just create a preference file and name it the same as the one in the user's library folder?  I am a bit lost at the moment. I am running OS X 10.8.5 right now and I am just not sure which way I need to go.
