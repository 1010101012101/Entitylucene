Automated iTunes tagging? <body> I'm looking for an app that alows me to quickly update tags from imported media in iTunes. Something like itunify used to when it was free.   Nothing that automagically analyses the music and downloads all lyrics. Just a tool that makes it easy for me to e.g. 'remove n characters from left' or 'switch title - author' etc.  <answer35694> You want Doug's AppleScripts for iTunes. Simply download the scripts and put them in:  precode~/Library/iTunes/Scripts /code/pre  Note: You'll likely have to create the folder. From there, you'll see the scripts pop in the iTunes menu.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WtG1i.png" alt="enter image description here"  His scripts cover everything from modifying play count to find and replace specific words in a song's given field.
