Select "Sent Items" on Outlook with Keyboard Maestro <body> Is there any way to have Keyboard Maestro select "Sent Items" on an app like Microsoft Outlook upon pressing a hot key?  I have tried with "Select Menu" and "Press Button" but none of these options seem to work.  <answer130940> h1Selecting Intractable GUI Elements with Keyboard Maestro/h1  This is one of the most useful aspects of Keyboard Maestro, the ability to manipulate a GUI which is not easily accessed by other scripting options. I'll explain how to use this routine to solve your question, but it can be used for just about anything else.  The recycable core of the method is a sequence of three strongactions/strong:  ol licodeFind Image on Screen/code./li licodeUse Variable/code in the codeto set the mouse location/code mode./li licodeMove or Click Mouse/code relative to the codecurrent mouse location/code./li /ol  Once these three strongactions/strong are dragged into your macro, you'll need to configure them slightly:  ol liTake a screenshot of the graphical element you would like to select using strong⌘-⇧-4/strong./li liDrag the screenshot into the codeFind Image on Screen/code box./li liTest it by hitting try with the codeDisplay/code box checked while the icon is on the screen./li liMake sure the same Variable is both set by codeFind Image on Screen/code and used by codeUse Variable/code./li liAdjust the → and ↓ distance so that the button is pressed, in case the image found is slightly larger than the hitbox./li /ol  And there you have it. This little block of strongactions/strong is completely modular, so try to think of other fun uses. Here's my final macro:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vH6Yp.png" alt="Select Sent Items Macro"
