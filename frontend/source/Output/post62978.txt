Can I install the preinstalled Mac OS X Mountain Lion on other Macs? <body> I just ordered a Mac that will be shipped with Mountain Lion. Is it possible to install Mountain Lion on my other Macs? Or do I have to buy an upgrade in the App Store?  <answer62980> No. The preinstalled copy of Mountain Lion is not licensed to be installed on additional machines.
