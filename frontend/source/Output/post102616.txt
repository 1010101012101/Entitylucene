iOS 7 screen is still shaking after reboot <body> I have tried changing the Parallax setting (generalaccessibilityreduce motion).  Still shaking!!  Weird thing...the shaking only appeared after re-booting my phone the first time after updating to ios 7.  After updating to iOS 7 initially, the screen did not shake.  Strange?  What can I do to resolve this?  <answer104646> I had it very bad since the upgrade - 24/7 - I changed my settings (General  Accessibility  Invert Colours) to invert the colours and it worked.  It's a bandaide but at least I can read my messages and mail.  My pictures however look like negatives..
