Can Automator pass multiple lines (e.g. from a shell script) to the New Mail Message action? <body> I have Automator running a shell script that ends with codecat "tempfile.txt"/code. The codecat/code command should output the contents of codetempfile.txt/code. The file codetempfile.txt/code contains just the following three paragraphs over five lines:     1st paragraph Lorem      2nd paragraph Lorem ipsum      3rd paragraph Ut enim   I have this chained in Automator to the "New Mail Message" action. The instructions for this action say that "If text is received from a previous action, the text is appended to the message."  The expected behavior is therefore that the body of the email message contains those three paragraphs. Instead, it contains only the thirdâ€”shown here:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/JEVWv.jpg" alt="screenshot of generated email"  Below is the relevant part of the workflow. In it we can see in the Results for the shell script that all three paragraphs are being passed to the "New Mail Action." Why does this not put all of the input text file into the message body?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/OquCy.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  strongUpdate (further info)/strong: If I swap in the "Create New Outlook Mail Message" action in place of the Mail.app action, all three paragraphs are successfully passed to the body of the new message in Outlook. However, they are passed without line breaks.  <answer285168> It looks like there may be a embug/em in strongNew Mail Message/strong emaction/em in strongAutomator/strong. If you are interested in an strongAppleScript/strong workaround, where the emoutput/em of the strongRun Shell Script/strong emaction/em is formed into the emcontent/em of the emnew mail message/em using strongAppleScript/strong emcode/em to create a emnew mail message/em, here's an example workaround.  In place of the strongNew Mail Message/strong emaction/em use a strongRun AppleScript/strong emaction/em, after the strongRun Shell Script/strong emaction/em, with the following example strongAppleScript/strong emcode/em:  precodeon run {input, parameters}     set theMessageContent to ""     repeat with i from 1 to (count of input)         set theMessageContent to theMessageContent &amp; item i of input &amp; linefeed     end repeat     tell application "Mail"         activate         set theMessage to make new outgoing message with properties {visible:true, content:theMessageContent}     end tell end run /code/pre  This creates a new message that looks like the following example image.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xginC.png" alt=""  If you need too, you can add additional emproperties/em, as in this example strongAppleScript/strong emcode/em:  precodeon run {input, parameters}     set theMessageContent to ""     repeat with i from 1 to (count of input)         set theMessageContent to theMessageContent &amp; item i of input &amp; linefeed     end repeat     tell application "Mail"         activate         set theMessage to make new outgoing message with properties {visible:true, subject:"Hello World", content:theMessageContent}         tell theMessage             make new to recipient at end of to recipients with properties {name:"John Doe", address:"johndoe@domain.com"}         end tell     end tell end run /code/pre  Obviously, you'll need to change the emvalue/em of the additional emproperties/em, and or add more emproperties/em then shown, to fit your needs. You can look in Mail's AppleScript Dictionary in Script Editor for additional applicable emproperties/em.  This creates a new message that looks like the following example image.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6162v.png" alt=""
