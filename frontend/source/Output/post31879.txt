Finder folders gone? <body> My codeFavourites/code sidebar has gone in codeAll My Files/code in codeFinder/code:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5EueT.png" alt="http://i.stack.imgur.com/IcWFY.png"  There is a thing which you can pull out from the side like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dAoYN.png" alt="http://i.stack.imgur.com/ogr6m.png"  but it doesn't have any of my codeFavourites/code in. But I have got them (it shows them in the codePreferences/code):  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QFzwv.png" alt="http://i.stack.imgur.com/vGwAP.png"  If I open a folder/disk, it does show them:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NRX5I.png" alt="http://i.stack.imgur.com/ZgrEx.png"  How do I get my codeFavourites/code back? I have Lion.   <answer31890> Try restarting finder by hitting CMD + OPTION (ALT) + ESC - Choose Finder and click restart.  If this doesn't work try performing a "Repair Disk Permissions" inside Disk Utility, and reboot.
