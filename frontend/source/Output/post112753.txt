How do I move all recent photos from iPhone to PC, but keep my favourites on my iPhone? <body> I regularly plug my iPhone into my Windows PC and 'Import photos and videos', and then delete them from the device, which is what I want.  But how can I select a few 'favourite' photos and keep those on the iPhone, without them getting removed when I do regular transfers to the PC of all my emnew/em photos?  <answer114003> Assuming you are using iTunes for syncing your phone, take a look at this article:br http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4236?viewlocale=en_US&amp;locale=en_US  It describes how you can sync photos from your PC to your iPhone.   So, if (for example) you keep a folder on your PC called emFavorite Photos/em, and have that folder selected to sync to your phone, it will always copy those photos to your phone, even after you remove all the pictures during an upload.
