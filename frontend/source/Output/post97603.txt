iMessage stopped working on Mac <body> Recently, iMessage won't sign in on my MacBook Air (10.8.4). I opened up Messages a couple of days ago, and my iMessage account was signed out. Upon trying to sign back in, I get a message reading:     The registering device does not have the appropriate credentials.   And login fails. Anyone else have this issue?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/U61V4.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer97688> Follow the steps listed on this page - http://support.apple.com/kb/TS4476  If that doesn't fix your problem, try checking your Date &amp; Time settings (Settings  Date &amp; Time). Make sure "Set date and time automatically:" is ticked, and that your time zone is correct.  <answer98845> The solution here in this thread is how I ended up fixing this:  https://discussions.apple.com/message/22624648#22624648  I updated the Flash player for OS X, then went to strongPreferences/strong &rarr; strongFlash Player/strong &rarr; strongAdvanced/strong and told it to clear all browsing data from the local storage cache. After this, I rebooted and was able to login to iMessage on the Mac without the error.  Dumb that this interferes with iMessage, but this did fix it.  <answer104027> Type:     killall imagent   in codeTerminal.app/code (in /Applications/Utilities) and then start iMessage and log in again.  That fixed the problem for me.  <answer217084> I had the same issue and I found out that somehow I was logged out from my account. Just check if that's the case with you. Open Messages application - click on Messages (on the left upper corner) - Preferences - select Accounts - and then, if you are logged out you will have to enter your iCloud password.  Hope this helps!  <comment114539> Make sure date and time is auto <comment122525> Terminal isn't the most beginner friendy, but to brave to go in and restart the specific process that runs the communications is a +1 in my book. <comment350224> Since the iMessage software doesn't ship anymore, I'll point this to messages.app.
