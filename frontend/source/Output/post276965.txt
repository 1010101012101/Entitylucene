Repeatedly asked to accept iCloud T&C <body> I have a new iPhone SE and have had it for about 5 days. I keep getting pop ups saying the iCloud terms and conditions have changed and to accept the new ones. I have done this several times and it still keeps coming up asking me to accept. How do I stop this from reoccurring as I have already done it?
