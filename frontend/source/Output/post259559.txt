Safari Can't Open the Page (Persistent Certificates Problem in Safari) <body> I'm getting the error message "Safari can't open the page because Safari can't establish a secure connection to the server." Yet the page runs perfectly on an iPad and other computers. I suspect a problem with Keychain/certificates but I can't pinpoint the problem. Any ideas?   Running macOS 10.12.1, and system date/time is correct.   <answer259609> I ended up solving this issue on my machine by following these instructions which seem to be different for 10.12 vs. prior versions of OS X. To summarize:  OS X 10.12  precodesqlite3 ~/Library/Keychains/*/ocspcache.sqlite3 'DELETE FROM ocsp;' /code/pre  For OS X 10.11 and earlier  precodesudo rm /var/db/crls/*cache.db /code/pre  <comment324753> Instead of saying  "_latest macOS update_" without any actual numeric designator, it's preferred that you actually state the version information, e.g macOS 10.12.1, so there is absolutely no ambiguity. <comment324755> can you tell us the page url you are talking otherwise no one can try to reproduce or even test if he gets the same error <comment324842> The URL is unsplash.com <comment324843> Worked like a charm.
