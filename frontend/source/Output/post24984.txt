Is there a way to reopen last windows when you launch TextMate in Lion? <body> I know TextMate isn't Lion optimised, but is there any way to do this?  <answer24991> As mentioned in the troubleshooting section you can achieve this by entering the following into your Terminal.app:  precodedefaults write com.macromates.textmate NSQuitAlwaysKeepsWindows -bool NO /code/pre  <answer97861> The latest build of TextMate 2 does this!  <comment28220> Just wait for TextMate 2.0 to be released :-) <comment28369> It works for single files, but not for projects that I created by drag and dropping folders. Does it work for you? <comment28447> I tested this with Folders and it doesn't work here either.
