Different Volume Level for Headsets and Headphones over Combo Jack <body> I have the Sony MDRX10. When I use the cable with the mic, I get lower volume level and distortions at max volume but when I use the headphone only cable, I get much better volume control.  I tried using both cables with my smartphone, and they both produce the same volume. Also, I tested with a portable amplifier connected to my Macbook and then the cable with mic; this gave the same output as the one without the mic.  This makes me think the problem is associated with Mac OS X.

So it is high likely that one of your cables is of low quality or just broken.  <comment218615> OK.  So what's your question?  I can guess what your question might be, but I should have to guess.  I encourage you to edit it to include all relevant information, and to ask a specific question.
