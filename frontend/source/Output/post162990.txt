open in tmux fails for all files <body> I'm having some trouble nailing down a problem I've had with Yosemite for a few weeks now - when I issue the codeopen/code command inside tmux, all files (PDFs, text files, applications, everything) fail to open with the error code -10810 for all files. Following result:  precode$ open Coda\ 2.app LSOpenURLsWithRole() failed with error -10810 for the file /Users/chris/Applications/Coda 2.app. /code/pre  This happens for all shells (bash, fish, zsh) but only when running under tmux. URLs like codeopen "http://google.com/code work fine too.   Anyone have any ideas? Here is my PATH:  precode/Users/chris/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.1.3/bin /Users/chris/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.1.3@global/bin /Users/chris/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.1.3/bin /usr/local/bin /usr/bin /bin /usr/local/sbin /usr/sbin /sbin /Users/chris/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.1.3/bin /Users/chris/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.1.3@global/bin /Users/chris/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.1.3/bin /usr/local/opt/coreutils/libexec/gnubin /Users/chris/.rvm/bin /opt/X11/bin /usr/texbin /Users/chris/Applications /code/pre  <answer236271> There seems to be a usernamespace problem if you want to open OS X apps inside tmux.  To fix that install with Homebrew:  precodebrew install reattach-to-user-namespace /code/pre  and put this inside your code~/.tmux.conf/code for the Bash shell:  precodeset-option -g default-command "which reattach-to-user-namespace &gt; /dev/null &amp;&amp; reattach-to-user-namespace -l /bin/bash || /bin/bash" /code/pre  after that you should be able to open files also in tmux.
