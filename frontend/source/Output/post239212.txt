Dell docking station D3100 with MacBook Pro <body> I am trying to setup 3 monitors with my MacBook Pro (Late 2013). I was wondering if anybody has tried this docking station with mac.   <answer239731> Yes, this worked for my MacBook Pro which is the Late 2013 model. You need to go to the DisplayLink website and download the driver for your Mac, the driver is called "DisplayLink USB Graphics Software for Mac OS X." Then reboot your Mac and then plug in the Dell D3100.
