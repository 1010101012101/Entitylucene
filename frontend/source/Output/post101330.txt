Itunes doesn't want to dispose played podcasts <body> I have a Podcast settings: ‚Keep all unplayed episodes‘ but Itunes doesn't want to dispose those played ones.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Tyhns.png" alt="19 episodes to dispose"  There are only 9 new unplayed episodes and 19 fully played episodes are fully to dispose. But Itunes doesn't want to do it even if I try the refresh.  I did also try to uncheck Default settings without change.   How to make Itunes to follow settings and keep only unplayed episodes on disk and dispose all those played?
