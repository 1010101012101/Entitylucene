Is there a way to create new desktop spaces from keyboard only? <body> We all know there is a way to to switch between desktops using keyboard shortcuts,  but can we create new ones using only the keyboard?  <answer88360> No, there isn't a way to create a new space with only the keyboard. You'd still need to use the mouse/trackpad to drag a window to the (+) desktop thumbnail in the top-right corner (or just click on it) to create a new space.  <answer256430> It is possible to create a new desktop space with the keyboard, but it's strongreally/strong cumbersome:  ul lienable Mouse Key toggle (5 times kbdalt/kbd) in System Preferences  Accesibility  Mouse &amp; Trackpad  Options  enable "Press the Option key..."/li lihit kbdF3/kbd/li lihit kbdalt/kbd 5 times/li limove the cursor with the respective keys and navigate near the right upper corner/li lihit either kbdi/kbd or kbd5/kbd (depending on your keyboard)/li lihit kbdalt/kbd 5 times/li lihit kbdF3/kbd and switch to the new space "with a keyboard shortcut"./li /ul  <answer256452> You can do it with some AppleScript. This will create a new desktop every time you run it:  precodetell application "System Events"     do shell script "/Applications/Mission\\ Control.app/Contents/MacOS/Mission\\ Control"     tell process "Dock"         set countDesktops to count buttons of list 1 of group 1         --new desktop         click button 1 of group 1         --switch to new desktop         repeat until (count buttons of list 1 of group 1) = (countDesktops + 1)         end repeat         click button (countDesktops + 1) of list 1 of group 1     end tell end tell /code/pre  You can save this as a Universal Service you can assign a globally-available shortcut key combination to call it.  Credit where credit is due.  <comment319886> Something that easy is not fair ;-) <comment319887> @klanomath you got an upvote from me for even attempting to do it without touching AppleScript! :D <comment319889> ;-) I upvoted you also, presenting a really clean and easy Apple Script answer
