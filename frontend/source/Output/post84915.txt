How to keep apps from adding themselves to login items? <body> Today, I noticed that there were several "login items" that I'm 99.99999% certain I did not add.  I figure those items added themselves when I installed them (they were probably installations that required authentication).  Of course, I can always check "login items" every time that I install an app (if the installer asked for authentication), but I'd prefer to lock "login items" altogether.  Is that possible?  <answer84938> Update*  if you do a get info on the ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginitems.plist file and tick the lock checkbox.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/OwPMQ.png" alt="enter image description here"  No changes will be written to the file. Therefor on next login there will be no additions.  I just tested this and it worked. But cannot guarantee that this may or may not be a good thing to do.  I my self will use my Answer below.  hr  You can set a launchAgent to watch for changes on the ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginitems.plist file  In my example here I use a launchAgent to watch for the change and then run a command to notify me. In this case I use the command tool growlnotify  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt; &lt;!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"&gt; &lt;plist version="1.0"&gt; &lt;dict&gt;     &lt;key&gt;Label&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;string&gt;loginItems&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;key&gt;ProgramArguments&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;array&gt;         &lt;string&gt;/usr/local/bin/growlnotify&lt;/string&gt;         &lt;string&gt;-n&lt;/string&gt;         &lt;string&gt;login items change&lt;/string&gt;         &lt;string&gt;-m&lt;/string&gt;         &lt;string&gt;login items change&lt;/string&gt;         &lt;string&gt;-s&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;/array&gt;     &lt;key&gt;WatchPaths&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;array&gt;         &lt;string&gt;/Users/USERNAME/Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginitems.plist&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;/array&gt; &lt;/dict&gt; &lt;/plist&gt; /code/pre  I actually made this using lingon which take some of the pain out of making launchAgent.  The command I run is :code/usr/local/bin/growlnotify -n "login items change" -m "login items have been changed" -s/code  Note this is a simple example. And you should remember that any changes may take a short while to be written to the plist. But my tests have shown it to work.   <answer84945> A simple solution:   Add that application to your dock. Right click on the dock icon - options - uncheck "open at Login".   If you don't want the application on your dock afterward, just drag it off.  <comment97823> Updated  my answer <comment97944> did you mean "launchAgent", not "lunchAgent"? <comment97948> lol. Clearly I was thinking of food at the time.. <comment265221> This worked for me, but I noticed that after running the offending app, it would initially appear under "login items" until I restarted my machine.
