Building mysql with readline instead of editline <body> I'd really like to be able to use readline instead of editline with the mysql client, but I can't find out how to do this.  The embottled/em mysql that brew installs by default for mavericks is using editline. There's no "readline" option in codebrew options mysql/code if I want to build if from source and it seems that I can't add this to the formula.  Has the readline support been dropped in mysql 5.6 ? Should I use rlwrap as a workaround or is there a better way to do this ?  Thank you.  <answer238228> I know this question is super old, but if you use MariaDB instead it will be built with readline support. MariaDB is a fork of MySQL. codebrew update &amp;&amp; brew install mariadb/code
