All files are not found when searching in the Finder <body> I have a folder at code/Applications/MAMP/htdocs/test/images/code which include swfs, called "Safari Documents" in Finder. Certain files were added to that folder today.  I also have other subfolders in htdocs that include swfs.  Then, when I am in htdocs, press âŒ˜ + F to search, and then choose other and type Safari I see a bunch of swfs, so I sort by added date, but the last added is 25th of September, even though I have added swf files to code/test/images/code today.   What could be the explanation for these files not showing up?
