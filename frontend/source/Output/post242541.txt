How do I kill a daemon and not have it open up again if I can't find it in the LaunchAgents or LaunchDaemons? <body> So I think I downloaded a program from Avatron called Airconnect. I'm not sure, but their website was purple when I looked it up. Anyway, now everytime I check my activity monitor, codecom.avatron.airconnect.daemon/code is taking at least 25% of my CPU. What have I done.  I tried looking up a solution online, and I realized it opens with launchd (I checked through activity monitor), so my research directed me towards codeSystem/Library/LaunchAgents/code, codeSystem/Library/LaunchDaemons/code, or codeLibrary/LaunchAgents/code. I tried looking through all of the folders, and I can't find the airconnect daemon. Please help me. I thought I was smarter than to get viruses. I am so disappointed in myself now.  <answer242549> Software you personally install typically puts its files in several places under your [username]/Library or ~/Library. While holding down the Option key, use the Finder's Go menu to open your Library folder. Check under ~/Library/Application Support, ~/Library/LaunchAgents &amp; ~/Library/Preferences for any files with Avatron or AirConnect in their names &amp; delete them. That should cure your problem. BTW- this isn't a virus.   <answer242568> The launch daemon of Avatron Airconnect is installed to /Library/LaunchDaemons. If you want to stop and remove it enter in Terminal:  ul liCheck if it is loaded:  precodesudo launchctl list | grep avatron /code/pre/li liUnload it:  precodesudo launchctl stop /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.avatron.airconnect.daemon.plist sudo launchctl unload -w /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.avatron.airconnect.daemon.plist /code/pre/li liTo remove it:  precodesudo rm /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.avatron.airconnect.daemon.plist /code/pre/li /ul  hr  After installing Avatron Airconnect you can uninstall the app from the Airconnect menulet! This should also remove the launch daemon.  <comment298548> Thanks A Bunch..I don't see it anymore!
