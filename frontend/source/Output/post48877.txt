How can I reinstall Lion so that the "Welcome" movie plays at first boot? <body> I'm preparing an old Macbook Pro for resale. I want to setup the Lion installation in a way so that the strongWelcome video/strong plays when the buyer boots the MBP for the first time.  How can I accomplish this?  <answer48878> You can't â€” sadly, strongLion has no welcome video!/strong  (However, you can reset a machine to the first-boot state by simply booting from the recovery partition, erasing the drive, and reinstalling Lion. See this thread for more instructions.)  <comment55949> Aww :( This is so sad! Why would they do that? <comment55951> Not *strictly speaking* true, if you are being pedantic (and I am)...  Right at the end of the install, after you have chosen your username, and keyboard, and wifi and all that, is a very short video on loop that describes the 2 finger scroll gesture, and requires you to scroll down and click a button to start using Mac OS X. :P <comment55952> I agree... I was really disappointed when I first installed Lion. Perhaps it's to decrease the time until a machine is usable, or to make the experience [more consistent with iOS](http://www.macrumors.com/2011/07/04/so-there-is-an-os-x-lion-welcome-animation/).
