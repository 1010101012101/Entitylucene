How can I remove the OSX server? <body> I have installed a OSX server a long time ago for testing purpose. It shows up in my App Store  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4ZJGk.png" alt="enter image description here"  However I cannot install update on my iMac that's running El Capitan due to this error message:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/99Z2y.png" alt="enter image description here"  I really want to remove it because apparently this package is preventing me upgrade to Sierra. Sierra installer requested this to be of latest version before proceeding any further.  <comment370037> Related: [Uninstall OS X Server completely in Yosemite](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/178959/uninstall-os-x-server-completely-in-yosemite)
