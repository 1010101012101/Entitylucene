Finder crashes constantly <body> On an iMac 10,1 running Mac OS X 10.6.8, Finder crashes on every startup.   Safe Boot does not work around the problem.   When I log in normally, the emFinder Crashed/em error messages always steal focus. I can barely access anything else, but I created a new user, and it still does it for that new user. I also disabled all startup items, this does not help.  The crash reports – example at http://pastebin.com/HfJH9gHH – seem very cryptic. As per a conversation in Root Access, the following file does exist (found in single user mode):   code/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Backup.framework/Versions/A/Backup/code  I tried Disk Utility from a USB drive (I created based on the 10.6.3 image), and Repaired Disk Permissions, and Verify Disk shows no errors.   What can I try next?  hr  Extracts from the report at http://pastebin.com/HfJH9gHH (the full report is too long to paste here):   precodeProcess:         Finder [767] Path:            /System/Library/CoreServices/Finder.app/Contents/MacOS/Finder Identifier:      Finder Version:         ???

I sought information after the discussion in Ask Different Chat but found nothing conclusive. As the operating system misbehaviour is extraordinarily bad – both (a) for a new user and (b) in safe mode – I suspect a corrupt installation.   As you also found a problem with archive and install without Apple's DVD, I wonder whether something troublesome has been done with 10.6.8 files that are hardware-specific and not good for the iMac10,1.  h1Advice/h1  Reinstall the operating system.   You don't have a DVD for installation, but your customer might obtain a replacement disc from Apple; or you or your customer can purchase the missing disc.   h2Prior to reinstallation/h2  Backup to separate media.   Disk Utility can check the HFS Plus file system structure of a volume, but not media, so you might like to verify media before backup and installation.    <comment106252> Could you just upgrade to 10.8? Upgrade installs often fix issues like this. <comment106268> No I can't. It's not my machine, and I can't do anything worthwhile on the gui since the error message keeps popping to the foreground <comment106276> You could try moving `/System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.Finder.plist` somewhere else in single user mode. <comment106279> @lauri I will try that tomorrow and report back <comment106380> @LauriRanta OK, I tried that, and now the system loads, but Finder can't open (error -10810) <comment106511> And can't access Safe Mode <comment106529> The above did not fix it, but the reinstall from scratch kinda did. Had to wipe the partition table completely and re-create before the install would let me select the partition. System runs super slow, but it runs properly otherwise
