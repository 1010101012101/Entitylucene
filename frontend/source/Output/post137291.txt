airplay from safari for microsoft to apple tv <body> Can i send safari for windows across airplay to my apple tv? There is no airplay logo on my safari even though i am connected to the same network as my apple tv.  Cheers for helping!  <comment163135> Do you mean you want to send an entire page across to your Apple TV, or just send a video? <comment163139> You made us guess: You have a PC with Windows and Safari. You also have Apple TV and probably some Apple device like, iPhone, iPad, or even a Mac  that you use with Apple TV?--if you answer this we could be able to help you.
