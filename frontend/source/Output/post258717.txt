Need help finding and iPhone/Android Emulator for OS X that can run apps in the app store (Summoners War) <body> Been looking for Emulators that can run on my Mac, but all i keep seeing is Blue Stacks, Ipadian, Andy (Pretty sure this one contains a virus). The others don't work for me. If you have tried those Emulators and "Summoners War" runs, and works fully on said Emulators please let me know. If no emulators can be found I'll accept that i can't play this game anymore thanks.
