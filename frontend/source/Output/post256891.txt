How do I uninstall the macOS Sierra Installer? <body> My macOS Sierra Installer isn't working, so I'd like to uninstall it in order to reinstall it later. The only problem is that I can't delete it directly because I don't have admin privileges on this computer. (I've also tried coderm -r filename/code in Terminal.) How could I uninstall the installer without directly deleting it?  <answer256894> If you don't have admin priveleges, you won't be able to use the OS X Installer for Sierra. You should ask whoever has admin privileges to install Sierra for you.  <answer256909> There’s no uninstallation procedure. Despite the code.app/code extension, codeInstall macOS Sierra.app/code is essentially just a disk image waiting to be installed…no system modifications were made by merely downloading it, so deleting it is all that’s needed for removal.   That said, as Avery Chan mentioned, you still need sufficient privileges in order to remove it.   The command coderm -r /Applications/Install\ macOS\ Sierra.app/code won’t execute without prepending it with codesudo/code. But using codesudo/code requires an administrative, master, or root password...  The advisable solution is to ask the system administrator to remove it. That said, if this isn’t possible, a few workarounds exist:  strongReset The Admin Password/strong (note that if Filevault is enabled, this won’t work):  ol liBoot into your Recovery Partition holding down kbdcommand/kbd + kbdR/kbd at the startup chime/li liSelect codeTerminal/code from your Utilities Menu Bar/li liEnter coderesetpassword/code in the prompt. /li liFrom the window that appears, select your boot volume and the administrative account. /li liType in a new password for the account. Confirm the new password./li liClick Save, close this pane and quit Utilities/li liSelect your boot volume when presented with "choose startup disk" and then reboot your machine./li /ol  That’ll allow you to access the admin account and subsequently delete the Installer.   strongUse Single User mode/strong (if Filevault is enabled emor/em a firmware password is set, this won’t work either). While using this method will allow you to remove the file without resetting the admin’s password, it’s not advisable to make filesystem modifications at all in this manner, strongso proceed at your own risk./strong   ol liHold down kbdcommand/kbd + kbdS/kbd at the startup chime. After each of the following commands, hit enter./li liemAlways/em run a disk check first in SU mode by typing in code/sbin/fsck -fy/code. Don’t be alarmed by output such as “FILESYSTEM WAS MODIFIED”, that’s normal. It just means the filesystem was repaired. /li liNow, mount the boot volume with user write permissions. code/sbin/mount -uw //code/li licodecd /Applications/code to migrate to the relevant directory. /li liType in codeecho $(rm -rf Install\ macOS\ Sierra.app)/code before directly running it. Using actual backticks to nest the coderm/code command is preferable to code$()/code, I just can’t format it properly here. /li liNow proceed to remove the installer coderm -rf Install\ macOS\ Sierra.app/code/li liType in codereboot/code/li /ol  <comment320535> Boot into recovery mode and use the terminal?
