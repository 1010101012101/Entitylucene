What's the canonical name for the "sunburst" waiting animation? <body> Is there an accepted name for the spinning animation that's displayed when one needs to wait for an indefinite amount of time?  It looks like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5Wits.gif" alt="enter image description here"  <answer24442> It is called the "Asynchronous Progress Indicator". You can read more about it, and other elements of Mac OS X, in their OS X HIG Guidelines.  <answer24444> The canonical name is the "strongasynchronous progress indicator/strong" but in most user documentation it is described as "a progress indicator (that looks like a spinning gear)". The Apple Publications Style Guide is a nice reference for learning what Apple considers the correct terms for writing about these details correctly.  The four specific types of generic strongprogress indicators/strong that Apple provides to developers are:  ul liasynchronous progress indicator (spinning gear)/li lideterminate progress bar (moving bar)/li liindeterminate progress bar (spinning striped cylinder)/li lispinning wait cursor (colored pinwheel)/li /ul  hr  I'm writing a short postscript since many confuse the emspinning gear/em with the emcolored pinwheel/em:  The colored pinwheel is colloquially known as the emspinning pizza of death/em or SPOD cursor due to user frustration when it appears to signal a hung process. It is the worst indicator for the user to see since it means the programmer either didn't or couldn't keep the main program responsive. We as users have no clue what part of the program is waiting for something to progress, only that it's stuck.   <answer24467> The technical term for it is a Throbber.  <comment27434> Go GIF animation!! <comment27436> While not the official name, I've generally seen it referred to as either the "spinning gear" or "that d**n spinning gear". <comment27449> Re the coloured pinwheel, I know it as the spinning beach ball of death :) <comment27455> Oddly, I refer to it as "beach ball" or SPOD which causes some to wonder how I can prefer beach ball in long form, but abbreviate that with a P in the short form. Both terms have clearly become habit. <comment27489> And we wonder why this name never took off? <comment27492> I love the link to the HIG documents - they seem to be more recent than the style guide (which almost predates iOS) <comment27500> I, too, also have always heard beachball (and the verb beachballing, as in "Safari is beachballing because I loaded some Flash"). <comment27603> Oh netscape - your satellite is still in orbit all these years later... <comment175636> Looks like the [address to the Apple Style Guide has changed](http://help.apple.com/asg/mac/2013/). <comment261650> @bmike Most interestingly, SPOD and SBOD are next to impossible to differentiate when spoken aloud. Perhaps this is the source of your apparently contradictory preferences!
