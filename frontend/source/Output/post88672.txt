How to edit theme colors in TextMate 2? <body> In TextMate 1 there is a codeFonts &amp; Colors/code tab in codePreferences/code to edit theme colors, but in TextMate 2 I cannot find how to do the same...   I can select a theme in the codeView/code menu, but I want to customize a theme, the same way it was possible in TextMate 1, by selecting the "scope" and changing the color with a palette and the font style.  Where is this function in TextMate 2?  <answer88747> Option 1: use TextMate 1:  precodeopen ~/Library/Application\ Support/Avian/Bundles/Themes.tmbundle/Themes/Custom.tmTheme -a TextMate cp ~/Library/Application\ Support/TextMate/Themes/Custom.tmTheme \ ~/Library/Application\ Support/Avian/Bundles/Themes.tmbundle/Themes/Custom.tmTheme /code/pre  Option 2: edit the theme as an old-style plist from the bundle editor:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hw9ku.png" alt=""  Option 3: edit the tmTheme file directly by opening it with codemate/code:  precodemate ~/Library/Application\ Support/Avian/Bundles/Themes.tmbundle/Themes/Custom.tmTheme /code/pre  The last two options require you to close and reopen files to make them use the edited theme. codetell app "TextMate 2" to reload bundles/code does not work.  You can use codepl/code and codeplutil/code to convert between the XML and old style formats:  precodepl -input file.plist -output file.plist plutil -convert xml1 file.plist /code/pre  <answer106684> Theme tweaking of the type you could do in TextMate 1 is not yet featured in TextMate 2 itself. HOWEVER... I just came across this very cool online TextMate theme editor. Its interface imitates the Fonts &amp; Colors tab in the TM1 preferences. It apparently only works in Chrome, but I use Chrome anyway so I'm off to play with it.
