Replace keyboard shortcut for ⌥ + d <body> I want to replace the keyboard shortcut forbr/ kbd⌥Option/kbd  + kbdd/kbd = strong∂/strongbr/ withbr/ kbd⌥Option/kbd  + kbdd/kbd = strongð/strong  How can I do that?   <answer143564> Create a plain text file with this in it (in TextEdit, use codeFormat &gt; Make Plain Text/code):  precode{     "~d" = ("insertText:", "ð"); } /code/pre  Call it codeDefaultKeyBinding.dict/code (make sure to uncheck “When no extension is provided, use .txt”), and save it in code~/Library/KeyBindings//code. (You can press kbdCommand ⌘/kbd+kbdShift ⇧/kbd+kbdG/kbd and paste that path.)  The code"~d"/code means Option-D, and the code("insertText:", "ð")/code means it will insert a ð character instead of ∂.  You will have to restart your applications in order for this setting to take effect.  <answer144208> Another solution is to create a custom keyboard layout. I can easily type symbols like code→/code, code←/code, code/code, and code♥/code with my custom layout.  <comment169086> Did you try any of [these options](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/111858/keyboard-remapping-in-os-x-10-9)? <comment169087> I have no KeyBindings in my Library folder.. I use OSX 10.9.4 <comment169088> @hiru: Then make that folder yourself. <comment169089> KeyboardMaestro solved my problem, but I'm looking for a solution that doesn't require a third-part software. Thanks! <comment169096> yes, a solution w/o 3rd party requirement is ideal! <comment169912> Thanks, this is another great solution :)
