Bluetooth serial is busy <body> My Bluetooth Serial seems to always be busy.  ul licodelsof /dev/tty.BluetoothModem/code yields nothing./li licodesudo chmod 777 /var/lock/code seemed to have no effect./li licodescreen /dev/tty.Bluetooth-Modem/code  tells me it's busy./li /ul  I rebooted.  I'm using Mountain Lion.  How can I possibly debug this?  <answer168704> Apparently, code/dev/tty.Bluetooth-Modem/code isn't the device that I want. I went into the Bluetooth preference pane and selected my device, clicked "Advanced", and added a new software serial device associated with it.  I can connect to that one just fine.
