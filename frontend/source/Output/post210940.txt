"More info" button missing in "About this Mac" <body> I have a macbook pro running Yosemite 10.10.5.  When I click on the apple and select "About this Mac", I'm allegedly supposed to see a button "More info", but it's not there.  Is it just me?  How else can I access detailed system information?  <answer210941> Open up strongSystem Information/strong in code/Applications/Utilities//code.  I don't know why strongMore Info/strong isn't showing up, but others have had the issue.  <answer210954> The page you referenced is for earlier OS. codeSystem Report/code should show everything, but if you are looking for something specific it should be accessible through the tabs in codeAbout this Mac/code.  <answer211035> There's a System Report... button in the Overview tab.  <comment254729> On my mac I have "System Information" (and no "profiler") and I'm guessing that these are equivalent.
