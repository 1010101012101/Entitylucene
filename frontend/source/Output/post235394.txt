Can't boot into OS X Recovery Mode <body> I would like to  I've recently installed Debian Linux on my Macbook, which required repartitioning the hard drive.  I now can't boot into Recovery Mode. Holding down Command+R on boot brings up Internet Recovery Mode. Holding Option on boot brings up the Startup Manager, which lists the Recovery HD, but if I select it, regular OS X boots.  I'm using a Retina MacBook Pro Early 2015 13" on OS X 10.11.4  precode$ sudo gpt -r show /dev/disk0 gpt show: /dev/disk0: Suspicious MBR at sector 0     start       size  index  contents         0          1         MBR         1          1         Pri GPT header         2         32         Pri GPT table        34          6                 40     409600      1  GPT part - C12A7328-F81F-11D2-BA4B-00A0C93EC93B    409640  843043264      2  GPT part - 48465300-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC 843452904    1269536      3  GPT part - 48465300-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC 844722440  123046872      4  GPT part - 0FC63DAF-8483-4772-8E79-3D69D8477DE4 967769312     262144          968031456    8811424      5  GPT part - 0657FD6D-A4AB-43C4-84E5-0933C84B4F4F 976842880     262147          977105027         32         Sec GPT table 977105059          1         Sec GPT header  $ sudo fdisk /dev/disk0 Disk: /dev/disk0    geometry: 60821/255/63 [977105060 sectors] Signature: 0xAA55          Starting       Ending  #: id  cyl  hd sec -  cyl  hd sec [     start -       size] ------------------------------------------------------------------------  1: EE    0   0   1 - 1023 254  63 [         1 -     409639] &lt;Unknown ID&gt; *2: AF 1023 254  63 - 1023 254  63 [    409640 -  843043264] HFS+          3: AF 1023 254  63 - 1023 254  63 [ 843452904 -    1269536] HFS+          4: 83 1023 254  63 - 1023 254  63 [ 844722440 -  123046872] Linux files*   $ diskutil list /dev/disk0 (internal, physical):    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *500.3 GB   disk0    1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1    2:                  Apple_HFS Macintosh HD            431.6 GB   disk0s2    3:                  Apple_HFS Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s3    4:           Linux Filesystem                         63.0 GB    disk0s4    5:                 Linux Swap                         4.5 GB     disk0s5  $ diskutil cs list No CoreStorage logical volume groups found /code/pre  <answer235707> From the results you posted, I can see the GUID for the Recovery partition is wrong. This is partition number 3 in the tables. The correct value in the GPT would be 426F6F74-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC. The codefdisk/code command also shows the value to be wrong in the MBR table. Here, the correct value should be codeAB/code. If you can not boot to your Recovery partition after repairing these tables, then I would assume the contents of the partition is corrupted.  As far as I know, there is no utility in OS X for this type of repair. (Technically, you could use the codedd/code command, but no sane person would attempt using codedd/code to fix this problem.) I would recommend downloading and installing the codegdisk/code command from here. To install, you may have to modify the setting on the "Security &amp; Privacy" pane of the "System Preferences".  To use the codegdisk/code command, you will need to disable System Integrity Protection (SIP). Normally, this can be done while in Recovery mode. Since you can not boot to Recovery mode, you can use a product called "rEFInd". Many Linux users already have this product installed on their Mac computer. If you do not, you can create a USB flash drive version which can be used to disable/enable SIP. The instructions are given here.     Note: Since you have Debian Linux already installed, you may be able to execute codegdisk/code from this operating system. Since I do not have this operating system installed, I am not going to pursue this further. You can obtain more information from this site. Also, codegdisk/code may be available by booting from an external Emergency Disk. emIf available under Linux or from an Emergency Disk, you will strongnot/strong have to disable SIP./em   Once codegdisk/code is installed and SIP is disabled, you will need to make three changes. These changes involve modifying both the GUID Partition Table (GPT) and the Master Boot Record (MBR) partition table. The changes are listed below.    ol liChange the type GUID for partition 3 in the GPT from 48465300-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC to 426F6F74-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC. Note: codegdisk/code uses a value of codeAB00/code to represent the value 426F6F74-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC./li liMake sure the attribute for partition 3 is code0002000000000000/code. In the example below, I assume the current value for the attribute is code0000000000000000/code. If not, make the appropriate corrections./li liChange the id for partition 3 in the MBR table from codeAF/code to codeAB/code./li /ol  In the example below, I create and mounted a sparse image as code/dev/disk1/code. I then used this image as input to the codegdisk/code command. This was done to simulate the conditions on your computer. strongYou will be making changes to your code/dev/disk0/code/strong.  precodeSteelhead:~ davidanderson$ sudo gdisk /dev/disk1 GPT fdisk (gdisk) version 1.0.1  Warning: Devices opened with shared lock will not have their partition table automatically reloaded!

Steelhead:~ davidanderson$  /code/pre  At this point, I would restart your Mac.  <comment288115> Could you enter the following commands in a Terminal application window and post the results to your question. The commands will not change your computer and may require your login password. The commands are `sudo  gpt  -r  show  /dev/disk0`, `fdisk  /dev/disk0`,  `diskutil  list`, and `diskutuil  cs  list`. You can just cut and paste the results to your question. Someone will cleanup the output. Also, add the model/year of your Mac and the version of OS X you are using. <comment288225> @DavidAnderson sure! Added to my question. <comment288306> What's the purpose of the 'Undefined bit #49' attribute? <comment288315> @klanomath: I haven't a clue what the bit is for. OS X puts it in the GPT when creating an OS X Recovery partition. I first noticed this when I wrote my [readgpt](https://sourceforge.net/projects/readgpt/) utility. As far as I know, neither `diskutil`, `gpt` nor any other OS X Terminal application command has a way to modify the GPT attribute. <comment288959> Thank you so much, this did the trick. One note: I made changes to `/dev/sda` rather than of `/dev/disk0` from within Debian.
