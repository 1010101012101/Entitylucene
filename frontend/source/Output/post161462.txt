How to stop an app from running completely on OS X? <body> Few days back I installed Team Viewer on my MacBook Pro running OS X 10.9.4 Mavericks. It worked fine at the first. Now the app is stuck on the dock saying "Application not responding" and it's running indefinitely.  h2What I've tried to stop the app from running/h2  ol liForce Quit from Dock/li liKilling from Activity Monitor/li liTried to restart the mac and the app launched automatically even though it's not set to launch during startup under system preferences./li /ol  There are two processes using the CPU which when I try to force quit gets automatically relaunched.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/H73rC.png" alt="enter image description here"  strongHow do i stop the app or how do I stop these processes from running ever again?/strong  <answer161473> It is probably a launchctl process that is restarting.  To see all loaded launch agents, in Terminal:   precodelaunchctl list /code/pre  To remove one:  precodesudo launchctl remove label_of_program_to_remove /code/pre  where, stronglabel_of_program_to_remove/strong is found in the preceding list.  Note that you have to run the sudo command from an administrator account; or, codesu/code to an administrator account first.  <answer179129> Go to the Teamviewer preferences. Under the general tab unclick "Start TeamViewer with system". Apply and afterwards you should be able to close the program.  <comment188699> I have version 8.0.16901 and it responds to Force Quit using alt+cmd+Esc! <comment188700> I also do NOT have the TeamViewer_Desktop process running. Are you connected to someone ? <comment188701> @Buscar웃 - Nope, I'm not connected to anyone. The app won't load for force quit using  alt+cmd+Esc! <comment188702> I found two labels - `com.teamviewer.desktop` and `com.teamviewer.teamviewer`, but when I try to remove it `sh-3.2# launchctl remove com.teamviewer.teamviewer` it says this `launchctl remove error: No such process` <comment188704> Can you run the Uninstall TeamViewer ? <comment188706> I was able to remove it from the list without using sudo. <comment188707> @Buscar웃 I wasn't able to uninstall because the app was still running. <comment188712> Great! Now that that is working, the second (and more permanent) step is to move the com.teamviewer files from either /Library/LaunchAgents/ or your ~/Library/LaunchAgents/ folder.  Instead of removing them outright, you should move them someplace else in case you want to try again. <comment219435> It doesn't work if the Teamviewer is forever not responding <comment280379> Ok, what the heck. I have used launchctl to stop, unload, and remove all the teamviewer processes and it no longer shows up in `launctl list` and I moved all the plist files away, but I *still* get error messages in system.log saying it's trying to run something every 10 seconds and is failing! <comment280423> Can you open a new question, and copy the error message as well as the output of "launchctl list" (remove anything that might compromise your privacy, etc) <comment286418> My macbook pro sporadically shuts down. The teamviewer I used to have continues running. I did sudo launchctl remove com.teamviewer.teamviewer, but after rebooting the computer it starts again... <comment286421> You also need to remove the files from the LaunchAgents folder if you want the change to be permanent. See the comment above that starts with "Great!" <comment314537> I installed TeamViewer Host - where is the preferences?
