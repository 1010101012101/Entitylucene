Spotlight and Alfred can't find alias to Emacs.app <body> I installed Emacs.app with Homebrew, and used codebrew linkapps/code to create an alias in my code/Applications/code directory.  Since I updated to OS X Mavericks yesterday, Spotlight and Alfred can no longer see this alias.   Since discovering the problem, I've tried reindexing my MacBook as described here, as well as reinstalling Emacs and restarting the machine.  Any other suggestions?  <answer106848> Found the answer here.  I needed to add the Homebrew cellar path to the list of paths under emFeatures | Default Results | Search Scope/em, and then Alfred recursively scanned it and found Emacs.   On my Mac the path was code/usr/local/Cellar/code.  And there was great rejoicing!  <answer107921> I actually came across this back in March with the release of Alfred 2 and documented my solution here: http://blog.victorquinn.com/alfred-2-and-emacs  Perhaps that'll help you.  <comment126579> Answers on Ask Different need to be more than just a link. It's okay to include a link, but please summarize or excerpt it in the answer. The idea is to make the answer stand alone and not fully rely on off-site information (which may disappear, similar to the first link in the page you are referring to). <comment314402> FYI: victorquinn.com uses an invalid security certificate.
