Stolen Mac - Help Finding Serial Number? <body> My apartment was broken into yesterday and my Mac (Mavericks) is gone. I'm trying to dig up the serial number for the police, but I'm having zero luck. Here's what I've done so far, to no avail:  ul liChecked Find iPhone through my iPhone and iCloud.com (didn't iCloud show the serial number at one time?)/li liChecked https://supportprofile.apple.com//li liSearched my emails for one from Apple from purchase (found an email with an almost 3 year old Order Number and a Crucial email with some specs)/li liSearched for the box my Mac came in/li /ul  Here are some things I still have that may help:  ul liAn external drive used for Time Machine/li liMy iPhone used the Mac for iTunes syncing/li liPrograms connected to the Internet, like Dropbox and TeamViewer/li /ul  The police have been here already and I've contacted my renter's insurance. I have the Mac Locked and on Notify When Found. But I would really love that serial number. Any ideas I haven't thought of or found online?  <answer148241> If you synced it up to your mac it should be stored in your preferences plist.  precode/Users/yourusername/Library/Preferences/com.apple.iPod.plist /code/pre  This file stores all the information about devices you connected to iTunes.  You can easily get to your user library by holding strongOption(alt)/strong when you click strongGo/strong on the top menu.  <answer243531> Someone stole my iPads last week and I didn't have the serial numbers. I found the serial numbers on appleid.apple.com. Once, logged in, scroll down to Devices and click view details. You will need to answer your security questions, but any of your devices that are linked to Apple ID will be shown with their serial numbers. I hope this helps someone.    <comment174682> This is good info if my iPhone is stolen, but my Mac was the stolen item. <comment174684> Yeah I don't think macs hold the serial number anywhere since its read directly from the motherboard itself using ioreg.  Did you register your mac?  If so you can use the site https://selfsolve.apple.com/GetAgreements.do <comment174685> Nothing there... <comment174706> I can confirm that I see my Mac, along with serial number at that site. You need to be logged in with your Apple ID before that link will show anything though. <comment200322> On apples site- "If you still have the original packaging for your iMac, you can find the serial number on the barcode label that is affixed to the packaging."
