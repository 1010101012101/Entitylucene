How do I launch Finder from terminal or command line <body> I use command line a lot, like most programmers.  I want to be able to launch Finder, Safari or any other application for that matter from command line e.g.      finder .   where it will start Finder app, and the set the view to the current folder that I am in at the command line.  <answer101433> To open your current directory in codeFinder/code from codeTerminal/code, type codeopen ./code  So, if you want Documents: codeopen Documents/code  Library: codeopen /Library/code  Downloads: codeopen Downloads/code  And so on.  <comment119504> Boom! `open .` is the winner here. <comment119521> Oops. Didn't realize it had a duplicate already. I knew the answer so I just answered it. <comment119522> you did fine - linking the dupes helps with search terms. Your answer or this questions' words get indexed so that people searching the internet find the right answer. <comment144396> I've been wondering for some time what the Mac equivalent to "explorer ." was.  Thanks! <comment162605> This doesn't work if your current directory is an application, like /Applications/Something.app.  It will open that app instead of finder. <comment166318> Important note, which was helpful to me - if you've `Force Quit`ted the Finder and it doesn't relaunch and you happen to have a Terminal window open, you can relaunch the finder by simply opening a directory, like `open .` as indicated here. <comment166319> I disagree that this is a duplicate. I found this when Finder was force quitted and I wanted to launch it again. The other question doesn't address this aspect of the problem, this one does. <comment212114> I agree: not a duplicate. This question is about how to launch the program. The other is just about how to open a new window. <comment229565> @Segfault To force it to open an application as a file in Finder, rather than the open the application itself, use the `-R` option: "-R  Reveals the file(s) in the Finder instead of opening them." For example, you can do `cd /Applications/Preview.app; open -R .` and it will open Finder, not Preview. <comment242155> open directory hangs for me on Yosemite.  I have tried it on different folders to ensure it were not specific to one directory. <comment300025> `open \`pwd\`` is safer, does the same thing as `open .` <comment344490> thanks `open .` working for me
