Swap X and Y axes on Numbers 3.1 <body> This link is now outdated with the new release of numbers.  I want to transpose the X- and Y-axes on a chart in Numbers 3.1. How the heck can I do this?  The first chart I made was able to sum my columns up to 100 just fine: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7ocKT.png" alt="Correct display"  However, when I try it with fewer columns/geographies, it transposes the selection: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/oLaeP.png" alt="Incorrect display"  Even when I transpose the cells, it still forces the data to display incorrectly and there is no option to swap the axes: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/tdTPN.png" alt="Still incorrect display"  I'm so frustrated with this! How can I make it plot correctly? Thanks!  <answer119392> Was having the same problem â€“ apparently the options to swap axes moved to the bottom left when Editing Data References:  img src="https://discussions.apple.com/servlet/JiveServlet/downloadImage/2-24642568-369356/209-103/Screen+Shot+2014-01-27+at+12.05.02+am.png" alt="options"  Answer found here.  <comment139102> It looks like if I build a chart from scratch (i.e., don't select any text and just click the chart button), then I can select the transposed cells (image 3) and it will work that way. It's stupid to have to workaround it like that. <comment139103> Please shift that comment to an answer if it has solved your problem. That allows others to see that the question is answered. <comment139489> Yes! This is what solves the problem! Thanks for referencing the thread. <comment139490> It wasn't a very good answer, but Aidan below did answer it correctly. I will do so next time if my own answer is sufficient ;) <comment201091> Note: this is at the bottom of the window.
