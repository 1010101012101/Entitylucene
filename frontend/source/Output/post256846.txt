Access to full FaceTime and Continuity-enabled phone call log (call history) on a Mac <body> The strongMac's FaceTime application/strong, as of macOS Sierra, presents a strongvery simplified call log/strong (call history) in its main window:  ul liFor any given contact,  ul lionly a (time-stamped) SINGLE entry for the MOST RECENT conversation is shown,/li liWITHOUT indicator as to whether the call was INCOMING or OUTGOING.  ul liOnly missed calls (printed in red) imply the call direction (they're by definition incoming)./li /ul/li liWITHOUT information about the DURATION of the (most recent) call./li /ul/li /ul  With phone calling via Continuity enabled, iPhone-mediated calls are shown in the same fashion.  strongContrast this with the iOS 10 Phone app, which shows a full call log./strong  strongIs there a way to gain access to the full call log emon a Mac/em,/strong providing all the information that the iOS Phone app exposes?  Note: Ideally, there'd be a way to access the full call log from within the FaceTime application (I don't think there is), but I'm open to any Mac-based solution (physically accessing the iPhone that mediates the phone calls is emnot/em an option).  <comment320457> When you say "gain access to the full call log," do you mean cause it to appear in FaceTime, or just be able to access it somehow? <comment334070> Did you ever figure this out? I don't understand why it doesn't show me all the calls that have been made via FaceTime with timestamps. <comment334073> @dstepan: No, I still don't know how to do it. My sense is that Apple thinks of FaceTime's behavior in this respect as a helpful simplification, but I personally do not consider it that.
