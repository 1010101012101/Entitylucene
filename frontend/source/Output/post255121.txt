Lock Down IOS in the field <body> We currently use Netmotion in our organization to lock down laptops in the field...we are looking at the possibility of using iPads in the field, but so far it seems that the employee could turn off NetMotion and be unrestricted.  Is there any way within IOS to lock down web traffic in the field?    I saw this thread:Can websites be locked down on the iPad?  But the answers are five years old and the link seems to be broken to the apple site. Would a third party solution be the way to go? Any suggestions?  <comment317662> Have you looked at [iOS restrictions (parental controls](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201304))? <comment317663> That looks promising as we could just turn off Safari and lock it. We have one web application though that will be used...is there a way to make that website viewable? Someone on the old thread said "Turn it into a web app on the home screen" but so far I haven't figured out how to do that...if I had a link to home screen it still opens up a full Safari session. <comment317665> [This answer](http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/250495/88313) recommends an Apple tool designed specifically for enterprise use.  It might help.
