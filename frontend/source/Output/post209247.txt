Keyboard Problem Hardware or Software? <body> I have a two year old macbook pro with retina display.  About a month ago, I noticed a number of keyboard problems that occurred somewhat at the same time.  ul liThe "z" key stopped working completely./li /ul  This is what made me suspect that this is a hardware problem. Then later I noticed. Later on, I noticed that  ul liThe "a" key works, but not Cmd-A./li liThe "delete" key works, but Fn-Delete does not do a forward delete./li /ul  It is the last two that are obviously non-hardware problems. I don't see anything else that is wrong with the shortcuts.  When I view the software keyboard, and I press, the command key (on the keyboard), the corresponding key on the software keyboard gets dark. But with the command key down, further pressing the A key makes no change on the software keyboard (the Cmd key remains highlighted). Control-A, Shift-A, Alt-A all work.  It is even stranger with the Fn+delete. Pressing the Fn key shows up on the soft keyboard, and changes the picture on the delete key from left delete to right delete. Now pressing the delete key, removes the highlighting from both the Fn key and the delete key, so it appears as if no key is being pressed. In fact if I repeatedly press the delete key, while holding the Fn key down, it thinks that I am repeated pressing the Fn key!   <comment252367> This sounds like a software problem (happen to have played with any accessibility settings?), but have you tried [peeling a keycap off](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCT-CldP_r4) and seeing if there's a bunch of dirt/dust/grime/food under it? <comment252469> Removed, cleaned and replaced the "z" key with no difference. The underside of the key was reasonably clean. I have had no spills or other accidents with the keyboard.
