Search for a folder using applescript <body> I am trying to make a folder to go on a server, that people can add photos to and then the script sends them to the correct place, however I'm having trouble with the search part.  As you can see below in my code, the part where it finds where to send the folder to is commented out, because I have no idea what the syntax is for it.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.  precodeglobal theWatchedFolder set theWatchedFolder to choose folder on idle tell application "Finder" set theDetectedItems to every item of theWatchedFolder repeat with aDetectedItem in theDetectedItems     set jobNumber to display dialog "Please enter the job number for this photo." buttons {"Submit", "Cancel"}     display dialog "File detected: " &amp; jobNumber     --tell finder     -- search for jobNumber in (path to desktop)     --set jobFolder to top search result     --end tell     --set colourFolder to jobfolder &amp; /colour     move aDetectedItem to the desktop --move to colourFolder end repeat end tell if theDetectedItems is not {} then activate display dialog "test move complete" end if return 1 end idle /code/pre  Also, I am concerned that if this script is on the server, watching a folder on the server, then it won't create a pop-up for anyone who adds a file to the folder on the server. Hopefully I am wrong but if someone could confirm this one way or the other then that would be awesome. Thanks :)  <answer135299> h2For local files/folders/h2  you can use spotlight's command line tools. In Terminal   precode$ mdfind -onlyin ~/ "kMDItemDisplayName == 'xyz*' &amp;&amp; kMDItemKind == 'Folder'" /code/pre  will give you all strongfolders/strong whose name strongstarts with/strong codexyz/code with the search begining from your home folder code~//code. Remove code*/code in codexyz*/code above to find an exact match. For more information on codemdfind/code read the man page using the command codeman mdfind/code in Terminal app.  You can use it in your script like this...  precodeset res to (do shell script "mdfind -onlyin ~/ \"kMDItemDisplayName == 'xyz' &amp;&amp; kMDItemKind == 'Folder'\"")     set fList to (every paragraph of res) as list     log "Count:" &amp; (get count of fList) /code/pre  hr  h2For remote files/h2  that spotlight doesn't know about, you can use the good old UNIX codefind/code command.   precode$ find ~/ -iname "xyz" -type d /code/pre  You can use it in your script the same way as codemdfind/code but it may be a bit slower.  Hope that helped.  <comment160470> Thanks for the help :) unfortunately I've found major unfixable flaws elsewhere in my code, but you fixed the part where I search for a folder :P
