My Apple News app hijacked by porn - security breach? <body> I was reading the news on Apple news, was looking at a Fox News article, which linked to a TMZ video. When I clicked the link to the video, my News app seemed to be immediately hijacked. I was shown porn sites, and then asked to open the app store. Pressing the back arrow to go back to the original Fox News article wouldn't work. Each time I clicked the back arrow, the app displayed "wait" and I was redirected to another porn site or asked to open the app store, where an app was displayed.   Is this considered an iOS security breach (being sent from an article to porn, and not being able to return to the article) or is this a third party problem with TMZ that Apple isn't responsible for?  <comment328353> I would guess it is a bad ad in the TMZ video player. If so the responsibility for that to not happen is probably primarily with the ad seller TMZ uses, then TMZ then Apple. <comment328358> @dwightk what of the inability to use the back button in the app? Would that issue be in Apple's domain, or as you said, primarily the responsibility of the ad seller? <comment328403> Just close the app (double-tap the home button and swipe up on the News app). Then you can reopen it and access your main feed again. <comment328737> I think Apple has something to fix here, I saw similar behavior on just a regular site in safari it sent me to the app store as soon as I switched to Safari until I finally force-quit both the app store and safari. Clearly that isn't the sort of behavior that Apple should allow. But (in my opinion) it is an exploit the ad guys are taking advantage of.
