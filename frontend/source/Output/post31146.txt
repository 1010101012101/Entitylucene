iPod touch refuses to sync Keynote documents with iCloud <body> I have Keynote on my 4th generation iPod touch and iPad 2, both running iOS 5.0.1. When I try to turn on "Sync with iCloud", it will turn on, but a presentation I created on my iPad will not show up, and when I go back into settings, the "Sync with iCloud" switch will have turned itself off. I have enabled "Documents and Data" (and turned it off and back on) in the iCloud settings. iCloud syncing appears to work just fine with the iPad.
