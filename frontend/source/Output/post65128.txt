How do I run a jar when I double-click it? <body> So, I double click on my jar file and it just blinks a window with white screen then it disappears. After that, I right-click and select "Open with jar launcher" it is the same. too. I opened up Terminal and type codejava -jar "System FRONT.jar"/code then it opened up perfectly.   I want it to be opened directly when double clicking it! How do I do that?  <answer65135> The best way to make a java gui application work with OSX is to bundle it as an application. This requires Jar Bundler.app which on Lion is at code/usr/share/java/Tools/Jar Bundler.app/code. I think it is installed as part of Xcode but appears not to be in Apple's current documentation so might not now be supported. Old documentation is here  There do appear to be ant tasks to do this in appbundler which is documented in the Oracle JavaSE documentation.  <answer65136> You can prepend a short script to the .jar to make it executable via double click. In Terminal do the following:  precode$ cat &gt; header-template &lt;&lt;"EOF" #!/bin/sh  exec java -jar $0 "$@" &gt; /dev/null  EOF $ cat header-template "System FRONT.jar" &gt; executable_app $ chmod +x executable_app /code/pre  Double-clicking codeexecutable_app/code should now launch the application.  hr  Why does this work in the first place? Well, a .jar is just a .zip archive which gets unpacked and executed by java. And the zip format allows to prepend additional stuff in front of the actual archive. Any zip unarchiver skips this part until it finds the start of the archive (indicated by strongPK.../strong).  <answer129694> h1packr/h1  You can use packr to package up your codejar/code for easy distribution and double-clicking to open:     Packages your JAR, assets and a JVM for distribution on Windows (ZIP),   Linux (ZIP) and Mac OS X (.app), adding a native executable file to   make it appear like the app is a native app. Packr is most suitable   for GUI applications, such as games made with libGDX   packr has been discussed on Hacker News and is an open source project.  <comment76502> It probably opens a terminal window, finishes and then closes the terminal window. <comment76515> To debug in Terminal.app - goto Preferences-Settings choose the Shell tab and Alter the "When the Shell exits" option then the terminal will stay open <comment76517> Actually its a game. So how do I make people double-click on it and open up my jar without commands? <comment76518> Other users will prefer it as an OSX app rather than just a .jar. In this case you do it once as part of the build process and users do not have to do anything
