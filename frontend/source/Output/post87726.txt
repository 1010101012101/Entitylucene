Is there a high quality webcam-cover solution for a MacBook Air? <body> Questions as to the nature of my paranoia aside, strongright now I have a piece of sticky note covering my webcam/strong on my MacBook Air, which, as you can imagine, doesn't really complement the look and feel. strongIs there a decent product that people have actually used/strong that they'd recommend to replace such a sticky note or piece of electrical tape over the webcam?  <answer87734> What about c-slide? (http://www.c-slide.com) 1 mm thin and works with all latops and pad devices.  The cool thing is that you can open and close it without having to remove any parts from you laptop. And it's sleek, the only downside is that it is black and might not look very nice on a white MacBook frame.  <comment228402> I'm voting to close this question as off-topic because hardware shopping questions like this attract spam. If anyone has a problem with web searching for this product, feel free to open a thread on [meta] and we'll see about editing this or reopening it. <comment328594> I have this and it's so large that it partially covers the ambient light sensor on my Macs (iMac 27", Retina MacBook Pro 13"), which prevents them from automatically adjusting brightness properly. Currently searching for a lower-profile solution...
