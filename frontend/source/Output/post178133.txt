How can I edit a long URL in the Safari browser on my iPad 2? <body> I'd like to be able to edit a long url in the Safari browser on my iPad 2 running iOS 8.1.1. I can select it, but I can't scroll through it to add or delete something on the end. I generally copy/paste it into Notes, do the edit, then paste it back into the browser window, but that's a number of steps and becomes tedious.   Is there a way to do that type of edit inside the browser window?   <answer178960> Hold down your finger in the address bar to get the little magnifier to show up, finally drag your finger to the right or left to get to the part of the url that you want to edit.   <comment212065> How kind of you to answer this. It will make my life so much easier! I just want to add that I use a stylus instead of my finger, and it worked perfectly with that too!
