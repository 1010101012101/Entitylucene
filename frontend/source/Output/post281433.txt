Unable to delete cookie on iPhone 7 iOS 10.3.1 <body> I have a very persistent cookie on my iPhone 7 which I am not able to delete.  The cookie in question is codepuckermob.com/code and I am almost certain this is some kind of adware.  Here is what I have tried so far:  ul liUnder Settings\Safari clicked the codeClear History and Website Data/code/li liUnder Settings\Safari\Advanced\Website Data clicked the codeRemove All Website Data/code/li /ul  In addition to the obvious methods for removing cookies, I have also tried the following:  ul liDisabling javascript in Safari/li liBlocking all cookies in Safari/li liUninstalled all third party applications as I thought maybe one of these might be creating the cookie./li liDisabled iCloud sync for Safari/li /ul  I am out of ideas and appreciate any help.  hr  h2UPDATE/h2  It appears as if this is a known issue with iOS 10.3.1:     some cookies will not remove using, which appears to be part of the bug, my experience is that google.com will not remove using any method suggested by others in this thread, others have indicated in the thread that there are other sites that similarly will not remove   The suggested workaround did not work for me.  hr  h2UPDATE 2/h2  Upgrading to iOS 10.3.2 solved this issue for me and was able to delete all cookies.  hr  h2UPDATE 3/h2  So the problem has come back in version iOS 10.3.2 and is worse.  After the initial upgrade I was able to successfully delete the cookies, but I tried again yesterday and experienced the same issue.  Previously when attempting to delete cookies, the size would be set to 0 bytes for any cookies which could not be deleted, however now the undeleteable cookies remain the same size, meaning that the data in the cookie appears to be retained.  This is a much bigger concern for me as this is now potentially a privacy issue.  hr  h2UPDATE 4/h2  Upgrading to iOS 10.3.3 appeared to fix the issue for me strongBUT/strong believe I have narrowed down where the issue lies.  If you open a url from a link in an email it appears the cookie cannot be deleted in some cases, however if visit the same site directly in Safari then the cookie can be deleted.  I tried this with a reputable website Costco.com  ol liOpened Safari and visited Costco.com/li liOpened up settings\safari\advanced and was able to clear the Costco.com cookie/li liConfirmed this a few times and double checked that the cookie was deleted./li /ol  When I did the following I was not able to delete the email:  ol liOpened up mail and followed a link in a marketing email from Costco.com/li liOpened up settings\safari\advanced and was strongNOT/strong able to clear the Costco.com cookie but all other cookies could be deleted./li liTried the same with Verizon marketing email and I was able to clear the Verizon cookies but Costco cookie remains./li /ol  <comment354352> Same here except it's reason.com <comment354641> So it appears as if there is a known bug for this in iOS 10.3.1 discussed in the Apple forums [Safari cookies won't delete](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/7907561?start=30&tstart=0).  The suggested [workaround](https://discussions.apple.com/message/31660447#message31660447) did not work for me
