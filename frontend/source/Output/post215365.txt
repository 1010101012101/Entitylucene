Indenting code blocks using a Swedish keyboard? <body> The shortcut for indenting a block of code is usually âŒ˜], which I cannot do on a Swedish keyboard. Does anyone know any workarounds?  I'm not looking for a solution for any specific editor but a way of triggering this shortcut.  <answer215371> You can do that. Press alt, command and 9.  <comment260130> cmd+alt+9 to indent or respectively cmd+alt+8 to unindent doesn't work? <comment260171> It doesn't work on nitrous.io but works in the other ones that I'm using, thanks!
