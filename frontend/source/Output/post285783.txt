What does "SE" stand for in font name "Chalkboard SE" <body> I'm looking at two fonts that come with macOS: emChalkboard/em and emChalkboard SE/em.  What does the "SE" stand for?  <answer285784> Looking at the two Font in Font Book and seeing nothing other then Chalkboard SE has a Light version of the Font, where Chalkboard only has Regular and Bold versions, I decided to look at the two fonts in a Hex Editor. I noticed they were copyrighted six months apart:  ul liChalkboard, was copyrighted in 2003-04, by Apple Computer, Inc./li liChalkboard SE, was copyrighted in 2003-10, by Apple Computer, Inc./li /ul  I'd imagine that Chalkboard SE was created after Chalkboard as a second edition.  So, I'd say strongSE/strong stands for strongS/strongecond strongE/strongdition.  Update Note: Looking at the Get Info sheet, it shows the Copyright. I guess I should have looked there first.  <answer285786> Chalkboard SE has a much wider language coverage than ordinary Chalkboard.  Besides Latin, it includes Cherokee, Greek, and Cyrillic scripts.  Perhaps the SE means "Special Edition".
