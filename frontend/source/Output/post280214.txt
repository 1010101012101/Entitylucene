Safari videos always go full-screen by themselves <body> Since I updated to 10.12.4, whenever I go to a website playing video (tested on YouTube, Vimeo and others), Safari 10.1 takes a few seconds to start the video and then plays it in fullscreen, whether I want it to be fullscreen or not.  This only happens in my main user account, not in my second test user account. I already tested disabling all extensions and launching Safari with shift, but so far, no luck.  Any ideas why that happens? Is there a way to reset Safari or something (without losing my iCloud bookmarks)? I'd like to avoid having to create a new user account and move everything over.  <answer280244> Try clearing the Safari preferences.  Close Safari and run this command in Terminal:  precodecd ~/Library/Preferences; mv com.apple.Safari.plist +com.apple.Safari.plist /code/pre  This will move the existing preferences file aside and force Safari to create a new, blank one with all preferences set to default.  If that doesn't solve the problem, here's a command to put everything back the way it was and restore your preferences:  precodecd ~/Library/Preferences; mv +com.apple.Safari.plist com.apple.Safari.plist; rm +com.apple.Safari.plist /code/pre  Hope this helps!  <answer280257> Turns out this was not a bug, it was a feature I had stupidly enabled. :)  Thanks to Bob's answer, I realized it was a setting - it's hidden in the Debug menu â†’ Media Flags and called, appropriately enough, "Disallow inline video". One day I tested it out because I thought it would only disable unwanted ad videos, and the next day I of course forgot that I had enabled it. So if anyone finds this and has the same problem, check that setting.  <comment352469> Awesome, that worked! Thanks Bob! <comment352471> Ah.  Well, now that you know what it was, you still have a backup of your old preferences file!  Just run that revert command, reopen Safari, and fix the setting. <comment352472> Also, if you want to un-accept my answer and re-accept your own (better) answer, I'm totally cool with that. <comment352474> Okay, I'll do that! Some websites actually advocate that setting, so who knows, maybe other people will get the same problem. - I can accept my own answer in 2 days.
