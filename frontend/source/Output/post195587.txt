Music and Podcasts restriction keeps resetting to "clean" <body> Had 8.4, tried 9 public beta 1, I still find out that only music and podcast restriction keeps resetting itself to "clean" with no reason. I tried to disable restrictions with "explicit" on and yet it keeps resetting with time.  I am managing family plan w/ 4 adults, so no kids in my family plan. I have Russian account and tried ratings both US and Russian. On my iTunes I unchecked restriction to explicit content and synced it with iPhone.  It really annoys me that I have to manually turn on explicit content every day.   <comment233512> I had that issue w/ 8.4 <comment237884> I have this same exact issue. <comment241215> Apple has asked me to install profile and send them logs with this issue being repeated. Hope that'll do something to resolve the issue. <comment243985> Resetting all settings didn't change anything...
