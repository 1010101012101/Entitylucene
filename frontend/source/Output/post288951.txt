Error_log of apache empty <body> So I mistakenly deleted the file code/var/log/apache2/error_log/code.  I recreated the file again via Terminal.  However, I'm now getting a lot of 500 internal errors, but none are getting written on the error_log?  What maybe the reason behind it.  strongls -la /private/var/log/apache2/error_log/strong  precode-rw-r--r--  1 root  wheel  0 Jul  6 03:12 /private/var/log/apache2/error_log /code/pre  <comment364950> @klanomath  Done. <comment364956> Stop/kill all instances of httpd and remove the error_log file. Then start httpd with `sudo apachectl start`. The error_log file will be created automagically...working... ;-)
