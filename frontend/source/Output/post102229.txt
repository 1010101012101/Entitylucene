iOS7 why won't the time show up in texts <body> I downloaded iOS7 and noticed that the time doesn't show up in texts like the older version.  How can I get the time to show up in my text messages when someone texts me? For example, when I receive a text from someone I want the time to show up in the actual conversation  <answer102231> Swipe right to left to reveal the timestamps.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wn6ao.png" alt="enter image description here"
