Text To Speech - Custom Rate (not on the slider) <body> In System Preferences, under strongDictation &amp; Speech/strong, there is a strongSpeaking Rate/strong setting:  img src="https://i.imgur.com/yC5Fe0b.png" alt="Dictation &amp; Speech - System Preferences"  Is there a way to change the strongSpeaking Rate/strong to a value that is not on that slider bar?   For example, if I want the speech rate to be faster than the maximum slider value, how can I do that? There's a way to make the terminal speak certain lines of text faster (e.g. codesay --rate 500 "hello world"/code), but I'd like it to be the system-wide setting.  Can this be set using something like codedefault write com.example.apple.speech.rate 999/code?  <answer163466> I discovered that you can change the VoiceDataRateArray in ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.speech.voice.prefs.plist  I just changed the value of Item 2 to a value of value 500 and rebooted.  Thanks to tyler over at https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/macvisionaries/HOR7NWxsDQA  <answer233553> Adding to user3621156's answer, change emeach/em of the Item 2 values to 500.   If you don't want to reboot, you can open Activity Monitor, search for codespeech/code and force quit each of the matching processes under your username. Then, open speech settings and toggle the shortcut key and the next time you use it it should be faster.
