Is it possible to give a custom name to a browser window on OS X? <body> Is it possible to give a strongcustom name/strong to a browser window on OS X?  Perhaps by using a Window Manager that has this feature? If yes, which one has it?  The strongmotivation/strong for this question is : I have 100 browser tabs open, all on different topics. It would be great to cluster these 100 browser tabs into different browser windows, each having a meaningful name.   strongFor example :/strong   ul listrong1st/strong browser window for cat pictures strongnamed "cat pictures"/strong, having 10 tabs open about cats/li listrong2nd/strong browser window for Haskell programming, having 10 tabs about Haskell open, strongnamed "Haskell"/strong/li listrong3rd/strong browser window for Buying a new meachanical keyboard, where I have 10 different tabs open about different keyboard review sites... strongnamed "keyboard"/strong/li /ul  Any idea how to do this on OS X?  <answer211527> It is possible with this extension for Firefox:  https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/firetitle/  <comment228604> The latest version of Safari doesn't have a browser window name, just tab names.
