Copy and paste from skype includes unwanted characters <body> I tried to copy the following line from Skype:  blah123  I got an error when I tried to paste it into another app to use it. So I pasted that into a hex editor and it looked like this in the hex editor:  ¬†blah123  I don't know if that was just a problem with copy from Skype or if it could happen in other applications. What I want to know is a way to copy and paste from applications on mac osx ignoring all these unwanted 'invisible' characters.  <answer80037> As far as I know it is impossible avoid the copy of these weird characters. But you can remove them using an editor like TextWrangler. TextWrangler has an useful menu option "Text" - "Zap gremlins".   This options identify and replace:  ul liNon Ascii characters/li liControl characters/li liNull (Ascii 0) characters /li /ul  So, when I cannot avoid to copy from Skype (I suggest to use emails for important text) and I would be sure to remove all weird characters, better paste/zap/copy all the text within TextWrangler.
