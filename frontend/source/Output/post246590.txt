How to simulate location on Safari on OS X <body> I am developer and I'm trying to simulate a different location other than my own on Safari on OS X (El Capitan). How do I do that?  EDIT: This is not a duplicate of how might one spoof geographic location on a desktop Mac. That question is about spoofing the location system-wide. I am emnot trying to/em (and actually don't want to) spoof my location system-wide, I just want to change it for Safari only.  <answer246604> I don't think it is possible in Safari. You can do it in Fire Fox with the right browser extension   <answer246612> It seems that this still not possible in Safari.  For Firefox, there is a browser extension called Geolocater which does exactly what you want, but the latest reviews seem to indicate it is not compatible with the current version of Firefox.  Chrome has this functionality built-in in the Developer Console. Press kbd⌥/kbd + kbd⌘/kbd + kbdI/kbd, go to the Console tab and inside the Console tab to the Sensors tab. There you can enable location simulation and specify the coordinates.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/SM1va.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment304164> Possible duplicate of [how might one spoof geographic location on a desktop Mac](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/73125/how-might-one-spoof-geographic-location-on-a-desktop-mac) <comment304170> Can you add a link to a Firefox extension providing this kind of functionality? <comment304172> Related question: [Fake/randomize/delete geolocation in Safari for certain Websites](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/37521/fake-randomize-delete-geolocation-in-safari-for-certain-websites) <comment304174> It's a shame that we don't have it in developer tools. I'll go on with Firefox.
