How to find the Lion installation image on the iMac? <body> I recently bought Lion for $29.99 for my iMac on the App Store, and now want to burn a disc so that I can make another white Macbook that has Snow Leopard dual boot to Lion as well (Apple allows installing Lion on more than one machine that a user owns).  Also, I wanted to create a disc so that if there is an need in the future, there is a disc to boot to.  But I followed the instructions on   http://osxdaily.com/2011/06/08/create-burn-bootable-mac-os-x-lion-install-disc/  http://osxdaily.com/2011/07/08/make-a-bootable-mac-os-x-10-7-lion-installer-from-a-usb-flash-drive/  which are both linked from Can I dual boot Snow Leopard and Lion?  and the codeInstallESD.dmg/code file cannot be found.  In fact, if I type codedmg/code in the Finder's search box, and chose "Disc Image" (kind / type), the whole hard disk doesn't have a file that is more than 90MB in size.  If I go to the Applications folder, the largest size shown is merely 495MB...  How can this be solved?  thanks.  <answer52984> When you buy Lion from the App Store, it downloads an application named Install Mac OS X Lion to your Applications folder.  InstallESD.dmg is hidden inside this application.  Since it's hidden, a Spotlight search normally won't show it; you need to find the installer application, right-click on it, choose Show Package Contents, and then navigate to the image inside it (both links have instructions for this).  There is one more complication: when you run the Lion installer application, it installs Lion and then emdeletes the installer/em.  But you can re-download it if you know the trick: open the App Store, kbdOption/kbd-click on the Purchases icon in the toolbar, and you should have a Download button available for OS X Lion.  <comment60592> could that file be already backed up on the Time Machine? <comment61050> Yes, if you have a Time Machine snapshot from after it was downloaded and before it was installed&deleted (and you didn't exclude /Applications from backups).
