Why does my laptop shut down overnight? <body> Whenever I leave my MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Early 2015) unattended (plugged in, or not) overnight (or for long periods of time) it shuts down by itself. When I open the lid it boots up to the FileVault password screen. It seems that if the lid is up, the laptop does not shut down.   It is running the latest and greatest macOS Sierra build (10.12.3 (16D32)).   There is no kernel panic, and I cannot find anything in the logs or settings that would cause this behavior. I tried searching and did a SMC reset.  EDIT  precodelog show --style syslog --predicate 'eventMessage contains "shutdown cause"' Skipping info and debug messages, pass --info and/or --debug to include.

It is possible that when unattended, your MacBook doesn't suspend as you expect or wake up for some reason. Or that your battery isn't working as it should.  Look at these options:   ol liLook at battery info on the last line of the panel: if your battery is damaged, it should tell you to replace it./li liLook at codeTurn display off after/code option. Try to set it to a short amount of time for both codeBattery/code and  codePower Adapter/code, and look what happens when you leave your computer for a while. Does it suspend and wake on your input as you expect?/li liTry to disable codePower Nap/code and wait for a night or two. Does you Mac wake as you expect the next morning? codePower Nap/codeallows the Mac to automatically wake up periodically, to do several tasks. It's possible that codePower Nap/codewakes up your Mac for too much time or too often during the night, using all your battery power. /li liClick on codeSchedule/code button on the bottom left of the window, and uncheck any checkbox. Maybe there's a shutdown scheduled for night time. /li liTry to uncheck the codeWake for network access/code option, and wait for a night or two. Maybe some other device on the network wakes your Mac during the night. /li /ol  It's also possible that one or more preference files that store one these options got damaged, causing some kind of strange behaviour. Just deactivating and reactivating them could be enough to fix them, and restore normal behaviour.   <answer273084> Your "Shutdown Cause" has three separate values:  0, 3, and 5.  ul li"5" is a clean shutdown /li li"3" is a dirty shutdown meaning the power button was held for 3 seconds or more/li li"0" means power loss/li /ul  (contrary to what you'd think the values "should be, I know...)  There's an answer here on Ask Different that addresses the shutdown causes:  Are OS X shutdown cause and sleep cause numbers listed/explained anywhere?  A power failure on a "desktop" Mac (iMac, Mac mini, Mac Pro) is easily explained.  However, since you have a laptop (MacBook Pro), it's very concerning because if your electric current is cut, your battery will kick in and if that battery gets too low, it will save a hibernation image.    The 0 is as if you had no battery and pulled the plug - the system just cut out.  I would take it in and have a look at it.  This is definitely not normal behavior.  <comment343037> Look for the shutdown codes in your syslog:  `log show --style syslog --contains "shutdown cause"`  It will give you and error code.  Post that to your original question. <comment343039> @Allan, The OP is tagged `sierra` as well it's mentioned in the OP and the `log` _command_ in macOS Sierra does not contain an _option_ named `--contains`, although there is a `--predicate` _option_ which filters messages based on the provided predicate. <comment343070> Thanks on your comment. I had no changes to make as everything was already set per your recommendations. Energy saver says no issues with the battery. Turn off display is at 10 mins for each. Power nap is disabled for both. No boxes are checked for schedule. Wake for network is unchecked for both. I checked and unchecked each per your last suggestion. <comment343071> --contains leads to the help menu. --predicate gives: Bad predicate: shutdown cause <comment343077> log show --style syslog --predicate 'eventMessage contains "shutdown cause"'   The above worked. Posting results in the main post. <comment343286> Woops... @user3439894 is correct.  Sorry about that...I was typing that from memory when I was out out and about on a PC.  Ever since Sierra moved away from `syslog` I found myself having to memorize a whole new set of commands.... <comment343297> I was beginning to think that this is a hardware issue rather than a software issue. This all started when I updated to Sierra. I don't remember manually shutting down the laptop in a while since this issue kind of made restarts and shudowns irrelevant due to its daily nature. <comment343302> Installation of Sierra *may* be a coincidence, unfortunately, what I am seeing in the logs points to hardware.  I would downgrade to El Capitan to see if the problem goes away (for the record, I went to Sierra and went back to El Cap after a couple of weeks because the problems far outweighed the gains I didn't need).
