Change header of all text files in directory in commandline <body> I have tons of *.csv measurement files with following header:   precodeStart time: Thu Oct 09 15:46:16 CST 2014  Trend type: Average Wavelength over [259.09, 259.09]  Trend offset: None  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Begin Strip Chart Data&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Date    Elapsed Time    Absorbance(Absorbance) /code/pre  How can I change this with command-line in the whole directory to following header:   precodeDate    ElapsedTime Absorbance /code/pre  Cheers,  Hans  <answer148935> This will remove first four lines form codecsv/code files and remove "(Absorbance)" part from them:  precodefind . -name  "*\.csv" -exec \     bash -c "tail -n +5 {} |                  sed 's/Absorbance(Absorbance)/Absorbance/' |                  sed 's/Elapsed Time/ElapsedTime/' &gt; {}.bak |                  mv {}.bak {}" \; /code/pre  <comment175425> To clarify: you want to strip off the first 4 lines of each file? Or all lines before "Date    Elapsed Time    Absorbance(Absorbance)"? <comment175433> Thanks, you saved me at least one day of copy and paste!! The only thing left is to remove the space in "Elapsed Time" to get "ElapsedTime". I tried it with sed but the result was a empty file (because I have no idea of apple skript ;) <comment175440> I've eddited my answer. But If You have already run this command, remove `tail` because You'll lose first 4 lines in every csv file. <comment175442> That works fine, thank you very much!!! <comment175466> @Hans note this is not AppleScript but Unix shell script
