Droplet Applescript Touch <body> i was trying the last days to get a droplet working, which is changing the time stamp of every dropped .jpg / .tif / .dsc / .cr2 to the actual time or even a few secs earlier in Terminal.  Would appreciate if anyone could help me.  Greetings TiRa  <answer125789> You can use Automator to create your droplet.
