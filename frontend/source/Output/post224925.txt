Script opens two terminal windows <body> I coded this little AppleScript using emAutomator/em:  precodetell application "Terminal" do script "myscript" end tell /code/pre  This perfectly works but has a side effect: when I close the window, there's always the Terminal window to close, so there are two windows, the one that executes the script and the Terminal.  Is there any way to have just one window running?  <answer224937> Try:  precodetell application "Terminal"     if not (exists window 1) then reopen     activate     do script "echo hi" in window 1 end tell /code/pre  <answer274158> Looks like when Terminal is not open, then codetell application Terminal/code opens the Terminal with first window and codedo script/code opens another window (because codedo script/code is supposed to open new window).  Partial solution is to codedo script ... in window 1/code, which forces to run the script in recently opened window, but when Terminal was in use before, this would hijack existing window (and possibly unsuitable context).  Following script did the trick for me:  precodeif application "Terminal" is running then      tell application "Terminal"            # do script without "in window" will open a new window                 do script "echo HELLO"                      activate                               end tell                               else                                           tell application "Terminal"            # window 1 is guaranteed to be recently opened window                 do script "echo HELLO" in window 1          activate     end tell end if  /code/pre  em(I got inspiration from adayzdone's proposal, but it didn't work for me (in El Capitan). Looks like after codetell application "Terminal"/code the condition codenot (exists window 1)/code never holds.)/em  <comment272854> What happens when You only make `do script "myscript"` ? <comment273015> @Mateusz Szolsek: I get an error
