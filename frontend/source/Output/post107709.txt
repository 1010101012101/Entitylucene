Utility to re-encode mp3s <body> I'm looking to batch re-encode 96-kbit mp3s to a higher rate (yes, sounds bizarre, but I'm sure it is possible).  Would anyone know of such a utility?  I believe Goldwave in Windows can do this.  <comment126296> Could you elaborate on why you want this? You wouldn't gain any quality. Maybe the underlying problem can be solved differently. <comment126297> It's to upload to grooveshark some files I have from way back... shh, don't tell them! Update: Adapter may work for this.  Just tried it.  Link: https://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/33916/adapter <comment126298> And Grooveshark does not accept 96kpbs files? I think your question is not very helpful to the community as "up converting" MP3 files is not very common. Therefore I'm flagging this question to close. <comment126299> No, it does not.  I think it may be helpful to those who are looking for such an app.  I knew how to do this on Windows with Goldwave, and couldn't find an app to do it on OSX, till now.  It may not be common, and that is why I asked here - and others may as well. <comment126300> Ok, no worries. I just flagged, the community now decides if the question is useful or not. <comment126301> ffmpeg will do this, quite easily. You can either use a shell script or an automator script to 'batch' it.
