Preset a password for all encrypted backups by policy <body> I am trying to find a way to protect my Corporate data. Currently this revolves around backing up data. When you backup an apple device it contains any Exchange/Activesync data. When you restore the device it will contain the data. So if my company terminates someone, I wipe the device, they can do a restore and pick up the company data that was on the device last backup.  My plan is to enforce encrypted backups, then set a password on the device that the end user does not know. They can backup the device but in order to restore they will need a password.   My question; is it possible to preset the password so that I don't have to physically take each device and connect to iTunes in order to set a password on it. Alternatively if you have any better ideas on how to safeguard data I am all ears.
