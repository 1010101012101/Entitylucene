Get back guest user osx 10.10.1 <body> I upgraded to 10.10.1 and now I can only reboot to Safari mode and enable parental controls on guest user is greyed.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/PlryA.png" alt="enter image description here"  Does anyone know how to get the real guest user account back?  <answer168985> If FileVault is enabled the guest user can only use Safari because they can't access the encrypted disk partition the system resides on.  <comment185234> so setting it up in the system preferences users does not work ? <comment185236> @Buscarì›ƒ added screenshot of prefs <comment185239> Thanks, the Guest User is enabled, but the Parental controls is grayed out ? delete that account and try again. <comment185242> BTW This release is a POS. My laptop keyboard no longer works with an external plugged in. <comment185244> That is why I am still on 10.9.5 and waiting as usual for 3-5 months for them to iron things out. There is nothing on 10.10 that I must have urgently :) <comment185255> Have you tried editing the guest account from the Parental Controls control panel? I would imagine that you could disable parental controls (or at least make it wide open) from there. I haven't upgraded to 10.10 yet, so I haven't tried it myself.
