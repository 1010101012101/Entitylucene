How to get old Spotlight Search View back for Yosemite? <body> I do not like Yosemite's default Spotlight search.  It is in the middle of screen and I can see very little outputs at once.  It is so much helpful when it is full screen.   Example of the window which has limited height and central location: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dHLEF.png" alt="enter image description here"  strongHow can you change the location be at the top right corner and height of the hits full height?/strong  <answer159887> As of today there is no way to move/resize the spotlight window or to rollback to the previous spotlight (as seen on older OSXs)  I would suggest giving a feedback to Apple about this.   <answer179866> Here my second bug report to Apple  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/953u4.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer189163> You don't need "old spotlight" it still exists - just do a spotlight search and then scroll down to the bottom of the documents list on the left until you get to "Show all in finder" and (Fx: roll on the drums) magically old spotlight's results will appear!   <answer218764> I was also annoyed by the obtrusive, centrally-located spotlight window. My only solution was to move the window into the upper-right hand corner. OSX remembers the window position so it always reopens in the upper-right hand corner for me now. Slightly more palatable then the original position. Hope this helps!  <comment213399> I sent a feedback about this to Apple second time today and put this time the form which I used to the body of my question.
