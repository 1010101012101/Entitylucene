Allowing other clients on a Wireless network to access an Internet shared device <body> I'm currently using internet sharing to share my WiFi (codeen1/code) connection over my Ethernet (codeen0/code) port. I have a computer plugged into my iMac's ethernet using a crossover Ethernet cable (codebridge100/code).  I would like clients outside of my iMac's en0 network interface to be able to connect to the client I am sharing my connection with, so that they can access the website hosted on port 80 on that client. I had originally been using nginx codeproxy_pass/code to proxy the traffic to port 80, but since I installed ESXi on the client machine, which uses HTTPs instead of HTTP - I have been unable to connect outside of the network, as it attempts to redirect the browser to the actual IP address of the client (code192.168.2.3/code), which the rest of the clients on the network can't connect to.  I have looked around for ip routing technologies similar to codeiptables/code for my Mac, but I have come to no suitable solution to my issue. I had thought that codeipfw/code may have resolved my issue, however I later found out that it was removed from Mac OS in the Yosemite update. I also looked at codepf/code, and attempted to use that, using the following rules:  precode   rdr pass on en1 inet proto tcp from any to any port 80 -&gt; 192.168.2.3 port 80    rdr pass on en1 inet proto tcp from any to any port 443 -&gt; 192.168.2.3 port 443 /code/pre  I also tried using codelo0/code, codebridge100/code and codeen0/code instead of codeen1/code, which were also of no use.  My last attempt was to use SSH tunnelling, as the client was previously running Ubuntu, until I remembered that it was no longer running Ubuntu, and ESXi doesn't allow SSH connections.  I need to be able to connect to code192.168.2.3/code from a Windows client, to install the vSphere Client and manage ESXi, so my last resort is to virtualise Windows using a virtualisation software such as Fusion or VirtualBox.  Thanks in advance, Harry  <comment217651> I suggest you to give names to all the pieces of your network problem (`Alice`, `Bob`, `Charly`â€¦), so as to get a correct answer from people skilled in network. As an example, when you have 3 networks involved, an expression as "outside of the network" isn't cristal clear :).
