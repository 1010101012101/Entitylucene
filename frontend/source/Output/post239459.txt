How to disable "look up" context menu in Google Chrome OSX 10.10+? <body> This is a distinct question from Is the &quot;Lookup in Dictionary&quot; context menu option hardcoded in Google Chrome for Mac?  I want to get rid of the "Look Up x" contextual menu in Chrome:  How can it be done?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/oMCCy.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer285525> I know this isn't what you want to hear, but maybe you should switch to command + c to copy if you want to avoid it. Thats what I migrated to and I almost forgot "Look Up" was even there. It'll eventually become a reflex.  <answer293445> Unfortunately it cannot be removed. It was marked as WontFix because it's part of the MacOS convention. It has been officially answered here: https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=543891  <answer293779> This is not really an answer as much as a workaround.  Get more practice using codeCommand-C/code.  I work I.T. and inherited this Mac from my predecessor--and I'm still not a huge fan after four years.  I now realize what I once despised is more of a square peg than a pile of junk.  Learning what can be supplanted or bypassed has brought me a long way, and I've found much to appreciate about Macs and OSX†.  One thing I actually like is this "emrapid dictionary/em" feature, "codelook up X/code" in the context menu.  When I'm 95% certain I'm about to use a word correctly in Gmail or a forum, confirming is a great deal faster here than opening a new tab to type codedictionary.com/browse/X/code.   My mousing accuracy isn't what it once was (pre-fatherhood gaming marathons), but as a geek I've long held that the keyboard is nearly always faster anyway.  I use Linux at home, and I still support a million Windows boxes, so I frustrate myself with my new propensity to hit Alt-whatever due to my codeCmd-C/code habits.  Of all the things I've maligned in my adjustment curve to OSX and its related walled garden frustrations, this is one of the few things I've observed with, "emhuh--that's kinda neat/em."  Sorry to disagree with you, but maybe my own frustration and learning curve can help you embrace things we can't change. :-)  † I'll always prefer Linux to a Mac, but this is pretty solid hardware I must admit.  <comment311200> This has been discussed in the Chrome development under this bug report: https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=543891 but they opted to keep it to not "break the Mac UI feel". They are apparently looking into some instrumentation to see if it is used at all (I bet the answer is no) before considering removing it. An option to get rid of it would be enough if you ask me. <comment356978> This is so annoying, i misclick it so many times when trying to copy some text. It would already help if this would be moved further down the context menu.
