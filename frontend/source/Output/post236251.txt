Finder crash and missing MAC Snow Leopard <body> I have an old MacBook Pro under Snow Leopard and I have an issue with Finder. It keep crashing for not particular reason. When it does all things from finder can't work(can't shut an app or open..). Strange thing is, finder doesn't appear in "force quit application" the box is empty and the only way is to force shut down the computer. when I turn on my mac everything goes back to normal until finder decide to crash again, or it simply don't sometime. I've had this message while I was trying to re-launch finder : -10810. Anyway its pretty annoying^^ anyone know somethings about it ? I was thinking of copying all my files and clean up my hard disk but maybe there is another way..  Thanks for responding me :)   <comment289152> You should try doing this command on the terminal "defaults delete finder && launchctl load -w /system/library/launchagents/com.apple.finder.plist". Hope this helps! <comment289277> Thanks for your response, so you suggest I try deleting finder preference "com.apple.finder.plist" ? It will normally create a new one after right and not any other problems can come with that action ? <comment289289> [Edit] I have delete the "com.apple.finder.plist" file plus the "com.apple.sidebarlists.plist" and restart my mac. nothing seems to have changed. After that I have restarted in safe mode I will see in the future if anything work better <comment289319> Did you do the other command: 'launchctl load -w /system/library/launchagents/com.apple.finder.plist'?
