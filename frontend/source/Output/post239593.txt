Downgrade GCC version <body> How do I downgrade my GCC v5 to GCC version 4.7 ? I currently don't have Xcode installed and I am using the command line tool.  More details :   precodeApple LLVM version 7.3.0 (clang-703.0.29) Target: x86_64-apple-darwin15.4.0 Thread model: posix /code/pre  OS X Version : 10.11.4  <answer239609> To install GCC 4.7 from Homebrew:  precode$ brew tap homebrew/homebrew-versions $ brew install gcc47 /code/pre  which will install it as codegcc-47/code. If you want to install as codegcc/code instead:  precode$ ln -s /usr/local/bin/gcc-47 /usr/local/bin/gcc /code/pre  <comment294075> That info is not for gcc it is for clang. How did you install gcc. (and why do you need the older version) <comment294078> My nvcc compiler is creating problem while i'm trying to use my NVIDIA GPU. I installed gcc from home-brew. Hope that helps
