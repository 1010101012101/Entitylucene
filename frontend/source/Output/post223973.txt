Duplicated volume name bug with NTFS-formated drives on Yosemite <body> I used this solution, Write to NTFS-formated drives on Yosemite, but after system restart have strange bug with names for NTFS drives - every next reboot I see new number right after volume's name. E.g. at first it was DISTRIB, after next reboot - DISTRIB 1, next time DISTRIB  2 and...   Any ideas?  <answer223996> This duplicating of volume names appears to be a known issue in FUSE for OS X that has been fixed in more recent versions.  https://github.com/osxfuse/osxfuse/issues/119  The Homebrew cask system is still installing 2.x versions but if you install one of the pre-release 3.x versions from GitHub the issue is reported to have been fixed.  <answer224913> Finally I solved it by updating to 3.1.0 (thanx guys) and deleting alias icons. After system reboot my volumes got their original names  <comment271608> Download an install the latest [FUSE for OS X](https://osxfuse.github.io) from a standard installer package. <comment271623> Just got 3.1.0 from here (https://github.com/osxfuse/osxfuse/releases) installed. Rebooted. Still the same bug. Any additional things have to do? <comment271635> Still have this bug. Strange... <comment271687> The new version might fix the problem but not be smart enough to tidy up. Try unmounting/unplugging the NTFS drive then deleting the extra folders under /Volumes, reboot and try plugging the drive in again. <comment271753> Done it. But had no extra folders there. After reboot drives have pugged automatically and kept names as they were before unplugging and rebooting <comment271767> I'm not clear, are you saying the problem is fixed or not? :) Is the name still incrementing after reboots? <comment271820> Now I think it is ok, but I don't know how to reset volume name to first state - it is still named "DISTRIB 5". Do you know how to rename it (change mount point name) to "DISTRIB"?
