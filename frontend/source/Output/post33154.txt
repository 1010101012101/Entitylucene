How do I change the location of screenshot in OS X Lion? <body> The old method that works for Leopard/Snow Leopard doesn't work any more on Lion:   precodedefaults write com.apple.screencapture location /Users/kamus/Pictures/snap /code/pre  Has something changed or does anyone have some good workarounds?  <answer33155> Perhaps it's because your path isn't really a path to a folder: Notice to terminating code//code:  precodedefaults write com.apple.screencapture location /Users/kamus/Pictures/snap/ /code/pre  <answer56789> You can also try TinkerTool to accomplish the same thing. I've found that TinkerTool is much easier than having to remember a whole bunch of codedefaults write com.apple.../code commands. It has all of the most useful ones in one place for you to easily change. You can find the screenshot destination one under the General tab:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/e3k9c.png" alt=""    (as noted by this comment, you emdon't/em have to log out and back in again, just use the Terminal command codekillall SystemUIServer/code)  <comment44464> Note to any other boneheads like me out there: this doesn't take effect until you log out and back in. <comment65207> @AbbyT.Miller No need to log out, just enter this in terminal: `killall SystemUIServer` <comment297100> How do I do this?
