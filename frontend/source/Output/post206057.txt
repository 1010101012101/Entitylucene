Is real hibernation possible on OS X? (mac mini/imac, not laptops) <body> I am looking for a real hibernation feature. Feature-wise I would like to be able to do both of the following:  ol litake a 15 minute break from work and take up when I left off without waiting longer than a few seconds - like an ordinary "standby" or "sleep"/li lihibernate my mac, turn off the power stripe, turn it on the next day and be back at exactly the same state as yesterday. I don't want my mac to boot again and reopen all apps using saved application state. I want it to dump the RAM to a file and load it exactly as it was - so effectively I want a #1 that may survive a power outage./li /ol  I did some research about this and all solutions I found were allowing either #1 or #2 but not both at the same time.  I tried to:  ul liset codehibernatemode/code to 3 and codestandby/code to 1, but it didn't cause my mac to hibernate after codestandbydelay/code/li liset codeautopoweroff/code to 1, but it didn't cause my mac to hibernate after codepoweroffdelay/code/li /ul
