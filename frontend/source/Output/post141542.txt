Is there any way to broadcast a part of your screen as webcam on OSX (for twitch, omegle etc)? <body> Title: can you get a section of your screen recognised as if it was a webcam, so sites like twitch and omegle will read from it?  <answer141543> You can use strongGrabberRaster/strong     Free screen grabber with live streaming: grab anything onscreen and use as a fake webcam. Desktop streaming, window grabs &amp; more!   The screencasting requires a paid licence.
