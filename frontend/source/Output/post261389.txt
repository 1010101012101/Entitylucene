Compiling with clang in the terminal is extremely slow after seeing a message that my disk is almost full. How to restore? <body> I removed files so I now have 18.7GB storage free. Still, compiling is extremely slow. How can I remedy this? Is there some setting that I missed?  <answer261457> If you are on a spinning hard disk and you remove a large amount of files, you might have sub-optimal allocation of some files.  You can test that by shutting down the Mac after removing the source files or copying them to another drive.  After the restart, you might run for a day (set the Mac to never sleep) and the hot file optimization will start to move files that aren't accessed often off of the fastest portion of the hard drive.  Then - move your source code back and try a compile. At that point if you are still slow, you'll need to get into specifics - use the codetime/code command to time the compiles and then profile the system with codevm_stat 5/code or similar like Activity Monitor to see if you are constrained by RAM or by CPU or by IO.
