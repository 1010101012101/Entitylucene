Logging in automatically without removing the password <body> Is there any way to have OSX log in automatically in a certain account when starting up, without asking for the password, while preventing remote (or even local network) connections without password?   I have a computer that I use both as a home server and a media center, so it has to be accessible from outside world in a secure manner (SSH + Screen Sharing), but at the same time I don't want to key in the passwords every time my media center boots up, or more importantly each time it wakes up from sleep.  <answer214680> Yes, this is possible. An strongautomatic login/strong option is available within the System Preferences.  strongSystem Preferences  Users &amp; Groups  Login Options  Automatic login/strong  This ability may not be available if you are using FileVault.  When setting up this option, you will need to provide the user's password. See Does activating auto-login compromise secure password storage? for a discussion about how this feature works.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Tm6H9.png" alt="System Preferences on OS X"  <comment259409> Ah, the problem was File Vault. Thanks for mentioning that. I don't have any critical file on that computer per se, so I removed File Vault encryption and it worked.
