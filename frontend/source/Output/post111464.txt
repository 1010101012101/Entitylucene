AXSelectedRows: Getting selected rows for AXOutline <body> I feel that AXSelectedRows has finally beaten me into submission :) After extensive research, I am stumped as to how to programmatically list the contents of AXSelectedRows; simply put, to get the selected rows of any given AXOutline.   It sounds trivial, but finding an answer has proven difficult - particularly due to the lack of online documentation (though I should probably buy a book!) Strangely, a lot of people just seem to want to programmatically select rows, instead of getting selected rows.  I am certainly close though. I have reached thus far:  precodeset selectedRows to value of attribute "AXSelectedRows" of outline1 /code/pre  where codeoutline1/code is set to an AXOutline. Next:  precodeset selectedRow to item 1 of selectedRows /code/pre  This is where it becomes a little murky (after already failing to set it to coderow 1/code instead of codeitem 1/code). I would expect codeselectedRow/code to be of type codeAXRow/code (or coderow/code), but instead Automator output displays:  precodeapplication "System Events" /code/pre  That is, the item appears to be an instance of 'application "System Events"' - which leads me to believe that I'm overlooking something important. Having said that, I feel that I've tried every combination of codevalue/code's, codeattribute/code's and coderow/code's - including some type-casting.  The frustrating part is that I can actually see the contents of AXSelectedRows in the Accessibility Inspector! And so I know that it exists. As a workaround, I am using:  precodeset selectedRows to selected of rows of outline1 /code/pre  However, this is certainly not preferable as I still have to loop through the entire array in order to find the 'true' values, which could have performance issues for very large lists.   Any help would be hugely appreciated!  <answer111469> I guess getting the value of AXSelectedRows is just something that has not been implemented. When I open a Finder window in list view, select two rows, and run this script:  precodetell application "System Events" to tell window 1 of process "Finder"     value of attribute "AXSelectedRows" of outline 1 of scroll area 1 of splitter group 1 end tell /code/pre  The result is:  precode{application "System Events", application "System Events"} /code/pre  However you can use a whose clause to get the selected rows without using a repeat loop:  precodetell application "System Events" to tell process "Finder"     rows of outline 1 of scroll area 1 of splitter group 1 of window 1 where selected is true end tell /code/pre  <comment131187> Thank you for investigating this, Lri. Your suggestion works a treat!...while also being efficient. I'd be surprised if it has not been implemented though - I believe it is more likely to be a bug in AppleScript. According to Apple's own documentation (https://developer.apple.com/library/Mac/documentation/ApplicationServices/Reference/AXRoleConstants_header_reference/Reference/reference.html), AXSelectedRows should return an array - and therefore the bug would be that they forgot to implement it :) Either way, you've satisfactorily answered the question!
