Mac App Store stuck with app update <body> It's been like this for months:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hYTGD.png" height="95"  A friend of mine downloaded Angry Birds on his account, then signed out. Then a week later I said "I'm never going to play this." and deleted the app, however, the update still remains.  Hitting update returns "Unknown Error".  Attempting to purchase Angry Birds again or re-sintall it on any account (even my friends) returns "Unknown Error", and then "The app store encountered a problem. Please try again later. (4)"  How can I get it to go away!? It won't display my emother/em app updates either! My update tab is just broken and stuck on Angry Birds.  Here's what I've tried:  ol liUsing AppZapper to remove App Store pref files. Works for a moment, then if you hit the updates tab it refreshes and goes back./li liRe-installing Angry Birds/li liChanging accounts and trying the above./li liSigning out of iTunes/li /ol  Nothing works. Am I doomed to see that update forever?  <comment30667> The icon looks weird to me. Do you use some kind of mods? <comment30698> It's a custom icon, yes. That's irrelevant. <comment92542> @JacksonGariety did you fixed this error? <comment92594> Got my friend to sign into his account, re-downloaded it, removed it. <comment92701> @JacksonGariety redownloading it and then remove? hmm <comment95212> @JacksonGariety If you fixed the problem, you should probably make an answer for it. That way, your question won't appear in Unanswered so others can easily find the answer. <comment95266> @loldop Yes, it had already been deleted, that's why it was a problem in the first place.
