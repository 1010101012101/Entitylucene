How to make shared printing works on Yosemite within an IPv4 only network? <body> h2Network landscape/h2  My network is made through Internet Sharing from a Mac: codeBob/code hosting an USB printer: codeClara/code. On this home network is a Mac: codeAlice/code which is usually printing on codeClara/code through codeBob/code.  precodeAlice    --AirPort--    Bob    --Ethernet--    Internet Mac                     Mac 10.0.2.23       10.0.2.1    192.168.1.1                          |                         USB                          |                         Clara                         printer /code/pre  Of course, on codeBob/code the codeFirewall/code is on, and the sharing of codeClara/code is on.  One key detail: this problem of shared printing failing occured when I upgraded codeBob/code from Mountain Lion to strongYosemite/strong.  h2Bug/h2  For security reasons (don't let open what you don't fully control), I stop any IPv6 on the internal side of my network.  On both codeAlice/code, codeBob/code I ran:  precodenetworksetup -setv6off Wi-Fi /code/pre  Since this modification my network is working perfectly (and in fact much better). codeAlice/code can access the Internet with codessh/code, codehttp/code, codeIMAP/code, codesmtp/codeâ€¦ without a glitch, but for printing.  codeAlice/code does still see codeClara/code as a shared printer, but printing dosen't work, and the printer window stays on the message:  precodePrinting - Looking for printer /code/pre  forever. The codeCUPS/code error log does says:  precodeE [23/May/2015:11:05:50 +0200] [Job 621] Unable to find printer. /code/pre  If on codeAlice/code I check the reachability of codeCUPS/code on codeBob/code I get:  precodealice$ telnet 10.0.2.1 631 Trying 10.0.2.1... Connected to bob. Escape character is '^]'. /code/pre  Hence codeCUPS/code is running on codeBob/code and perfectly reachable through IPv4.  If I turn IPv6 back on, shared printing is working again. The firewall isn't involved in this network problem.  h2Question/h2  How may I get shared printing to work on an IPv4 only network?  I already found this correct analysis of a similar problem on Linux: Disabling IPv6 seems to break CUPS  But the suggested modification to the codecupsd.conf/code  framed with the relevant codelaunchctl stop... launchctl start/code doesn't fix it.  Moreover I discovered that I have to be cautious on tuning:  precode/etc/cups/cupsd.conf /code/pre  because codePrinter Sharing/code activation is overwriting this configuration file.
