First iPhone, what should I Do? <body> So, I've decided to go for an iPhone 4. But since I am new to the whole iPhone thing, what are the things that I should know, to make the maximum use of the device?  Some of the questions I would like to know the answer:  ol liwhat are the apps I should install? /li liHow do I charge the battery? /li liThe temperature the iPhone should be exposed to in order to prolong the lifespan?/li /ol  <answer2847> 1) That entirely depends on what you want to do. There are a bunch of app recommendation discussions here based around games, productivity, etc. Rather than rehash them, I'd suggest searching those out.  2) Plug it into a USB port on your computer. The phone also comes with a wall adapter for the USB cable so you can charge it from a wall socket.  3) Don't stick it in the oven or the freezer and you should be fine.  <answer2854> Apple has a handy "iPhone Temperate Zone" chart on their iPhone battery page.  As for what apps to install: the reason apps are user-installable is because everybody wants different ones!  But also, if you're in Malaysia, you probably have a different selection of available apps in your App Store from most other users here, anyway.  <comment2543> what about the screen? Let's say if my hands are oily and I touch the screen, will that make the screen oily too? <comment2544> Make sure you donâ€™t blend it: http://www.willitblend.com/videos.aspx?video=iphone <comment2552> @Ngu Soon Hui - As long as you can still hold onto it, it'll be okay. When it gets too slippery to hold, you'll want to wipe it on your shirt. <comment2571> The oleophobic screen on the iPhone is surprisingly awesome at keeping itself clean, and easily wiped off if it gets dirty.
