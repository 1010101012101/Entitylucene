Can I use sharing? <body> Can I use "Share my library on my local network" ? I have my library in a shared folder on my iMac, this is to stop having to have the same music stored twice so my other half can use iTunes as well as me.  I was told not to turn this on when helped by apple phone desk when setting this up, but that was quite a long time and updates ago now. I would like to airplay my music to an ATV.  Using iTunes 11.3.1 and Mountain Lion.  <answer144373> Home Sharing is a feature that became available in iTunes version 9.   Home Sharing makes it easy to connect to the other iTunes libraries in your home network so you can stream and share--actually copy--music, movies, TV shows, apps, and ringtones.  You can set it up in iTunes:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/840es.jpg" alt="home sharing"  strongNOTE:/strong  You might want to do this in iTunes preferences:  To prevent iPods, iPhones, and iPads from syncing automatically!  Prevent devices from automatically syncing with this iTunes library when a device is connected.   To sync a device, click the Sync button when the device is connected.  <comment170051> Not sure what is holding you back to use Airplay. <comment170232> I was told by apple when setting up "Not To" turn on home sharing with library in shared folder! <comment170249> Do you remember what they said why not. <comment170264> No just remembered that I was told not to several times during setup. <comment170267> Thanks for that , but not quite what I was asking! <comment170272> Why would Apple make the "Home sharing" and then tell users not to use it?. What they probably told you is to disable the "automatic syncing". <comment170370> No they VERY clearly told me not to use home sharing, still lots of time passed now moved on a system up date or 3....
