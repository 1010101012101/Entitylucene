Using CTRL with bash <body> Coming from year on Windows, I swapped kbdCmd/kbd and kbdCtrl/kbd buttons.  On bash I used to press kbdCtrl/kbd+kbdA/kbd/kbdCtrl/kbd+kbdE/kbd for jumping to the beginning/end of line. But, since I swapped the buttons I need press kbdCmd/kbd+kbdA/kbd/kbdCmd/kbd+kbdE/kbd.  How I make bash recognize back my beloved key combination?  <comment284646> Long term it's **far** simpler to just get used to the difference, than try to patch it. <comment285501> If you figure this out, let me know. :) <comment285522> @Vladimir Eventually I did what Tetsujin proposed :( <comment286548> I'm going to keep resisting ;) <comment289602> @Vladimir You could probably achieve the result you want with a third party app like Keyboard Maestro. However, I cannot emphasise enough on used default shortcuts, because Mac shortcuts are somewhat intuitive for which you'll start to get a feel for after some time. Cherish the best of both worlds. <comment289654> @user14492 Cool! Thanks for the suggestion! +1 Yeah, I agree just learning it would be the best option for most people. In my case personally it will be confusing because I'm a programer and I have to use my Mac and Windows about 50/50. So having to stop and think about which key combo I need would hurt my productivity too much. Haha :)
