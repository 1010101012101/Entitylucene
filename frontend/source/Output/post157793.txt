iTunes Store - Use My Credit Card Not Store Credit For A Gifted Item <body> I have some store credit on my iTunes account that I got couple months ago and am gifting a film on iTunes for my sisters birthday..br If i gift the film does the cost come off my store credit or my credit card?  <answer157795> Quote from Apple's Support page about Gifting...     "When you purchase an iTunes Gift, you must have a valid credit card   on file; you can't purchase an iTunes Gift with store credit..."   brbr   - http://support.apple.com/en-us/ht2736   So to simplify..   Apple charges the gifted item straight to your credit/debit card. strongNOT/strong the credit on your account.
