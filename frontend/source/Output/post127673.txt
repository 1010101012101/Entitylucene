Can I disable Safari's pinch-to-zoom tab switcher? <body> When looking at a PDF document I often want to zoom-out to scroll quickly to its contents and get an overview.  However, when I zoom-out past a certain threshold (it seems to differ per PDF) Safari thinks I want to see the tab overview:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/q1IE6.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  I have never found a use for this function, so it only causes annoyance.  Can I turn this tab overview off somehow? A solution that uncouples the pinch-to-zoom gesture from the functionality would also work.  I'm on Mountain Lion 10.8.5 with Safari 6.1.3.  <answer127682> This is currently not possible. Apple does not provide a way to turn this off.  Note that if your swiping is begun whilst still zoomed slightly, the tab switcher is not invoked.
