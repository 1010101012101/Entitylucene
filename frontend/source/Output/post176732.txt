Create a bootable USB with Windows installer for Yosemite? <body> I'm having trouble creating a bootable USB for my mac. I have an iMac, and I'm wanting to install a copy of Windows Server 2008 x86 onto it. I've tried BootCamp, but I'm getting errors when selecting the ISO because it is "not Windows 7 or later".  Does anyone have any idea how I could create a USB that I can boot on my Mac, with my Windows Server 2008 ISO?  <answer176734> According to the Ubuntu site, you can do the following:  ol liLaunch Disk Utility (Applications → Utilities → Disk Utility)./li liInsert your blank CD/DVD. Drag and drop your .iso file to the left pane in Disk Utility. Now both the blank disc and the .iso should be listed. /li liSelect the .iso file, and click on the Burn button in the toolbar.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/N45C8.png" alt="macosx_disk-utility"  Ensure that the "Verify burned data" checkbox is ticked (you may need to click on the disclosure triangle to see the checkbox). /li liClick on Burn. The data will be burned and verified./li /ol  <answer176737> Here is how to burn a bootable USB stick (taken from the Ubuntu website):  ol liOpen the Terminal (in /Applications/Utilities/ or query Terminal in Spotlight)./li liConvert the .iso file to .img using the convert option of hdiutil e.g., codehdiutil convert -format UDRW -o ~/path/to/target.img ~/path/to/windows.iso/code Note: OS X tends to put the .dmg ending on the output file automatically./li liRun codediskutil list/code to get the current list of devices./li liInsert your flash media./li liRun codediskutil list/code again and determine the new device node assigned to your flash media (e.g. /dev/disk2)./li liRun codediskutil unmountDisk /dev/diskN/code (replace N with the disk number from the last command; in the previous example, N would be 2)./li liExecute codesudo dd if=/path/to/downloaded.img of=/dev/rdiskN bs=1m/code (replace /path/to/downloaded.img with the path where the image file is located; for example, ./windows.img or ./ubuntu.dmg). Using /dev/rdisk instead of /dev/disk may be faster. If you see the error dd: Invalid number '1m', you are using GNU dd. Use the same command but replace bs=1m with bs=1M. If you see the error dd: /dev/diskN: Resource busy, make sure the disk is not in use. Start the 'Disk Utility.app' and unmount (don't eject) the drive./li liRun codediskutil eject /dev/diskN/code and remove your flash media when the command completes./li liRestart your Mac and press alt/option key while the Mac is restarting to choose the USB stick./li /ol  <comment208752> Thanks for the suggestion, but I'm trying to create a bootable usb because 1. I'm fed up of burning DVDs because I can't burn them again, 2. I don't actually have any DVDs that I can burn to left! <comment208754> Yeah, it makes shure its a bootable. It takes a few steps. But i can boot any linux version i want from usb via this tutorial. Done the same with windows 7, vista and xp. I run all opperating systems :) <comment208755> Ah okay, sounds good. Would I be able to boot it from a mac if I tried that? <comment208756> Yup, have a imac an mac pro running linux dual boot with osx. I used to have osx dualboot with windows. But wanted an alternative to bootcamp. This was my sollution. I was used to bios from windows haha. This made more scense installing an os than bootcamp! Hope it helps you out. And otherwize ill post the exact link tomorrow! <comment208757> Thanks a lot man! I found the post I think you're referring to, I will give it a go now! <comment208758> Cool good luck mate! <comment208767> Tried this method and was very hopeful. Everything looked good, until I rebooted, and the Mac still couldn't see the USB at the boot device selection screen. Guess I'll just have to source some more DVDs tommorow!
