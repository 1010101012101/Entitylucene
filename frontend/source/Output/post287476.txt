The new created terminal can not find the file use which in Mac <body> After I installed the mysql in my Mac, it locate in the:  precode/usr/local/mysql  /code/pre  And after I use codeexport/code add the PATH to the $PATH, I can use codewhich mysql_config/code find it:  precodeaircraftdeMacBook-Pro:/ ldl$ which mysql_config /usr/local/mysql/bin//mysql_config /code/pre  But however when I use kbdCommand/kbd+kbdN/kbd create a new Terminal, in it can not searched the codemysql_config/code now:  kbdimg src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hqqto.jpg" alt="enter image description here"/kbd  <answer287477> If you modify the PATH variable in a Terminal session by exporting it (e.g. codeexport PATH="/usr/local/mysql/bin:$PATH"/code it will be expired in the next session.  So either edit the file ~/.bash_profile or edit /private/etc/paths if you need this PATH for other users also.  In ~/.bash_profile add the line:  precodeexport PATH="/usr/local/mysql/bin:$PATH" /code/pre  In /private/etc/paths add the line  precode/usr/local/mysql/bin /code/pre  Close your current Terminal session, launch a new one to enable the new PATH and check the result:  precodeecho $PATH which mysql_config /code/pre  <comment362974> Add this `export $PATH` to the `~/.bash_profile` file. This file is "executed" every time new Terminal window/tab is opened. <comment362978> If there is diffrence between `export PATH="/usr/local/mysql/bin:$PATH"` and `export PATH="$PATH:/usr/local/mysql/bin"` <comment362979> @aircraft The first occurrence of a file x in the path will be executed or found with `which`. If you would have an old version of mysql_config in e.g /usr/bin it would be executed in the second case but not your new mysql_config. It's the other way round in the first case: the file mysql_config in /usr/local/mysql/bin/ would be executed preferably and the file /usr/bin/mysql_config would be ignored.
