External HDD cannot be mounted <body> I really have a problem with my HDD. I was working on it, it was my local HDD installed on a MacBook 2009 but some day my Mac turned off suddenly and it didn't work again.  I installed OS X on a new disk and tried to attach the other in an external case but the volume doesn't mount.  The now broken disk contained one visible volume and OS X 10.10 Yosemite was installed.  Here are the partition infos I can see:  precodearturoperez$ diskutil list  /dev/disk0    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *250.1 GB   disk0    1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1    2:                  Apple_HFS New Mac                 99.5 GB    disk0s2    3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s3    4:                  Apple_HFS Datos                   149.6 GB   disk0s4 /dev/disk1    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:     FDisk_partition_scheme                        *159.3 GB   disk1    1:                       0xEE                         159.3 GB   disk1s1  arturoperez$ diskutil info /dev/disk1s1     Device Identifier:        disk1s1    Device Node:              /dev/disk1s1    Part of Whole:            disk1    Device / Media Name:      Untitled 1     Volume Name:              Not applicable (no file system)     Mounted:                  Not applicable (no file system)     File System:              None     Partition Type:           0xEE    OS Can Be Installed:      No    Media Type:               Generic    Protocol:                 USB    SMART Status:             Not Supported     Total Size:               159.3 GB (159307878400 Bytes) (exactly 311148200 512-Byte-Units)    Volume Free Space:        Not applicable (no file system)    Device Block Size:        4096 Bytes     Read-Only Media:          No    Read-Only Volume:         Not applicable (no file system)    Ejectable:                Yes     Whole:                    No    Internal:                 No /code/pre  The output of codesudo gpt -r show /dev/disk1/code and codesudo fdisk /dev/disk1/code:  precodearturoperez$ sudo gpt -r show /dev/disk1       start      size  index  contents          0         1         PMBR          1  38893525            arturoperez$ sudo fdisk /dev/disk1  Disk: /dev/disk1    geometry: 2421/255/63 [38893526 sectors] Sector size: 4096 bytes Signature: 0xAA55          Starting       Ending #: id  cyl  hd sec -  cyl  hd sec [     start -       size] ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 1: EE 1023 254  63 - 1023 254  63 [         1 -  312581807] &lt;Unknown ID&gt; 2: 00    0   0   0 -    0   0   0 [         0 -          0] unused       3: 00    0   0   0 -    0   0   0 [         0 -          0] unused       4: 00    0   0   0 -    0   0   0 [         0 -          0] unused /code/pre  Apparently it doesn´t have an active partition but I tried by different ways to fix it and i couldn´t.

All your work documents. The music you most enjoy. The movie of your kid's first steps. It's your life and it's gone. Don't panic! strongDiskWarrior/strong will recover your documents, photos, music and any other files when disaster strikes and you lose access to your files.   It may not be suitable depending on your original disk format but TestDisk can also recover damaged partitions:     strongTestDisk/strong is powerful free data recovery software! It was primarily designed to help recover lost partitions and/or make non-booting disks bootable again when these symptoms are caused by faulty software: certain types of viruses or human error (such as accidentally deleting a Partition Table). Partition table recovery using TestDisk is really easy.   <answer183020> Usually Mac disks contain a GPT (GUID Partition Table) to define the partitions. Your GPT seems to be destroyed/lost and only the PMBR is left. Your main goal is to rebuild the GPT. Recreating your GPT doesn't affect the content of your disk - except the first and last 32 blocks of course.  To reproduce your problem I've created a disk in a Yosemite-VM with the size mentioned in your question: 311,148,200 blocks à 512 Bytes=159,307,878,400 Bytes and installed a vanilla Yosemite system (10.10.3) including a Recovery HD.  After installing Yosemite your standard partition layout for disk1 should look like this:  precodeuser$ sudo gpt -r show /dev/disk1       start       size  index  contents           0          1         PMBR           1          1         Pri GPT header           2         32         Pri GPT table          34          6                   40     409600      1  GPT part - C12A7328-F81F-11D2-BA4B-00A0C93EC93B      409640  309468984      2  GPT part - 48465300-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC   309878624    1269536      3  GPT part - 426F6F74-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC   311148160          7            311148167         32         Sec GPT table   311148199          1         Sec GPT header /code/pre  If you don't want to buy DiskWarrior or aren't successful restoring the disk with TestDisk, you may try the following approach:  Backup disk1 to a raw file on a volume with enough free space with dd in case the following solution fails.br Example: codedd if=/dev/rdisk1 of=/Volumes/Backup/disk1.raw bs=1m/code. You need at least ~165 GB (the more, the better) of free space on the backup volume.  Now you may try to restore the GUID partition table with gpt.  Open Terminal and enter:  precodediskutil unmountDisk disk1 /code/pre  to unmount disk (assuming disk1 is your broken disk)  then enter  precodesudo gpt -r show /dev/disk1 /code/pre  (enter your password if you are asked for it) to get the current layout. It should look like this:  precode start      size  index  contents      0         1         PMBR      1  38893525          /code/pre  now enter:  precodesudo gpt create disk1 /code/pre  to create a new (empty) GPTbr then enter   precodesudo gpt add -b 40 -i 1 -s 409600 -t C12A7328-F81F-11D2-BA4B-00A0C93EC93B disk1 /code/pre  to create a partition table entry for the EFI-partition  unmount disk1 again if a new volume pops up on your desktop (unlikely):  precodediskutil unmountDisk disk1 /code/pre  then  precodesudo gpt add -b 409640 -i 2 -s 309468984 -t 48465300-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC disk1 /code/pre  to create a partition table entry for the main JHFS+-volume  unmount disk1 again if a new volume pops up on your desktop (happens often):  precodediskutil unmountDisk disk1 /code/pre  then  precodesudo gpt add -b 309878624 -i 3 -s 1269536 -t 426F6F74-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC disk1 /code/pre  to create a partition table entry for the Recovery HD.  Then you may label all the partitions with codesudo gpt label -i IndexNumber -l "Name" diskNumber/code:  precodesudo gpt label -i 1 -l "EFI" disk1 sudo gpt label -i 2 -l "OldMacintoshHD" disk1 sudo gpt label -i 3 -l "Recovery HD" disk1 /code/pre  Now remount disk1 with:  precodediskutil mountDisk disk1 /code/pre  Quit Terminal by entering codeexit/code and open Disk Utility. If the attempt was successful you should now see your previously vanished main volume. Check the volume for errors and repair them if necessary. strongemRepairing them may be desastrous (depends on the errors) without backup. Please leave a comment with the error message(s) before repairing./em/strong  This solution should work if you had a standard partition layout with one visible main volume previously and never had a second partition or installed Windows with the Boot Camp Assistant on the disk.  If you are in doubt I've already answered a similar question with a similar approach. The linked answer may work if you had a non-standard layout. You need to search for special strings/patterns with wxHexEditor on your disk to detect the start block/end block of your main volume and the Recovery HD and then calculate the table entries.  <answer261491> I have a similar issue, I Have a MBP 10,2 with Mac OS X Sierra 10.12 installed. I was running Windows 8.1 with VMWare Fusion, and i had the virtual disk on my external own, when the computer turned down cause no more battery, my external HD got stuck. I can see it from Disk Utility but the partition is unmounted. When i try to repair it says me that the filesystem output is (8) and there's an error. I try to mount it but nothing appears, just the HD led blinking for a while, like he's trying to connect but he can't do it. I tryed to mount it also from diskutil in terminal, but nothing happens. I've also tried to verify and repair it but nothing again.  strongHere's the output of:/strong codediskutil list/code  precode/dev/disk0 (internal, physical):    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *121.3 GB   disk0    1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1    2:          Apple_CoreStorage Macintos HD             120.5 GB   disk0s2    3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s3  /dev/disk1 (internal, virtual):    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:                            Macintosh HD           +120.1 GB   disk1                                  Logical Volume on disk0s2                                  15FE7657-5A3E-43B3-95A6-D577A121CF75                                  Unencrypted  /dev/disk2 (external, physical):    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:     FDisk_partition_scheme                        *320.1 GB   disk2    1:                  Apple_HFS BACKTRAXX               320.1 GB   disk2s1  /dev/disk3 (disk image):    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:     Apple_partition_scheme                        +536.9 MB   disk3    1:        Apple_partition_map                         32.3 KB    disk3s1    2:                  Apple_HFS StellarVolumeOptimizer  536.9 MB   disk3s2 /code/pre  strongHere's the output of:/strong codesudo gpt -r show /dev/disk2/code  precodestart       size  index  contents           0          1         MBR           1       2047                 2048  625137664      1  MBR part 175   625139712       2736 /code/pre  strongAnd here's the/strong codesudo fdisk /dev/disk2/code strongone:/strong  precodesh-3.2# Disk: /dev/disk2    geometry: 38913/255/63 [625142448 sectors] Signature: 0xAA55          Starting       Ending  #: id  cyl  hd sec -  cyl  hd sec [     start -       size] ------------------------------------------------------------------------ *1: AF 1023 254  63 - 1023 254  63 [      2048 -  625137664] HFS+          2: 00    0   0   0 -    0   0   0 [         0 -          0] unused        3: 00    0   0   0 -    0   0   0 [         0 -          0] unused        4: 00    0   0   0 -    0   0   0 [         0 -          0] unused       /code/pre  I'll hope that someone knows what to do, cause I've already tried everything that everyone said me, and I don't want to lose the files inside the HD..   emBest regards./em  <comment217748> Thanks for response... i was trying with testdisk but maybe i'm not an expert using it... is there anyway to help me with the commands or a guide? <comment217750> I have no experience with TestDisk, but I have successfully used DiskWarrior. Hopefully someone will be along shortly to help provide a tutorial or guide. <comment217777> I have no experience with TestDisk, but it seems to be based on pattern detection, so you will be able to recover (some) files to another media, but not to restore your disk. On the other hand, Disk Warrior performs an in memory reconstruction of the directory tree of HFS discs, so you can recover any part of your disc copying to a different one. <comment217808> It´s Yosemit 10.10 and there were just one volume... i just had one partition... when i executed testdisk there were no information about the heads and sectors of the disk... i don't know why this could be happen. <comment217995> MacBookdeArturo:Recuperacion HDD arturoperez$ sudo gpt -r show /dev/disk1 Password:      start      size  index  contents          0         1         PMBR          1  38893525 <comment217997> Ready, i added the info you requested... it's important to comment this: yesterday i changed the disk geometry and i could find some partitions, in this moment i am executing a process with testdisk to make a disk image. <comment218057> Thanks for response... i will follow your recommendation and will let you know. <comment218201> @klanomath: I have stared at this long enough without being able to figure it out. So, I will just ask: Is it normal for the sector size to be 4096 bytes? I have only seen such a sector size once [before](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/171050/fixing-my-external-hard-drives-partition-map) and that drive was 3 TB in size. Could the external case be designed for an Advanced Format Disk? <comment218216> @DavidAnderson Yes, meanwhile it's a normal physical sector size. It's the so-called AF ([Advanced Format](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Format)). Gpt, fdisk etc. still adhere to 512 byte sectors on the surface - probably for compatibility  reasons (MBR/GPT) and/or the "human habit". But internally they usually consider the 8 sector alignment (8 old sectors = 1 new sector). Check the gpt listings below or your own. The 3 major partitions are all aligned to 4096 byte sectors (all start blocks and sizes are dividable through 8!) <comment218394> @ArtMac I'm investigating both (gpt/TestDisk) at the moment. Please delete your last 3 comments here because they are hard to read without proper formatting. I already incorporated your "answers"/replies in your questions (check update 1 & 2 at your question). <comment218426> @ArtMac I can't reproduce the error message "gpt add: disk1: error: no primary GPT header..." after executing `sudo gpt create disk1`. I complete erased the mbr and the gpt on my test disk with [gdisk](http://sourceforge.net/projects/gptfdisk/) and still have been able to restore everything! Please check your log files with the Console.app if you get an error (e.g. i/o errors) executing  `sudo gpt create disk1`  and add it to your question. <comment303389> I'm having the issue this question addresses after a mac crash. I've just bought and tried Disk Warrior and it doesn't even see the disk I'm trying to repair :(
