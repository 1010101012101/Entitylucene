Run Javascript on specific Safari using Applescript <body> There will be many Safari browsers running in my machine. I want to execute the some javascript commands on specific Safari using the codePID/code's.   I have the code in applescript for it here:  precodetell application "System Events"     set proc to item 1 of (processes whose unix id is 2375)     tell proc         using terms from application "Safari"             tell proc to do JavaScript "" in document 1        end using terms from      end tell end tell /code/pre  where code2375/code is one of the process id of Safari browser running. But running this applescript gives me the error:  precodeSystem Events got an error: "" doesn’t understand the “do JavaScript” message. /code/pre  Looks like the tell command goes to System Events, rather than Safari.   Where I'm making the mistake?  h3Edit:/h3  With struggle, I came up with this solution:  precodeon run argv     set pid to item 1 of argv     set fileLocation to item 2 of argv     tell application "System Events"         set theprocs to every process whose unix id is pid         repeat with proc in theprocs             set the frontmost of proc to true         end repeat     end tell      tell application "System Events" to set frontApp to name of first process whose frontmost is true      if (frontApp = "Safari") then         using terms from application "Safari"             tell application frontApp to activate             set theScript to "document.querySelector(\"input[name='fileField']\").click()"             tell application frontApp to do JavaScript theScript in document 1         end using terms from          tell application "System Events" to tell process frontApp             keystroke "G" using {command down, shift down}             delay 2             key code 51             delay 2             keystroke fileLocation             delay 2             key code 52             delay 5             key code 52             delay 5         end tell          tell application "System Events"             set theprocs to every process whose unix id is pid             repeat with proc in theprocs                 set the frontmost of proc to false             end repeat         end tell      end if end run /code/pre  One problem I'm facing is the part:  precodeif (frontApp = "Safari") then             using terms from application "Safari"                 tell application frontApp to activate /code/pre  is opening the other Safari application, rather than the application whose codefrontmost/code is codetrue/code(I'm making the codefrontmost/code is codetrue/code for the given codepid/code in the first part of the script). Any idea, where I'm making the mistake?  <comment205119> First of all: what do you mean by "many Safari browsers running"? All in the same user account (not a good idea) or on different user accounts? Also: not completely sure why, but other things like `get URL from current tab` also don't work when addressing the process id rather than the name. Maybe this has to do with the multiprocess architecture of Safari (i.e. each tab gets its own process)? <comment205122> Asmus: All browsers are running in same user account <comment205123> That's really not a good idea. What's keeping you from using only one application instance and multiple tabs? What exactly are you trying to achieve here? <comment205124> No I want a script, which I want to do the file upload process. I need this to work, as Selenium automation with Safari doesnt support file uploads. And thats the sole reason for it. <comment205125> So you are simply looking for a way to do multiple file uploads (in Safari, with javascript)? Once again, why can't you do this in _one_ Safari.app with multiple windows or tabs? Why do you need multiple Safari´s (which is apparently problematic) for this? <comment205126> Asmus: Again, thats how Selenium opens the Safari. Each testcase in each browser, with a separate process. <comment205129> Asmus: Can you check now, I have edited my question with scripts.
