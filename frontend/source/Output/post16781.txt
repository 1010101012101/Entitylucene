How to control apache service on OS X (start/stop/restart/graceful restart)? <body> I have Apache installed on OS X and I want to know what command I can use to:  ul listart apache/li listop apache/li lirestart apache/li ligracefully restart apache/li /ul  Also I want to know if the commands were successful or not.  Apache seams to be installed as codeorg.apache.httpd/code or at least this is what codesudo launchctl list|grep apache/code shows.  <answer16782> I use the codeapachectl/code command  precodesudo apachectl stop sudo apachectl start sudo apachectl restart sudo apachectl -k graceful /code/pre  Hope this helps  <comment18333> Not sure why but `launchctl stop org.apache.httpd` doesn't do anything but `service stop org.apache.httpd` seems to work even if it does warn me that I should use launchctl instead. <comment18352> If your apache has launchd configuration files, then you would have to load and unload the `org.apache.httpd` to affect launchd control over the app. Are you using the built in apache or installing it yourself? <comment26223> This doesn't work on Lion. <comment80358> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8065288/how-to-remove-autostart-of-apache-on-macosx
