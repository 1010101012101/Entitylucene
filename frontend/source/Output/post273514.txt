Itunes use relative file paths for media files <body> I have my itunes library located on a NAS, the media files are in there own seperate shares(/Volumes/Music, /Volumes/Movies) while the itunes library is in its own share(/Volumes/Itunes)   I have a mac and a windows computer, using the mac I am able to point itunes at the music in /Volumes/Music but it links them through a absolute path so when I go to access my itunes library on a windows computer it cannot find the files since the path structures are not the same  Mac: code/Volumes/Music/AAA/AAA/AAA.mp3/code  Windows: codefile://localhost//HOME-MEDIA/Music/AAA/AAA/AAA.mp3/code  So I am wondering is there a way for itunes to link the files using a relative path from its location so it would look like code../Music/AAA/AAA/AAA.mp3/code  I am aware this is the way it works if my music was located in the Itunes Media folder however it is more preferable for me for it to be its own share  <comment343857> The short answer would be "Give up, give up now" ;) The paths are absolute & there's no way round that. See if either of these might help [though I've heard that breaking the ITL file no longer works as it did when i posted these - http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/157665/itunes-move-files-off-a-network-drive/157670#157670 & http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/163594/itunes-moving-itunes-files-self-managed/163601#163601 <comment343870> @Tetsujin answer section please. Lots of great details on when iTunes changed, why iTunes sharing or iTunes Match would solve this... <comment343872> @bmike - they're the bits I don't know, however;) as I've maintained my remote Library manually since... forever, though haven't resynced it in a year or so. I'll have to test it out again this week & see what's changed.
