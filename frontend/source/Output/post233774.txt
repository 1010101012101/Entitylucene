How to sort a list of files ordered alphabetically to a list ordered numerically? <body> I'm trying to split large .csv files into several smaller ones ordered numerically, i.e., "File.csv" into "file_1.csv, file_2.csv, file_3.csv...".   When I use the command: codesplit -l 100000 File.csv small_file/code I get a list of files named "small_fileaa.csv, small_fileab.csv..etc", that is, it adds letters to the end of the file name and orders them alphabetically instead of adding numbers. How can I change the list generated to a list ordered numerically?   <comment285689> If you have MacPorts or Home brew, you can install coreutils (`sudo port intall coreutils` or `brew install coreutils`) which includes gsplit that has the option you are looking for. This it's just `gsplit -l 100000 -d File.csv small_file` and you're golden!
