Partition failed <body> Trying to shrink my default full disk partition to create some free space (for Ubuntu, incidentally, which I'm longing for even more now).  prePartition failed Partition failed with the error:  Couldn't modify partition map because file system verification failed/pre  I've tried the advice here: http://osxdaily.com/2012/03/05/fix-partition-failed-error-mac/  Including booting to single user mode to run /sbin/fsck -fy and booting from the recovery partition to run disk utility to repair the disk and try partitioning there.  Verify disk seems to think everything's ok but I'm still at a loss as to how I can shrink the partition to create some free space.  <answer127932> Try booting from a USB drive and running Disk Utility from there on your drive, using this method in Disk Utility. You can just slide to resize the partition.      img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HDxN6.gif" alt="You can drag and drop"
