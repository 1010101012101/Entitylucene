VMware: Shared folders on mac not updated on the virtual machine <body> I'm using vmware on mac to emulate Ubuntu.  When I change shared folders files on OSX I don't see the changes (automatically updated) in Ubuntu...  When I added the folder, everything was visible and it perfectly worked, but when I edited some files, these become red in the Ubuntu terminal, and I cannot see the new versions of them (even if I restart Ubuntu, I guess the only way is to remove and add the shared folder again).  Any help ?  <answer3718> I've solved. The problem was that I was using symbolic links applied to the files instead of the parent folder.  <comment3473> WHat version of VMware Fusion? You did make sure the VMware tools are installed and up to date, correct?
