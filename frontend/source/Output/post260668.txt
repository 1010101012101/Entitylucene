Intel HD 4000 graphics device drivers missing in Windows 10 Bootcamp on Macbook Pro Mid 2012 <body> I have a Macbook Pro Mid 2012 with no Retina (MacBookPro9,1). Below are the basic specs:   ul lii7-3720QM 2.6GHz/li liGeForce GT 650M/li li8GB RAM/li li15inch display/li /ul  I installed Windows 10 using the regular legacy BIOS MBR method (not UEFI method). After installing Windows 10, I installed the latest Bootcamp v6 drivers and support software.   I am having an issue with the getting integrated Intel graphics to work. Intel HD 4000 integrated graphic device and drivers are NOT being loaded or visible in Device Manager. Only the discrete GeForce GT 650M is loaded and visible in the Device Manager.   I went to the Device Manager and noticed that Intel HD 4000 is not showing up under Display Adapters (see attached picture). I manually installed drivers for Intel HD 4000 and it showed up under Display Adapters but there is an error that says: emThis device is not working properly because Windows cannot load the drivers required for this device. (Code 31). Object name not found./em (See attached picture)  Would anyone have suggestions on how to fix my issues?
