How do I create a script to create/modify local admin accounts? <body> This question is almost exactly what I need for my project at work. We have approx. 400 Macs on our campus, and the problem is they were not all set up identically. There are at least 4 different admin username and password variations.  What I'd like to have is a script that will:  1) Check to see what the local admin account(s) is called. 2) If the account isn't named properly, create a new one with the proper name. 3) Set the proper password. (Preferably it'd be obfuscated in the script)  <answer112992> This is what I came up with:  It also uses http://magervalp.github.io/CreateUserPkg/  precode#!/bin/bash # This script will first check existing accounts for presence of USERNAME or admin    or administrator # If found, it will change the password to PASSWORD # If none are found, it will run the package create_USERNAME-1.0.pkg which creates an account with Full Name = Administrator, Account Name # (short name) USERNAME with the password.  function checkusername () {  local test1=$(dscl . -list /Users | grep -i USERNAME) local test2=$(dscl . -list /Users | grep -i admin) local test3=$(dscl . -list /Users | grep -i Administrator)  if [ "$test1" = “username” ]; then   echo the username username already exists   echo setting password   dscl . passwd /Users/username PASSWORD   exit  else    echo fi  if [ "$test1" = "Username" ]; then   echo the username Username already exists   echo setting password   dscl . passwd /Users/Username PASSWORD   exit  else   echo  fi  if [ "$test1" = “UserName” ]; then   echo the username UserName already exists   echo setting password   dscl . passwd /Users/UserName PASSWORD   exit else    echo fi  if [ "$test2" = "admin" ]; then   echo the username admin already exists   echo setting password   dscl . passwd /Users/admin PASSWORD   exit  else    echo fi  if [ "$test2" = "Admin" ]; then   echo the username Admin already exists   echo setting password   dscl . passwd /Users/Admin PASSWORD   exit  else    echo fi  if [ "$test3" = "Administrator" ]; then   echo the username Administrator already exists   echo setting password   dscl . passwd /Users/Administrator PASSWORD   exit  else    echo fi  if [ "$test3" = "administrator" ]; then   echo the username administrator already exists   echo setting password   dscl . passwd /Users/administrator PASSWORD   exit  else    echo fi   }  checkusername  /usr/sbin/installer -pkg 'create_USERNAME-1.0.pkg' -target /  /code/pre
