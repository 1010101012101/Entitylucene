OS X Startup Disk full, cannot login <body> File storage is full, got spinning wait cursor when trying to access files to delete them, rebooted and now I can not get past the user login.  I enter password but cannot login.  <answer205590> Deleting files in this circumstance is relatively easy but you will need to be at least a little conversant with Unix/Linux command line operations.  Boot your Mac holding down kbdCommand ⌘/kbd-kbdS/kbd, this will pop you into single-user mode. A black screen with white text scrolling by. Eventually you will get a prompt with some instructions on what to do directly above it. I don't remember exactly but the commands mount the filesystem so you can access it. Then enter this:  precodecd /Users/[USERNAME]/Movies /code/pre  Where [USERNAME] is your short username that appears on your home folder. Once in the movies folder you can proceed to delete movies. remember a couple of things.  ol liThe command line is Case Sensitive. So MySpecialMovie.mov is a different file than myspecialmovie.mov. At least at the command line level. (The Mac preserves case but in Finder operations is not case sensitive)/li liThe kbdTab/kbd key is your friend. Press kbdTab/kbd when typing a file name and it will autocomplete./li /ol  Start by listing the files in your ~/Movies folder like this:  precodels /code/pre  Or you could get a longer listing (which I prefer).  precodels -al /code/pre  That will give you a list of all the deletable files.   The second method will give you file size.   To remove one of the files:  precoderm MySpecialMovie.mov /code/pre  Now it is a matter of going through the ~/Movies folder using codels/code and coderm/code to view and remove un-needed files.  Note that pressing the emUp Arrow/em will scroll back in command history allowing you to easily review what you have done and/or repeat previous commands. emDown Arrow/em scrolls forward in command history.  One you are done you can issue the reboot (restart?) command and allow your Mac to boot normally.  <comment247678> Have you gone into Recovery HD and verify/repair disk? <comment247679> Could you explain the goal? The system cannot work when the drive is full. Do you want instructions to wipe it and restore from a backup? Or to boot and delete some apps and files you know you can download again? When is the last full backup and do you trust it? <comment247680> Also. Welcome to Ask Different. In addition to the help screens you read before posting, see [ask] on how to meet our question quality standards. <comment247685> Yes and all verify checks are ok <comment247686> Boot and delete some files would be best.  I believe movies are my best option to delete. <comment247690> Please let me know how to delete files from terminal mode since I can not get past the user login due to startup disk being full.  Thx <comment247921> Hmm, I have found that my command like is case-insensitive though…
