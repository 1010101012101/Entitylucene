Is it possible to enable mouse right click via Terminal? <body> Is it possible to enable mouse right click via Terminal?  <answer118589> Try codedefaults write com.apple.driver.AppleBluetoothMultitouch.mouse MouseButtonMode TwoButton/code  To undo: codedefaults write com.apple.driver.AppleBluetoothMultitouch.mouse MouseButtonMode OneButton/code  <answer118627> You can enable it with BetterTouchTool.  <answer118727> If others search for how to perform a right click from a shell script, you can use MouseTools:  precodeMouseTools -x 1000 -y 500;MouseTools -rightClick /code/pre  <answer173505> Depends on mouse you are using too I believe, why not something like this if its the regular Apple mouse?  precodedefaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.driver.AppleHIDMouse.plist Button2 -int 2 /code/pre  Or  precodedefaults write /Users/username/Library/Preferences/com.apple.driver.AppleHIDMouse.plist Button2 -int 2 /code/pre  <comment138342> Wouldn't that kinda suck? You'd only be able to right click in the top right corner of the screen. <comment138346> I mean enable right-click on mouse through Terminal. I used the word "corner" incorrectly. Sorry. <comment138360> No need to undo this beautiful thing :P <comment138378> Could you elaborate on your answer. Provide a step-by-step solution or a link to a resource that explains your answer better. This will also help to prevent users from marking your answer down. <comment138404> I know this tool. The problem I had was to enable it through command line so that I could put this into an executable bash file to use it in more than one machine easily. <comment138500> This isn't what OP asked. From my understanding, he wan't a command line solution to activating the right click functionality on Mcs <comment363498> I think I love you.
