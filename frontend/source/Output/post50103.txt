How can I disable gestures on a particular workspace? <body> Is it possible to disable trackpad gestures I don't want to trigger on a particular workspace?  I have virtualbox fullscreen on one of my workspaces and I'd like for mouse gestures to not trigger when I am on that workspace.  <answer50104> h3This is not a feature provided by OS X./h3  You have to disable unwanted gestures in strongSystem Preferences &#x2192; Trackpad/strong and then use a third-party tool to enable customized gestures.  E.g. You can use strongBetterTouchTool/strong to define gestures on a emper-app/em basis. This will allow to simply not set set any gestures for virtualbox.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/XuxJ5.jpg" alt="enter image description here"
