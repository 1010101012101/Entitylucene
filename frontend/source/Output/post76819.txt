Can't burn podcast sounds to disk <body> I am trying to burn some sounds and a recording of my voice to a disk using GarageBand. It is set on podcast.  When I click burn to disk, it looks like is working, but then it says it can't burn to SuperDrive.  Any Ideas?  <comment89156> Can you burn a disk in Finder? Can you export your recording as audio files from GarageBand and then use iTunes to create an Audio CD? <comment89316> It's not clear yet whether the problem only occurs when trying to burn from GarageBand or it affects all CD's you computer tries to burn regardless of the application. <comment89322> after doing some tests, it's just a permissions issue. It doesnt work on my user but it does on another user.
