Bootcamp: 'No Bootable Device error' after resizing partition El Capitan <body> I have a Macbook Pro (Retina 15 inch end 2013) with OS X El Capitan 10.11.1. I have Bootcamp on it to run Windows 7, always using it without any problem. I wanted more space on the Bootcamp partition so I decided to resize the Macintosh HD partition to make some more space (+10 GB) for the Bootcamp partition.   When I made the Macintosh HD partition 10 GB bigger I've tried to reboot into Windows with Bootcamp but unfortunately the error 'No bootable device, press any key' appears.   I can still see Windows bootcamp in the startup disk of system preferences, but just can't boot into Windows anymore.  Here are some messages I've got by Terminal;  precodeMBP-van-Daniel:~ daniel$ diskutil list /dev/disk0 (internal, physical):    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *500.3 GB   disk0    1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1    2:                  Apple_HFS Macintosh HD            418.4 GB   disk0s2    3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s3    4:       Microsoft Basic Data BOOTCAMP                81.0 GB    disk0s4 /code/pre  And some more  precodeMBP-van-Daniel:~ daniel$ sudo gdisk -l /dev/disk0 GPT fdisk (gdisk) version 1.0.1  Warning: Devices opened with shared lock will not have their partition table automatically reloaded!

I think I have to restore the MBR using fdisk but how do I do that? I'm not very familiar with terminal  <answer222044> Sorry about my English. I mean I've made the Macintosh HD partition 10 GB smaller so I later could make in Windows the Bootcamp partition bigger. When I made the Macintosh partition smaller, Disk Utility made a new unnamed partition of that 10 GB. This means there were a total of 5 partitions. In Terminal the BOOTCAMP partition was situated on number 5 and the unnamed new empty partition on number 4. I think the problem is that the system only can boot the first 4 partitions. I've deleted the new empty partition again and set the Macintosh HD at its original size, so BOOTCAMP is now again on #4;  precodeMBP-van-Daniel:~ daniel$ sudo diskutil list Password: /dev/disk0 (internal, physical):    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *500.3 GB   disk0    1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1    2:                  Apple_HFS Macintosh HD            418.4 GB   disk0s2    3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s3    4:       Microsoft Basic Data BOOTCAMP                81.0 GB    disk0s4 /dev/disk1 (external, physical):    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:     FDisk_partition_scheme                        *1.0 TB     disk1    1:               Windows_NTFS My Passport             1.0 TB     disk1s1 /dev/disk2 (disk image):    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:     Apple_partition_scheme                        +10.5 MB    disk2    1:        Apple_partition_map                         32.3 KB    disk2s1    2:                  Apple_HFS Remote Desktop Conne... 10.3 MB    disk2s2 /code/pre  In my first post I had deleted the 10 GB empty partition already. I've installed Refind and after using the reinit and write command I'm now able to choose every time I start up my macbook, several options to boot like Macintosh, Windows and other devices. Now I can boot again into Windows. The only problem is that if I make Macintosh HD partition smaller, a new partition is created that comes at #4 so that BOOTCAMP moves to #5.
