Empty space on Macintosh HD drive <body> Below is a screenshot for Macintosh HD drive storage.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ldYAQ.png" alt="enter image description here"  It shows that I have 82.47 GB storage for "Other". How to delete and free up this space?  I checked code~/Downloads and ~/Desktop/code, both are less than 2 GB.  I also emptied out code~/Library/Cache/code and code~/Library/Cache/code folders.  I am running OS X 10.11.2.  <answer222816> I suggest you to use the DaisyDisk application (a free trial is also available).  This app help you to find out how you are using the space available and so you can identify what is occupying a large amount of space in your HD.
