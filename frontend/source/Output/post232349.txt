give read&write permission to only 1 file in folder <body> I am trying to manually modify preferences file located at   precode/Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/preferences.plist /code/pre  To modify it, I need to give it coderead&amp;write/code permission. I did that. The problem is that the file is in a folder, for which I cannot change permission (I am admin and I have no access), nor do I want to change permissions to the whole folder for security reasons. I only want to change it for preferences.plist file. How can I achieve this?   These are the pop-ups I get when trying to modify it.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ogRuk.png" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ObSMk.png" alt="enter image description here"  Upon modifying permissions to parent folder I get this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9NHIQ.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer232355> To allow emuser_name/em writing to empreferences.plist/em add an ACL with:  precodesudo chmod +a "user_name allow write" /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/preferences.plist /code/pre  This changes the output of:  precodels -laeO /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/preferences.plist -rw-r--r--  1 root  wheel  - 59715  9 Feb 23:25 /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/preferences.plist /code/pre  to:  precodels -laeO /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/preferences.plist -rw-r--r--+ 1 root  wheel  - 59715  9 Feb 23:25 /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/preferences.plist 0: user:user_name allow write /code/pre  but doesn't change the permissions of the superior folder or other files residing in the same folder:  precodedrwxr-xr-x  15 root      admin        -             510 24 MÃ¤r 17:23 SystemConfiguration /code/pre  To remove the ACL later simply enter:  precodesudo chmod -a "user_name allow write" /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/preferences.plist /code/pre  <comment283893> It's probably SIP - see http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/208478/how-do-i-disable-system-integrity-protection-sip-aka-rootless-on-os-x-10-11 <comment283895> hmm, I just want to lower the walls for 1 file. Strange that Apple forces disabling for every file.. <comment283910> I ended up disabling SIP and giving the right permission to parent folder, but this seem like a nice answer.
