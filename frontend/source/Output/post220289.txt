Can't reformat SD card (Yosemite) <body> I have a 2 GB SD card that I can't reformat. It seems pretty corrupted.   If I go into Disk Utility, I get these various error messages for each option:  ul liRepair Disk:     Disk Utility can’t repair this disk. /li liErase (with Format "MS-DOS (FAT)"):     Volume Erase failed with the error: Couldn’t modify partition map. /li liSet number of partitions to 1 and Apply:     Partition failed with the error: Couldn’t open device. /li /ul  According to Finder, I have permission to both read and write, and almost 100% of the space is available. However, if I try to copy any files on, I get an error message claiming there is not enough free space.  Any advice on how to fix this disk?  <answer220290> Does it have a lock switch on the side? If the card is not corrupted, it could help to slide the lock switch several times.  <answer220291> If you feel comfortable with the terminal you can try using diskutil commands. (Make sure you have a current backup of your main hard drive and dismount all other drives, then insert the SD card.)  Read the man page for diskutil first.  Then make sure you are strongabsolutely/strong positive which disk is the SD card before you execute any command that could erase your hard drive if you are wrong.

Hope this helps...  <answer267716> I had the same exact problem.  Format your card using this application: https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/formatter_4/index.html  Worked perfect for me.  Cheers.  <answer282663> I had the same issue on an iMac, Michelle mentioned using an external SD reader solved her problem so I figured it didn't make sense for it to be an OSX related problem. tried the tape, tinfoil and mid-position tricks to no avail. Some people go so far as to say there's a "light beam" inside the slot that reads the lock slider in the cards.   It came down to either buying a USB SD reader or opening the iMac to extract and service the reader part itself. Then I used a led light to see inside the slot itself and it was all in fact just pins. a pin is pushed when the card slider is in “lock” position preventing the OS from writing. I used tweezers to scrub inside the lock recess in the iMac slot, plugged the SD afterwards and it worked, it's writable again. might have been jammed with dirt and dust.  <comment266602> I tried this -- it unfortunately did not help. Thank you though. <comment266603> Thanks! I will try this as soon as I'm able to back up my main hd. <comment266605> and after this you're going to trust any data to it, even if you can persuade it to format? Throw it away! <comment280180> Those slides without markings are evil.
