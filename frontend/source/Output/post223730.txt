How to download Firefox via command line FTP <body> I am attempting to install Firefox on my Mac, which currently does not have a browser. From a bash terminal I have codeftp/code installed and am currently connected to the internet. However, I have been unsuccessful in connecting to their FTP server.  How do I go about installing Firefox for my Mac via the command line?  <answer223734> ftp access to ftp.mozilla.org was turned off (see this, thanks Dav√Ød). However, you can use codecurl/code from the command line:  precodecurl 'https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/firefox/releases/43.0.4/mac/en-US/Firefox%2043.0.4.dmg' &gt;~/Desktop/'Firefox 43.0.4.dmg' /code/pre  That gets the latest (as of this writing) US English release for Mac OS X of Firefox.  You can get a directory listing thusly:  precodecurl 'https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/firefox/releases/43.0.4/mac/' /code/pre  That outputs HTML, but it's pretty simple HTML, so it shouldn't be a problem reading it to get a different language. You can also chop additional elements off the path, for example if you want a different version:  precodecurl 'https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/firefox/releases/' /code/pre  <answer223746> You can skip the download step, and mount it directly over the internet like so:  precodehdiutil attach https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/firefox/releases/43.0.4/mac/en-US/Firefox\ 43.0.4.dmg /code/pre  Saves a step, time, and storage space!  <comment271254> Can your client use `http` protocol? See this [Mozilla support issue](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1078139). <comment271266> The Safari browser is a default part of the OS X, did you delete it and if so, curious as to why? <comment271277> That's pretty neat! :) +1 <comment271278> It's one of those hidden gems that Apple sneaks in. I tried attaching directly over the internet like that many years back to see if it would work, and it actually did. Definitely a neat trick. ;) Of course, I realized afterwards that it's mentioned in the man page. Heh. <comment271279> I was installing it for a friend.  Their OS X had safari installed but on the launcher it showed a cancel sign over it, and when attempting to launch it an error would occur in regards to the version of OS X.  I thought it may be necessary to update the computer's operating system to the newest version in order to get safari to work, so in the mean time I just installed firefox to give basic browsing functionality via firefox <comment271294> You may be able to launch Safari anyway by starting the binary from a shell. Inside the app there is contents/MacOS/Safari which when started from a shell (e.g. bash) often bypasses restrictions launchservices might impose (such as rules from info.plist). If the app is broken that won't work of course. <comment271341> You're mounting it over HTTP, which is pretty insecure. Does the command support HTTPS ? <comment271342> Fair point. Fixed! Yes, it does support HTTPS. <comment271535> I'll give it a try next time I have the computer in front of me, I'm familiar with launching binaries in linux so I imagine it is very similar. However, it is likely the app could be broken.
