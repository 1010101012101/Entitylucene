How to remove mails from mail app and maintain google calendar synchronized with Apple Reminders? <body> I've got a gmail account and I use the browser to read, write and manage my gmail account.  I wrongly opened Apple mail and it started synchronizing with gmail.  I would like to maintain google calendar synchronized with Apple Reminders, but I would like to free the space on HD used by Apple mail.  Is it possible?  <answer208639> Try system preferences - Internet accounts - uncheck mail from google account  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/eoaQt.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment252151> Thanks Bart, do you think that this solution will clean disk space? <comment252231> It will stop safari from downloading any more of your emails, but I am not sure if it deletes emails that have already been downloaded. You can check how big your mail folder is by going to finder - holding alt/option, clicking on "Go" tab and open "Library" - scroll down and look for "Mail" - you can right click and get info to see how big the folder is. I found this link about deleting files from mail folder, but maybe do a bit of research just to be safe [link](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/24625/is-it-safe-to-remove-library-mail-folders) .
