Keyboard shortcut for current window position <body> I am looking for the keyboard shortcut to place the current window in half of the screen, either to the left or right. This functionality is performed in windows by typing the windows button plus left or right.  How is this done on Mac OSX?  <answer77472> As far as I know, this is not built into Mac OS X. But there are many third-party utilities such as Moom which can do it.  <answer77474> I use Divvy to perform keyboard manipulation of window size. There is a free demo so you can try before you buy.  <answer77543> I would also add BetterTouchTool to those presented already - it gives you window snapping plus the ability to add all sorts of custom gestures and shortcuts to your environment  <answer77555> Slate is an extremely customizable keyboard window management tool. It can take a while to get setup (although there are some example configs) but it's totally worth it.  strongEdit:/strong  Slate has seemly abandoned at this point. I have switched to Phoenix which is very similar and more actively developed.  <answer131774> If you want to build your own keyboard shortcut here is how you do it:  ol liOpen Automator (Applications  Automator)/li liMake a new Service/li liIn the search pane on the right search for "Applescript"/li liDrag "Run Applescript" into the right Pane/li liIn the Text Box that is presented enter the following code:  precodeon run     set theApp to ((path to frontmost application) as text)     tell application theApp         activate         set the bounds of the first window to {0, 0, 1280, 800}     end tell end run /code/pre/li liAt the top of the right pane make it so that the service receives no input/li liSave the service as "Maximise Window"/li liDuplicate the Service (Command + Shift + S)/li liChange the code{0, 0, 1280, 800}/code to code{0, 0, 640, 800}/code/li liSave the service as "Move Window Left"/li liDuplicate the Service (Command + Shift + S)/li liChange the code{0, 0, 640, 800}/code to code{640, 0, 1280, 800}/code/li liSave the service as "Move Window Right"/li liGo to System Preferences (Applications  System Preferences) and select "Keyboard" then "Shortcuts"/li liScroll down in the list to "General"/li liYou services should be saved there.
