Display a notification with AppleScript <body> I would like to trigger a notification with AppleScript.  I have seen How can I trigger a Notification Center notification from an AppleScript or shell script? but I would like to have a emnative/em AppleScript solution if it exists.  <answer67235> Growl has an AppleScript dictionary. I didn't find any way to show a single notification in Notification Center, but they are shown in it by default you've enabled forwarding all notifications.  precodetell application id "com.Growl.GrowlHelperApp"     register as application "Scripts" all notifications "test" default notifications "test"     notify with name "test" title "title" description "description" application name "Scripts" end tell /code/pre  <answer67239> See this article on OS X Hints  <comment79254> While this link may answer the question, it is better to include the essential parts of the answer here and provide the link for reference.  Link-only answers can become invalid if the linked page changes. <comment79319> While that is true, this entire answer becomes invalid if the Automator workflow being offered is discontinued, so either way it's up in the air. <comment79332> Nevertheless add as much as possible. Link-only answers run the risk of getting deleted. <comment79333> You should quote the relevant portions of the hint in the answer itself. <comment79405> The solution is not a native Apple Script solution. It simply executes a shell script <comment79481> Actually, it utilizes a workflow in Automator. You asked for an AppleScript option. I have not been able to locate an AppleScript native solution. Therefore, I provided this one as a fallback until a native solution has been found.
