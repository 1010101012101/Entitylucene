Like thisï»¿img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/IqNh4.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer243798> You can't control what app appears in the bottom-left corner of the lock screen.  Neither can you add code to your app to make your app appear there whenever you want.  These are called emSuggested Apps/em and it's a feature of iOS.  iOS controls what app appears there based on several factors, including your location, the apps on your device, and your history of where &amp; when you use those apps.  Together, iOS emtrys/em to present you with the app you would most-likely use at a given time, location, and history.  If you don't like this feature, it can be turned off in codeSettings -&gt; General -&gt; Handoff &amp; Suggested Apps/code.  <comment300328> ....Very Thanks for your Answer <comment300348> If that answer helped you, please be sure to [accept](http://apple.stackexchange.com/help/someone-answers) it.
