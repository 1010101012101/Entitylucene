Why doesn't /proc exist in OS X? <body> What is the reason that code/proc/code does not exist in OS X? I was curious to find file descriptors that a process was using in my Mac. The way I do it in linux is to go in code/proc/fd/code folder of that process.  How do I find what codefd/codes are used by a process?  <answer119130> Going back to basics : Ubuntu is a GNU/Linux, OS X is a FreeBSD : Different systems, different way to work.   On OS X you can use codelsof/code to see the open files.   precode$lsof -p 68180 /code/pre  would show you every files opened by the process with pid 68180.   <comment233739> This post doesn't really answer the question. It states that the reson is FreeBSD, but FreeBSD does have [`/proc`](https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=procfs&sektion=5&apropos=0&manpath=FreeBSD%2010.1-RELEASE) <comment242390> it does not answer the question.   E.g. /proc/cpuinfo or /proc/meminfo - these have nothing to do with lsof. <comment344227> macOS isn't based off of FreeBSD, but rather a mixture of BSD and FreeBSD.
