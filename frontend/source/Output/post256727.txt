Every single 3rd party font gives me validation serious errors <body> I recently got El Capitan 10.11.6 installed on my MacBook. Now whenever I try to install ANY 3rd party font, they fail font validation in the Font Book app.  The error is always:  code1 serious error was found. Do not use this font./code  This occurs for ALL 3rd party fonts. Fonts I download from Adobe Typekit. Fonts I download from Google Fonts, etc. Every single one.  Some websites suggest that I go ahead and install the font anyways. I tried this and certain programs become unresponsive. For example Illutrator CC 2015.3 will not even start up (gets stuck at Initializing) but then once I remove the "bad" font, Illustrator works fine again.  What am I missing here? How do I fix this problem?  strongUPDATE/strong  As requested here is the Validation Error report from installing a font. The only thing I changed is the network path name for the font location (it was on a network drive).  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt; &lt;!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"&gt; &lt;plist version="1.0"&gt; &lt;array&gt;     &lt;dict&gt;         &lt;key&gt;file&lt;/key&gt;         &lt;string&gt;Nudista Medium.otf&lt;/string&gt;         &lt;key&gt;path&lt;/key&gt;         &lt;string&gt;/network/path/nudista/Nudista Medium.otf&lt;/string&gt;         &lt;key&gt;report&lt;/key&gt;         &lt;array&gt;             &lt;dict&gt;                 &lt;key&gt;fail&lt;/key&gt;                 &lt;integer&gt;1&lt;/integer&gt;                 &lt;key&gt;fontname&lt;/key&gt;                 &lt;string&gt;Nudista Medium.otf&lt;/string&gt;                 &lt;key&gt;pass&lt;/key&gt;                 &lt;integer&gt;0&lt;/integer&gt;                 &lt;key&gt;ruleslist&lt;/key&gt;                 &lt;array&gt;                     &lt;dict&gt;                         &lt;key&gt;author&lt;/key&gt;                         &lt;string&gt;com.apple.ATS&lt;/string&gt;                         &lt;key&gt;kATSFontTestDescriptionKey&lt;/key&gt;                         &lt;string&gt;This font has failed one or more of a series of tests of the font interacting with OSÂ X.

If you get persistent errors let us know what they are and/or try another disk repair utility (Diskwarrior, etc.)/li liRun a cleaning utility, like Onyx and let it clean everything on the computer (Automation tab) and reboot. This may clean up damaged caches./li liDownload the El Capitan Combo Updater Quit out of all Apps and run it. This may fix damaged parts of the OS./li /ol  It strongIS/strong unlikely that all fonts you download are damaged, those three steps should help eliminate some of the more obvious possibilities.  <answer267396> I've been having the same problem. What has worked for me has been to install an app called Typelight. I go into Typelight, open the font that I downloaded to my computer but didn't install yet, and then save the font to my DESKTOP. It doesn't work if I save it anywhere else, don't ask me why. After that, I open the font by clicking on it on my desktop, then I click "install", and it works with no error messages. More of a hassle, yes, but at least it's a way around the problem.  <answer283111> Could you try to do the following:  ul liOpen the font/li liInstall it/li liWait for the validation error message/li liMenu: "File"  "Save Report..."/li liUpload the report here, I'll check it for you ;) /li /ul  The report is in fact a simple ".plist" that can be opened in text mode or with Xcode.  emI just discovered this option not too long ago!/em  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6Q6Lr.png" alt="FontBook hidden &quot;Save Report&quot; menu"  <comment320288> Maybe change your GateKeeper settings to allow all... then see. Not sure what else could be the issue. <comment340756> This just started happening to me too. There are at least 10 threads over the last 5+ years on discussions.apple.com discussing this problem, with no solutions. <comment340780> I had the same issue as the original poster. For me, installing fonts from ~/Desktop (or a subdirectory thereof) was sufficient to get rid of the "serious error" warning. I also have no idea why the files need to reside inside ~/Desktop. I didn't need to use Typelight.
