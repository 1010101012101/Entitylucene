Is there an app/extension to have UTC appear in the Sierra Finder (10.12.2) menu? <body> Is there an app/extension to have UTC appear in the Sierra Finder (10.12.2) menu ?  I bought "UTC Bar" version 1.31 from the Apple Store, but clicking on "Open" doesn't appear anywhere in the "Date &amp; Time" preferences nor in the Finder Menu - No indication it was installed anywhere.  I prefer toggling UTC to be displayed in the menu rather than bring up the Dashboard each time.  thanks  <answer269977> Simply install BitBar and an additional plugin related to time (probably WorldClock direct download) which displays current UTC time in the menu bar, with various timezones in the drop-down menu:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GotqD.png" alt="enter image description here"  All apps/plugins are free.
