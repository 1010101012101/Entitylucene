Import multiple-pages from a PDF as separate slides in Keynote <body> I have a PDF with slides in it from someone else and I want to import all the separate pages of the PDF as separate slides in Keynote. The best answer I can find is this one on apple support, but it suggests splitting the PDF into separate 1-page files to drag them into Keynote individually and I'm sure there must be an easier way.  <answer95858> There’s a simple app called strongPDF to Keynote/strong that does just this. From the developer’s description:     PDF to Keynote converts PDF-based presentations (e.g., made using LaTeX and Prosper) into Apple's Keynote format.   I use it all the time for handling Beamer presentations, and it’s great. Free to download.  PS: This app does not suport current (November 2014) Keynote 6.5 file format.  <answer95862> After experimenting a bit I found a pretty good way to do this - not fully automated but fairly simple and does the job. If you open the PDF in preview and enable the thumbnail mode, you can drag the individual page thumbnails across to Keynote slide panel and it will add that page as a slide.  <answer141202> Using codeAutomator.app/code, you can create a task that will generate pictures from pdf files (you can even do it with multiple files), just search for codeRender PDF Pages to Images/code action in automator. Once you run the action, you drag-n-drop generated pictures on the slides panel in codeKeyNote/code and you're done.  See here for detailed instructions  <answer141572> I tried the methods suggested in the other answers and was not successful.  I have Acrobat Pro so I just saved the PDF as JPEG, then put a JPEG onto each page of the Keynote presentation.  I'm sure there are better ways, but this worked easily for me.  <answer143928> I used below converter, works good...  https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pdf-converter-free/id422540367?mt=12&amp;ign-mpt=uo%3D4  It's not mentioned specifically in the description of the app, but the comments in the reviews indicate it will convert a PDF to a Keynote presentation, not just a PowerPoint presentation.  <answer222568> It's very simple: open the PDF in Preview, make sure the thumbnails sidebar is visible. All the pages of the PDF will be shown on the left side of the window. Simply move Preview a little out of the way so you can see you Keynote presentation behind, highlight the page you want from the PDF thumbnails, drag and drop. Repeat this for all individual pages you require. I use this simple method to create a clickable document inside a single keynote slide.  <comment132862> Great app, thanks. <comment166854> What part of the other methods did not work for you? If you could comment on the answer containing the method the user could clarify the process such that it works for you as well. <comment291634> It works though it seems to to at first sight.
