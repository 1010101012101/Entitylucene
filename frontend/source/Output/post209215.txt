In El Capitan: Safari wiped the extension database? <body> I recently did a clean install of El Capitan &amp; added Tampermonkey to my Safari. I added a few scripts in the morning and went to sleep. I woke up at night and got back to my Safari only to learn that all the scripts in Tampermonkey had disappeared into the ether.  When I re-added a script, this is what Tampermonkey told me:     Tampermonkey detected inconsistencies that indicate that your browser wiped the extension database!   Is there a way to prevent this from happening again?  <answer214990> I use OS X 10.9.5 (Mavericks) and I was preparing to ask:   ul liWhere, on disk, does Tampermonkey for Safari store user data e.g. scripts?/li /ul  Your question seems to answer my question!  (I had used fseventer to monitor file system activity whilst installing a script, but nothing conclusive was observed.)  In my case I assume that Tampermonkey dataloss resulted from an uninstall, followed by a reinstall, of various extensions.   h3Background/h3  Two sets of answers to frequently asked questions:   ul lihttp://tampermonkey.net/faq.php/li lihttps://forum.tampermonkey.net/viewtopic.php?f=16&amp;t=78/li /ul  The Tampermonkey forum is limited, seeking emSafari/em finds nothing:      The following words in your search query were ignored because they are too common words: safari â€¦   http://tampermonkey.net/faq.php#Q106 explains how to export scripts, but I never imagined that losing (or removing) the database of emextensions/em would also lose emuser data/em associated with any extension.
