Max Memory for Macbook Pro <body> I'm planning on buying a new Macbook this fall. I fail to order more than 16GB RAM for any mobile device, but I remember that previously, with smaller memory limits, some machines would inofficially also with more than just the 8GB.   Is there any way to make any of the current/new devices work with more than 16GB memory? Are there rumors of a new Macbook specification that will allow for more RAM?  emI know that this question has been asked previously , but I figure this is not a duplicate, as the boundary of technology and hardware is moving rapidly.*/em  <answer138984> Since retina Macbook Pro have their memory soldered to the mainboard I won't be possible to have more memory than sold by Apple.   About the last non retina MacBook Pro (mid-2012). It's 16GB   <comment163948> Are you talking about a non retina Macbook Pro ? <comment163949> Anything is okay.
