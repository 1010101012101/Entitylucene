iPad mini - same in Australia as UK? <body> I wonder if someone can shed some light on this.  I live in the UK but am travelling to Austalia for Christmas.  If I buy a cellular iPad mini in Australia, will that work when I bring it back to the UK?    Obviously I will need to put a UK SIM card in there, but apart from that, will there be any issues?    Many thanks in advance Charlie  <answer74050> According the LTE page at Apple.com the model in UK and Australia should be compatible:  Model number:     iPad mit Retina Display (4. Generation) Modell A1460      iPad mini Modell A1455   LTE Band Support:     1 (2100 MHz)br   3 (1800 MHz)br   5 (850 MHz)br   13 (700c MHz)br   25 (1900 MHz)    For both UK and Australia. You should be fine buying the iPad down under :)  <comment86046> Many thanks for the quick response - great news!
