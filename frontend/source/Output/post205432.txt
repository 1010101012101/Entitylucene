My iPhone 4s cancels syncing when connected with laptop hp <body> When I connect my iPhone first of all the phone connects then disconnects  quickly after a while it seems to connect for a longer time and I have asked this question and was given that it might be power problems( iPhone is different from other USB connections) and told to download iTunes. The problem is after the phone connects to the computer iTunes starts then when I order to sync with my iPhone the phone disconnects then connects quickly, it does this whenever I order a sync with iTunes, and is really irritating. When I order it to sync with iTools it works but does this for a short time after a while it un syncs then syncs quickly. I tried it with a laptop of my friend and it seems to work, so the connecter iPhone and iTunes software seems to work perfectly the problem must come from the laptop, what seems to be the problem?  <comment247709> Sounds like the USB can't supply enough power. Try it through a powered hub. <comment253731> @Tetsujin it still does not work, I also tried it with Galaxy note the same thing happened,is there any way to fix it, has anyone had this problem? <comment253742> Might be a hardware issue with the USB port itself;  not sure what to suggest except to get a professional to have a look at it.
