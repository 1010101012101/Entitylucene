Can MacFusion be used under Mountain Lion? <body> I have bought a new MacBook Pro with Retina display which has OS X 10.8.3. I have installed MacFusion from the version on their website, but I cannot mount it, getting this error: codeCould not mount filesystem: Mount process has terminated unexpectedly./code  Can you help me with that?  <answer93395> Unfortunately Macfusion no longer works, it hasn't been maintained in a long time. Newer versions were around for a while but as near as I can tell, none of them work anymore either. Your best bet is a commercial product which can mount FTP or WebDAV disks such as Transmit. For mounting disks via SSH, I believe we're out of luck.  Such is progress.  <answer97741> Macfusion has been forked on GitHub by another developer and a pre-2.1 development build is available that operates under Mountain Lion with no issues yet that I've discovered; both SSHFS and FTPFS work with FUSE for OS X if the MacFUSE compatibility layer is installed.  If you're feeling adventurous, you can download the build or build it yourself from https://github.com/ElDeveloper/macfusion2.  Alternatively, the original Macfusion 2.0.4 can also be convinced to work again as a front end for SSH mounts and this works under ML, if you also install FUSE for OS X and SSHFS (also available from the same site), then modify it so that the codesshfs-static/code binary points to the one from SSHFS, by running the following commands in Terminal:  precodecd /Applications/Macfusion.app/Contents/PlugIns/sshfs.mfplugin/Contents/Resources mv sshfs-static sshfs-static.orig ln -s /usr/local/bin/sshfs sshfs-static /code/pre  However, it's a bit finicky.  Mounting and unmounting SSHFS filesystems works fine, but attempting to remove a filesystem from the Macfusion list will fail.  I am unaware of a way to re-enable FTPFS functionality in Macfusion 2.0.4.

I had tried macfusion2 which was failing.   WingFS worked the first time, and so I can GBTW. It's at http://wingfs.com for those that are interested. It doesn't seem to have every feature but it got the job done, with a UI that worked!  <comment109576> A known issue: https://github.com/mgorbach/macfusion2/issues/36 <comment109593> Transmit can mount disks over SSH. <comment122456> That is perfect! working like a charm :)
