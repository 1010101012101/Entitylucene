How to setup Indian rupee format in Numbers? <body> Indian rupee number format is different from US number format.  e.g. 1,00,00,00,000 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_rupee  How do I setup a custom number format in Numbers?  <answer43244> You didn't mention which version of Numbers you were using.  Here are general directions to create a custom cell format in both Numbers '08 (1.0) and Numbers '09 (2.0).  In Numbers '09, once in the emCustom Number Format/em dialog, drag a few integer elements into the format box.  Pull the menu down for each, and choose emHide separator/em.  On the appropriate groups, change the number of digits to two.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uRfax.png" alt="Screenshot of Custom Number Format dialog"  If you're not mixing with USD and prefer India's conventions, a much simpler approach is in the emLanguage &amp; Text/em panel of emSystem Preferences/em.  Choose emIndia/em from the emRegion/em menu, and any cells set to emCurrency/em format will not only have the correct symbol, but the correct groupings.  Of course, then if you want USD formatted correctly, you'd need a custom format for that - so use whichever region is most appropriate to the bulk of your content.  <comment49155> Great, is there a way to not suppress unwanted commas for smaller number. e.g. I am seeing ,,,15,000 for 15,000
