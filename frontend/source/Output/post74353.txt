How to launch pdf viewer from the terminal <body> I'm working using LaTeX, since I compile the document in the terminal, it would be much easier for me to open it in pdf viewer directly from the terminal.  I'm using OS X 10.8.2 in Polish, so I'm not sure of the English name of the viewer I'm using, but it's the default one, I guess it's codePreview/code in English. But the command codepreview &lt;filename.pdf&gt;/code results in code-bash: preview: command not found/code.  <answer74361> You can just use codeopen &lt;filename.pdf&gt;/code and your OS will use the default program to view PDFs. With codeopen -a Preview.app &lt;filename.pdf&gt;/code your PDF is opened using Preview, even if your default PDF reader is something different.
