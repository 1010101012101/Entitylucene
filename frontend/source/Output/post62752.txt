How can I sync my new iPad on Ubuntu? <body> I use Ubuntu 12.04 and I would like to add some songs and videos.  <answer62764> Check this thread out https://askubuntu.com/questions/994/can-i-sync-with-my-iphone-4-and-ipad  otherwise you might ask directly on askubuntu.  You can log in on askubuntu using your stackexchange credentials  <comment72449> This should be on the Ubuntu stack exchange IMO. <comment72471> thanks, I asked the question on askubuntu (I can sync music but I do not see them on my iPad)
