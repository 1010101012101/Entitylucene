Make SCSI Appear as Internal Hard Drive <body> I have the HighPoint RocketRAID 2720SGL Raid card running on my Mac and it shows as an external drive. I would like to make it appear as an internal drive.  Is this possible?  From:   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/CUFqs.png" alt="SCSI External Raid"  To:   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/n1fL4.png" alt="Internal Drive"  Here is the ouput from my System Profile: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0hZMs.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer110221> Do you have the following files?  ul li/System/Libraries/Extensions/HighPointIOP.kext/li li/System/Libraries/Extensions/HighPointRR.kext/li /ul  If so, copy both of them to your desktop, then:  ul liOpen those kexts and edit the Info.plist. Change all the 'External' references to 'Internal'/li liCopy the modified kexts back to '/System/Libraries/Extensions/'  from your desktop./li /ul  Reinstall the kexts:  ul lisudo chmod -R 755 /System/Libraries/Extensions/HighPointIOP.kext/li lisudo chmod -R 755 /System/Libraries/Extensions/HighPointRR.kext/li lisudo chown -R root:wheel /System/Libraries/Extensions/HighPointIOP.kext/li lisudo chown -R root:wheel /System/Libraries/Extensions/HighPointRR.kext/li lisudo rm -rf /System/Library/Extensions.mkext/li /ul  After this:  ul ligo to your Disk Utility App and Repair your filesystem permissions./li liReboot./li /ul  <answer112555> I've got a Drobo 5D connected to my iMac via Thunderbolt. I'm running 10.7.5 I'd like to have the Drobo load as an internal to bypass silly cloud storage restrictions with my current provider.  I looked at the HighPointIOP.kext and HighPointRR.kext files and didn't see any references to External or Internal. I should note that they were located in /System/Library/Extensions as opposed to /System/Libraries. Am I accessing the wrong files?  <comment126756> Do you just want to change the icon or is there a technical consequence I'm not aware of ? <comment126795> There is an eject button next to it on the side panel, and it's really not an external. <comment129667> I would like it to be recognized as an internal drive. Appear in the side panel the same as the others. By that virtue, no eject button. <comment129705> In what way does the drive not work as external? <comment129749> It "works" but it is not on external drive, its Internal. I'd like it to appear as internal. <comment129991> Boom: https://www.dropbox.com/s/kl7poeufqe5pj1j/Screenshot%202013-11-11%2022.43.22.png Has anyone told you you're the man lately? Well, you are! <comment129993> The kexts were located at /Libraries/Extensions on my Mac. Running OS X Mavericks 10.9 <comment130127> To be sure, replace `Libraries` with `Library`. <comment132177> Hi - and welcome to Ask Different.
