How can I remove the window shadow in Mountain Lion? <body> There's an application called ShadowKiller that seems popular and supposedly works for Lion, but it just seems to die as soon as I try to start it on Mountain Lion.  I'd like to get around of the shadows surrounding a window.  <answer61929> ShadowKiller still works for me on 10.8, but it's supposed to quit silently after it's opened. You can run it at login by adding it to login items.  Nocturne also has an option to disable the shadows.

Then I discovered something much simpler:  precodedefaults write NSGlobalDomain NSUseLeopardWindowValues NO defaults write com.apple.Safari NSUseLeopardWindowValues YES /code/pre  The second one is necessary because Safari doesn't seem to like the shadows (you get a "Invalid unbuffered shadow parameters." comment in syslog).  <answer104463> The program I use to do this on OS X 10.8.4 is ShadowSweeper.  http://download.cnet.com/ShadowSweeper/3000-2072_4-75966596.html  This one looks like it might also work but I haven't tried it myself.  https://github.com/puffnfresh/toggle-osx-shadows  <answer142979> This one works well for me: toggle-osx-shadows.  It is easy to compile and use, and there are only 17 lines of code.  <comment71520> Ah I see. I tried Nocturne but it seems like the disable shadows option doesn't do anything either. <comment71521> It's only available when the night mode is enabled. <comment105609> I ran those commands in a terminal window. Nothing happened. Where are they supposed to be modified?. Sorry newbie to Mac. <comment109410> so_mv: log out & in; the only thing I notice these commands changing is removing shading on the window title bar... shadows are still cast onto underlying windows <comment122939> Thanks for the answers on this. Be sure to read the promotion section of [help] if you recommend the same software several times. <comment169936> If you don't have XCode, and don't mind downloading from people's Dropbox's, here's the util, which I just compiled on my Mac ;-) I didn't do anything to it, and it worked great for me... But if you're not adventurous, download it from the git repo above and build it yourself!  https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/274922/toggle-osx-shadows  You'll have to `chmod 700 toggle-osx-shadows` to make it executable, of course! <comment210295> This thread should be extended to OSX Yosetime too, I think. <comment264131> Tested ok on Yosemite : Using brew : brew install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/puffnfresh/toggle-osx-shadows/master/homebrew/toggle-osx-shadows.rb
