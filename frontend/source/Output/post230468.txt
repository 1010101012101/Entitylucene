Copy OS X 10.4.11 Mac to Guest in VirtualBox on OS X 10.7.5 Host to Run PPC Applications? <body> A user (who may or may not be my mother) has an old MacBook Pro running OS X 10.4.11 that is falling apart. It overheats. The cells in battery expanded beyond the confines the battery casing. She really wants to make this computer work, because she loves using AppleWorks or ClarisWorks and some other old PowerPC applications. She also as an iMac running OS X 10.7.5.

I've found instructions how to start from a DVD. Will those instructions work for a hard disk image taken from a physical machine?/li /ol  Thanks!  <comment281347> Mac OS X 10.4 is not legally virtualizable nor is it supported as a Guest OS in any of the Hypervisors. <comment281359> Though VMWare makes a utility to virtualize a Windows or Linux computer they do not seem to have that utility that does the same for Mac O/S. Nor am I aware of anything that does what you ask. Assuming you can solve issue #1 you could install Mac OS on the VM and then use the Migration Utility across the network to transfer all her files and apps. But solving issue #1 is the real trick, one I don't have a solution for...
