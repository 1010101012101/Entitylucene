Are there no explicit Power modes in Mac? <body> Does Macbook Pro not provide power modes (Power Saver, High Performance, etc) like a Windows laptop? If there is nothing like that, then I'd assume that OS X manages optimal settings itself.  Or is there something which I'm missing?  <answer34666> There are no build-in power modes in Mac OS X. Still, the standard configuration in Mac OS X in combination with the high capacity batteries used in the MacBooks offers quite good battery life.  If you want to optimize your energy usage, you need to manually tweak settings.  Here's, what OS X offers to save power:  h3System Settings - Energy Saver/h3  ul lidim display when using battery/li lidisplay/computer sleep/li /ul  h3System Settings - Display/h3  ul liAutomatically adjust brightness/li /ul  h3System Settings - Security &amp; Privacy/h3  ul lidisable remote control infrared receiver/li /ul  h3Menubar/h3  ul liWifi Icon - disable Wifi/li liBluetooth icon - disable Bluetooth/li /ul  <comment39586> Yes, looks like the settings you mentioned are pretty much all of what OS X offers to be configurable.
