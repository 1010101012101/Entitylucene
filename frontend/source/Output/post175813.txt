PS : am i making any mistake during making bootable usb or whats the key combination for booting mac pro 2 to usb?  <answer175815> To make a USB installer from the 10.7 .DMG you need to open the .DMG, then open the installer application by right-clicking and selecting strongShow Package Contents/strong and then find the actual installer itself, strongInstallESD.DMG/strong.  Use the Restore function in Disk Utility to copy InstallESD.DMG to your USB device (if you receive any errors, try mounting InstallESD.DMG first before copying it). You should then be able to boot your Pro from it :)
