How to show App previews in Mission Control <body> I just upgraded to Sierra. If I open mission control and hover over the desktops, I see this: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yuF7q.png" alt="enter image description here"  Those pinkish boxes are applications in those spaces. Prior to upgrading, those boxes would be a preview picture of the applications. Is there any way to get this functionality back?
