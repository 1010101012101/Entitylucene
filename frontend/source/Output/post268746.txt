How to change Apple ID account that I cannot remember the password for and that is under an account that is no longer active? <body> I am trying to sign out of the Apple ID on my iPhone 6 Plus but the email it is under is a westnet.com.au account and is "out of date" so we can no longer receive emails. I also cannot remember the password for the Apple ID account.  Could you please tell me if there is a way to sign out of the account with these existing issues or if I need to visit or call Apple?
