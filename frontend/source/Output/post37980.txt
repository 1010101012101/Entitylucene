How do I refresh Application metadata - URL handlers, Web browsers - after installing my own AppleScript? <body> I'm working on an Apple Script that handles URLs. There's a command one can give which re-creates the list that Safari shows to change the default web browser.  Anyone know what this is?  <answer38110> If you saved your AppleScript as application and declared that it can handle the codehttp/code and codehttps/code URL scheme in its codeInfo.plist/code file, you simply need to update its modification date e.g. by running codetouch "My Program.app"/code in Terminal, or moving it to a different folder and back again in Finder.  Launch Services will then pick up the change automatically. You will need to restart Safari to update the browser list.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lirJR.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment43167> Ah hah, interesting! Yes, the system does pick up these changes. There is definitely some under-the-covers magic going on: I couldn't do a cp -pR at the command line, but DnD in Finder was fine for deploying the app. <comment43170> @Dogweather Yeah, *preserving modification time* looks like a good reason for Launch Services to not check the bundle again. <comment43186> Oh, duh. Thanks.
