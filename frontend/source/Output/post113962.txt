Mounting un partitioned usb device <body> I have a debian live boot dvd iso image that I placed on a usb device using DD. Now my question is how can I access that image from the drive while OSX is booted?   I can not figure out how to mount it. All of the commands I know ask me for a file type but there is none!  <comment133659> Do you want to boot from Ubuntu ? <comment134203> No I have a bootable usb drive that I am trying to mount and explore except that it has no partition on it. So I can not figure out how to do it. This is really an exploration into disk devices. Is there a way to read the raw bytes of an "unmounted disk"
