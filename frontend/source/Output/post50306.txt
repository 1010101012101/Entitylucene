How to use Scale Action to scale up an image in Keynote without loosing quality? <body> If I have a really high resolution image in Keynote, and I shrink it down to start out small, and then use the scale up action (animation) to make it big the resulting image is pixelated and low quality, even if the image was scaled up to its original size (before it was scaled down).  This is the same for both vector and raster images.  Is there a way to scale up an image without losing image quality?  <answer50307> I found two workarounds for this, but both are a pain.  ol liThe first is to replace the scaled up image after the scale action completes. This works pretty well, but during the scale process you can see the loss of quality until the regular image replaces it./li liThe second is more complicated, but produces better results:  ol liStart with small scaled version of the image em(image A)/em where you want it. Apply any Build In animations on it./li liHave a full size image em(image B)/em with the opacity set to strong0%/strong./li liHave a strongScale Action/strong on the image B setting it to the size of Image A./li liAdd a strongOpacity Action/strong on image B to 100%./li liUse a strongDisappear Build Out/strong on image A./li liThen use the strongScale Up Action/strong on Image B to the new size you want it to be./li /ol/li /ol  This produces perfect results, but as you can see is very complicated. I created a little video to show the steps and the results.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/BdT00.png" alt="Video showing steps to scale up image without loss of quality."  <comment137584> Second answer it is perfect.
