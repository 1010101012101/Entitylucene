iOS: How to see pictures on a network hard disk? <body> Which is the best free app for browsing and displaying pictures that are stored on a network hard disk?   <answer61483> Yes there are many, like for example File Browser. But you would have found them with a easy google search too.  Add "free" to your search term and you find My Computer Data. I haven't used, it's just the first search result.  <comment71009> Sorry, I forgot the word free :-) <comment71010> Also, does file browser allow me to "slideshow" the pictures like the original iPhone Photos app, or do I have to open each picture separately? Thanks! <comment71113> Thank @Christian. Unfortunately My Computer Data works only for pcs and requires a server running on the pc. Btw I know that google gives me answer, however here I hope to find also some users' feedbacks. <comment71116> @lucaghera Then rephrase your question to "which is the best free app" or something like this ;)
