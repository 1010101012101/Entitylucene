I want it to launch an app, and you get to choose what app it launches, so if I press Google Chrome, then it launches Google Chrome, but it doesn't launch FaceTime.  precodeset the_results to (display dialog "Please Choose User!" buttons {"Admin", "Guest", "Cancel"}) set button_returned to button returned of the_results if button_returned is "Guest" then display dialog "Guest is not functioning!" if button_returned is "Admin" then display dialog "Please insert password!" buttons {"Cancel", "Continue"} default button 2 default answer "" cancel button 1 with hidden answer if the text returned of the result is "Test" then     set the_results to (display dialog "Welcome! What would you like to do?" buttons {"Chrome", "Messages", "More"})     set button_returned to button returned of the_results     if button_returned is "Chrome" then tell application "Google Chrome"         activate     end tell     if button_returned is "Messages" then tell application "Messages"         activate     end tell     if button_returned is "More" then display dialog "Second Page" buttons {"FaceTime", "Thank You!"} end if if button_returned is "FaceTime" then tell application "FaceTime"     activate end tell /code/pre  <answer226487> It's a similar error as in your last question:  You can either reuse embutton_returned/em and emthe_results/em (like you already did in line 6 and 7 &lt;- 1 and 2):  precode...     if button_returned is "More" then set the_results to (display dialog "Second Page" buttons {"FaceTime", "Thank You!"})     set button_returned to button returned of the_results end if if button_returned is "FaceTime" then tell application "FaceTime"     activate end tell /code/pre  or introduce two new variables: embutton_returned2/em and emthe_nextresults/em:  precode...     if button_returned is "More" then set the_nextresults to (display dialog "Second Page" buttons {"FaceTime", "Thank You!"})     set button_returned2 to button returned of the_nextresults end if if button_returned2 is "FaceTime" then tell application "FaceTime"     activate end tell /code/pre
