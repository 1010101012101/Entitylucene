How to run a program by plugging in specific usb device <body> I have such question. Is there any way to start a program whet I plug in a USB device (I think about Logitech R800 presenter).  This device has problems with 2 keys - you need to change the way they work to act properly in keynote. I do it with other program called Karabiner Elements. I don't want Karabiner running constantly so I'd like to open it when I plug the presenter.  Question is how to automate this process. I know you can use automator to run the specific app but I don't know how to trigger it by connecting specific USB device.  Is there any solution? Thanks for your help.  I've found some answers but they are few years old and seem not to work any more. I'm on macOS Sierra.
