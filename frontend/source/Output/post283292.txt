How to prevent separate Google iPhone apps from auto sign-in (sandbox?) <body> I signed into the Google Mail app with my Google account.  I saw that Google Maps app automatically signed me in. I never gave Google Maps my account credentials.  How can I prevent this? Are apps not sandboxed? How can Google Maps steal the credentials of Gmail app?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2lVwz.png" alt="my account logged into Google Maps"
