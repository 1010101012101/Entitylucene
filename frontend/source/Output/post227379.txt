How do I find out which application is sending me this Notification Center alert? <body> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mK6DQ.png" alt="enter image description here"  It appears every 10 minutes or so, and it's driving me nuts! Nothing appears in my notifications slider (the black translucent drawer from the right screen).  Macbook Pro, 10.11.3 El Cap  For googlability: the text is: AUTH_NOTIF_TITLE AUTH_NOTIF_MESSAGE  Options: Close CONTINUE  <answer265476> Usually, you can click on the message area in the notification and the associated app will be launched.  FYI, this looks like the app's localization is configured incorrectly or is missing.
