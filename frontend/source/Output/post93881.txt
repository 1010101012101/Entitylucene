How do I send ASCII text to printer (over USB)? <body> I have a (cheap Chinese) thermal printer with USB connection with Windows and Linux drivers. I tested installing the Linux driver PPD with Gutenprint and usbtb at first without any luck.  So I would like to be able to send text-only direct to the printer. I can't see any virtual device under /dev/ that seems to correspond to the printer.  The output from System Information looks like this:  precodeGeneric Bulk Device:    Product ID:   0x5011   Vendor ID:    0x0416  (Winbond Electronics Corp.)   Version:   3.00   Serial Number:    1234567890   Speed:    Up to 12 Mb/sec   Manufacturer: Generic   Location ID:  0x14100000 / 1   Current Available (mA):   500   Current Required (mA):    100   1284 Device ID:   print00 /code/pre  Is there a way to send text (ASCII) to the printer?  When Mac OS X tries to identify the printer it manages to send PostScript code that the printer outputs verbatim so at least some parts of the communication with printer works. If I just could avoid sending PostScript code and instead just send ordinary text.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5QFLr.png" alt="Receipt with printed PostScript code"  <answer96536> I managed to install a raw printer driver and print to it from the command line.  Using CUPS/Gutenprint's web interface at codehttp://localhost:631//code I added a printer with device URI      usbtb://Generic%00%00%06/Generic%20Bulk%20Device?serial=1234567890   and selected "Raw" as the make for the printer. (Please note that the serial URI parameter corresponds to the serial number for the USB device as listed in the question!)   I can now see the printer listed when issuing the command codelpstat -p -d/code     printer Generic_usbtb is idle.  enabled since Tue Jul 16 23:04:11 2013   To print the text file codetext.txt/code I write codelp -d Generic_usbtb test.txt/code  <comment110093> Do you use Terminal ? <comment110387> @Buscarì›ƒ Well, I use iTerm2 but one problem is that lp doesn't give me raw access to the printer or usbtb but just uses the existing printer drivers. I guess a text-only printer driver would suffice for my needs but I haven't found one. <comment110402> If you can't setup a printer through the usual Finder interface, you can try to access the CUPS web interface at: [http://localhost:631/](http://localhost:631/) <comment221969> This worked for me! You can find usbtb here (Gutenprint isn't required, just usbtb): http://sourceforge.net/projects/gimp-print/files/ - incredibly, it works on OS X Yosemite, despite usbtb's last release being from 7 years ago.
