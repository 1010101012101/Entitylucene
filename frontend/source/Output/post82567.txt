How to set up macbook 2008 to samsung led tv - sound issues <body> I have a Macbook, and the specs are:  ul liOS x 10.5.8 /li li2.2 Ghtz Intel Core 2 Duo/li li2Gb 667 Mhtz DDR2 SDRAM/li limini-dvi out/li /ul  I have a Samsung LED TV with HDMI in , Component in with twin phono in  I have succesfully mirrored the laptop screen to my Samsung TV, no issues with visual, but i cannot for the life of me get the sound to come through my TV.  I use a Mini-DVI to HDMI adapter and HDMI cable to my TV, and when the sound didn't work I bought a stereo jack to twin phono, and hooked that up via headphone socket on my Mac to the L/R input on my TV but to no avail.  All cables have been checked and work properly, and I have gone to system preferences/sound nothing is muted and my Mac recognizes that something is pluged in to headphones, but it doesnt come out the TV.  I have also checked all settings and configs on my TV but again to no avail.  What can I do to fix this?  I am at a loss, any help would be greatly appreciated, I can do screenshots upon request.  <comment95243> Yet another case of Samsung and Apple [refusing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc._v._Samsung_Electronics_Co.,_Ltd.) to get along. *sigh* <comment95247> surely the tv shouldn't have a choice, sound is definitely coming out the headphone socket and is plugged into L/R.....arrrggghhh....why doesnt it work!!!! the visual just worked, i plugged the cables in and poof up came the screen, why is the audio any different?    thanks for replying btw
