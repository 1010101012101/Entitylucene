Show context sensitive keyboard upper case or lower case characters on the iPad <body>    strongPossible Duplicate:/strongbr   Is there a way to configure the keyboard on an iPad       My Windows Phone's keyboard displays the characters on it depending on the context, i.e, if I am currently typing lower case characters the keyboard overlay is lowercase and ditto for upper case.  I just got myself a new iPad yesterday and found that the keyboard is always stuck on uppercase. I mean when I type it works fine but the overlay is always uppercase. Anyway to change this?  <comment57218> What os level is on your iPhone? That seems odd behavior <comment57219> @bmike: You know I could have sworn thats how my iphone worked but I checked and realized that how my Windows Phone works! <comment57220> The question still holds though. <comment57221> Hmm... My iPhone overlay is always on upper case. <comment57232> There is no way to change the way the iOS keyboard works, which is always uppercase. <comment57233> Seems like the same question as http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/49886/is-there-a-way-to-configure-the-keyboard-on-an-ipad <comment57245> No way to change that without jail breaking. <comment57246> @bmike It's perfectly normal. The keys themselves always display uppercase, no matter what case they're actually typing. Just like a hardware keyboard!
