After an OS update, should you remain logged in? <body> My recollection of past behavior of OS X updates is the following:  ol liUpdate downloaded from within App Store. System reboots.  /li liSystem installation (gray background, apple symbol, est. time to completion)  /li liLogin prompt screen  /li /ol  After updating to 10.11.3 today, however, there was no login step. After the gray installation screen, there was a brief black screen, and then my desktop was instantly restored. I was already logged in--as if I weren't logged out at all for the reboot, in fact--already reconnected to wifi (but severed from my VPN due to the reboot), and already connected to the App Store.  My basic question is, is this default behavior?   Addendum: am I taking crazy pills, or was this not the usual behavior before?  Is it due to a setting I can change (so I can require the login screen after a reboot regardless of the reason)? I guess I find it unsettling that a user account is "auto-logged" into following a reboot, even if that user initiated the system update that triggered that reboot.  <answer224169> You can disable automatic login from the User &amp; Groups control Panel...  ul liSystem Prefs  Users &amp; Groups  /li liClick the lock &amp; supply your password to unlock  /li liLogin options - set Automatic Login to Off/li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dkvYf.png" alt="enter image description here"
