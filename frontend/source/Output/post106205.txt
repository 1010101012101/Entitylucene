How do I sum up specific things in Numbers? <body> I have a spreadsheet in the newest iWork Numbers.app, with something like:  precodeCATEGORY | POINTS         HW | 100       HW | 100       NW | 12       HW | 50       NW | 23 /code/pre  I want to just sum up all the codeCategory = HW/code into a cell: I'm not sure how. I think I need to use the codeSUMIF()/code function but I get stuck afterwards.  <answer106536> You are correct in that you need to use the SUMIF function. This is the specification from the Function Browser:  precodeSUMIF(test-values, condition, sum-values) /code/pre  Try this in your cell:  precode=SUMIF(CATEGORY; "=HW"; POINTS) /code/pre
