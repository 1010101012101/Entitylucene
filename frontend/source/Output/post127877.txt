iPad 1 update from 5.1.1 to 7.1 <body> How can I update iPad 1 from iOS 5.1.1 to iOS 7.1?  I tried checking for updates but I get a message "your software is up to date".  <answer127880> h3You can't install iOS 7 (or even iOS 6) on an iPad 1./h3  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/n4B07.png" alt="iOS 7 is compatible withâ€¦"  supSource: http://www.apple.com/ios/features//sup  The last version of iOS capable of being installed on an iPad 1 is iOS 5.1.1 and since this is the version that you are currently on there are no updates available.  <answer164253> Just found this site and the informed answers and advice. While very disappointed I cannot fix my iPad 1 or 1st Generation as I now know to run later than ios5 etc; my many months of head scratching are now over!   Sadly it seems a few writing on these pages appear very angry, more angry at the fine folks telling them the truth, 1st Gens cannot upgrade, which reflects frustrations rather than thanks for accurate information, I am forever grateful for those who advise as they have.  Many thanks and wishing the site ongoing successes during 2015 and onwards.  Yours sincerely grateful,  BusyRoly999. Devon, England, UK  <comment149838> You won't. It's not supported. I'm just looking for citable content... <comment149839> http://www.apple.com/ios/features/ You need to scroll down nearly to the bottom of the page to see the supported devices.
