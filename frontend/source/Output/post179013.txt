Recovering lost Swift Files <body> I was having problems with Xcode, the SourceKitService kept crashing, so I followed the advice in this SO answer: https://stackoverflow.com/a/26308922/1037617  To delete those files I opened up Terminal, found that directory and I ran the command coderm -f -r */code  I ran Xcode again and it was still suffering with these problems. So I went back to terminal and ran that command again. Then I rebooted my Mac just in case that would help.  When my Mac came back on, my entire desktop was empty. The desktop was where I had been saving my Swift projects, and there were a few images I had saved from the internet on there. It is all gone.  This Swift project I have been working on for several months. I know I am a dumbass for not making backups. I could potentially be in huge amounts of trouble for losing so much work, and I'm not even sure how I lost the contents of my Desktop.  So I have run some file recovery programs on my Mac (Stellar Phoenix Mac Data Recovery and Mac Data Recovery Guru), but neither of them seem to be finding Swift files. They find AppleScripts (.scpt), they find C Scripts but none of them are anything like what I have been working on.  Can anybody please help me?   Is there a file recovery program that works with Swift files?  <comment212122> Sorry to hear about this, my first guess is that you didn't change into the correct directory before running `rm -rf *`. http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/55956/recovering-an-accidentally-deleted-folder-in-osx-no-time-machine-or-backup-av?rq=1 has some additional ideas about tools you could try to recover your files with. <comment212123> **Note**: Protected to prevent spam answers which usually come in rather fast for questions about file recovery. <comment212125> do you know if any of these recovery programs works specifically with Swift files? <comment212126> No, I don't know. <comment212128> Can you unprotect this question then please? As I need something that will specifically recover Swift files. I have tried a few data recovery options so far and none of them are finding any Swift files at all. It would be nice if somebody else out there knew of data recovery that worked specifically with Swift and could help me out. <comment212129> Everybody with at least 10 reputation can provide an answer already anyway, the protection is primarily to prevent newly created spam accounts from pushing their "recovery" products.
