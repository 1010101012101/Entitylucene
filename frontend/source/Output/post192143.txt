Total per month of daily values <body> I would like to have a total per month in second table of the first table I would like the table to be separated and I would like the process to be automated: typing the month and year in one cell and having the spreadsheet calculate the total for that month. (it means i can keep data in a tab and just import/update it when I need without caring about which month stops where).  In my data table I have 2 columns: one is a date, the other a value  precodeSeptember 2014  114 September 2014  89 September 2014  109 September 2014  85 September 2014  96 September 2014  93 September 2014  96 September 2014  118 October 2014    107 October 2014    98 October 2014    79 October 2014    67 October 2014    86 October 2014    141 October 2014    92 /code/pre  The formula I'm using is:  precode=SUMIF(Date,"="&amp;A2,Count) /code/pre  Date is the date column in the first table; in A2 i have the month and year (as mentioned above)—but this only returns the first value found for the month… I tried using MONTH(Date) but it is not working; would you have any suggestions?  EDIT my dates in the raw data table are formatted as follow:  precode01/09/2014 00:00:00 /code/pre  they are indeed Date, not String, so the SUMIF appears to be failing on this. How could I convert those Dates into Strings so the comparison inside SUMIF works?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Qnzbf.png" alt="data and formula" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3JJng.png" alt="date colummn, Date not string and formatting options"  <answer192443> Using the codeSUM(IF)/code function:  Because strongNumbers/strong does not yet support certain Array functions, for example extracting codeMONTH(A1:A23)/code, by parsing the date into a third column (which can be hidden) the function will work. This column can be in any table, not just the raw data table as long as the references are valid.  Hidden column formula:  precode=MONTH(A1)&amp;YEAR(A1) /code/pre  Where A1 is the cell with date.  Copy down then hide column if desired.  (Importing more data by adding rows should automatically bring the formula down but unhide the column to be sure.)  precode=SUMIF($'Month &amp; Year',"="&amp;MONTH($A1)&amp;YEAR($A1),$Value) /code/pre  From the documentation regarding codeSUMIF()/code:     The SUMIF function returns the sum of a collection of numbers, including only numbers that satisfy a specified condition.      SUMIF(test-values, condition, sum-values)      ul   litest-values: The collection containing the values to be tested.    test-values can contain any value./li   licondition: An expression that can include comparison operators, constants, the ampersand concatenation operator, and references. The   contents of the condition must be such that the result of comparing   the condition to another value results in the boolean value of TRUE or   FALSE./li   lisum-values: An optional collection containing the values to be summed. sum-values can contain number values, date/time values, or   duration values. It should have the same dimensions as test-values./li   /ul   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/tHHot.png" alt="Tables"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/iKZZC.png" alt="Formula"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ACdJN.png" alt="Hide Column"  <comment228465> Do you want the sum the total for a Month or do you want to count how many times per month or both? Your Range setting is for the singular cell, and not for the range of all cells. <comment228943> hey @bjbk thanks for looking into this. I justified with your formula which is close to what i had. It's weird as it is still returning the same results, i.e.: the first 114 is returned and it won't sum the counts from B… <comment228944> just realising my date column is containing dates and are displayed as Month Year, but they remain Dates (i.e.: not string). How could i convert those Dates into Strings so the comparison inside SUMIF works? <comment228945> I would like to make the sum of count for any given month. The A2 contains the month I want to know the total for. Thanks :) <comment228954> I updated my questions with the details about the Date content and the cells' formatting—thanks <comment228961> @jrgd now I see your problem. I'll update the answer with a fix for parsing the date shortly. <comment228971> great! i managed to get some results with MID, LEFT and VALUE but it's forcing me to create columns in my raw data : / Happy to read about a smarter and cleaner way ;) thanks for popping back and giving some thoughts on this <comment228973> Will you have multiple years in your column for date? Or one column/table per year? <comment228985> Ideally I should be able to dump 3+ years of daily data and get monthly sum; happy to read your thoughts <comment228987> OK, will keep working on it. ;)
