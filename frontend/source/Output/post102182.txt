What's the "Combo" OS X Update? <body> What's the difference between the strongOS X Mountain Lion Update v10.8.5/strong and the strongOS X Mountain Lion Update v10.8.5 (Combo)/strong packages?  I'm running OS X 10.8.4  <answer102185> strongCombo Update/strong allows you to update from whichever Mountain Lion version youâ€™re using. It means you can update from v10.8.1 to v10.8.5 immediately.  While strongOS X Mountain Lion Update v10.8.5/strong means you can only update from the previous version, which is only strongOS X 10.8.4/strong.  <comment120350> Maybe not related, but if you use Skype be aware that the 10.8.5 does not support Video calling (for now).
