Establishing ssh session using Back To My Mac <body> I am trying to establish a ssh session to my MacBook using "Back to my Mac". So I turned the "Back to my Mac" option strongon/strong in iCloud and ticked the remote sign in box. But if I issue the command  precodessh user_name@computer_name.number.members.btmm.icloud.com /code/pre  the terminal just goes into the next line and stays black. Sorry for not providing more information, but I don't know much about this, so I don't know what else information to provide.  Does anybody know what I did wrong?  strongEdit/strong: As suggested I used the -vvvv flag and got:  precodeOpenSSH_7.4p1, LibreSSL 2.5.0 debug1: Reading configuration data /etc/ssh/ssh_config debug2: resolving "computer_name.number.members.btmm.icloud.com" port 22 debug2: ssh_connect_direct: needpriv 0 debug1: Connecting to computer_name.number.members.btmm.icloud.com [private_IPv6_address] port 22: Operation timed out ssh: Connecting to computer_name.number.members.btmm.icloud.com [private_IPv6_address] port 22: Operation timed out /code/pre  Also the command   precodessh localhost /code/pre  works without any troubles.  <answer291080> "Back to my Mac" uses a special tunnel device configured with two - more or less random and unique - IPv6 addresses from the local address room:  ul lia link local address: fe80.../li lia unique local unicast (ULA): fc00… to fdff…/li /ul  All IPv6 traffic (computer_name.number.members.btmm.icloud.com is the DNS name of a IPv6 host/device!) is wrapped into IPv4 packets, so that a IPv6 capable router isn't needed. On the Apple side it's unwrapped - probably with some 6in4 relay - and then routed to the remote device.  Apparently this doesn't work if you want to ssh from your own host into your own host (aka codessh -6 %localhost-utun1-ULA%/code). It works with a second device (also registered with your Apple ID in iCloud) in your own private or a remote network.  It's really slow though (tested with two Sierra VMs on one hosting Mac all using the same physical network interface!).  <comment367484> You can get more useful debug information out of `ssh` by calling it with `-vvvv` as an option. That'll at least tell you where it's stalled in the connection establishment process. <comment367485> So your remote computer is unreachable, that's all `-vvvv` tells us. Let's debug in in a chat room. I have questions for you: https://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/62332/debugging-btmm-ssh <comment367487> We established that all BTMM settings, computer firewall and ssh settings are correct but BTMM is trying to ssh to an IPv6 address that appears to be un-routable. Not sure where to take it from here but maybe someone smarter than me can help figure it out. <comment367835> Also - hooray for [RFC 6281](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6281) and [this Q&A here on back to my Mac design and function](https://apple.stackexchange.com/q/283349/5472) <comment367836> Although not 100% the answer - I wanted to link to some great answers that have helped me greatly with mDNS and BTMM - https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/53719/can-i-use-back-to-my-macs-mdns-address-and-for-ssh-and-other-routing-of-traffic and https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/14049/is-it-possible-to-use-back-to-my-mac-dns-or-routing-information-from-the-command
