Sometimes video jumps while presenting it from a third party app on iOS 10 <body> I am trying to present a video from a third party app on my iPhone 6s (iOS 10) to an extended screen via the Lightning Digital AV Adapter. But sometimes it lags/jumps, making the video almost unwatchable.   Why does it do this? How can I stop the video from lagging and jumping?  <comment342866> What are you presenting to? HDMI output to a projector/screen? Do other machines lag when you plug them into the HDMI the same way (minus the adapter)? <comment342867> Hdmi output to a projector screen. <comment342869> If you, say, plug a computer in, does it still lag/jump? Do other apps on the iPhone have the lagging and jumping effect or just this specific third-party one? <comment342870> need to check. Video jumps only at the end... It has 59 minutes... <comment342871> That, to me, sounds like an issue with the app. I need to know more specifics (is it the iPhone, the app, the video, the adapter, the cable, or the projector, we must determine). <comment342872> iphone 6S, adapter completely new, cable hdmi completely new...
