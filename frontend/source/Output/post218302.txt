Preview app lost cmd click title bar in El Capitan? <body> Preview.app: I see that you can click a menu widget but what happened to cmd-clicking the file icon?   <comment263905> We strongly advise one question per question. Can you explain what you want to happen when you click and precisely where in the UI you are clicking (perhaps uploading an image).... <comment263917> I still see the path menu. Are you sure the file is saved to disk? <comment264045> Yes it is saved to disk. <comment265892> Sorry maybe that was the problem, that is was not saved to disk. However every file should be on disk anyway? Why can't we see it's path?
