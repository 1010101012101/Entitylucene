How do I use Applescript to reply to an email? <body> Specifically I'm looking for a simple tweak in the Mail app.  I have a rule set up to "Reply with text" to certain emails that come in, but one source in particular (Trulia) emails me messages from updates@trulia.com.  The email has a "reply to" address built in to respond directly to the person who sent the message, but the "reply with text" rule in Mail sends the response to the updates@trulia.com vs the sender's address.  I was thinking I could create a rule to run an Apple Script to reply, but I'm not familiar with scripts in general.  <comment236313> Look at this - try it yourself and post the Answer if you got it  Otherwise try and update your Question for help  http://www.mactech.com/articles/mactech/Vol.21/21.09/ScriptingMail/index.html
