macbook Random reboot and forgot the time <body> Macbook just randomly switched itself off, and when I switched it back on again it had forgotten the time (as in, it had set itself to 0000 1st Jan 2001)  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/EjJ9U.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  ...and had a moan about some applications with alerts of this format...  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/JwdUB.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  When I opened the time/date presferences... the automatic 'get time from central server' kicked in. But I wanted to know if these two symptoms pointed to a specific problem that someone can recognise...  MacBook has these specs...  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DO0LW.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Edit next day macBook wouldn't charge. Visited Apple Store, power supply was prononced DOA  (turns out it wasn't an offical power supply it was a cheap knock off).  Problem hasn't reoccured since - will come back in a week and let you know if that has fixed it (which would be odd, but on the other hand the power supply starting to flake out emcould/em have a bunch of downstream issues - it has been plugged in every time there has been a problem)  <answer92754> Time to swing the voodoo chicken.  Things to try, in increasing order of intrusiveness:  1) PRAM reset: Reboot machine, holding Command+Option+P+R. Machine will begin to boot, and then automatically reboot itself. Let this cycle continue for 2-3 reboots, then let go and let the machine boot normally. Yeah, I know.  2) SMC reset (the more likely one): http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3964  It's entirely possible that the SMC itself is malfunctioning, which would require a logic board replacement. From your description, I think it's unlikely that this is a software-related issue.  <answer96615> Ahem - it turns out that a faulty (non-apple) charger was to blame - it failed, but before failing properly I understand it wasn't feeding the mac the power it wanted in the way it wanted and may have tripped something...   <comment108736> Has it done this more then once? <comment108738> It rebooted earlier today, but I didn't notice a change in the time... (and it came up as a warning dialog so I'd like to think it would...) It may well be an isolated incidence, but even so, I'd be interested in the reasons why it might be so... <comment108740> Ha - just after I finnished typing - it did exactly the same thing again... *growl* will add some more screenshots. <comment108746> You have some serious bug issues. You system is corrupt, need to do the CMD-R to reset it. <comment108786> Was the MacBook running on battery or mains when you had this problem? <comment108805> @ashley mains.  When restarted it was showing 100% battery. <comment108938> Strange! I agree with @MikeyWard's answer, but I am inclined to think of this as two separate issues: 1) the machine switched itself off; 2) the time was reset. I have resolved issue (2) many times on pre-MacBook Mac portables by replacing the internal watch-like battery which powers the internal clock. On a MacBook, though, I believe the internal clock is powered by the main battery. If it was plugged into the mains, though, this doesn't seem terribly relevant, but I thought I'd mention it in case it helps.
