Can one's iMessage/FaceTime identities be hijacked at a public Wi-Fi? <body> I'm logged in on "Joe's MacBook Pro" at a public Wi-Fi.  I get an alert window (apparently from no program in particular). It says:     Your Apple ID is now being used for iMessage and FaceTime on a new Mac.      If you recently signed into “Joe's MacBook Pro” you can ignore this notification.   What does this mean? I use several development tools (Emacs, …) but neither iMessage nor FaceTime.  I never use the same password twice as suggested as an answer to FaceTime hijacked, nor do I otherwise have a reason to believe my Apple (macOS or iCloud) account is compromised.  Is this a security risk? The message does not indicate what to do if I had emnot/em "recently signed into".  strongPlease provide some back-up or reference for your answer, so as not to trigger extra caution when none is needed./strong emThe point is to understand what's happening, not to be prudent just to be on the safe side./em  <answer284009> Yes, this strongmay/strong be a security risk. But it's unlikely that someone hijacked your Mac using Wi-Fi alone.  In order for you to receive this message someone needs to login with your Apple ID credentials with a device that supports FaceTime (iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, any Mac).  hr  h2Change your Apple ID password/h2  ol liGo to Manage Apple ID/li liLog in with your Apple ID/li liGo to Security  "Change Password..."/li liChange your password/li liAlso turn on two-factor authentication if it isn't already/li /ol  hr  h2Check your Devices/h2  ol liGo to Manage Apple ID/li liLog in with your Apple ID/li liScroll down to emMy Devices/em/li liClick any device that looks unfamiliar to you/li liIn the new window strongclick the blue circle with an x/strong to remove it./li /ol  hr  You may need to sign in with your new Apple ID password on your other devices in order to use all iCloud services again.  <comment358103> Was it asking your for credentials or is it just an alert? <comment358107> @fsb No. It was just an alert. It wasn't asking for any credentials. One reason I'm uncomfortable is that AirDrop showed up in OS X at some point, and, conveniently, Finder now says under AirDrop: "To share with someone using a Mac, ask them to go to AirDrop in the Finder." But I don't quite have a grasp of what this is about. <comment358108> I would recommend immediately changing your Apple ID password while you research this. <comment358263> That's good. But I'm really looking to hunt down what's happening. On a unix system, for instance, if you're wondering if someone is grabbing your screen, there is a multitude of commands (simplest: `who`, next simplest: `top`) you can run to figure out whether someone else. Is there anything I can do in such a case to determine the damage that has been done? If I rush to "check your devices" as you outline, I should see the invader, if any. Is that right? <comment358282> FaceTime is a service that's managed by iCloud. If someone gets his/her hands on your Apple ID and password, this person connects to Apple servers. If access will be granted, all your connected devices get a notification about this. So **this person does not need to have access to your device, only your Apple ID credentials**. Even if a someone connected to you device to grab your credentials, he/she would close any connection to your device before signing in with them. /// Yes, if you check your devices the device will be visible there.
