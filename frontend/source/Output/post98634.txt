In Mountain Lion, where is the exclude list for Time Machine stored? <body> I want to know if the list of Time Machine excluded files (pictured below) can be found in a file somewhere.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/83upD.png" alt="Time Machine exclude list"  I know about the question On Lion, what files are excluded by rule from a Time Machine backup? which has a lot of good information about codeStdExclusions.plist/code, codemdfind/code and codetmutil/code â€“ but not the answer for this question.  One answer also talks about code.exclusions.plist/code, which is almost the answer to this question. But there's a catch, I haven't done a backup yet, so I can't read the code.exclusions.plist/code file from the Time Machine backup volume.  I'm doing codecd / ; sudo find . -iname "*exclusions*"/code now, keeping my fingers crossed.  <answer98636> The Mountain Lion settings are identical to the Lion settings as described here:  ul liWhere does Time Machine store its settings?/li /ul  The answer is code/Library/Preferences/com.apple.TimeMachine.plist/code  <comment151910> This was the key answer, since  `defaults read /Library/Preferences/com.apple.TimeMachine.plist ExcludeByPath`  does what tmutil listexclusions should have done
