Why can't I find PackageMaker? <body> As far as I know, the PackageMaker should be part of "Auxiliary tools for Xcode" and can be downloaded from https://developer.apple.com/downloads. However I cannot see the "Auxiliary tools for Xcode" download (using free developer account).  What am I missing? Is it because of the free account? Where can I find the PackageMaker?  <answer218704> Auxiliary Tools can definitely be downloaded at the link you provided. However PackageMaker is no longer included with the current Auxiliary Tools. See this answer for alternatives  <answer222848> Download Auxiliary Tools for Xcode - Late July 2012 from http://developer.apple.com/downloads - it works on OS X 10.11 fine.  <comment104368> I've also a free account but I see 3 different Auxiliary tools for Xcode (Feb & July 2012) + 1 for Xcode DP <comment104380> I don't understand why I can't see those downloads. Maybe it has something to do with profile or account settings or... <comment104382> Hum, tested with a free developer account and the software doesn't shows either, so it's not a specific issue of yours. <comment104383> Which navigator do you use ? <comment104385> I use Safari Version 6.0.3 (7536.28.10). <comment104387> Tested again, and it's shown now. Weird. Give it another try, @Ted. <comment104397> Still no luck but I'll keep trying. <comment104398> Try opening the link directly, which is: [Auxiliary Tools](http://adcdownload.apple.com/Developer_Tools/auxiliary_tools_for_xcode__late_july_2012/xcode44auxtools6938114a.dmg) <comment104405> It says "Your session has expired.", although I am logged in to the https://developer.apple.com. <comment104511> Hmm... today the download is available. Weird. No idea why it took some time to appear. Thank you all. <comment350710> "Auxiliary tools for Xcode 8" doesn't seem to be available? It seems that latest one is "Auxiliary tools for Xcode 7", or am I missing anything? Or does the "Auxiliary tools for Xcode 7" works with Xcode 8? <comment350777> It's now called Additional Tools for Xcode http://adcdownload.apple.com/Developer_Tools/Additional_Tools_for_Xcode_8.2/Additional_Tools_for_Xcode_8.2.dmg <comment369705> PackageMaker is not in Additional Tools for Xcode, either.
