Activity Monitor confusion <body> I have two java programs that run forever until I terminate the process, I start both at once using a script....   precodeCobrakai$more  startCapture nohup startCaptureA.sh &amp; nohup startCaptureB.sh &amp; Cobrakai$more startCaptureA.sh  cd ~/Dropbox/Eclipse/workspace/com.tmc.personal.screencapture/bin java com/tmc/personal/ScreenCapture Cobrakai$more startCaptureB.sh  cd ~/Dropbox/Eclipse/workspace/com.tmc.personal.screencapture/bin java com/tmc/personal/ActiveWindowCapture /code/pre  They both continue to run, I can see the output they generate (they write to a file each), and I can see them in 'ps':  precodeCobrakai$ps x  | grep Capture | grep java  1137 s000  S      0:12.13 /usr/bin/java com/tmc/personal/ScreenCapture  1138 s000  S      0:05.17 /usr/bin/java com/tmc/personal/ActiveWindowCapture Cobrakai$ /code/pre  But when I open Activity Monitor, I can see that 'ScreenCapture' is running (and taking 96MB of memory)   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/b0aG8.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  But 'ActiveWindowCapture' does not appear at all...  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/EKAQZ.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Can someone tell me why it's not appearing? I'm deeply lost...  EDIT - following (sensible) suggestion from the comments, I tried just starting ActiveWindowManager  precodeCobrakai$killall java Cobrakai$ps x  | grep Capture | grep java [1]-  Exit 143                nohup startCaptureB.sh [2]+  Exit 143                nohup startCaptureA.sh Cobrakai$nohup startCaptureB.sh &amp; [1] 3070 Cobrakai$appending output to nohup.out  Cobrakai$ps x  | grep Capture | grep java  3071 s000  S      0:00.23 /usr/bin/java com/tmc/personal/ActiveWindowCapture Cobrakai$ /code/pre  But still nothing in the Activity Monitor...:s  <comment133826> Try opening the applications in reverse order (i.e. open ActiveWindowCapture before ScreenCapture) and see if the opposite effect occurs. I think it has something to do with there being a single java process to "rule them all." <comment133832> Have you got any java processes in Activity monitor it might be showing as that <comment133842> @XAleXOwnZX edited question to cover... :) <comment133845> Did you try sorting Activity Monitor by PID and see whether the process has a different name there? <comment133852> That second grep implies that ScreenCapture is not running and it is not an ActivityMonitor issue are you sure that the programs are not exiting? <comment133879> Hi Mark - Screen Capture wasn't running for the second grep - that edit was to test the possibility that @XAleXOwnZX suggested... <comment146105> Which versions of OS X and Java are you running?
