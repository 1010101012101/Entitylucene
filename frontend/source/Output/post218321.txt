How can I find the pictures I uploaded from an iphone on Mac? <body> I uploaded all my photos on my photo album to my Mac. My Mac is OS X 10.9.5, I've searched under images, folders, photos, and I cannot find the entire album yet when I type image onto the spotlight bar, I can see some of the pictures I uploaded but not all. I've tried searching iphoto but "iphoto" does not show up. I know my pictures aren't deleted because I can see previews of some of my photos.  Thank You
