How do you change the keys inserted while holding the Option key? <body> The Option key influences what characters are inserted when pressing different keys.  For example, Option-k is ˚ and Option-Shift-k is .  Is it possible to modify these? Is it possible to, for example, make Option-Space insert an En-space? And if so, how would I go about doing such a thing?  <answer249114> You can remap keys with Ukelele or Karabiner.  http://scripts.sil.org/ukelele  https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/
