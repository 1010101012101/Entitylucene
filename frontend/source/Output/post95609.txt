Mountpoint for networked volumes <body> Is possibly to achieve to mounting the network volumes as  precode/Volumes/machine/share_name /code/pre  instead of the default  precode/Volumes/share_name /code/pre  So, when a machine "marvin" has two shares ("home" and "u"), don't want:  precode/Volumes/homes /Volumes/u /code/pre  but looking for  precode/Volumes/marvin/home /Volumes/marvin/u /code/pre  I'm using "netatalk 3.0" (afpd) and mDNSResponder on the server side (FreeBSD), but the same question is for the Samba shares and mounting via Finder's "Connect to server"...  I'm opened to any suggestion to "server side" configuration too.  Is this possible? Thank you.
