Does Boot Camp support Windows Server 2012 with ReFS? <body> According to this article it is possible to install Windows 8 on a Mac (with minor issues).  Assuming Windows Server 2012 supports installation to an NTFS volume, I don't expect to run into any additional issues (if I use NTFS). However, I'd like to install to an ReFS (Resilient File System) volume.   Does anyone know if this possible? Will ReFS play nicely with the Boot Camp / OS X boot manager?
