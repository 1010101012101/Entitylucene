AppleScript: Display alert or restart when application terminates/crashes? <body> I rely on Dropbox for syncing work files between two computes that are powered on 24/7. For some reason, Dropbox terminates (crashes or quits) after long periods of time, with no explanation. I just find later that the application is no longer running.  Is there a way I can get notified (e.g. via a popup) when a certain application terminates?  I'm thinking there might be a way for AppleScript to do this, but I'm unsure where to begin.  <answer230105> Quite easily with an Applescript:  precode repeat     tell application "System Events"         if name of every process does not contain "Dropbox" then display alert "Dropbox has crashed!"     end tell     delay 5 end repeat /code/pre  You could replace "display alert" with codetell application 'Dropbox' to launch/code ..to have it automatically restart if you desire.  Paste this into codeScript Editor/code. save it, and then you could add the script to your user's startup items for future use. The timing there may be a bit tricky though if the script starts before Dropbox - adding a codedelay 10/code or something before the first coderepeat/code would solve this.  For future use, anything involving codeSystem Events/code is a great place to look for solutions to these kinds of meta-system-wide tasks.  <comment280844> Thank you very much! I have now implemented your solution so that it automatically restarts the application, and it seems to work great.
