IOS Safari shared links RSS reader documentation <body> I have a valid ATOM feed here: http://natalian.org/index.atom  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/O0c1P.png" alt="RSS feed reader in Safari"  Though when I added it to Apple's native feed reader, which oddly goes by the name "Shared Links", it doesn't show up despite prompting me to Add current site and being listed in the subscriptions.  What am I missing?  Also I am curious how to do thumbnails for the post. I have not found any documentation how to do this.
