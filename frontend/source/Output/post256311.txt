VMWare - MAC OS X emulation - mouse movement laggy/choppy and unable to increase svga.vramSize beyond 3MB <body> I'm running MAC emulation for the first time and I can see that the mouse behavior is lagging and choppy. I then noticed that the strong"Graphics Display = 3MB"/strong would not change, no matter what I set the strongsvga.vramSize/strong value at.   I suspect these are related, and fixing the vramSize may fix the mouse lag and make it smooth again - agreed?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/USJbM.png" alt="Here is a picture of the settings"  And here is the config (some values are masked, such as serial number, mac address and directory locations).  Personally, I don't care what the svga.vramSize number is, or should be - I just want the mouse scrolling to be smooth :)  Thank you for your help! -Bob  precode.encoding = "windows-1252" config.version = "8" virtualHW.version = "9" scsi0.present = "TRUE" scsi0.virtualDev = "lsilogic" memsize = "4096" scsi0:0.present = "TRUE" scsi0:0.fileName = "OSX MAC.vmdk" scsi0:1.present = "TRUE" scsi0:1.autodetect = "TRUE" scsi0:1.deviceType = "cdrom-image" ethernet0.present = "TRUE" ethernet0.connectionType = "bridged" ethernet0.virtualDev = "e1000e" ethernet0.wakeOnPcktRcv = "FALSE" usb.present = "TRUE" ehci.present = "TRUE" ehci.pciSlotNumber = "34" sound.present = "TRUE" sound.virtualDev = "hdaudio" sound.fileName = "-1" sound.autodetect = "TRUE" pciBridge0.present = "TRUE" pciBridge4.present = "TRUE" pciBridge4.virtualDev = "pcieRootPort" pciBridge4.functions = "8" pciBridge5.present = "TRUE" pciBridge5.virtualDev = "pcieRootPort" pciBridge5.functions = "8" pciBridge6.present = "TRUE" pciBridge6.virtualDev = "pcieRootPort" pciBridge6.functions = "8" pciBridge7.present = "TRUE" pciBridge7.virtualDev = "pcieRootPort" pciBridge7.functions = "8" vmci0.present = "TRUE" smc.present = "TRUE" hpet0.present = "TRUE" ich7m.present = "TRUE" usb.vbluetooth.startConnected = "TRUE" firmware = "efi" displayName = "OS X MAC" guestOS = "darwin12-64" nvram = "OS X MAC.nvram" virtualHW.productCompatibility = "hosted" powerType.powerOff = "soft" powerType.powerOn = "soft" powerType.suspend = "soft" powerType.reset = "soft" extendedConfigFile = "OS X MAC.vmxf" uuid.bios = "56 4d 8e 4e 6b 5c ca 93-cd 8a 0b 3c 96 fb fc e4" uuid.location = "56 4d 8e 4e 6b 5c ca 93-cd 8a 0b 3c 96 fb fc e4" replay.supported = "FALSE" replay.filename = "" scsi0:0.redo = "" pciBridge0.pciSlotNumber = "17" pciBridge4.pciSlotNumber = "21" pciBridge5.pciSlotNumber = "22" pciBridge6.pciSlotNumber = "23" pciBridge7.pciSlotNumber = "24" scsi0.pciSlotNumber = "16" usb.pciSlotNumber = "32" annotation = "     OS X Mavericks 10.9" ethernet0.pciSlotNumber = "160" sound.pciSlotNumber = "33" vmci0.pciSlotNumber = "35" vmci0.id = "806628803" vmotion.checkpointFBSize = "3145728" cleanShutdown = "TRUE" softPowerOff = "TRUE" usb:1.speed = "2" usb:1.present = "TRUE" usb:1.deviceType = "hub" usb:1.port = "1" usb:1.parent = "-1" toolsInstallManager.updateCounter = "32" tools.remindInstall = "FALSE" numa.autosize.vcpu.maxPerVirtualNode = "1" numa.autosize.cookie = "10001" migrate.hostlog = ".\OS X Mavericks-80c306fe.hlog" monitor.phys_bits_used = "40" scsi0:1.startConnected = "TRUE" smc.version = "0" scsi0:1.fileName = "&lt;path&gt;\darwin.iso" tools.syncTime = "FALSE" board-id.reflectHost = "FALSE" board-id = "Mac-XXXXXB81FF30ACF6" hw.model.reflectHost = "FALSE" hw.model = "MacPro6,1" serialNumber.reflectHost = "FALSE" serialNumber = "XXXXX446F693" smbios.reflectHost = "FALSE" ethernet0.addressType = "static" ethernet0.Address = "XX:X:XX:10:7d:84" ethernet0.checkMACAddress = "false" efi.nvram.var.ROM.reflectHost = "FALSE" efi.nvram.var.MLB.reflectHost = "FALSE" efi.nvram.var.ROM = "847245" efi.nvram.var.MLB = "W80A4F65ABA1A" svga.autodetect = "FALSE" svga.maxWidth = "1024" svga.maxHeight = "768" svga.vramSize = "3145728" fileSearchPath = "&lt;path&gt;\OS X Mavericks;." floppy0.present = "FALSE" usb:0.present = "TRUE" usb:0.deviceType = "hid" usb:0.port = "0" usb:0.parent = "-1" /code/pre  <answer256734> Soooo I figured this out :) I ran the Chicago Marathon yesterday, and while at mile 24 (and trying to think about anything else other than the last two miles - marathoners will understand), it dawned on me:   I recently upgraded to VMWare 12 and I was still using Darwin (VMWare tools) for version 11.5.  Installed it and solved this problem right away!  <comment319920> Yes, I saw this step in the tutorial but it didn't seem to do anything. <comment319921> There were no options in the vmware tools to modify - the install just completed and then asked me to reboot - did I miss something? <comment319923> You obviously installed OS X to a non-Apple machine & VMware Workstation. Usually this is completely off-topic here. Now I assume you installed VMware Workstation to a Bootcamp partition on a Mac (blink, blink). Which crack did you use?
