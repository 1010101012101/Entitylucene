Ethernet / Thunderbolt working but no access to Internet <body> MacBook Pro 13" (late 2013), Intel i5, 2.4 GHz, 8GB RAM, 250 GB SSD, macOs 10.12.1  A couple of weeks ago my ethernet connection to internet dropped after waking it from sleep (I think this is when it happened ). A few days before that I have upgraded to macOS Sierra at home where everything worked and beginning of week also at the location of my current project.  Ethernet dongle, both of them, are functioning. As well as thunderbolt ports according to System Information.  Network diagnostics tells me everything is working fine, all green balls. Using a different location setting it is all red balls and anything in between with other self-made location during different try-outs. Either way no connection to internet over Ethernet.  What have I already done:  ul liI have deleted all network locations and started afresh./li liDeleted all Thunderbolt bridges and rebooted./li liI have re-installed macOS 10.12.1 (Sierra)/li liI have checked correct version of "IncompatibleKernelExtensionConfigurationData " have 3.21.2 which is higher then the apparent faulty one mentioned in fora/li liI have thrown out content of /Library/Preference/SystemConfigurations as suggested in other fora and rebooted for 'clean' build of files./li liTried different cables on other machines (win), all good. Checked wall socket of ethernet, all good, double checked switch wiring was still in place to my office ethernet socket, all good./li liTried it at home (The Netherlands) as well as at current project (Germany) but no luck (if that has anything to do with it)./li liBooted in safe mode and subsequently rebooted in standard mode. Apparently cleans up some stuff somewhere./li /ul  In the mean time concocted a 3G mobile wifi router set-up to get by with a trickle feed internet.  Please help.  <comment325179> Thanks AllInOne for the edit. Will take better care of it myself next time around. <comment325186> Start the Console, found in /Applications/Utilities/Console.app, disconnect the Ethernet/Thunderbolt Adapter and reconnect. Check the Console and post the logged Entries here. <comment327866> I am no longer at the project address where this problem occurred so unable to replicate. In the mean time problem at home solved by plugging E/T adapter in other MBP at home and then plug it back in my own MBP. Clueless to what has changed but internet is accessible over E/T adapter. Very odd. The more since it 'feels' like ethernet is faster then ever before...
