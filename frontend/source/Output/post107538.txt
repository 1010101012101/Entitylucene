Is there a way to put the iPhone into a child-only mode? <body> I find that my two-year-old will often delete photos...most of the times by accident.  Is there a mode on the iPhone or some other software that will help thwart this?  Is there a way to control which apps a child can access?  (I'm hoping that Apple would build it right into the OS.)  <answer107542> Yes, start with Guided Access which easily locks one app in full screen mode and then move on to restrictions once you have a feeling for what you want to open up past one app at a time as your two year old gets more able to use more than just one game at a time..  <comment126737> Guided Access worked like a charm! How do I use Restriction with Guided Access to allow multiple apps access? <comment126753> When using guided access, you will not be able to switch between apps, so you will have to use one or another.
