Is there a way to know who owns an iTunes app name? <body> I want to use a certain name for my app, but it is already taken. But no known app exists with this name. Any idea how I can find the owner of the app?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hopdW.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment327994> Your question really doesn't provide much detail. However, I would not assume that the app doesn't exist, as it may exist in a particular App Store (e.g. be available in the US app store but not anywhere else) or it may only be for a particular device (e.g. available only for iPad). Also, it _may be possible_ that single digit number names are reserved (although I haven't specifically come across this as a developer).
