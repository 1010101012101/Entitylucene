Can't install Python Modules <body> I'm running OSX 10.8.5 with python 2.7.10. When I run the following codepip install pyodbc/code I get the following error message.   Error Message:     Command "/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/Resources/Python.app/Contents/MacOS/Python -c "import setuptools, tokenize;__file__='/private/var/folders/vy/13xnp2r52ls80mzhmcns__bm0000gp/T/pip-build-OUZxeg/pyodbc/setup.py';exec(compile(getattr(tokenize, 'open', open)(__file__).read().replace('\r\n', '\n'), __file__, 'exec'))" install --record /var/folders/vy/13xnp2r52ls80mzhmcns__bm0000gp/T/pip-BhOEZo-record/install-record.txt --single-version-externally-managed --compile" failed with error code 1 in /private/var/folders/vy/13xnp2r52ls80mzhmcns__bm0000gp/T/pip-build-OUZxeg/pyodbc   Xcode 5.1 is installed and codepip list/code shows:  precodeargh (0.26.1)  html5lib (0.999999)  pathtools (0.1.2)  pip (7.1.0)  PyYAML (3.11)  setuptools (15.2)  simplejson (3.8.0)  six (1.9.0)  wheel (0.24.0) /code/pre  I'm pretty new to OS X so any help is welcome.  <answer201739> Problem sovled  This issue was caused because I had imported a time machine back which was made using snow lepoard. Doing this had overwrote the mountain lion libraries.  I just had to reinstall mountain lion over the existing install and then xcode and homebrew and it worked fine.  <comment240661> Have you installed Xcode ? <comment240716> Could you also include the output of `pip list`? <comment240841> @Mark Xcode is installed 5.1 <comment240842> @theoden argh (0.26.1) html5lib (0.999999) pathtools (0.1.2) pip (7.1.0) PyYAML (3.11) setuptools (15.2) simplejson (3.8.0) six (1.9.0) wheel (0.24.0) <comment243230> I'm voting to close this question as off-topic because given the answer this question will not help anyone else <comment243269> I also get messed up between the "system python" and "homebrew python" - pip vs easy_install. Good thing you sorted it out +1 <comment243271> @Mark Thanks for the comment. We no longer close questions simply because they are narrow. This has a specific error and is welcome on the site. We can discuss the why in more detail at [meta] - It's a +1 question IMO. <comment243276> @bmike pip and way_install can be used with both system and home-brew and other pythons - they all need to have the correct python in the #! header <comment243279> @Mark I know and I keep forgetting the paths so my pythons need some professional wrangling from time to time.  http://i.stack.imgur.com/0tfqZ.jpg
