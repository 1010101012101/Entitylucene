Alternative to Cover Version visualizer in iTunes 12.6 <body> I need a way to display full screen lyrics in iTunes of the song that is currently playing. Up until now I have used Cover Version, but it doesn't work anymore since iTunes 12.6:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/i6GEC.png" alt="cover version website screenshot"  Are there any alternatives? I am using a mac :)   strongEDIT - 29 June 2017/strong  Apparently it has been fixed and the plugin works now! Many thanks to the developer :)  <answer281015> iTunes has its own lyrics display, but it's rubbish...  click the 'Up Next/History tab towards the right on the top of iTunes screen, and you get a Lyrics box as well. You get a drop=down showing the track artwork and the lyrics.  But you can't chose a font nor enlarge the text, and if there is more text that will fit the screen, the lyrics don't scroll down as the track plays, unlike old Cover Version plugin, which was brilliant. :-(  <comment350156> Can you clarify whether you're using a Mac or PC? Or do you need a solution for each? <comment350184> @Monomeeth I am using a mac :) <comment367127> Unfortunately, I can't seem to make 'Cover version' work anymore. (Macbook Pro 2011 - iTunes 12.6(.1.27). And I liked it so much... <comment367131> @Jack-O Actually, the new version works again. Try updating iTunes and downloadng cover version again :)
