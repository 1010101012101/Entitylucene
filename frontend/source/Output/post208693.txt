Missing SSD space on MBPr 13, El Capitan <body> I have the following problem: I had two partitions, one was ~190 GB, and another ~60GB. Then I wanted to delete the second partition and resize the first one. The deletion went well (I suppose), but I could not resize the first partition, Disk Utility always failed. So I disabled Core Storage, as I found on the internet it could help. After this the unallocated space disappeared and now I cannot do anything. Disk Utility says the drive is 251 GB, but the only partition fully covers it and is 190 GB. I attach the screens below:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Wkf4K.png" alt="The drive in Disk Utility" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bKakf.png" alt="Partition in Disk Utility"  Does anyone know how to resize the partition to 251 GB? I would really appreciate your help! Thanks!
