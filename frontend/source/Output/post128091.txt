Where can I find default Microsoft fonts Calibri, Cambria? <body> If I want to test or use default Microsoft fonts on my Mac, and I own a post-2006 copy of Windows or Office, I believe I can legally use Calibri and Cambria although IANAL. This would be especially helpful when collaborating with colleagues using Office products like Word, Excel, and PowerPoint. Right now, I get a warning like: "Calibri not found. Trebuchet MS used instead." Where can I find them?  <answer128092> To find and install default Microsoft fonts on a Mac:  ol liNavigate HERE in your browser. /li liDownload the .ZIP file./li liUnzip it (double-click it)./li liOpen the folder that appears./li liSelect all the .TTF files inside the folder./li liWith the files selected, right-click./li liFrom the pop-up menu, choose "open with → Font Book". /li liClick "Install Font" for each font./li /ol  emNote:/em Changes to fonts take effect when an application is opened or a user logs in to the account or computer on which the changes occurred, see support.apple.com.   <answer259747> If you use homebrew, try the homebrew-fonts-nonfree tap  <comment197146> You may also find this download page from Microsoft helpful: http://www.microsoft.com/typography/fonts/ <comment256267> Note that the version number of the MS *C…* fonts offered behind that link is 2.0, i.e. taken from MS Office Mac 2008. Since Windows Vista (see [MS Typogrpahy](https://www.microsoft.com/typography/fonts/font.aspx?FMID=1914)), the version numbers have been 5.x. I’m not sure what exactly are the differences. <comment256274> That are also the same versions as are coming with [Open XML File Format Converter for Mac 1.2.1](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=27334), by the way.
