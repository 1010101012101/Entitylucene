iphone Calendar can not see events previously entered or enter new events <body> I only have an iPhone. I have lost (it worked and no stopped) the ability to see calendar events that I have entered previously. When I call up the Calendar the + sign is dim. I can not enter new calendar events and I can not see events previously entered. I have tried to find on this site and tried to use what I have found with no success.  <comment321799> Welcome to Ask Different.
