Change Preview's default "Move to..." directory <body> Is there a way to set the default strongMove to.../strong directory in Preview?  When a file is opened in strongPreview/strong and strongMove to.../strong is selected, the default directory is the directory that the file currently resides in. This directory selection is useless since I want to move the file emfrom/em it. I'd like to set it to something else.  <comment106947> You need to provide more information.  I cannot find a Move To item in Preview's menu on Snow Leopard.  What version are you using?  (The closest I've got is "Save" and "Save As" ) Rmember that a 'rename' in unix is a move.  Eg.  mv foo.pdf bar.pdf renames foo to bar in the existing directory.
