Does Reset and "Erase All Content and Settings" removes iOS updates? <body> I want to reset and clear the iPad.   But I would like to keep the iOS updates.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vGf3T.png" alt="Erase the Content and Settings on iPad"  <answer265138> No. Factory resetting your phone only deletes the user data; the operating system and firmware will still remain the same.  That means, if your iPhone is running iOS 9.3.2 before you reset with codeErase all content and settings/code, it will be running iOS 9.3.2 (minus all of your data) once it starts up again.  <answer265151> You cannot revert the operating system. As a result, you are free to remove all content and settings and the iOS version will remain the same. Resetting all settings will also not impact the operating system.  <comment332447> Yep, this is correct.
