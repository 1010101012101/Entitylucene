iOS cannot play "slow" or "veryslow" h.264 videos <body> I have encoded a video that I want to transfer to my iPad.  Using FFmpeg, the settings are:  precodeffmpeg -i input.mkv -c:v libx264 -preset veryslow -crf 32 output.mp4" /code/pre  When I have tried the presets codeveryslow/code and codeslow/code, I get this message when trying to sync the video via iTunes to the device:     "[Your File] was not copied to the [Device Name] because it cannot be   played on this iPad."   However, I have tried encoding the same video using the preset codemedium/code and sync and playback in iOS's emVideos/em app works.  Is there a work-around to get the "slow" preset videos onto the iPad?  <answer243864> Use next parameters to ensure compatibility with apple devices.  code-profile:v baseline -level 3.0/code  This disables some advanced features but provides for better compatibility. Typically you may not need this setting (and therefore avoid using code-profile:v/code and code-level/code), but if you do use this setting it may increase the bit rate quite a bit compared to what is needed to achieve the same quality in higher profiles.  Encoding video using H.264 compression:  ul liH.264 Baseline 3.0: All devices/li liH.264 Baseline 3.1: iPhone 3G and later, and iPod touch 2nd generation and later./li liH.264 Main profile 3.1: iPad (all versions), Apple TV 2 and later, and iPhone 4 and later./li liH.264 Main Profile 4.0: Apple TV 3 and later, iPad 2 and later, and iPhone 4S and later/li liH.264 High Profile 4.0: Apple TV 3 and later, iPad 2 and later, and iPhone 4S and later./li liH.264 High Profile 4.1: iPad 2 and later and iPhone 4S and later./li /ul  A frame rate of 10 fps is recommended for video streams under 200 kbps. For video streams under 300 kbps, a frame rate of 12 to 15 fps is recommended. For all other streams, a frame rate of 29.97 is recommended.  Encode audio as either of the following:  ul liHE-AAC or AAC-LC, stereo/li liMP3 (MPEG-1 Audio Layer 3), stereo/li /ul  <comment300373> Have you tried [VLC](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/vlc-for-mobile/id650377962)? Also, is there a reason you need anything better than `medium`? From the [FFmpeg FAQ](https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/Encode/H.264#FAQ): "It's diminishing returns: `veryslow` helps about 3% compared to the `slower` preset, `slower` helps about 5% compared to the `slow` preset, and `slow` helps about 5-10% compared to the `medium` preset." <comment300375> @AndrewLarsson: Haven't tried VLC, but will do. In my case, `veryslow` saves a few hundred Mb compared to `medium` on a 2 hr long video. <comment300377> The App Store page doesn't list much technical information about VLC, but they do have some on their website: http://www.videolan.org/vlc/download-ios.html
