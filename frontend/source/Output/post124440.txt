Missing text when I print Pages 5.1 file or export to PDF <body> I've encountered a problem whereby if I want to print a pages 5.1 file or export it to PDF, text goes missing (specifically text near superscript/subscript text). An example of this same problem can be found here however the 'solution' there doesn't work.  I'd be very grateful for any advice or solutions.  <comment145574> So you are saying you have the problem even when tables are not being used? <comment145619> No, the problem is exclusive to the text inside tables. <comment173418> Just hit the same bug. Circumvented it by exporting to Pages09, opening in pages09, and exporting to PDF from there. This doesn't work very well, but for a one off was okay. **Shame on Apple** for not fixing this well known bug in Pages13.
