How can I find hidden items in Automator? <body> I am trying to create a workflow in Automator that will find hidden files in a folder by searching for files with names that begin with ".".br Currently, the codeFind FInder Items/code action is as follows:  precodeFind Finder Items     Search: [(Var:Selection path)]         [All] of the following are true             [Name] [begins with] "." /code/pre  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/K5kf7.png" alt="a screenshot of the action"  Here is the log showing the error: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/USckY.png" alt="action log"  It does not receive any input, but outputs to a codeMove Finder Items/code action. Every time this action is run, it produces no results. Am I doing this wrong, or is there another way to find hidden files and folders in a variable path? I do not know much about other scripting languages such as applescript, but I am willing to use them if necessary. emThanks for reading!/em  <answer154556> Use a Run Shell Script action like this:  precodefind "$@" -name .\* /code/pre  <comment181977> Disregard that previous comment. I forgot to get the variable before running the script. Thank you very much!
