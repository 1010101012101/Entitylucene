I can not sign into gmail at all unless I pay for help <body> I go to gmail.com and get looped back to sign in with no option to type in password. I copy paste the url and get this.... https://accounts.google.com/signin/v2/identifier?hl=en&amp;passive=true&amp;continue=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F%3Fclient%3Dsafari%26channel%3Dmac_bm&amp;flowName=GlifWebSignIn&amp;flowEntry=ServiceLoginI   Now I see a window that says:  New Remote Connection Service  Secure Shell ssh Secure File Transfer (sfp) File Transfer (ftp) Remote Login (telent)  <comment374246> I'm voting to close this question as off-topic because it doesn't appear to be about Apple hardware or software, according to the [help]. <comment374253> This may or may not be an macOS issue. Can you please add at least some screenshots of the things you see (e.g. The window with the connection options)? It would also help if you could try it with a different browser than Safari.
