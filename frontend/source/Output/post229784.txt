Play video of my iphone by tv that has wifi or bluetooth , is possible by some app?  <comment280367> For bluetooth or airplay you don't need an app. Just pair the bluetooth device with the speaker and choose the speaker as output from control centre <comment280369> Thanks, for playing video on tv? <comment280371> That is a separate question - you should split into two and also show what you have searched for as this information is easy to find
