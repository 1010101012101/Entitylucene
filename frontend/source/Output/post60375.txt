Deleting VPN Configuration Files From Network System Preferences <body> Unfortunately I used a shitty VPN service called VPN OneClick Pro. When you uninstall the app it does not remove the VPN configuration files it creates in Network in System Preferences. So in other words, when you open System Preferences and then click on Network, to your left you always see your Wi-Fi, Ethernet, Firewire, etc. VPN OneClick Pro places about 28 VPN Configuration files. The minus button "-" has been greyed out so removing them is impossible. I'd post a screenshot but as a new user, I'm not allowed to.   Any help would be greatly appreciated.   <answer74808> You can remove them from the place you have the original file.  I had the same problem on my iPhone. It has a red button that said "Remove".  <answer83158> Open the finder, press Cmd + shift + G and paste this: /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/preferences.plist copy the preferences.plist file to your desktop (Admin account) right click and open with X-Code (Get it if you don't have it, it's free) Expand the NetworkServices key, expand every group in that key and look for the UserDefinedName you need to delete (VpnOneClick - something) click the - button to the right of the group number (make sure the that row is selected) you will notice the whole group is marked in a blue square when that is done. Save the file Drag the file on the desktop to the original location and authenticate Open the network settings and you will see the vpnOneClick entries are gone!  <answer85210> To remove the VPN Profile from your Mac:  System Preference  Profile  Vpn One Click  Remove.  <answer95197> System Preference  Profile  Vpn One Click  Remove.  <answer95265> system preferences profile Vpn One click and then the '-' button you have in network settings to, it worked with me flawlessly   <answer131392> First of all go to System Preferences, then Network, then click on VPN on the left. Click click on the minus button under the screen and remove all the VPNs, then close it.  Now go to Finder â†’ Applications and delete VPN One Click  If the system says VPN One Click is running, then quit the app from the Dock and try again.  <answer286348> I had the same issue with IPVanish. They installed probably 30 or 40 different VPN configurations, and going through each one and selecting Remove would be aggravating and tedious. I just deleted the file: code~/Library/Preferences/ByHost/com.apple.networkConnect.&lt;UUID&gt;.plist/code. It's a binary XML, so open it in Xcode or TextMate first to confirm that there's nothing there which is important to you. Or rename the file and/or set permissions to 000. By the way, this is on macOS Sierra. So other OSX versions may differ.  <comment69496> Do you have the System Preferences unlocked? Open System Preferences, choose Network and there is a padlock icon at the bottom left corner. If it is locked, click on it and it will ask you for the admin password, after unlocking you should be able to delete these entries. If already unlocked -- I am not sure what the problem may be. <comment69548> Thanks for the reply, yes it's already unlocked but the "-" button is still greyed out. <comment69553> The VPN settings are in `/Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/preferences.plist` under NetworkServices, check what User Defined Name says to find these entries. If you have plist editor installed (e.g. via Xcode) you can edit that file (create backup first) and delete these entries. If you don't have plist editor, you should be able to edit the .plist file using a text editor, HOWEVER I WOULD STRONGLY RECOMMEND AGAINST DOING SO because it is very very easy to mess things up and render the system nonoperational. <comment87126> Perhaps you could expand a little more on your answer.  Do you have a file path you could provide or could you elaborate on how the iPhone issue pertains to the OP's problem?
