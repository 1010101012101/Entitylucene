using automator/applescript to upload files to a web form? <body> I have a bunch of files I want to upload to web page. Unfortunately the web form for uploading only allows me to specify one at a time (it spawns and 'open file' dialog). Is there an easy way to do this with some combination of automator/applescirpt?  <answer82317> Ok, I managed to get automator to do what I wanted, with a little help from codegrep/code ;)  I did it with a 'workflow' and a "files and folders" in "finder" service. The service calls the workflow with each of the selected file names.  Here's what the service does:  ul licodeRun Shell Script/code with Pass input codeto stdin/code and the script codegrep -o '[^/]*$'/code  --  the service receives the full paths of the files selected in the finder, I only want the file names, so this removes the path bit./li licodeLaunch Application/code with codefirefox/code  -- this seems to be the best way to switch applications (even if they're already open..)/li licodeRun Workflow/code - codein batches/code of code1/code at a time using code1/code workflow, with "wait for workflow to finish" ticked./li /ul  The codein batches/code mode appears to process text input line by line. Each line output by codegrep/code contains a file name, so the second workflow is called once with each file name. Note that the list of file names is passed through codeLaunch Application/code.  Here's what the workflow does:  ul licodeCopy to Clipboard/code/li lia recorded codeWatch Me Do/code: ul lia series of clicks to get the 'upload file' dialog up/li lia click to focus it's search box,\/li lipaste (the file name)/li liselect the top found file/li liclick 'open'/li lia series of clicks to upload the file and return the page to the same state in which we started/li /ul/li /ul  There were a few hiccups along the way.   ul liFirst I used codecommand-V/code to paste, but for some reason that was unreliable, so I ended up using paste from the edit menu instead./li liI had to be careful to leave enough time between clicks for worst-case rendering of html pages and opening dialogs etc.. /li liWhen the flow crashed (usually by getting out of sync with the browser), I often ended up with the browser stuck with the 'upload file' dialog open and unresponsive. To get it responsive again, I found that moving it sufficed (ie: dragging it's title bar a bit)./li /ul  <answer227563> I followed @drevickos very good instructions. Didn't manage it with Safari, but Firefox works perfectly.  Below the downloads for the Service file codeUploadFilesWebForm/code and the Automator file codeUploadFirefox3/code.  With these files, I managed to upload multiple files to SAS on AWS.  For any other website, you should adjust:  ul licodeWatch me do/code procedure to fit your web form in the codeUploadFirefox3/code file/li liThe codedelay/code needed for upload specified in the codeUploadFirefox3/code file/li /ul  UploadFilesWebForm.workflow.zip http://www45.zippyshare.com/v/QQm0SKJ5/file.html UploadFirefox3.workflow.zip http://www45.zippyshare.com/v/bHyKGi2g/file.html  <comment94839> This is very site-specific, can you add some details about the site (address if public, screenshots)? <comment94987> It's mind42.com. It's html/javascript driven. I was hoping to achieve a series of clicks at specific screen positions (which I could perhaps record with automator?), the last of which would open a 'file upload' dialog. Then navigate to the correct folder and perhaps paste in the name of the next file to upload. This would be repeated for each of the files. <comment167675> Any chance you can share your Automator file? Thanks! <comment168252> Happy to share it - do you know a good place to do that? I've [asked a question](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/142837/where-is-a-good-place-to-share-automator-files) too... <comment276048> Could you please share it with me as well? This is exactly what I was looking for. Probably a one-click hoster would work best? <comment276220> @BalassaSamuelson Afraid I'm a bit busy at the moment... If you manage to put it together using the instructions above, perhaps you could share it somewhere and provide a link? <comment277415> thx - been meaning to do that for a long time, but life keeps getting in the way!
