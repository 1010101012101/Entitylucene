iTerm colors for Prompt, Command, and Output <body> Right now my iTerm2 looks like this...  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0XFOu.png" alt="enter image description here"  Everything is the same color and is hard to read. Can I make any of the Prompt, Command, and Output different colors like this?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7VYYn.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer125641> There's a pretty exhaustive description of editing the bash prompt here there might be some linux specific stuff, but most of it is generic bash stuff.  But just for getting started, I recommend this bash profile generator  It is pretty simple, so I've since learned more and my prompt looks like: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GiGAw.png" alt="dwightk&#39;s bash prompt"  using:  precode[[ -s "/Users/dwightk/.rvm/scripts/rvm" ]] &amp;&amp; source "/Users/dwightk/.rvm/scripts/rvm" # Load RVM into a shell session *as a function*  function parse_git_branch { git branch --no-color 2&gt; /dev/null | sed -e '/^[^*]/d' -e 's/* \(.*\)/(\1)/' } export PS1="  \[\033[01;35m\]\u@\h:\[\033[01;34m\]\$(parse_git_branch) \[\033[01;32m\]\w \[\033[01;34m\]\n&gt;\[\e[0m\]" /code/pre  which is pretty useful when dealing with git. Everything before the codeexport PS1=/code is what enables the git branch to appear.   The  is from my first foray into bash prompt editing after I read this blog post.   <answer252001> AFAIK there is no any UNIXy way to color anything else than the strongprompt/strong.  But as you asked for an iTerm2 solution you are in luck! Use the Triggers feature to color text matching regexp.  For example if your prompts looks like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1mvPm.png" alt="before coloring"  ..then add in iTerm - Preferences - Profiles - Advanced - Triggers , [Edit] a Trigger like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xsSxX.png" alt="trigger for command"  ..that will match the strongcommand/strong part of each line, which will start to look like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ysZAC.png" alt="after coloring"  Voil√† - you have different colors for prompt, command and output! :)  <answer275966> Here's what worked for me. Try it and let me know.  http://dobsondev.com/2014/02/21/customizing-your-terminal/  <comment147025> Hopefully someone with a better grasp of the actual editing of the prompt can post a more cogent answer. <comment147031>  - Is that char intented? <comment147033> yeah, it's a leftover from my first expedition into bash prompt editing after reading: http://notes.torrez.org/2013/04/put-a-burger-in-your-shell.html I liked it so it stayed around. <comment147212> That git function is really nice. Will save be some git branch -a cmd's. <comment147318> colored git output is nice too. https://thomashunter.name/blog/git-colored-output-shortcut-commands-autocompletion-and-bash-prompt/ <comment313411> While this is a nice answer, especially the funny  part, it is not a correct one as it doesn't really tell how to set a different color for command and output - only for the prompt. Anyone knows the right answer? <comment313422> I think I got it right in my answer, @jeremyjjbrown . It would be cool if you could change the accepted answer to mine. :) <comment313423> This is simpler for most folks I bet so upvoted. But since the other one will work in any term, even remotely and it colors the git prompt as well, I'm going to keep it as the accepted answer. <comment316743> What font do you use? <comment316782> @towry : Consolas
