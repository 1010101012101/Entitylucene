What is "usernoted" and why is it eating my CPU? <body> For the past couple of weeks, a process identified as codeusernoted/code appeared to "take over" my machine after a few hours of use, eating over 99% of available CPU.  Force quitting the process doesn't help; only a system restart puts codeusernoted/code to sleep for a while.  What is this process and how do I get it under control?  I am running strongOS X 10.10.5/strong (build 14F1021).  <answer213013> While this may be related to Growl or one of the other notification apps. This seems like it could be a solution:  https://discussions.apple.com/thread/4926305?tstart=0  <answer219528> Usernoted is a process that is responsible for notifications on OS X.  The instructions from this post solved usernoted sitting at 100% CPU on my Mac, even though they were intended to only fix stuck Notification settings:  ol liOpen the Library folder in your Home folder./li liIn the Library folder, open the Application Support folder./li liLocate the folder named NotificationCenter. Drag this folder to the desktop./li liNext, open the Terminal application. Copy and paste each line of these commands into the Terminal window, in order. Press return after each line:  precodecd `getconf DARWIN_USER_DIR` rm -rf com.apple.notificationcenter killall usernoted; killall NotificationCenter /code/pre/li liClose the Terminal app./li liRestart your computer./li /ol  For me, the problem started after I had upgraded from Yosemite to El Capitan: usernoted was constantly sitting at 100% CPU and nothing I tried (force-quitting usernoted, checking if Growl or Bark are installed, booting into safe mode, SMC reset, running all the maintenance and cleaning scripts in Onynx, etc.) seemed to help until I tried the steps listed above.  <comment257162> A search on Google reveals that some have had this issue with the Bark app or even with Growl.  Do you have one of these types of apps installed? <comment257173> As mentioned, Bark appears to be a potential culprit, according to Apple Support [forums](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/4281671?tstart=0). The `usernoted` high CPU usage has also been noted on the [Wunderlist](https://support.wunderlist.com/customer/portal/questions/14323412-high-cpu-usage) forums as a recent issue. Do you have Wunderlist installed on your Mac? <comment257196> I do have Growl, but not Bark or Wunderlist. And I haven't actually used Growl in months, so it hasn't been running.
