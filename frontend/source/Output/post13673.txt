Removed Spotlight, now there's a gap I can't get rid of <body> I disabled and removed spotlight from my menubar to save performance and space. Now except for saving some space, I have a gap in my menu-bar I'd like to get rid of:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4tYt0.png" alt="Screenshot of the gap"  Anyone an idea how to get it away?  <answer13674> Logging out and back in (or restarting your computer) will fix the problem, but you might be able to fix it simply by kbdCmd/kbd-dragging one of the icons next to it.  Holding kbdCmd/kbd will let you move emsome/em of the icons around, and I've found that sometimes, moving one will re-arrange the others to fill any gaps that may have appeared.  This will also help you put them in an order that you like best.  <answer13686> First, revert whatever you did to remove it. Then, run the following commands in Terminal.app:  precode$ sudo chmod 000 /System/Library/CoreServices/Search.bundle/ $ killall SystemUIServer /code/pre  (The code$/code only represents the prompt and should not be typed.)  What I get:br img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/07rtP.png" alt="Spotlight removed"  To get Spotlight back, enter the following commands:  precode$ sudo chmod 755 /System/Library/CoreServices/Search.bundle/ $ killall SystemUIServer /code/pre  <comment14530> Have you tried restarting? <comment14532> Log off and log back in. <comment14535> Restarting does not help. Therefore logging off and back in does not work either. <comment14536> Does not help :( <comment14541> @Nils What method did you use to remove the icon?  If you used a "hack-y" method, you may just have removed the icon resource and not told OS X to release the space that it reserves for it. <comment14584> This works! Awesome! Thank you :) <comment14588> You're welcome.  I forgot one thing: If you "repair permissions", it'll also revert this hack.
