Full screen application causes screen saver to not start (Lion) <body> When I am in a Full Screen application mode, the screen saver doesn't start. So I have to shift to another screen that doesn't show a full screen app. There the screen saver starts!  This naturally happens only in Lion.  <answer39404> A workaround would be to assign a Hot Corner to start the screen saver. To do this, go to codeSystem Preferences &gt; Desktop &amp; Screen Saver &gt; Screen Saver &gt; Hot Cornersâ€¦/code and select "Start Screen Saver" in the drop down menu of your choice.  (Side note: Hot Corners is also accessible from the Mission Control prefpane.)  <comment42029> is it a feature? <comment118861> lion is a buggy peace of work, a reinstall of the os will probably do the trick the easiest way, no need for a "factory restore" just a reinstall, also try enabling and disabling the screensaver settings
