Find which process receives a given keyboard command <body> I'm trying to figure out why a certain keyboard combination is no longer working.  As an example, Sublime Text 2 ships with a keyboard shortcut for opening the Find/Replace panel:  kbdCommand/kbd + kbdOption/kbd + kbdF/kbd  This combo worked fine until I did a clean install of OSX 10.8.5, after which it mysteriously stopped working in Sublime Text.   I know keyboard sequences can be captured by processes other than the frontmost (like by the OS) so I was wondering if there is a way of checking by which process a particular keyboard command was "consumed"?  <answer177058> I don't know any fast and efficient method to find the recipient of a shortcut. But here is a emreceipe/em to initiate the hunt:  ol liClose most of your running applications so as to improve the efficiency of the hunt./li liOpen a codeTerminal/code window, and run the following command:  precode/usr/bin/sudo opensnoop /code/pre  This command will track down every codeopen/code system call./li liSwitch to the context where your shortcut is intercepted by an unknown application and type kbd⌘ cmd/kbd+kbd⌥ option/kbd+kbdF/kbd.  Look for a culprit hint from the file names opened./li licodewhile/code unsuccessfull, add one application, and codeGOTO 3/code./li /ol  <answer177203> KeyCue provides visual feedback on the keyboard shortcuts.  It can be downloaded as a trial version.  KeyCue from Ergonis  I have it configured so that a double tap and hold on the Command key displays all the currently active shortcuts.  <comment122570> I would start with looking at System Preferences - Keyboard - Keyboard shortcuts. Try to add new shortcut there with `Cmd + Option + f`, if it has been associated with other action, you'll see a warning <comment122724> No warning when assigning Cmd + Option + f to Launchpad - works fine <comment209228> What model Mac are you running with what keyboard? I've often found that applications looking for non-standard keyboard shortcuts like to have the function key pressed too, though if this just stopped happening it's likely not your issue. <comment209566> Have you reset your [NVRAM](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204063), or your [SMC](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201295)? Any issues with your permissions? Resetting them via Disk Utility *might* work. Also, reinstalling the latest version of Sublime Text and/or OS X may work (last resort). <comment209567> While this very well might solve the specific problem with the shortcut in sublime, it holds little worth as an answer to the more general problem of locating which process consumed a given shortcut. <comment210352> I have the answer to your question : yes, you were wondering. <comment346426> After trying KeyCue, it looks to me like it only shows the keyboard shortcuts associated with menu commands for the current active application.  Additionally, it seems to show global hotkeys from Keybaord Maestro and maybe one or two other specific supported applications.  Does it show global hotkeys for _all_ applications for you? <comment346553> I find it somewhat mysterious as to what hotkeys are shown for 'other' apps.  I think it attempts (but doesn't fully succeed) to show global hotkeys that are relevant to where you are. The User Guide specifically refers to Keyboard Maestro.
