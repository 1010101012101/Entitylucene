Replace text with predefined value in browser <body> I used to have a tool on my PC that would allow me to prefill text when I enter certain "codes". For example, I would type $test123 and it would replace that text with a sentence that I had setup.  Is there a similar program on the Mac that also works in any browser?  <answer88874> I believe you are looking for TextExpander.   From their site:      Type more with less effort! TextExpander saves your fingers and your keyboard, expanding custom keyboard shortcuts into frequently-used text and pictures...   <answer88912> You can do this by setting each emreplacement/em word with it's value under strongSystem Preferences / Language &amp; Text./strong  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qcCUT.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  If after trying it out, it doesn't work, you may need to enable the text substitution feature. To do so just go strongEdit / Substitution / Text Replacement/strong or right click on a editable field for the emedition/em menu to show up:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/K3HyO.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  You could, though, enable the text substitution feature on every Application which supports it just by executing this command on strongTerminal/strong:  codedefaults write -g WebAutomaticTextReplacementEnabled -bool true/code  <comment104347> thanks. That works in mac apps like textedit but not in the chrome browser using gmail. <comment104348> that's it. A bit pricey at $35 ...
