Disable mini Calendar pull out in iOS 5 on iPad? <body> I've noticed after upgrading to iOS 5 that a little pull-out sheet for the Calendar app appears on finger swipe near the top edge when inside other apps. I already disabled multi-gestures but this still occurs. Is there way to turn this off? It's annoying when using full screen drawing apps for example.  <answer27957> I think you might be talking about the Notification Center. Does it look like the pictures in this iOS: Understanding Notifications page?  If so, go to Settings - Notifications - Calendar, and turn off 'Notification Centre'.  <comment32021> How do you reproduce that problem? I'm not altogether sure I understand what you mean. <comment32032> Go to any app and do a quick down swipe gesture along the top edge of the screen (around the midpoint). <comment32036> Yes! That's it. But strangely turning it off doesn't make the tab go away just the content inside it. <comment32037> On my iPad, which currently has no pending notifications, but I have one appointment for tomorrow morning, shows a Calendar entry, so this sounds spot-on. <comment32038> AFAIK there is now way to disable the entire notification centre. It'll show up when you do that downward motion whether it has pending notifications or not. <comment32039> Ok thanks, I guess there's no way to remove that. <comment32040> It's supposed to be one of the major new features of iOS 5, so maybe they weren't expecting people to want to turn it off! <comment32042> Maybe they will add it with the next update. I can see it being disruptive and prone to accidental interactions, especially when lending the device to a kid or something. <comment32044> why would u turn off by-far the most useful features of iOS 5 on an iPad? <comment32057> Like Clare said, it's one of the major new features, so I don't expect there will be a way to turn it off. I have noticed in some games however, that you need to swipe twice to get the panel. The first time, it just drops down a little tab. I think this to prevent accidental interactions, but I'm not sure if it's on purpose or just an odd bug.
