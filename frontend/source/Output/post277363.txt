Cannot connect to software update server <body> By some reason I cannot connect to the software update server. I'm receiving the following message when I try to fetch the updates:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/k8oBL.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Can you suggest how I can switch to the native Apple update server? I used to be assigned to the corporate one before, but it's no longer the case. Any chance to change it without bringing my laptop to the Apple store? The options suggested here didn't help. I keep receiving the same error. OS version: macOS Sierra 10.12  <comment349381> Any ideas how to solve the issue?
