Remove app suggestions made by iPhone <body> On a new iPhone 7, when I unlocked the screen it suggested I should add cards to my Wallet.  Can I turn off this kind of suggestions?  It feels like ads.  <comment332690> Have you already disabled `Wallet` access from the Home screen? <comment332775> I didn't.  I did now.  I thought the notification was an ad to promote the wallet app.  It seems it was just the wallet app that said "OK, I am active, but I have no card to work with". <comment332790> If that worked for you, I can add it as an Answer.   You can accept it and that will help others with the same issue. <comment332829> If you're not looking to disable all the suggestions - please edit the post or flag for reopening. Thanks! <comment332834> Thanks, that other posts gives all the answers I needed.
