How to launch apps that require Java on Mountain Lion with only Java 7 installed? <body> Just got a brand new MacBook Air which shipped with Mountain Lion 10.8.4 and no Java installed. There is a code/usr/bin/java/code, but running it would prompt me to install an Apple-distributed Java 6 runtime in a Cocoa dialog.  However, Oracle is no longer supporting Java 6, and I don't want to be running an unsupported and probably insecure Java installation.  So, I went to Oracle's Java SE downloads and installed the latest JDK, codejdk-7u25-macosx-x64/code. Now the only Java I have on this machine is 1.7.0_25, distributed by Oracle. code/usr/bin/java -version/code now works.  I just ran codebrew cask install eclipse/code, and ended up with Eclipse 4.3. When I first tried to run it, I got the same prompt to install a Java runtime as if I had no Java installed.  So I looked here on Apple StackExchange and found https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/58841/52440. After running codesudo ln -s /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.7.0_25.jdk /System/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/1.6.0.jdk/code, I'm now able to launch Eclipse.  However, when I try to launch other apps that require Java, such as code/usr/share/java/Tools/Java VisualVM.app/code and code/opt/homebrew-cask/Caskroom/webstorm/6.0.2a/WebStorm.app/code, I get an error that no compatible Java 1.6 is available (see below).  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0YNfN.png" alt="screenshot of error dialog"  Does anyone know if it's possible to get these other apps working, or do they really actually require Java 6 and can't work with Java 7?  <answer119148> The dialog is shown because Oracle's Java has only partial 'JVMCapabilities' set and advertises itself as command-line-only capable.  As a superuser (use 'sudo' if editing in Terminal), you should edit code/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk.1.7.[version-and-release].jdk/Contents/Info.plist/code and find the following key:  precode&lt;key&gt;JVMCapabilities&lt;/key&gt;   &lt;array&gt;     &lt;string&gt;CommandLine&lt;/string&gt;   &lt;/array&gt; /code/pre  and add it to include the missing values:  precode&lt;key&gt;JVMCapabilities&lt;/key&gt;   &lt;array&gt;     &lt;string&gt;CommandLine&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;string&gt;JNI&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;string&gt;BundledApp&lt;/string&gt;   &lt;/array&gt; /code/pre  After that, you have to either reboot, logout or codekillall Finder/code, what ever seems to work. (People have reported that restarting Finder was enough, but I had to log out.)  --br Source.  <comment138928> Don't link non Apple code to an Apple controlled place. For eclipse see other questions. Java Vuual VM I suspect is toed to the VM and as in an Apple area needs an Apple VM. <comment138942> Java 6 is still supported and Apple provide upgrades. Think of Java 6 and 7 as two separate languages and not an upgrade
