Soon, you'll see the Apple logo and spinning gear. This will force the Mac to boot into OS X on the recovery partition that was created when you installed OS X 10.7 or later./li liWhen booting is complete, you'll see a window of "OS X Utilities." You won't do anything there. Instead, you'll go to the Menu bar at the top and select Utilities  Terminal./li liIn the terminal window, type the following and press the Return key.  coderesetpassword/code/li liA new window will open and click on the volume of interest and select the desired user account in the popup.
