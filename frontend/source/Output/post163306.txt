Music stops during movie in Keynote <body> I've inserted music into the presentation and the song is 5 mins long. There are 21 slides. After exporting the presentation to a movie, and then playing the movie, the song stops playing at 41 seconds, at about the 4th slide. It doesn't matter if I move the slides arounds - the music always stops at 41 secs when saved as a movie.   When I am in Keynote the song continues throughout if I play the presentation from the start. I want the music to play in the movie through all the slides.  The music file is 5 mins long. It is set to play continuously per slide.  <answer163762> I just wanted to say that I have exactly the same problem. My music file is 2:10 and in the exported movie it always stops after 1:04... Maybe it's a bug? A possible workaround could be to add the audio file in imovie.   <comment191161> who long is the actual music file? did you set it to play continuously or per slide? <comment191176> The music file is 5 mins long. It is set to play continuously per slide. The movie automatically goes through about 4 slides and then the music stops. Any idea? <comment191190> Do U trying another music file? <comment191305> Thanks, lets get some details here: what version of Keynote, what version of QuickTime (assume you used GT to make the movie) <comment191776> Keynote version 6.5 (2110), 2014. QuickTime Player version 10.4 (833), 2014. This error makes no sense. What is going on? <comment191780> I'm trying....not sure how to combine this. <comment191785> I did more research and discovered that Keynote 6.5 has a bug that causes this problem. I may have resolved this by going to File  Advanced  Change File Type  Package. <comment191787> See above for possible fix.
