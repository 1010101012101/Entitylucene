App to use iMac as digital photo frame for photos on a network drive? <body> I'd like to use a spare iMac as a strongemdigital photo frame/em/strong to display my personal photos.  Desired features:  ul listrongTurn off screen/strong when the room is dark (or, worst case, turn off based on a timer -- would the Energy Saver schedule be sufficient for this?)/li liAccess photos from a strongshared network drive/strong (so it automatically gets new photos) -- this Mac will not actually contain a local copy of any of the pictures/li listrongRandomize/strong order of photos/li liIf possible, allow strongmultiple monitors/strong (with different photos on each)/li liDoesn't need any fancy animation effects -- I'd prefer it being more like a static picture that doesn't change that often, just like a traditional photo on the wall/li /ul  Are there any apps you'd recommend that can meet these needs (especially accessing photos from the shared network drive)?  <answer273241> Nobody volunteered a solution, so here's what I did...  ul listrongScreensaver:/strong I used the in-built screensaver, with a few changes (see below)/li liThe strongDefault duration/strong of the slide show was too quick (3 seconds), so I used OS X Mavericks screensaver changes pictures too quickly: How do I slow it down? to fix it. Note the special codecsrutil/code instructions since Yosemite./li listrongNetwork drive:/strong I mounted a network drive, then changed the strongLogin Options/strong to permanently mount it. See: How to Automatically Connect to a Network Drive at Login in OS X/li listrongOn/Off control:/strong I used the Energy Saver control panel to Wake &amp; Sleep the machine at set times. Not as good as sensing light/motion, but it will do for now./li /ul
