MacOS 10.10 on 4 GB memory bloat: which launch daemons/agents/services can I disable? And how to discover the names of the culprits? <body> I recently did a Yosemite (10.10) clean install on my 4 GB 2010 MBP, but it now has so much memory bloat due to unnecessary launch daemons/agents /services that it causes frequent beachballing; excessive memory pressure.   This is strongnot a duplicate/strong; I did research manpage/docs on launchctl, launchd, Yosemite/Sierra whatsnew guides, AskDifferent, SO, Apple.com, many Mac enthusiast blogs/forums and many other sites for over a month now; see comments below for examples of the many Google keywords searches I tried; also, the answer is very MacOS-version-specific. This is driving me nuts.  strongI'm looking for a minimal configuration: no crap like iCloud, iTunes etc./strong Just the absolute minimum set needed to run the OS. Clearly stuff like 'CloudPhotosConfiguration' is unnecessary bloat. (For reasons we will not go into here it doesn't make much economical sense to upgrade 8 GB RAM + SSD).   strongThe question:/strong  ol liHow do I find out which launch daemons/agents/services I can safely disable on my mid-2010 MBP with 4 GB running Yosemite 10.10?/li liWhat are the exact service names? (I can't get any sensible output out of codelaunchctl blame/code)/li liWhat is the precise syntax to disable them? codelaunchctl disable &lt;servicename&gt;/code doesn't work if you don't know the servicename, and I can't discover them, despite spending time on it. After having read the manpage for launchctl repeatedly daily for a month now. Also, in 10.10 codelaunchctl disable/code changed to something else. Do I go for the launch service, agent, daemon or some unholy combination of the above? I repeat that it is near-impossible to discover service names, or which daemons are causing the pressure./li /ol  Below is a dump of some which codelaunchctl/code shows had Status -44 (killed due to inadequate memory). Based on reading blogs some are notorious (e.g. com.apple.bird), some are believed to be unnecessary, some cannot safely be stopped.  precodeclear; launchctl list | awk '($2 == "-44") { print $3 }' | sed -e 's/com.apple.//g' | sort -f        com.apple. accountsd, AirPlayUIAgent, bird, CalendarAgent, CallHistoryPluginHelper, CallHistorySyncHelper, cfprefsd.xpc.agent, cloudd, CloudPhotosConfiguration, cloudphotosd, coreservices.appleid.authentication, coreservices.uiagent, DataDetectorsDynamicData, icloud.fmfd, iconservices.iconservicesagent, imdpersistence.IMDPersistenceAgent, InputMethodKit.UserDictionary, internetaccounts, MailServiceAgent, Maps.mapspushd, nsurlsessiond, nsurlstoraged, pbs, photolibraryd, pluginkit.pkd, printtool.agent, recentsd, secd, secinitd, security.cloudkeychainproxy3, soagent, spindump_agent, tccd, telephonyutilities.callservicesd /code/pre  <comment374450> I did find [Disable bunch of #$!@ in Sierra (10.11)](https://gist.github.com/pwnsdx/d87b034c4c0210b988040ad2f85a68d3) but a) that's 10.11 b) I want people here to 'teach me how to fish', i.e. how to use system commands to discover the root-cause of the memory pressure, instead of blindly taking some guy's list. <comment374451> Sierra is still 10.12! ;-) <comment374457> @Allan: unhelpful comment, and you didn't read the question. I read the manpage for launchctl a month ago, and have been reading it repeatedly daily. a) `launchctl disable servicename` doesn't work if you don't know the servicename, and I can't discover them, despite spending time on it. b) The question is: **How to identify** which of  my (212) LaunchAgents, (261) LaunchDaemon and launch services to disable? If the answer is "Tough, MacOS deliberately obscures this from the user, don't waste your time", then say so. But please address the actual question, don't dismiss it with a one-liner. <comment374461> Your command doesn't fetch -44 events exclusively but also any pid containing 44. The list is ehhmm useless... Please add a screenshot of Activity Monitor  Memory  sorted by Memory or Real Memory. Here a fresh 10.10 with some additional apps (e.g. Apple Server) occupies 1.4 GB/very low memory pressure <comment374462> IMO you are not the target market for the OS and you will spend a lot of time on this. Why not go with Linux on a PC? What do you need a Mac for if this is what you want? <comment374466> @klanomath: I already fixed the awk syntax and now the list is only of Status -44 command. Harv: I simply want to breathe 6-12mos more life into my creaky old MBP, this is doable. There's no point attacking the premise. Other Mac users have figured out which services are unnecessary on various versions, so why not address the question? <comment374468> @Allan: I read a) apple.com b) AskDifferent (+SO) on launchctl, Yosemite, sierra, "launch daemon", "launch agent", "memory-pressure", et al c) I read launchctl manpage on disable and blame plenty, and did try to form service names, unsuccessfully. d) a ton of blogs and support-sites turned up by Google for any of 50 obvious phrases such as "Yosemite memory pressure", "Prevent beachballing on 10.10", "How to disable launch daemons/ agents/ services on MacOS", "Useless launch agents in Sierra", "Why is my my MBP slow?" + many many other phrases. <comment374469> @Allan: *"Sorry, but I am not there to look over your shoulder"* is incredibly abrasive and inappropriate, and also a pure strawman. Noone asked you to look over my shoulder. Clearly since I have 10k rep on SO I'm competent at researching questions, asking, tagging. Please be civil. <comment374472> @Allan, you had every way of knowing what I read, based on what any user with a 10K SO rep and demonstrated 8-year SO history of asking, reviewing and tagging questions might reasonably be expected to read, and you already knew I spent a month researching this. If you still couldn't infer what I searched for, you could simply politely have asked "Tell us what sites and search-terms you used? You might have missed something". Clearly the (totally unnecessary) laundry-list I gave of what I read/searched for proves I did my homework. Hence your reaction was based on a wrong assumption. <comment374473> Hmmmm....should I assume you did or didn't read the link I posted?  Then again...someone with 10K rep is obviously out of my league.  I hope you find your solution. Good day! <comment374474> @Allan: of course I ran `launchctl blame gui/501/com.apple.Spotlight` 44 min ago when you posted it. All it outputs is "ipc (mach)". I don't see that that tells me much. <comment374475> That *was* your question; it also gave you the syntax.  I just *assumed* that's what you wanted since that's what you asked for. Oh well....like I said...10K rep. and all... you're just out of my league.  Good luck.
