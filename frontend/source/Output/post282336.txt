Speech announcements only once <body> I am using macOS Sierra and I have enabled Announcing the alerts when they are displayed. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gvIwF.png" alt="enter image description here" It is pretty useful for when I am not sitting by my computer. Unfortunately macOS is reading them not just when they appear for the first time, but every time.  Is it possible to limit macOS to read these only once?  <comment364587> Could you elaborate a little on "only once" - would you want to only hear one type of announcement once, or that it only announces when the screen is dark or some other way the computer would know you are not physically close or looking at the screen?
