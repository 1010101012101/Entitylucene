How I prevent OSX from freezing when an application crashes? <body> I am a developer, using a MacMini, so beside apps crashing for my own coding mistakes, apps crashing for other reasons also happen, including running out of resources sometimes (CPU or RAM).  Today I had a particularly nasty behaviour, when a game I am making crashed, several system-related processes ate 100% of my CPU (when they were all summed).  One of them, "powerd" required me to kill it, since it was alone using 50% of CPU.  Then during my debug session (that required the app to crash again), I noticed it would spawn a "crash reporter" that would hog the machine resources for several minutes, heavily slowing it down.  So what settings I can change to prevent OSX from freezing when an application crashes?  <comment329874> Can you make the system crash at will?
