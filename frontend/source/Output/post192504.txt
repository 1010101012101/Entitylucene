Upgraded from Mavericks 10.9.5 to Yosemite 10.10.3. Permissions are all messed up <body> If I try to move things to external hard drives I am asked for my admin password.  If I try to move things in or out of the Applications folder I am asked for my password. I am asked for my password for a lot of things I wasn't previously asked for. It's starting to get frustrating that I have to type it in ALL THE TIME. Is this normal for Yosemite?    No matter what permissions I change in a folder it's still asking me for my admin password to move files. What am I doing wrong?  <answer192529> h1Permissions and what to do/h1  Sometimes, permissions can get messed up. The system get's confused on who has access to what which has many side-effects. I know of a few ways of tackling this problem.   h2Repairing Disk Permissions/h2  This uses code.bom/code files to repair permissions. code.bom/code files, or "Bill of Materials", and are used as installation files:     BOM files contain information used to determine which files to install, update, or remove during a software update; contains files that have been installed; may include Unix  permissions, owner and group data, file size, last modified date, and a checksum for each file        When you repair permissions, your Mac looks at the .bom files here and checks the actual files on your system. If a file or folder on your system has permissions that don’t match the permissions specified in the .bom files, your Mac will change the permissions to match those in the .bom files.   ol liOpen strongDisk Utility/strong.

You need to repair your Home Directory Permissions.     This tool doesn’t use .bom files to adjust system file permissions, it just repairs a user account’s home directory to the standard, default permissions.   ol listrongSave/strong all data and strongclose/strong all applications./li listrongShutdown/strong your computer/li /ol  Now you need to enter strong"OS X Recovery Mode"/strong  ol start="3" liTurn on your Mac while holding kbd⌘ + R/kbd.

That could just be it. Try creating a new account and testing if the problem still occurs, if it doesn't then you've narrowed it down to your account. I'm going to link this thread, which goes over fixing a keychain, to avoid making this question to long emI've been spending almost half an hour writing this/em. In Keychain Access, you may just have to unlock your keychain, leave it like that and see if the problem continues.  h1Further Troubleshooting/h1  If you're here, you're running out of options em(as far as I know)/em. A few tools / Applications I've seen help people:  ul liBatchMod changes file permissions /li liCocktail, source./li /ul  h1If all else fails (A LAST RESORT),/h1  If everything else fails, but you've narrowed down the problem to your user, you can try this. In System Preferences, create a new user account just the same as yours. Then, you can delete your current account and set the home directory of the new account to the one of your old one. How to change your home directory. I've only had to do this once but it should get rid of the issue. Obviously this should be a last resort option and isn't perfect.  Hope that helps :) I've dealt with emvery/em similar problems when upgrading and usually after doing these, the problem disappears.  <comment229097> BatchMod (in contrast to Disk Utility) doesn't really repair file permissions (in the sense that the app changes them to correct values based on a database etc.) . It just changes it and the user has to know what the correct permissions ought to be. I modified that in your answer. <comment229099> @klanomath ahh, okay. I read somewhere about BatchMod being used to reset file permissions to default so I guess I misinterpreted that :p
