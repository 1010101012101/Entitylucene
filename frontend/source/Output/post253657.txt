`say` work in 10.11? <body> I have used codesay/code in the past for text-to-speech from the terminal, but I've just tried it and it seems to never speak (nor end the process?).  precode$ say "hello" (still running, no output) /code/pre  Does anyone know if it has an issue in 10.11.5 or something?  <comment315688> Works fine for me in OS X 10.11.5. In another Terminal window run the following command, `kill $(pgrep say)` and then quit Terminal and reopen it and try the `say "hello"` command again. Does it work now? <comment315690> Are you running `/usr/bin/say`? <comment315707> @techraf, what other `say` is there? <comment315710> Possibly the one that's not working for you. Do you want others to help you or do you just feel a need for an empty discussion? <comment316512> @user3439894: there's no `say` running (pgrep has not output) and naturally just running it again still just hangs  @ techraf: It is /usr/bin/say
