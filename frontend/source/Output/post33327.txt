Lion: Task switcher icons are badly discolored <body> when I press command-Tab to get the task switcher icons, to let me change the foreground program, I am seeing that after a little while, the icons are badly miscolored. Anybody else seeing this bug? Thanks.  <answer33352> Yes, I'm seeing the same problem on occasion. For me it happens mostly often when I connect an external display - the switcher looks as though it's underneath a semi-transparent black overlay. Restarting Dock.app (which runs the application switcher, as far as I know) doesn't help, but rebooting the laptop with the external display still attached does.  I've reported the issue to Apple (using their bug reporter) and have been informed that it's a known issue. Hopefully there will be a fix soon.  <comment38028> Does this happen after running any particular apps? Think about any graphics-heavy apps you might be running, such as photo editing apps or games. <comment38049> could you add a screen shot for records?
