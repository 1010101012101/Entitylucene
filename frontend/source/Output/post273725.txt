Do not disturb mode - but allow certain apps <body> I want to turn on do not disturb mode on my iPhone. But we use a pager application for work, and I want that application to still be able to notify me and make noises.  How do I do that? I can only figure out how to allow contacts to not be in do not disturb mode.  <answer273749> If the device is jailbroken, you can use Banner Sounds to allow certain notifications which match filters you configure the ability to bypass Do Not Disturb.  <answer277262> Unfortunately, you cannot (on a non-jailbroken device).  There is currently no iPhone feature available to exempt a specific application from either Silent or Do Not Disturb mode.  <comment374006> +1 - this would be a very useful whitelist for some people
