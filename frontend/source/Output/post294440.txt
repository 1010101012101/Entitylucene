Apple TV lag and connecting to Time Capsule <body> I have a 3rd gen Apple TV that I connect to my Mac, but I have issues with Airplay Display, namely that videos I try to stream from my Mac lag terribly.   I recently obtained a Time Capsule which I use as a router, but I would like to know if I can somehow connect it to my Apple TV, i.e. play videos stored on the Time Capsule hard disk.  I was also told that connecting my Apple TV to Time Capsule would improve the streaming speed and resolve the lag problem.  <answer294441> Hardwiring the apple tv to the TC does refuce the lag cr wifi, but won't change any download lag.  Have mine hardwired and no issues...  <comment371641> How do I hardwire it? Just plug it to the back of the TC? <comment371642> Use the networking sockets that both have. If you have other devices next the apple tv then get a small router box.
