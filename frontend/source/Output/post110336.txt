Launchd won't load plists at boot <body> I have a set of scripts that need to run on system boot and stay alive. I have the plist saved as /Library/LaunchAgents/net.vps.tunnel.plist and it has the proper permissions:  precode-rw-r--r--  1 root  wheel  516 Nov  6 22:03 net.vps.tunnel.plist /code/pre  The script is stored in the root code/Library/LaunchAgents/code, NOT the user code~/Library/LaunchAgents/code directory, so it's supposed to run on boot as the superuser. If I manually run the script via codesudo launchctl load /Library/LaunchAgents/net.vps.tunnel.plist/code it runs fine. But despite the fact that it is supposed to run on boot, it doesn't. When I check codelaunchctl list/code immediately after boot, I see that it has not been loaded. Trying to start via codesudo launchctl start net.vps.tunnel/code fails with the error "launchctl start error: No such process".  If I log in via the GUI, suddenly launchd loads all of the scripts. However, they run with my user permissions and some of them do not work properly. In the plists, I have specified the UserName key as a daemon user, but they all run under my user credentials.  Here's the plist file in question, located at /Library/LaunchAgents/net.vps.tunnel.plist and with -rw-r--r-- permissions for root:wheel:  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt; &lt;!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC -//Apple Computer//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd &gt; &lt;plist version="1.0"&gt; &lt;dict&gt;         &lt;key&gt;Label&lt;/key&gt;                 &lt;string&gt;net.vps.tunnel&lt;/string&gt;         &lt;key&gt;ProgramArguments&lt;/key&gt;                 &lt;array&gt;                         &lt;string&gt;/Users/_tunnel/tunnel.sh&lt;/string&gt;                 &lt;/array&gt;         &lt;key&gt;RunAtLoad&lt;/key&gt;                 &lt;true/&gt;         &lt;key&gt;WorkingDirectory&lt;/key&gt;                 &lt;string&gt;/Users/_tunnel&lt;/string&gt;         &lt;key&gt;UserName&lt;/key&gt;                 &lt;string&gt;_tunnel&lt;/string&gt;         &lt;key&gt;KeepAlive&lt;/key&gt;                 &lt;true/&gt; &lt;/dict&gt; &lt;/plist&gt; /code/pre  And here's the tunnel script, with permissions -rwxr-x--- for _tunnel:_tunnel:  precode#/bin/bash  logger "Opening VPS tunnel..."  ssh -i ./.ssh/id_rsa -gnN tunnel@********.com &amp; PID=$! logger "VPS tunnel is now open."  wait $PID logger "VPS tunnel is now closed." exit 0 /code/pre  <answer110339> Try moving the plist to /Library/LaunchDaemons/. Agents (other than pre-login agents) are run only after a user logs in and they are owned by the user. Also the UserName key has no effect for agents.
