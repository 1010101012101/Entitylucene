Daisy-chain two pre-thunderbolt Cinema displays? <body> I have a new thunderbolt equipped MacBook Pro at work (non-retina) and two older, pre-thunderbolt Cinema displays (mini-display cords).  Obviously, daisy chaining the new thunderbolt displays is a breeze, but is there any way to run two of the older pre-thunderbolt / mini display Cinema monitors off the single thunderbolt port on the 2012 MB Pros?  <comment105140> So you want a thunderbolt hub that somehow emulates a virtual screen that will get split up to the two attached monitors? <comment105145> Yes.  If I'd gotten the retina MBP with two thunderbolt ports, I could run both Cinema displays no problem.  I basically just need a thunderbolt hub with one thunderbolt in and two thunderbolt / minidisplay out... Something that looks like:  Atlona 1x4 Mini DisplayPort <comment105147> The problem is that the hub needs to present as a single screen since thunderbolt embeds one DP stream instead of TB data so your one port won't handle two DP streams directly. You might just need a cheap USB display driver and run a [DVI-MiniDP converter. (They run about $200 a pop).](http://www.gefen.com/gefentv/gtvproduct.jsp?prod_id=9898#buy) <comment105149> I am absolutely fine with one screen stretched over the two monitors - presumably I can just resize the application windows?  And there aren't going to be any performance issues, correct?
