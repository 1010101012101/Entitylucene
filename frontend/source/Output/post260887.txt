why does auto-mount of afp:// shares ask for login credentials? <body> My users login to their Macs using Active Directory usernames and passwords.  The Macs are bound to the Active Directory.  I put some codesmb:///code shares in codeLogin Items/code so that the network shares would be loaded automatically at login, and it worked great.  The users have permissions to this shares via their Active Directory credentials, so the shares appeared and were authenticated without any extra work from the users, as it simply used their session credentials.  I changed those emexact same shares/em to codeafp:///code shares and now every time they login, OS X (El Capitan) asks for their credentials to connect to the codeafp:///code shares.  They enter the very same credentials they used to login, and the shares load just fine.  Why is OS X not using the session credentials to login to the codeafp:///code shares as it does for the codesmb:///code shares?  How can I fix this?  I have one clue, but I'm not sure if it means anything.  When the authentication window pops up for the codeafp:///code shares asking for username and password, the Username is already prepopulated, but with the user's full name instead of their actual username.  In other words, my usernames are something like codefirstname-lastname/code and this is what they use both to login and to successfully authenticate the shares, but when the codeafp:///code share authentication window pops up, it is prepopulated with codeFirstname Lastname/code, which won't work until they change it to codefirstname-lastname/code.  Is it possible that OS X is trying to login with the user's full name for codeafp:///code shares?    I tried setting the codeLogin Item/code to codeafp://%short_name%@server.domain.com/code in an attempt to force the use of the username, but it didn't seem to make any difference.  Anyone know how to fix this?
