I wonder what is happening to my mail client as it is roaring my CPU quite seriously.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/tn7jN.png" alt="Mac Mail App"  <comment243166> If your email provider has a web interface, try halting the process and accessing from the web to see if the problem may be on the server side.  What version of OS X are you running? <comment243175> It is also possible that a spammer hacked your email account. Check with your email account provider's technical support and change your password.
