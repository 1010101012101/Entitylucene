Does iTunes put my iTunes account information in track files when I import CD albums? <body> Does iTunes put my iTunes account information in track files when I import CD albums?

This does not apply to tracks matched via iTunes Match and emreplaced/em by the AAC version from the store. These tracks strongdo/strong contain your Apple ID
