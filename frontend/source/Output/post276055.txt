Can't use Wi-Fi and LAN at the same time <body> I have a macbook and a belkin USB-C to Ethernet Adapter. I would like to use Wi-Fi to access the internet, and the LAN cable to connect to a local network. But it doesn't work. Whenever I plug in the LAN cable, I can't access the internet anymore, and no Wi-Fi networks are found. Why is that?  I set the LAN configuration manually: IP address: 10.0.4.7 netmask: 255.255.255.0 The router field is empty. I tried changing the network priorities, this doesn't seem to have an effect.  <answer278871> You can change the priority for Wi-Fi over LAN connection. By default machines have LAN connection at top priority. You choose Wi-Fi at top and try again.  Step to change the priority of connection;  ol liGo to strongSystem Preference - Network/strong, in network section at left-below side you have three icons +,-,(icon for setting). /li liClick on setting icon and you will get multiple option./li liSelect "Set Service Order..."/li liThen you will be prompt to a new window with all network option./li liSelect Wi-Fi and drag it to top./li /ol  It should help you to get your internet connection back. Please let me know if it works.  <comment347355> It should still be under apple warranty if you wanted to take it to an Apple Store I think.  I have heard a lot of issues like these on the newer macs.
