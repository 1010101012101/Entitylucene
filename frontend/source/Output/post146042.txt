Cannot install anything using iPad App Store <body> I currently have a problem with the App Store on my iPad. The problem is that whenever I click on "Free" and "Install", nor is the app installed, nor does the window appear which should ask for my password. It simply returns to the screen with the "Free" button. First I thought that my disk is full, but even after deleting files I cannot install anything.  <comment172081> Apple servers are overcrowded currently due to the new iOS 8 and iPhone 6 activity. Simply be patient or try other time of the day. <comment172233> Ok, haven't thought of that :)
