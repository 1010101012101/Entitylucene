Is the Verizon iPhone 5 (unlocked) compatible with Rogers? <body> Would I get LTE from a Verizon iPhone 5 on Rogers?  According to Apple's LTE page I won't be getting LTE?  <answer65552> No, the LTE bands used by Rogers are different than those supported by the Verizon iPhone 5. You will be able to get 3G and voice access, but not LTE.  <answer65553> Yes, that's correct, Verizon's iPhone 5 won't work on the Rogers LTE network.  According to Rogers' iPhone 5 page, the specs include:     LTE Bands:700/1700   In the Apple iPhone 5 page you've quoted, you need to get model strongA1428/strong which supports LTE Band 17 (700 MHz). Rogers is explicitly listed there as one of the supported LTE networks. If you want to get an unlocked Verizon iPhone 5 (model strongA1429 CDMA/strong), you won't be able to use LTE on the Rogers network. You'd be better off getting the unlocked AT&amp;T version.
