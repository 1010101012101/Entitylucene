Heavy MySQL usage causes Dock process to freeze system <body> This problem has been aggravating me for several months, and I've gathered a lot of information about it, but I can't find the solution.  I'm running XAMPP 1.8.2 on Mountain Lion, and I'm running a PHP/MySQL server application called Copra.  Every time iPad clients access Copra, my system freezes.  Here are the symptoms:  ul liDock uses 100% CPU/li liall Dock-related things are frozen (Notification Center, Expose, Mission Control, Cmd-Tab, etc.)/li li~/Library/Application Support/Dock/*.db is written to constantly (several times per second)/li liXAMPP GUI shows red dot for MySQL status, even though it's still running/li /ul  The below solution works 100% of the time, but the problem comes right back next time Copra is accessed.  The Copra developers haven't been able to reproduce it.  precodesudo /Applications/XAMPP/xamppfiles/xampp stopmysql killall -9 com.apple.dock.extra killall -9 Dock sudo /Applications/XAMPP/xamppfiles/xampp startmysql /code/pre  Here's what I've already tried: new OS user account, delete all SQL databases and reinstall Copra, upgrade XAMPP from 1.7.3 to 1.8.2, upgrade ML 10.8.4 to 10.8.5, delete Dock db file (it comes right back), chmod 777 the Dock db file, delete com.apple.desktop.plist, delete com.apple.dock.plist, deactivate spotlight  This is killing me.  I don't know what else to do, or how to pinpoint the problem further.  <comment148096> Upgrading to Mavericks fixed the problem.  But now on a clean Mountain Lion installation, I get the same problem.  Haven't found a solution.
