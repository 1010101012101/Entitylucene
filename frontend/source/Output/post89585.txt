Background VoIP/ SIP apps and ongoing Phone.app call <body> On iOS 6+ specifically iPhone if you are in a call using Phone.app and have Skype.app running in the background should you be notified of any Skype incoming calls and have the option of terminating the Phone.app call for the Skype.app call?  <comment105316> This is actually a really interesting question and would love to see how iOS behaves. I suspect the skype ringer will just be 'ignored'. I would look into it myself but unfortunately, I don't use any voip services.
