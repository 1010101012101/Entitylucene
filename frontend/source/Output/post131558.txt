How do I create a new playlist when all the options are greyed out? <body> I'm running iTunes 11.1.5 under Mavericks 10.9.2. Because I have a very large music collection I keep it on an external drive. I have six recorded lectures I'd like to sync with my iPad. How do I create a new playlist based on the recordings on the external drive. I know it can be done because I've done it before years ago but have forgotten how.  Yes, I too wish iTunes were more coherent and less convoluted.  <comment154579> It isn't clear to me which options are greyed out based on the question. Are you talking about `File  New...  Playlist`? <comment154595> Yes, exactly that. File  Playlist; File  Playlist from Selection; File  Smart Playlist…; File  Playlist Folder. All four of them are in grey and are currently not selectable. <comment154596> Yes, exactly that. File  Playlist; File  Playlist from Selection; File  Smart Playlist…; File  Playlist Folder. All four of them are in grey and are currently not selectable. My purpose is to create a new playlist with the six new lectures. Then mark this new playlist for syncing. Then initiate syncing of marked playlists to my iPad. <comment154598> are they greyed out in the menu that appears when you click the + in the bottom left corner of iTunes?
