Can my iPhone tell me where I have recently been walking? <body> I sometimes get very fuzzy short-term memory after a neurological event. When it happens, I'm told I often leave and take a walk. I want to use my iPhone to figure-out where I end-up walking when this happens.   I know this happened today. The strongrecent calls/strong log reveals emwhen/em I placed  calls and emwho/em I called while this was happening. But, I sure want to know strongthe route/strong I walked outside. At least, could I see where the calls were placed?  I was running once with a run tracking app when I had this memory issue, and that gps tracker of course showed where I walked. But, since this app chews-up battery life tremendously, I can't leave it always on in the background. Maybe can anyone recommend a very low battery consuming app that I can always have running that records my gps coordinates?  <answer283083> h2Option 1 - Google Maps Location History/h2  One of the easiest solutions for background location tracking that takes very low amount of energy. Download Google Maps and Enable "Location History".  strongHow to Enable Google Maps Location History/strong  ol liOpen Google Maps /li liTap Menu and then Settings/li liClick Personal content and then scroll down to "Location settings"/li liClick to Turn "Location Services is on." /li liSet Location Services is set to Always with iOS Settings./li /ol  You can later view your visited locations at google.com/maps/timeline or on Google Maps "Timeline" tab.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Qfalo.png" alt="enter image description here"  h2Option 2 - Apple Frequent Location History/h2  iOS has a feature called frequent locations built it's system. Apple provides you with lesser location history and detail. To access the information:  strongGo to the "Settings"  Privacy  Location Services  System Services  Frequent Locations./strong  You will find some of the frequent locations you have visited if it's already been turned ON.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5eBMp.png" alt="enter image description here"  h2Option 3/h2  As mentioned by Owlsnipes in the comment, Moves(acquired by Facebook) is an activity tracker which runs in the background which can record all the movements and classify it as running,walking and driving. It's a pretty neat app and I've used it myself in the past.  <comment356853> Life360 I think would work, maybe Google Maps's Timeline Feature too. Then there are activity trackers like Moves you could try. <comment358580> Just wanted to mention Google Maps "Timeline" is working-out just great. Sharing the login credentials also lets others see my locations. And, the battery consumption is not detectable. great solution.
