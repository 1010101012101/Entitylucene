How do I keep my MBP's screen on? <body> I have an early 2011 MBP running Lion. Is there a way to let screen not switch off  i.e, a keep screen on software? I heard several recommendations of a application named coffee for Mac but I can't find it anywhere.  <answer29267> As the commenter said, Caffeine is what you want.  <answer29357> h3Disable display sleep and screen saver in System Preferences/h3  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/eG7Vf.png" alt=""  hr  h3Caffeine/h3  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yJkkj.png" alt=""  <comment33601> I think you want [Caffeine](http://lightheadsw.com/caffeine/), not Coffee. <comment33603> hey that's right, thank you very much, I am not sure now what to do with this post, can you post it as answer and I will mark it , or should I just delete this post. <comment33688> most brilliant app ever!
