Repeated Kernel Panic <body> Can anyone decipher this, I've been having repeated Kernel Panics for a few months now. I spent the weekend wiping my drive and reinstalling the OS and upgrading to Sierra. Not 20 minutes after everything was completely reinstalled, I experienced another Kernel Panic and then again a 1/2 hr later. Here's the log:  precodenonymous UUID:       CE7C1640-C1E9-1D90-3416-FC8D0D0A8F87   Sun Nov  6 18:58:16 2016  *** Panic Report *** panic(cpu 0 caller 0xffffff80238065ea): Kernel trap at

Pro and it runs 16gb easily and I'm pretty sure you can even put in 32. I think you have malware on your computer. Your darwin kernel version is 16.1.0 but dated Oct 19. I'm pretty sure the authentic 16.1.0 is dated Oct 13.   Also a number of those kext are likely malware and linked to a mach rootkit. Your system would prevent from loading in safe mode. You can boot into single user verbose minimum boot and if you look closely at the output that probably will be pushed off screen quickly to see it block them.   You can do this by:  - entering recovery mode (command R at startup)  - opening the terminal  - emnvram -p/em (to see your nvram configuration)  - emnvram -c/em (to purge the nvram configuration)  - emnvram boot-args="-x -s -v debug=0x14e cpus=1 -no-zp=1"/em (to get your computer to boot into single verbose safe boot on one cpu in debug)  - emreboot/em  - read the output from single user-I use my iphone camera on slow    motion to get what it says since it all disapears really quickly. You    can try taking of the cpus=1 or changing to a different cpus 0-3 or    0-7 depending if your processor is quad (8 total for quad, 4 for    dual)  - when you're done with all that emnvram -c/em again to reset    boot-args/nvram   - emreboot/em  Also I would check the volumes you have mounted with emdiskutil list/em if you see 15-18 you need to run emhdiutil imageinfo -debug/em to check if they're being saved as ramfiles (definitely malware related) the image path will look like ramfile:///[####] or ram:///[####]. I don't think you'll have that issue though on that computer   As for removing anything I'm not sure where this thing has a foothold but it's a pain to remove and Apple's solution has just been to give the person a new computer if the computer still has applecare in the cases I've heard others talking about. I think it's messes with the EFI in some way making it nearly impossible to actually delete and reinstalling the OS from recovery mode will show an 'unknown' process which starts doing all the questionable stuff in the installer log. Apple has been less than useful and this stuff goes over AppleCare call center reps' heads (there's thousands and thousands of them probably averaging 4 months on the job with almost no actual expertise and many don't even own a Mac).  <comment325740> I thought the max amount of RAM this type of MBP could take was 8GB.  It looks like you have 16GB installed, is that correct?  Also, are you backing up to a NAS or other external drive? <comment325744> I do have 16gb of RAM installed and I have for the better part of the last 4 years. The problems I've been experiencing have really only come about  in the last 4-5 months. During this specific panic, I had a USB hard drive connected restoring my files I backed up. Though it's not been connected during previous panics. <comment325746> I've read about panic reports with info similar to yours in 2 situations, 1) RAM exceeding Apple's max limits, and 2) doing a backup or restore from a NAS or external drive.  Your issue can be either of those, a combination, or neither of those :-).  Maybe someone else can spot something different in the panic. <comment325748> Have you tried running [Apple Hardware Test (AHT)](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201257)?  Hold the D key while booting from a powered off state with the AC adapter connected.   You also mentioned that it started happening after everything was reinstalled.  This could indicate a problem with software.  Try doing a clean install and reinstalling apps over a period of time.  See if you can correlate an app installation to a kernel panic. <comment325749> Sorry, I might not have been clear. I have not tried the hardware test but I will do that here momentarily. It started about 4-5 months ago seemingly out of the blue. This past weekend I finally got around to a clean install and it happened shortly there after again and twice in pretty quick succession. Gonna give the hardware test a go. <comment325759> @Allan so i did the Apple Hardware Test. The 1st scan came back okay. Then I tried the more extensive scan and the computer completely locked up about 20 minutes in. I let be for about 30 minutes with no change. Not sure if that says anything about what the issue might be. <comment325761> Try removing a stick of memory and give it a go.  Then swap memory sticks and try again.  If it locks up both times, you are looking at a logic board issue and you need to have it serviced.  If it works on one but not the other, it's a memory issue <comment325762> @allan I'll give that a try. Thanks Allan. <comment325778> So after pulling one of the ram sticks. It crashed again and gave me the typical "your computer as restarted because of an error" gray screen. However it didn't log a kernel panic. I'm going to remove that stick of ram and put the other in. But seems strange it didn't log anything.
