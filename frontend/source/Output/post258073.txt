Unable to set live wallpaper in iOS 10 <body> On iOS 10, when you go to select a wallpaper, you can select live photos. Then on the preview screen, there is a segmented control that allows you to choose from:  ul listill/li liperspective/li lilive/li /ul  However, "still" is preselected and I can't tap on perspective or live. Tapping on the segmented control animates the live photo but it doesn't select what you are tapping. I have an iPhone 7 running iOS 10.0.3.  Is this due to some other setting or is it a really nasty bug? Force-quitting settings didn't help.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pY4w6.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer258078> Do you by any chance have Low Power Mode on?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KtAZG.png" width="375"     Dynamic wallpaper and Perspective Zoom are disabled when Low Power Mode is on.   Go to Settings  Battery and disable Low Power  Mode to be able to select a Live Wallpaper and use the Live Photo or Perspective settings.  <comment322666> That was it! Thanks!
