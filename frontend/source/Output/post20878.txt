Where to put the .vimrc file for sudo in OS X Lion? <body> I always put a .vimrc in my home folder for turning code:syntax on/code. But in OS X Lion it seems that codesudo vi foo.txt/code ignore or can't find this vim configuration anymore.  Has anyone experiences the same thing?  <answer21034> Try doing strongsudo visudo/strong and making sure that this lines appears somewhere in there:  precodeDefaults  env_keep += "HOME" /code/pre  This should maintain the strongHOME/strong directory and strong~/strong should would as it did in Snow Leopard.  <answer21039> Try using codevim/code instead of vi.  Sometimes the default for "vi" is compatibility mode.  Not sure if this is the case with Lion, however.  <answer21066> I usually have use the same .vimrc and .vim folders as my main users and link them to a safe backupped place on Dropbox - wich btw is awesome for this kind of task.  The location of the home folder for your su is code/var/root/code. Therefore .vimrc and the .vim folder belong there.  <comment23108> Thanks, good idea! :) Would like to mark your answer as correct, too. <comment23110> Works great! Thank you.
