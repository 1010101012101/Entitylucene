How to retrieve a PDF file from an iOS device? <body> Given two Macs running Yosemite and one iPad running iOS 8, how do you retrieve a PDF file put on the iPad from Mac 1, using Mac 2 ? Let's say that I don't currently have access to the Mac used to put the file in the first place. I can see the file in the Books section of the device in iTunes, but that's all I can do right now.   <answer173747> Try emailing it to yourself from the iPad.  <answer173763> Have you tried using Air Drop? I've used it several times for sending in retrieving items.  <comment204406> You should be able to drag it out of iTunes to the desktop <comment204411> Yes. *should*. But iTunes won't let it go. <comment204413> hmmm - might be because it's not 'native' to that machine. Never tried it on other than my main Mac. Maybe see how you get on with something like iFunBox - review & link - http://lifehacker.com/5914638/the-best-desktop-file-explorer-for-iphone <comment204435> While it's technically working, I'm looking for a way to do this without network connection, and a third party service. <comment204447> iBooks does not have a Share with Airdrop option, unfortunately.
