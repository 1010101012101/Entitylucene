How to unlock the Dock in macOS Sierra? <body> While using a brand new MacBook Pro, with Touch Bar, somehow the Dock got locked.  I didn't do anything that I know of.  Nothing moves at all, in or out.  I'm trying to remove and add items, apps, and nothing takes.  <answer265750> Try logging out and back in (or, if you're comfortable with the Terminal, try running codekillall Dock/code). That will cause the Dock to relaunch and may un-freeze it.  <answer265752> Try unsettling contents-immutable. Run the following in Terminal:  precodedefaults delete com.apple.dock contents-immutable &amp;&amp; killall -HUP Dock /code/pre  <answer265807> Give logging a shot and back in (or, in case you're alright with the Terminal, take a stab at running killall Dock). That will make the Dock relaunch and may un-solidify it.  <comment333200> I ran that command and nothing changed.  There was a flash, but nothing changed. <comment333201> I also tried deleting the prefs file and rebooting. <comment333600> That is a duplicate of your answer on the other question - you should be marking this question as a dup not answering it. <comment333602> @Mark I didn't remember my answer from 1.5 years ago, thanks for finding it <comment333614> As so long ago that suggests there is another question as I saw it recently :( <comment333776> This command totally worked for me, and it "unlocked" the dock.  There is no mention of the word "unlock" in the other question, so that's why I couldn't find it.  If you could add "unlock" to the question then people (or dummies like myself!) would find that one.
