How to fix “swipe up” and “swipe down” gestures in Reeder after installing Lion? <body> After upgrading to Lion, Reeder swipe up and swipe down gestures stopped working.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dGcjh.png" alt="Reeder swipe up and swipe down gestures in Lion"  How do I fix them?  <answer21415> This problem is a known issue and has been fixed in recent versions.       However, it is not specific to Reeder and seems to also affect Twitter and other apps.    To work around it, hold kbd⌥ Option/kbd and swipe strongusing the same count of fingers/strong that you have set for Mission Control in strongTrackpad/strong preference pane:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/CNcm0.png" alt="Swipe up with three fingers"  <answer21498> You can fix this (temporarily), but there's some plist hacking involved. I read on reeder's twitter feed about a solution to this problem.      “@jagreenwood: @reederapp i got them working like this tumblr.com/xic3melm6o swipeWithEvent isn't called otherwise”   Great, thanks!   The solution described at the linked address explains how to fix this problem in a couple of steps:  ol liI set up the trackpad properties in Preferences like this: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/589sd.png" alt="enter image description here"/li liopen up code~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.driver.AppleBluetoothMultitouch.trackpad.plist/code in your favorite editor /li limake set the value of key codeTrackpadThreeFingerVertSwipeGesture/code to 1/li liRestart your computer as this setting otherwise isn't used./li /ol  It's a bit hackish, but works pretty fine for me. The author of the post has also a different solution, but I don't really like that there's the option key involved.   <comment29342> I tried this but unfortunately to no avail. <comment36318> Thanks! This was a great workaround which also works in Chrome to trigger Chrome's exposé.
