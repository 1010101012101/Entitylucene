If you want a free copy of Windows 10, sign up for the Windows Insider Program. You can get a free ISO file from there./em/strong  <comment270204> If you are ok with it, you can follow my tutorial [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJE4OyT0DXg). <comment270214> I followed your steps but it did not work anyways thanks I appreciate it.
