Safari on macOS sends “connection: close” <body> I'm trying to connect to a web application using HTTPS.  Using mac OS x 10.11 &amp; 10.12, Safari sends the HTTP request with a codeconnection: close/code header, and the connection fails (I think that the SSL authentication fails).  When I used an HTTP proxy (Charles) that only changed that header's value from  codeclose/code to codekeep-alive/code, it worked perfectly.  Is there any way to configure safari to send codeconnection: keep-alive/code automatically?  (I'm open to any solution, even editing config files, not only UI configuration)
