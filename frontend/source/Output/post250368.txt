Mail.app - messages deleted by applescript reappear later in the day in the inbox. <body> I use a set of applescripts to help report junk mail to spamcop.  The first script, after sending the raw source of the selected message to spamcop, marks the message as junk and then deletes it.  Later a mail rule sees the spamcop notification, fires of another script which "clicks" the link inside the message, then deletes that message, too.  About an hour later, those deleted messages reappears. The first one is still brown (marked as junk). This behavior has been around since OSX Lion. And it only happens when deleting via applescript.  Has anyone come across this? Is there a way to fix it?  For reference, this is the applescript source.

It's possible the AppleScript delete routine isn't moving it to the actual trash folder for that provider. <comment310951> Multiple providers. I have a gmail account with IMAP, also an IMAP account on SmarterMail server. When I manually delete a message, it stays deleted regardless of account. <comment311381> In that case I'd guess whatever the AppleScript routine for delete message is, it's not deleting messages "correctly". Given how long it took them to support the concept of archive versus trash (a la Gmail) I wouldn't be surprised to find out that the AppleScript routine is just broken. I'm not sure why the messages disappear for an hour, though.
