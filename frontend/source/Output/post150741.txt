Application to get Magnetometer, Acceleration and Gyro data in one file? <body> I use iPhone for analysing trajectory, more here. I am trying to find an app that makes it easy to get Mag/Acc/Gyro data from the phone to let say dropbox. I have found apps that allow you to get only one type of data but I want an app that gets all of the data (not just gyro but all: gyro+acc+mag). Recommendations highly appreciated, thank you.
