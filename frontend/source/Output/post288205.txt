How do I open two tabs in a split pane in iTerm? <body> I have a split pane codeiTerm/code window img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/39G23.png" alt="window"  I would like to have two tabs in the right "pane", but cannot figure out how to do this. I did it yesterday, for the first time ever and loved it, but can't seem to remember how it was done.   Anyone know the process for this?  <comment364099> Looks like it may be [impossible](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/iterm2-discuss/p8-b4mPvD2w). Although I swear I did it the other day...
