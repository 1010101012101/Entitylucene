Why does 4s iphone change to vibrate when I put phone in my pocket? <body> Maybe I'm nuts but it seems my iphone 4s switches from normal (audible) mode to vibrate when I put my phone in my pocket.  Anyone else having this weird issue?  <answer101397> On the left-hand side of your iPhone is this little switch (ring/silent). The plausible answer to your question is, that you turn the switch on/off by accidentally touching it when you put your phone in your pocket. This happens to me all the time as well.  When the switch is turned from emon/em to emoff/em your phone will vibrate one time.  <answer211713> It's also plausible that the proximity sensor is switched on and there is a setting tied to it.  <answer249566> Well there is a option in settingsAccessibiltyVibration turn it off to avoid this .Hope this helps  <comment309607> This doesn't answer the OP's question.
