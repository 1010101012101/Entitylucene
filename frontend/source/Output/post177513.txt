2009 Mac Mini Wakes Up Immediately After Sleep. What Could be Wrong? <body> This computer would sleep fine before.  Now it wakes up immediately after sleeping, either from a timer, or from the Sleep menu item.  ul liEven if all USB ports (except the wireless mouse) are empty/li liEven with a non-wireless mouse/li liEven if Bluetooth and WiFi are off/li liEven if Time Machine is off/li liEven after Apple Hardware Test has shown no problem/li liEven if a B.S.O.D. has not happened during the session (See Black Screen of Semi-Death after Sleep/Fast User Switching )/li /ul  I've checked the "PleaseSleep" logs and there's nothing there, I've disabled "PleaseSleep".  I've checked "syslog" from a terminal:  precode# syslog |grep -i "Wake reason" Sun Apr 11 08:34:20 MyMac kernel[0] : Wake reason = USB7 /code/pre  But I don't have seven USB ports.  <comment210006> Read this: http://osxdaily.com/2010/07/17/why-mac-wakes-from-sleep/
