Contacts' "profile" entries (social media links) don't appear in iOS <body> I have links to my contacts' social media profiles (e.g. Facebook, LinkedIn) saved on the Mac copy of my contacts. They are saved as copies of URLs (e.g. 'http://www.domain.ext/nym') pasted into the "profile" entries at the end of each card. These are synced over to my iOS device via USB and iTunes.   When I view contacts on the iOS device, the profiles aren't listed. Items that do sync over are photo, name, phones, emails, URLs, addresses, anniversaries, relationships, and notes (everything except profile links).   ul liMac OS X 9.5 Mavericks/li liiOS 8.1.1/li liiTunes 12.0.1.26/li liNo iCloud. /li liNo third-party sync. /li /ul  <comment184976> works over iCloud <comment185047> iCloudâ€”the newer way to achieve previously basic functionality, but with less security. <comment185050> You could always go back to sneaker-net; that's pretty secure... <comment185114> This is sneakernet. <comment185115> I can't test, because it works perfectly over iCloud - the data's there before I can get to my iPhone address book, if I enter it on the Mac.
