How can I access my WordPress website hosted in MAMP from a remote client in the LAN? <body> I have a WordPress website hosted on my MacBook at 192.168.1.8 but the connection from another PC on the same LAN doesn't work.  Examples:  ul liWhen I enter 192.168.1.8:8888 I get the default "It works!" Apache page.  /li liBut when I enter 192.168.1.8:8888/folder/ it doesn't work./li /ul  Which configuration has to be changed to allow access from the LAN? MAMP? Apache?  From the other PC in the same network I have no problem to access other web servers.  <comment364670> You have to add some details like: how did you install WP? From within MAMP or separately? <comment364804> What _do_ you get when it "doesn't work"? Is the directory _folder_ in the document root as configured for the Apache server?
