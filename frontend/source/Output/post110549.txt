Open Preview in full page view <body> Whenever I open a PDF that is of ordinary DIN A4 format, the Preview window is oriented such that I can only see the upper half of the PDF. What I would like to have is a setting where I can define that every PDF is opened such that - the full page is displayed - the window is resized to reach vertically from the top to the bottom of the screen and - horizontally has half screen size and that  - the window is placed in the right half of the screen.  Can I define these settings somewhere?  <answer110583> In 10.8 and later (but not in 10.7) there is a preference for the default view mode:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qy6t5.png" alt=""  I don't know any way to change the default size or position of windows, but you can use an application like Slate, ShiftIt, or Moom to assign a keyboard shortcut for resizing a window to fill the right half of a screen.  <comment130441> Skim seems to remember window position and size as well as display settings, great!
