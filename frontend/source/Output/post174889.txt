Python script executable opened by text editor <body> I have a simple "Hello world" script that I want to turn into an executable. The problem is that even though I went through the steps of declaring the path of the Python interpreter in the first list of the code and made it executable via codechmod/code, it does not run as an executable. Instead when I click it my text editor opens up the file. This sounds really stupid, but I've tried everything. code./hello.py/code prints codeHello world/code in the Terminal.  I've tried changing the file to open with the Terminal instead, but it's greyed out.  precode#!/usr/bin/python print 'Hello world' /code/pre  What I typed in the terminal:  precodechmod +x hello.py ./hello.py /code/pre  Output:  precodeHello world /code/pre  The problem is that double clicking the script opens text editor instead of running it as an executable.  What I tried:  Changing what the file uses to open itself by having it default to the Terminal, but OS X grays out that option.  <answer186071> Removing the file's extension should cause the file to open in your default terminal application. Alternately, you could select "All Applications" from the "Enable" menu in the "Open With" dialog to enable opening with "Terminal.app" regardless of the file's extension.  <answer186084> Change the file extension from code.py/code to code.command/code.  With the code.command/code suffix the file will become associated with strongTerminal.app/strong. When opened, the file will open with Terminal.app and immediately be run within a new terminal window.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/o0y3C.png" alt="Finder info window of a command file"  <comment206662> I wonder if this would be helpful (stuffing it into an Automator workflow): http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/153828/116849
