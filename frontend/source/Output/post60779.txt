Suddenly I can only mount one iOS device at a time <body> I have two USB ports at the front of my Mac Pro. They both seem to be working fine, as I have tested my iOS devices and other hardware on both.   The issue is that I can only mount one iOS device at a time. If I try to mount the second device it does not appear, until I un-mount the first.   This is strange as I usually load two devices (an iPhone and iPad) without any issue.  Any ideas?  <comment70013> What if you plug one in the back of the Mac Pro? <comment70043> same thing actually. Only one device loads.
