Prevent spotlight from indexing folders with a certain name <body> Is there a way to globally ignore folders with a certain name (say codenode_modules/code)  I know I can do it manually for each instance but I was wondering if its possible to just let spotlight know not to index these folders? codenode_modules/code, for example, typically has thousands of files that I don't want to search and it ends up slowing down spotlight.  I've looked around but I can only find answers that suggest manually adding folders in spotlight privacy list. Does someone have a better, glob way to it?  <answer250924> Apparently adding '.noindex' to a parent folder name will prevent Spotlight from indexing.  NB: I haven't personally verified.  <answer258791> There is no known method to exclude from Spotlight a file or a folder based on a pattern (ex.: its name).  However it's possible to exclude a folder from Spotlight by adding to it an empty file code.metadata_never_index/code.  You can use this method to ignore all codenode_module/codeand codebower_modules/code folders:  precodefind /path/to/projects -type d \( -name "node_modules" -o -name "bower_modules" \) -exec touch "{}/.metadata_never_index" \; /code/pre  <comment304785> Adding specific folders to the Spotlight privacy is the way to have it ignore during indexing.  Why are you against doing it the Apple-provided way? <comment304786> Because I want to ignore many instances of this folder and doing that "the apple-provided way" will be time-consuming and ineffective (I might miss some). In addition to that, whenever a new `node_modules` folder is created, I'll have to go and add it manually. <comment360648> I cannot confirm that this works for my Mac with Sierra as of today. I ran the script and can find all the hidden `.metadata_never_index` files in my node_modules, yet after a forced refresh of the spotlight index, the files are still being indexed. There is also a node_modules NPM Github PR open but I am afraid that this won't be the final solution to the problem https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/15346 <comment360800> Note: Chrome and Opera use it for profile folder.
