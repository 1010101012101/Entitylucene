What are some good resources for learning Dashcode? <body> What are some good resources for learning Dashcode? I've got plenty for XCode, but can neither find a good online Dashcode tutorial nor a book in stores. If anyone can help, please let me know.  My apologies if this is better suited for SO.  <answer298> There are a bunch of resources available from the Apple Developer Site.  Here is a small list of stuff available:  Dashboard Widget Tutorial  Mobile Safari Web Application Tutorial  Starting a Project  <answer304> Maybe you've already checked and didn't like it or something, but the included help documentation is actually a pretty good starting point for creating simple widgets in Dashcode.  It got me through coding a couple easy ones.  Not sure if you're looking for complete beginner tutorials or something more advanced however.  <comment288> Thanks! But yeah I did all of these. They weren't quite as intensive as I'd like. <comment289> Yeah I am going through the Currency Converter example again now. Yes I am actually looking for a complete beginner tutorial. I saw "Dashcode for Dummies" but it won't be out until February 2011 lol.
