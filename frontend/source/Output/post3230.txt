How to disable to login screen shortcut (Cmd+Alt+L) <body> I'm trying to find where this shortcut is being configured under Snow Leopard but I simply can not. Any help would be appreciated!  <answer3389> Not sure what you're trying to do, but Safari uses CMD+Alt+L for the downloads window.  Also, I used to use LockMyScreen (which doesn't work in Snow Leopard anymore), and it's shortcut is showing in my Mac as CMD+Alt+L.  I went to System Preferences  Keyboard  Keyboard Shortcuts, then looked in Application Shortcuts.  <comment2893> Why are you trying to do this - there might be an answer depending on what you are trying to do <comment2894> basically to disable it or at least change the default to something else that is overlapping with an app shortcut <comment2902> What does the shortcut currently do? <comment3087> Nikos, please provide more information or I fear this question will end up voted to a close...
