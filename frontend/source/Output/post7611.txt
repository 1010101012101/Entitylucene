Is it possible to create a Wi-Fi hotspot from iPhone that's not ad-hoc? <body> First off, I am well aware of how to—in general—create a wireless hotspot using an ad-hoc network directly from my iPhone.  I have previously used the latest version of MyWi (version 4.12.6 at time of writing) but it creates ad-hoc networks and this doesn't work for me.  I emdo not/em want to and emcannot/em create an ad-hoc network from my iPhone to allow another device to share its connection (must be wireless, as bridged connections don't help either).  Does anybody know if this is possible?  <answer7612> In iOS 4.3 there will be Personal Hotspot integrated in firmware. Just wait  <comment8182> You have to jail break your iPhone to enable it as a WiFi hotspot. <comment8183> @tawman - as I said, I am well aware of how to create a wifi hotspot - my question is, is it possible to do so without creating an ad-hoc network <comment8185> Not until iOS 4.3. <comment8309> @JM4 the point is, since this will come in the next release nobody will bother developing such thing. And no, no solution exists to this date to do that - also because nobody had enough reasons to do it. <comment8368> @JM4 just prove me wrong and bring a solution then. <comment8374> @JM4: maybe try being a little less confrontational with people who are actually trying to help you out?
