Unable to click in a new user account <body> The click events wont fire in a newly created user account in my MacBook Pro Mountain Lion. The click events works fine in my first admin account. But when I create a new user account, (standard or Admin) I am not able to fire click events from my track pad in that account.   PS: I don't have a bluetooth mouse anywhere!  <comment222078> With my track pad!!!! <comment222079> Is there any solution for this??? <comment222175> did you check the track pad settings in the new user account? or run the disk permissions repair? <comment222186> How do I do that?? <comment222192> how do I access disk perm repair here? I just cant click on anything, <comment222194> Open Disk utility in Utility folder..click on verify-wait for it to finish, then click on repair. <comment222292> did not work!...
