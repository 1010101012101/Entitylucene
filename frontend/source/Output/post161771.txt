In Finder, folder gets icon when given an extension .md, not with other extensions <body> By accident, I see a strange behaviour when creating a folder with an extension code.md/code  It gets the the same icon as a file with extension code.md/code (the MarkdownLife icon). For other file extension, I do not see this behaviour.  Is this a bug in Finder? Or markDownLife? Can other confirm this issue?   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yvwny.png" alt="finder view"  Using:  ul liOS X Version 10.9.5/li liMarkdownLife Version 1.4.0 (20141019)/li /ul  <comment188978> It's not a bug: the Finder will try to associate file extensions with custom icon it may have in the cache for that extension. <comment188997> Did not see it before: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/83910/finder-folder-icons-look-like-document-and-image-files?rq=1
