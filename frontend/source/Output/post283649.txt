Is it possible to change the location of native or Chrome notifications? <body> All of them are by default in the top right corner and native notifications cover those from Chrome. (MacOS Sierra)  FYI: the only workaround I've found so far is to use native macOS notifications in Chrome (https://www.macrumors.com/2016/04/06/chrome-native-os-x-notifications/), but these notifications doesn't hold all the information as the original ones.  <answer283704> This isn't possible right now, with Chrome's notifications or with native macOS notifications â€” they're stuck in the top right.  This functionality used to exist on Windows, but isn't possible now, and there don't appear to be any plans for its implementation.
