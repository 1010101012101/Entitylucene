iOS 7 - Twitter notification issue <body> This has been getting me down, and I'm out of ideas.  On my main twitter account, for one person I follow (@IndieGala), every single tweet is sent as a notification. After a quick bit of reading, I found two different methods to stop the tweets showing up, and I disabled it. A few hours later, they were showing up again. So I repeatedly disabled them for a couple of weeks, and it didn't ever stick.  I then uninstalled and reinstalled the app, and that seemed to fix it. For about 15 hours, then once again the tweets started showing up. If I go into settings and tweet notifications, the account is there. I disable it in that menu, and it vanishes. When the notification inevitably shows, it's back in the list as If I had never removed it.  I don't want to disable notifications entirely, and there is an account who's tweets I do want pushed so I don't want to disable that entirely either.  Has anyone had something similar to this? It's literally driving me to the edge of insanity.  Thanks  <answer144972> You need to go to Twitter.com in to your account and change some stuff there.  strongMute a single Account/strong  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/H7uwq.jpg" alt="mute"  If you click on "More" in the twitter timeline there is the "Mute", to stop seen someones tweets.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MKEnU.jpg" alt="mute in timeline"  If you want to be radical then Disable applications access for all:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/j4toA.jpg" alt="application access"
