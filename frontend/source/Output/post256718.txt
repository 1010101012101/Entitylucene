Overloaded CPU process and 0% battery on a Macbook Pro <body> This problem just came out of blue. 2 days ago I came home and found that my laptop so lagged. I found that the problem was in a highly overloaded cpu process codekernel_task/code. As I understood, it's a known problem with this process.   With help of Stackoverflow I found one of solutions: to remove an extension code/System/Library/Extensions/IOPlatformPluginFamily.kext/code I didn't believe in this solution but it works!  Unfortunately, I got an another problem at the same time. 0% battery. Be honest, I changed my battery just 2-3 months ago. It looks like original but I can't trust to a seller. It worked perfectly. As a result, right now I have 0% battery and green lid on the charger. Furthermore, I have codenormal/code condition of the battery and on a login screen (gray background where you need chose a user and input password if your mac is encrypted) I have 100% charged battery.  Here is a screenshoot of "About this Mac" window:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2OtFQ.png" alt=""  Does it make sense? I cast doubt on that the battery just broke down already after 2 months of use. Moreover, simultaneously with the codekernel_task/code problem. I've tried reset SMC and PRAM but with no luck. Do you have any suggestions, guys?
