Mavericks."AFP error -1 mapped to EIO" error on console - sharing is unilateral <body> When I try to connect (cmd-k) to my MacBook Pro from my Mac Mini - using "afp://name.local" or the IP instead of the name, I get an error logged to console     AFP error -1 mapped to EIO   I can connect the reverse way, from MacBook Pro to Mac Mini and both run Mavericks.   Both on the same network. Used to work in the past. Any clues?
