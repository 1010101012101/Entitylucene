Cloned disk with dd, but it won't mount? <body> Goal: clone my internal disk to an external disk, and boot from the external disk.  strongupdate/strong thanks klanomath, who pointed out that I had to change the uuid of the core storage disk for both the internal and external disk to be present at the same time. I tested the external disk on a different mac and it works perfectly. I have not tried to change the UUID as my idea is to now wipe the internal disk anyway.  I used dd to make a clone and verified the md5 sums.  At boot, I can choose from all the expected volumes: "Untitled", "Windows", and with external-disk-symbol: "Untitled", "Windows".  Regardless of which "Untitled" I choose, it ends up booting up using the internal disk. Any ideas as to why? How I could I fix it?  strongHow I made the clone:/strong  I booted into Linux from a USB stick, no other filesystem was mounted, I proceeded to make the copy:  precodedd if=/dev/sda of=/dev/sdc bs=4096 conv=noerror,sync /code/pre  I verified that the md5 sums of the entire /dev/sda matched the equivalent size on /dev/sdc.  strongInfo about the disks/strong  Once in OS X (from the internal disk using "Untitled"), this is what I see with diskutil list:  precode$ diskutil list /dev/disk0 (internal, physical):    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *751.3 GB   disk0    1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1    2:          Apple_CoreStorage Untitled                689.4 GB   disk0s2    3:                 Apple_Boot Boot OS X               650.0 MB   disk0s3    4:       Microsoft Basic Data BOOTCAMP                61.0 GB    disk0s4  /dev/disk1 (internal, virtual):    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:                          Untitled               +689.1 GB   disk1                              Logical Volume on disk0s2                              137B561F-8819-4ABD-BFBF-DD8F3A997D60                              Unlocked Encrypted  /dev/disk2 (external, physical):    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *1.0 TB     disk2    1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk2s1    2:          Apple_CoreStorage                         689.4 GB   disk2s2    3:                 Apple_Boot Boot OS X               650.0 MB   disk2s3    4:       Microsoft Basic Data BOOTCAMP                61.0 GB    disk2s4 /code/pre  In Disk Utility the only volume that shows up for /dev/disk2 is BOOTCAMP.   strongfsck_cs/strong  Running fsck_cs on both disk2s2 (the external disk's core storage) and on disk0s2 (the internal disk's core storage), I get equivalent output and the volume seems fine.  Perhaps the issue is that there are two volumes (on different disks) with the same UUUD?

This will fail because each has to be unique. Booting to Windows on an external USB drive usually also fails! <comment355241> @klanomath thanks, any ideas how I can change the UUIDs? <comment355242> The UUIDs can be changed by disabling and enabling FileVault on **one** of the volumes - which will take some time.... (either the internal one while the external is unplugged or detaching the internal one and converting the external volume) <comment355410> @klanomath, if you make it an answer I'll accept it.
