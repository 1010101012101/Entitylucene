How to access a folder which name is composed of more than 1 word via shell? <body> I have tried with a simple command:  precodecd Name of the Folder /code/pre  but it's not working, of course.  I have also been searching on the web, but the methods I found are not actually working.  How can I accomplish this?  <answer146007> To access files or directories that have spaces in them you have to tell Bash to ignore them (it uses spaces to delimit commands so it has to be told that the space in the file name is actually part of the filename)  to do that you need to put a backslash () in front of the space.  ie.  precodecd Name\ of\ the\ folder /code/pre  However bash will help if you press the TAB key after the start of the filename i will autocomplete and take of the spaces for you  so type:  cd Name TAB and it will autocomplete.  <answer146008> The answers in the linked article are correct (but maybe hard to find among all the other information there). Key problem is that codebash/code (and any other shell) use whitespace to separate between words, so any space characters emwithin/em names (and any situations where such characters might occur) need to be protected/escaped.  precodecd "folder with whitespace in name" cd folder\ with\ whitespace\ in\ name /code/pre  and (if you have the name of the folder in a variable)  precodeFOLDER_NAME="folder with whitespace in name" cd "$FOLDER_NAME" /code/pre  <comment172027> "not actually working" doesn't explain the problem you are facing. In case the answers below don't help you in solving the problem, please include the actual command you are executing and the error you get in your question. <comment172028> I was trying with the second method, but I was trying wrongly, I was forgetting to insert the variable $VAR between quotes <comment172032> Thank you, all methods you suggested work perfectly now. I decided to not vote for none of you, because both answers are helpful :) +1 for both :)
