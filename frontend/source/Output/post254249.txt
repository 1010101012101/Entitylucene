My MacBook pro late 2011 15" has 800% usage with kernel_task <body> So my MacBook Pro is getting super slow and laggy after a while of usage. I updated to Sierra today and my kernel_task is sky-rocketing - hitting up to 1100% and I have no idea why? I've tried all kinds of things like an SMC and PRAM reset and it didn't work. Has anyone had the same issue? Does anyone have a fix?   Edit: I have 8GB of RAM and a 250GB SSD with 35GB of free space.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/EGRos.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer254594> So after long time of surfing the web i found this which fixed the issue:  ol liReboot into recovery mode (Command + R on boot prior to startup chime), select Utilities/Terminal, csrutil disable  (repeat process, use csrutil enable after removing the file), reboot./li liGo to About this mac under the apple in the upper left and click on More info/li liClick on system report/li limake a note of what it says after Model Identifier (MacBookPro8,2 is mine)./li liFrom the Root drive (not home folder): – System  Library – Extensions – IOPlatformPluginFamily.kext (alt-click/View Contents) – Plugins – ACPI_SMC_PlatformPlugin.kext – View Contents – Resources -– find the name from step 3 and move it to a folder that you can find again if needed./li liRestart and you’re done (other than enabling SIP)./li /ol  I can use my Mac again!  <comment316534> There are many possible reasons for this. Can you please share how much RAM you have and what capacity HDD you have and how much free space remains? <comment316535> i have 8gb of ram and a 250gb ssd with 35gb free space <comment359436> The recovery menu is broken on Sierra, it's stuck on Language Chooser. You can user Command + R  + S instead.
