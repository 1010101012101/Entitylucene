Does Apple design its own CPUs? <body> We're having a little debate here at work.  Does Apple design its own CPUs? And by CPU design I mean what is on Wikipedia.  I'm also interested to know the manufacturers of Apple's CPUs/SoC (maybe even GPUs)  <answer115139> Apple is known to design the ARM used in the iDevices. But Apple definitely does not design everything. For example the GPU is a PowerVR G6430 and the ARM architecture is derived of ARM's V8-A.  On the Desktop/Laptop it's done by Intel since it's their CPU.   Apple's latest A7 are made by Samsung, but it's believed to shift to other manufacturers (for example TSMC) since Samsung is a major competitor for Apple.
