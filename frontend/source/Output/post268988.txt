iOS turn off Fade-in effects? <body> sup(emNot talking about/em strongS/strongettings ➙ strongA/strongccessibility ➙ strongR/strongeduce strongM/strongotion ➙ strongR/strongeduce strongM/strongotion)/sup  Is there a way, on iOS (10+) and specifically iPhone (6+), to suppress the Fade-in/Mixing effects?   Especially pressing the kbdHOME/kbd button to go back from an app to home, there is a small delay to which is added the fade-in effect.  I don't mind a fade-in effect, as long as it's barely noticeable, but with newer iOSes, an iPhone gets slower and slower. The 6+ is not that bad, yet, but still, some effects are annoying.  Suppressing obtrusive effects to get a more responsive device would be great!  <answer270294> h2How to remove the animation when closing an app/h2  Please note: I tested this with an strongiPhone 5s running iOS 10.2.1/strong. It strongshould work with the iPhone 6/strong / iPhone 6 Plus as well, but not with newer devices (iPhone SE/6s/6s Plus/7/7 Plus). Also, the animations will be back as soon as you reboot your device.  Part 1/2: Prepare  ol liOpen this picture in Safari./li liPress the "Share" button on the bottom and tap "strongSave Image/strong"./li liGo to Settings  Wallpaper  strongChoose a New Wallpaper/strong  All Photos./li listrongSelect the new image/strong (black pixel)./li liTap "Set"  "Set Both"./li liTap "Choose"  "Wallpaper" to go back./li /ol  hr  Part 2/2: Crash  Now you need to crash the process that's responsible for the smooth animations. You need to strongrepeat the process below about 10-14 times/strong.  ol liTap on the lock screen preview (on the left)./li liTap "Set"/li liTap on the home screen preview (on the right)./li liTap "Set"./li /ol  You can verify that animations were disabled by pressing the home button. There will be no animation at all.  If you still the usual animation, go back to the wallpaper settings and repeat part 2 a few more times.  .  Please let me know if this works for your iPhone 5s or iPhone 6 / iPhone 6 Plus.  <comment338831> Not sure you can; have you asked apple support :D? <comment339437> Is it correct that you have an iPhone 6 Plus – not an iPhone 6s Plus – and that it's running the latest iOS 10.2 or 10.2.1? <comment339523> @oa That's correct!
