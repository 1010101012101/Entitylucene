Why does shasum generate non-standard hashes? <body> As far as I can tell, the shasum that ships with os x doesn't generate the hashes that it's supposed to.  precode$ echo "" | /usr/bin/shasum adc83b19e793491b1c6ea0fd8b46cd9f32e592fc ?- /code/pre  When I look up empty string sha hash in wikipedia I see that I should expect to get  precodeda39a3ee 5e6b4b0d 3255bfef 95601890 afd80709 /code/pre  My reading of the man page for shasum is that it defaults to sha 1. I get the same result even if I specify sha 1.   What's going on here?  ps Apologies for the bad tag. I can't create a tag of sha or shasum due to low reputation...  <answer90472> codeshasum/code is working fine but codeecho ""/code doesn't produce an empty string:  precodepse@Fourecks:~$ echo "" | od 0000000    000012                                                          0000001 /code/pre  This works better:  precodepse@Fourecks:~$ echo -n "" | shasum da39a3ee5e6b4b0d3255bfef95601890afd80709 /code/pre  <comment106201> D'oh!
