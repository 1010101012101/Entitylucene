Macbook screen flickering with external connection and sometimes freezes <body> This issue is different from connecting to an external monitor or screen. It occurs when I have a terminal session open or any other connection to an external machine such as a Virtual Machine. It even occurs for something as simple as connecting to a database using DBVisualizer or any other similar program. Occasionally, while these external connections are active, my screen will go completely "static" (either something similar to an old TV or very tightly spaced black and white lines). At this point, the only thing I've found I can do is manually reboot my laptop. Has anyone else encountered this and, if so, is there anyway to fix this?  <comment373219> Thanks for the quick response. Unfortunately, this has nothing to do with an external connection to a device. It occurs when I am connecting in some way to a virtual machine.
