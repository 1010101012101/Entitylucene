How can I force Mac OS X 10.9 to see the ethernet port of my hub (Asix AX88179)? <body> I already downloaded (and installed !) the latest file from ASIX.com, which is the latest to this day, but System Information does not list the port as being available when I connect the USB 3 Hub directly to the USB 3 port of my MBP.  Mike Ohlsen wrote here that when plugging the hub into another USB Hub, and not directly into his Mac, then OS X does detect the ethernet interface and displays the device in the System Information.  I can confirm this. But this is not useful in the long run since this defeats the whole idea of having a SuperSpeed Hub in the first place !  Leif's solution doesn't work in 10.9. That is :  precodesudo kextunload -b com.asix.driver.ax88179_178a sudo kextload -b com.asix.driver.ax88179_178a /code/pre  as I get this reply in Terminal :  precodecom.asix.driver.ax88179_178a failed to load - (libkern/kext) not found; check the system/kernel logs for errors or try kextutil(8). /code/pre  And anyway it would be a terrible hassle to have to do this each and every time.  But when my "USB 3 Hub with Ethernet" is connected through a USB 2 Hub, then the kext is loaded (inexplicably for me) :  precodeMBP-computer:~ username$ kextstat -l | grep asix   137    0 0xffffff7f82879000 0x8000     0x8000     com.asix.driver.ax88179-178a (1.0.0) &lt;36 34 7 5 4 3 1&gt; /code/pre  In case you wonder : img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wBVqT.png" alt="enter image description here"  Hence my question :  How can I force Mac OS X 10.9 to see the ethernet port of my hub (Asix AX88179) ?  ul liSince we see that Mac OS X 10.9 can see the port when the hub is connected through another hub/li liSince that port indeed works in this configuration, showing that the port is functional (the hardware is effectively working, so is the driver)/li /ul  <answer116783> After I posted my comment, I contacted support of my product (ianker.com) and after few email exchange they sent me a replacement dongle claiming that I had a defective unit.  I was skeptical but the replacement actually worked!  MacOSX immediately recognised it when I plugged it in directly into the Mac.  <comment134192> I have a similar problem.  I normally connect my Asix AX88179 via a USB 3.0 hub to my MacBook Air but it is very unstable.  After reading your post, I tried to connect the dongle directly to my Mac and it won't see it.  Point is don't bother connecting via a hub as it quickly disconnects.  Worse, although the network is simply not available, the setting still show green status. <comment146343> Sorry, my fault. Thought you were the OP.
