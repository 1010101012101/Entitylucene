iTerm2 does not kill processes when tab is closed <body> If I work in terminal, and, say run coderails server/code in it attached to the current terminal and then close the tab it will not terminate the process making it hang around indefinitely without ability to bring it. Is it possible to fix it?  Steps to reproduce:    ol liOpen new terminal tab (codecmd + t/code);  /li liRun a process in it (e.g. codeirb/code);  /li liClose the tab (codecmd + w/code);  /li liList processes to see that codeirb/code is still running (codeps ax|grep irb/code)./li /ol  Quitting iTerm doesn't finish these processes either.  <comment170792> If you Quit iTerm2 will it not quit all processes? <comment171479> @Buscarì›ƒ yes, it wouldn't quit them. I've just added steps to reproduce to question. <comment171481> Do you have tmux integration turned on? If so, it's probably creating tmux sessions for every tab you open. Try `tmux list-sessions` and see what it comes back with. <comment171488> @JayThompson I don't use tmux, but I have it installed, list-sessions tells me `failed to connect to server: No such file or directory` <comment171495> Hm. Does it also happen for non-Ruby processes? e.g. `top` <comment315779> same for me, just installed iterm2 and appreciated the features and right after that ran into several major bugs (what a shame)
