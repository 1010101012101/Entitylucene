How can I link to a specific point in a YouTube video from an iPhone? <body> When using YouTube on the desktop, right clicking a video gives the option to copy a link to a specific point in that video.  Is there a way to link to a specific point of a YouTube video from an iPhone or iPad?  I've tried using the native iOS app and the mobile site, but I can't find a way to link a specific time stamp.  <answer292636> The format of the query string is very simple. Just append code?t=#m##s/code to the video URL to link directly code#/code minutes and code##/code seconds into the video. If the URL already contains a code?/code, make that code&amp;t=#m##s/code instead.  For instance: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVPRkcczXCY&amp;t=1m22s will take you 1 minute and 22 seconds into the presentation video for the 2016 MacBook Pro.  So just figure out what point in time you want to link to in a YouTube video, and you can make the link yourself.  <comment369226> Send feedback in the app requesting the feature (and that goes for both you and anyone else who sees this that wants this too)!
