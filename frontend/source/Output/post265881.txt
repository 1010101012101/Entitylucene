Applescript: Ask user for list of numbers and open new tabs with those numbers as URLs <body> I am looking to make an Applescript that will take a list of numbers inputted by the user like (copy and pasted just like this):  25082945 br/ 25463469 br/ 03146331 br/ 36584524 br/ 23461461  Then, in a browser, open a new tab or each number with the number as the URL.  This is how far I have gotten:  precodedisplay dialog "Please Enter IDs" with icon caution default answer "" set id_list to text returned of result  tell application "Google Chrome"     make new tab at end of tabs of window 1 with properties {URL:id_list} end tell /code/pre  I am guessing that I need to filter the input into a list but I heard that Applescript does not register formatting so the line breaks are not registered. Then for each item in the id_list, open new tab, set url as that number.  <answer265888> If you're copying and pasting a list, as in what's shown in your question, as in lines of text that have the (hidden) emnewline character/em at the end of each line, you can use the following:  precodedisplay dialog "Please Enter IDs" with icon caution default answer "" set id_list to text returned of result  if id_list is not "" then     set i to 1     repeat (count paragraphs in id_list) times         tell application "Google Chrome"             make new tab at end of tabs of window 1 with properties {URL:(paragraph i of id_list)}         end tell         set i to i + 1     end repeat end if /code/pre  hr  Here's the Event Log in AppleScript Editor after running the AppleScript emcode/em above:  precodetell application "AppleScript Editor"     display dialog "Please Enter IDs" with icon caution default answer ""         --&gt; {text returned:"25082945 25463469 03146331 36584524 23461461", button returned:"OK"} end tell tell application "Google Chrome"     make new tab at end of every tab of window 1 with properties {URL:"25082945"}         --&gt; tab id 8 of window id 1     make new tab at end of every tab of window 1 with properties {URL:"25463469"}         --&gt; tab id 11 of window id 1     make new tab at end of every tab of window 1 with properties {URL:"03146331"}         --&gt; tab id 14 of window id 1     make new tab at end of every tab of window 1 with properties {URL:"36584524"}         --&gt; tab id 17 of window id 1     make new tab at end of every tab of window 1 with properties {URL:"23461461"}         --&gt; tab id 20 of window id 1 end tell /code/pre  <comment333478> This worked perfectly, thank you!
