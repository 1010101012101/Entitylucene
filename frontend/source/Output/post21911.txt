How do I mount a jailbroken iPhone as a volume in Lion? <body> In Snow Leopard I was using this utility (it uses MacFuse) to mount my iPhone as a volume upon its connection. Worked very well, and I could browse my jailbroken iPhone's files easily and drag/drop over themes like on a normal HD.  Since OS X Lion, it doesn't appear to be working. Are there any un-obtrusive tweaks to achieve this again? Or does anyone know how to get the MacFuse filesystem working on OS X Lion?  <answer24455> Phone Disk ain't free, but would be a good choice: http://www.macroplant.com/phonedisk/  <comment24133> I usually use an FTP app to SSH into it. Until MacFuse comes to Lion. <comment24228> Ta, but as far as I remember I used Cyberduck. http://ihackthatifone.com/ssh-tutorial-with-cyberduck/ <comment27539> That has a menubar icon that is uglier then all get out. Plus I don't need another app running constantly. <comment30923> Their website provides no indication that it works under Lion (listing the requirements as 10.5 and 10.6).
