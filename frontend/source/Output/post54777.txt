How can I change Terminal so that I don't have to press ESC every time I want to type a meta-modified key? <body> Currently in emacs/terminal, I have to press ESC every time I want to send an escaped keystroke, eg: to go forwards two words, I have to press:  precodeESC+f; ESC+f /code/pre  How do I change the system so that I just have to press and hold ESC once?:  precodeESC+f+f /code/pre  <answer54784> Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be a way to get kbdESC/kbd-kbdf/kbd to repeat and it has something to do with kbdESC/kbd. Here's one solution that emwill/em work:  Currently, Terminal.app is using kbdESC/kbd as META. You can change this to kbd⌥/kbd (option) like this.   ol liVisit Terminal - Preferences ( kbd⌘/kbd-kbd,/kbd )./li liSelect the Keyboard Tab on the right/li liCheck the "Use option as meta key" box at the bottom of the Keyboard pane/li /ol  Now enjoy repeating commands that involve meta by using the option key instead of kbdESC/kbd.  <answer54845> Select “Use option as meta key” in strongTerminal  Preferences  Settings  [profile]  Keyboard/strong. Then you can press the Option modifier key and type codef/code twice.  The “Meta” key sends an codeESC/code before the character you type in combination with the modifier.  Also note that you can use the strongKeyboard/strong preference to map other keys to commonly used sequences like codeESC f/code.  In fact, as of OS X Lion 10.7, Terminal's default keyboard map makes the standard Mac keys for moving left/right a word at a time (kbdOption/kbd-kbdLeft Arrow/kbd/kbdRight Arrow/kbd) send codeESC b/code and codeESC f/code, respectively.
