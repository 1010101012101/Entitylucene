Transfer Clash of Clans without Game Center <body> Is it possible to get my Clash of Clans base from my iPad to my new tablet without the use of Game Center on my iPad? It's a school issued iPad so I can't get a Game Center on it. If there is a way could someone please enlighten me as to how I could door?  <answer130205> An app like iExplorer can pull your saved app data from one iDevice and can copy it to another. You will need to be able to plug the device into your Mac to do it, but they do not both need to be connected at the same time. http://www.macroplant.com  <comment152503> Welcome to the site. I would like to call out the edit button since you asked a yes/no question. It's far better to do a little research on the Clash of Clans support site and say why what you found there doesn't answer your problem. That way an expert can come in and clarify things. As it stands, you might get two answers. One yes, one no and people can vote which is correct. <comment152506> This might be worth exploring. Are you saying that COC will allow a simple movement of the save file from device to device and not check in with a central server before allowing you to move a village? <comment152518> I am not 100% sure how the game saves all of its data. I assume it's in a 'saved game' data file on the iOS device. You grab that file/folder of data and transfer it to the new device. I have done it with some games myself, but not COC. <comment152520> I refuse to download COC, but from my looking at the support site for the game, it appears they control things in the cloud and have alternate procedures to claim the game data and move it between devices. This probably allows them to prevent some ham-fisted cheat attempts and also ensures they can monetize all the game data by requiring constant contact to their servers. +1 since you tried and it will be a good learning exercise for a motivated person to try and report back if it works.
