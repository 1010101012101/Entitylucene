Last Opened not clickable in Applications folder View Options <body> I’m trying to sort my applications by emLast Opened/em column, but the option is not clickable (is grayed out) in the view options (kbd⌘/kbd+kbdJ/kbd) panel (see image below).  Why and how can I fix this?  (I’m on Snow Leopard 10.6.8)  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/R9mlZ.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer85691> Date last opened was only available in Spotlight windows in 10.6 and earlier. It became available in normal Finder windows in 10.7.  http://www.mac-help.com/t205135-does-snow-leopard-have-last-opened.html          One thing that's always annoyed me about Leopard is that the search     results window has a Last Opened column, but an ordinary Finder window     doesn't have that option.          Of course, it also annoys me that the search results window is not an     ordinary Finder window like it used to be, with Size, Created and all     the other column options.          Has Snow Leopard fixed this inconsistency?         In list view 'Last Opened' is one of the options in Show View Options,   but it's rather annoyingly greyed out.      So: Yes, but no.   <answer118115> Requires a little bit of fiddling about but pretty simple to fix, check out: http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=2009083113534843  <comment137857> Answers on Ask Different need to be more than just a link.
