Screen Capture tool that allows me to use keyboard? <body> There are many screen capture tools, but every tool I've tried expects from its user to strongclick/strong and then strongdrag/strong the area to capture.  Is there a tool that allows me to use the keyboard for both operations, such that I can do precise captures in a relaxed manner - without holding anything? I do not want to capture just windows, but any rectangular region.  Example of usage:  ul lipress hotkey to enter capture mode/li limove cursor (cross, loupe, whatever) around using mouse/pad strongand/strong keyboard./li liwhen I find a good starting place (top-left corner), click or press some key to enter marking state/li linow, move cursor to other corner (bottom-right) of the area I want to capture, but without holding anything! Just move cursor with the mouse or using the keyboard, as before./li liwhen I find a good spot, click again or press some key to finalize capturing./li /ul  There is one such tool on Windows that worked this way: emFastStone Capture/em  For me this is an essential feature. I simply want to have precision, without holding any buttons or keys.  <answer113470> You can press command-shift-4 and use space bar to select one of your open windows to capture.  There is a good tutorial on this page.  <answer114216> The only one I know of is Snapz Pro, but there are a lot of screenshot utilities available for the Mac.  <answer130925> Ive just found that new Snagit ($50) does what I need - you still need to drag a rectangle, but then you are allowed to modified it and being able to release a mouse ;)  <comment133153> I do not want just to capture windows, but **any** region. <comment133184> Do you mean for example. Holding CRT+CMD Keys down to anchor one corner of a box and using the arrows keys to expand the sides of it's frame. Then another keys combinations to move the capture box around <comment133261> Ive edited my post with an example that should answer your question :) <comment133929> Thats true - Snapz Pro allows to use keyboard. However, its not that friendly - loupe is controlled by mouse and rectangular may be controlled by keys. I will wait if someone can come with some better software, until I mark this as an answer. <comment144559> One more issue: if I lock my mac when SnapzPro is active, it freezes.
