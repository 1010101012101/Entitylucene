iPhone cannot receive incoming calls <body> It happens sometimes. Suddenly. My phone is in my pocket and somebody is calling me. I see the slider that is for receiving incoming calls. But when I slide, nothing happens. Seems the screen has hanged. I can remember one day I pressed home button and then I could use the slider and receive the call, but that worked for that one time. It's annoying. I use 6S Plus, latest iOS. Any solution please?  <comment310444> I'm having this same problem! Do you have an Apple Watch? Mine seems related to my Watch. <comment310464> I don't have. So I think it's not related to Apple Watch. i think it's about iOS. <comment310466> I think we can at least get a solution [here, at Apple user community](https://discussions.apple.com/message/30556261#30556261). Please hit **I have this question too** <comment310537> I'm using iOS 10 Developer Beta 7. Mine doesn't appear to be iOS firmware related. What iOS version are you using? <comment310616> I use iOS 9.3.4.
