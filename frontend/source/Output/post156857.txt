Apple Script help - how do I tell OS X to not launch a specific app during a specific time period? <body> How do I make an Apple Script (or something similar) that will tell OS X "do not launch/run (emn/em) app from (emx1/em) time to (emx2/em) time?"  Thank you.  <answer158108> How about the following? It can be used as an app launcher. It doesn't stop the user of launching the app but for a child it should do. You could also easily convert it to a background script to continuously monitor for desired app and kill it once usage goes beyond allowed time block.  Hope it helped.  precode# The times to check.
