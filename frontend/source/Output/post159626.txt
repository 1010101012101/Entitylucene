How to change the default command to open shells in the MobileTerminal Cydia package <body> I am using MobileTerminal on iOS 7, and want to know how to change the default shell from sh: to bash:. I assume I would need to change the login command for this, but how would I?  <answer159702> This is a function of the shell set for the user in /etc/passwd (/etc/master.passwd).  Normally you can change this via the chsh command, but iOS7 doesn't have this command. so you need to edit /etc/passwd and /etc/master.passwd (as root) and change the shell for the user mobile to /bin/bash.  So it should look like:  precodemobile:*:501:501:Mobile User:/var/mobile:/bin/bash /code/pre  after changing from:  precodemobile:*:501:501:Mobile User:/var/mobile:/bin/sh /code/pre  Note: in the master.passwd file the '*' will be your encrypted password.  <comment187752> Thanks, also, is that password the lock screen password, or the passwd used in the passwd shell command. They are two different values, stored in different places as far as I can tell. Also, iFile worked wonderfully for this! I recommend others trying this use iFile. <comment187771> The lockscreen password is separate from the user (shell) password. <comment187857> Nice thanks for your help! <comment187859> Type (not really) `echo $AWESOME` and bash should return `bash: error: Awesomeness of this file was to much to process, the only information gathered was that the owner of the file was user 'MERM'` <comment187860> Also, would this work for other shells, ie Z Shell? <comment187861> As long as it is a valid shell.  Also it must be listed in /etc/shells for it to work.
