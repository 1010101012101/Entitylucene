IPad and IPhone - backing up "corrupted" file - spyware on IPad <body> My IPad Backup failed because the back up is corrupt.br Deleting the back up using iTunes or Windows File Explorer and repeating did not work. During Backup to my PC I got multiple popups from ESET NOD32 stating I had "adware" spyware on my IPad. NOD32 erased them on my PC but not IPad. Repeating the back up failed again.br I temporarily disabled NOD32 and the back up worked. But my IPad still has spyware on it.   Searching for spyware removal software or applications .. uncovered nothing.  How do I remove spyware, adware, malware from my IPad??  <answer187692> It's kind of Catch 22, but with a get-out clause...   If you let the Windows antivirus delete the suspect file, it will corrupt the backup.br However, as it is being recognised as a Windows virus by a Windows antivirus, then it almost certainly emcannot/em actually have any effect on the iPad.    The iPad, of course, does not run Windows &amp; cannot be infected by a Windows virus - even if it can 'carry' one &amp; unfortunately, possibly pass it on.   One 'fix' would be to ensure your iTunes backups are encrypted [an option available in the Summary page in iTunes when your iPad is connected]  - that way the Windows antivirus can't even see the 'infection', nor, as the file would be encrypted &amp; unreadable by Windows itself, could it infect your PC.  The other - more long-term - fix would be to delete the offending files from your iPad; your next backup would then be clean.
