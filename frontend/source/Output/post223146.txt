How to Drag and Drop between full screen apps on a Mac using a standard mouse? <body> I have a Logitech mouse. I often maximize my applications in OS X. E.g. I will have Evernote running on one Desktop and Google Chrome running on another, both in full screen mode.  Suppose I have a file in my Downloads folder. How do I attach it into Evernote using drag and drop? Or similarly, how do I attach it to an email using drag and drop. On Windows, drag and drop is made simple by the fact that you can easily resize windows. But, with OS X, since all your windows are maximized, or at least that is how I have them, how do I drag stuff from one place to another?   P.S. I have a simple USB mouse, I am not using Apple trackpad or any such fancy thing.  <answer223153> ol liGrab (mouse click) the item you want to drag from say the desktop or email./li liHit strongcodeCommand+Tab/code/strong on the keyboard to switch through the open apps you have running (holding codeCommand/code down continuously, and hitting codeTab/code repeatedly) tell you get to the app you want to drop the file on. KEEP HOLDING DOWN ON THE MOUSE BUTTON WHILE YOU DO THIS./li liWhen the app you want to drag the item to is the foreground app, you should simply be able to drop (let go of the mouse button) the item youâ€™ve been dragging, and it should be copied or attached to that app./li /ol
