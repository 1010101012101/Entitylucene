Are there alternative ways to interface with Mavericks tags? <body> My company hosts quite a large amount of reference material (images, video, pdfs) on a server, and we're looking for a good way to organize these assets by tags. Searching for these tags in Finder is very slow.  Are there any other ways to interface with any of these tags/files?  <answer136299> Launchers, like LaunchBar 6, can be a great way to navigate tags. Type the name of your tag and then right arrow to navigate the files. Alfred may offer something similar.  <answer152286> Just try Leap: best way to manage finder tags
