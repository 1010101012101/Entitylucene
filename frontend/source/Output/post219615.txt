Which Macbook is right for doing AfterEffect smoothly? <body> I'm new to Mac world. I want to buy a Macbook and an iPhone to become an iOS developer. However, compared to my current pc., I think I need Macbook that smooth enough to create an Adobe AfterEffect project, because I want to be able do many things with great apps to support my new startup.. Does MacBook Air 11" will run smoothly for running and doing project in Adobe after effect? Because I think Macbook pro is a bit expensive. Thank you.  <answer219618> I would personally think a little MacBook Air wouldn't really be suited for that type of production, but it really depends on the specs in your machine.  You can view Adobe's official requirements for After Effects here: https://helpx.adobe.com/after-effects/system-requirements.html  As of today, the requirements are:  ul liMulticore Intel processor with 64-bit support /li liMac OS X versions 10.9, 10.10, or 10.11 /li li4GB of RAM (8GB recommended) /li li6GB of available hard-disk space for installation; additional free space required during installation/li liAdditional disk space for disk cache (10GB recommended) /li li1440x900 display /li liOpenGL 2.0-capable system /li liQuickTime 7.6.6 software required for QuickTime features /li liOptional: Adobe-certified GPU card for GPU-accelerated ray-traced 3D renderer/li /ul  <comment265610> I would go with a used older MacBook Pro on eBay, nothing too old (nothing earlier than a 2011, maybe even 2012). Still, I use Xcode (app development) and Final Cut Pro X (video editing) on an almost daily basis on my ancient 2009 MacBook Pro, mostly without issues, but it can be very slow sometimes.
