How to create Dock entries via Terminal in macOS Sierra? <body> So I found a command that lets me create Dock entries via Terminal. This was working fine on OS X El Capitan, but not with macOS Sierra.  Any ideas how this can be done with macOS Sierra?  This is sample command that works with OS X El Capitan:  precodedefaults write com.apple.dock persistent-apps -array-add "&lt;dict&gt;&lt;key&gt;tile-data&lt;/key&gt;&lt;dict&gt;&lt;key&gt;file-data&lt;/key&gt;&lt;dict&gt;&lt;key&gt;_CFURLString&lt;/key&gt;&lt;string&gt;/Applications/VLC.app&lt;/string&gt;&lt;key&gt;_CFURLStringType&lt;/key&gt;&lt;integer&gt;0&lt;/integer&gt;&lt;/dict&gt;&lt;/dict&gt;&lt;/dict&gt;" /code/pre  <answer255665> As a test in macOS Sierra, I just downloaded the vlc-2.2.4.dmg file and installed VLC to em/Applications/em via drag and drop to the Applications alias within the installer window.  In Terminal, I ran the following command:  precodedefaults write com.apple.dock persistent-apps -array-add "&lt;dict&gt;&lt;key&gt;tile-data&lt;/key&gt;&lt;dict&gt;&lt;key&gt;file-data&lt;/key&gt;&lt;dict&gt;&lt;key&gt;_CFURLString&lt;/key&gt;&lt;string&gt;/Applications/VLC.app&lt;/string&gt;&lt;key&gt;_CFURLStringType&lt;/key&gt;&lt;integer&gt;0&lt;/integer&gt;&lt;/dict&gt;&lt;/dict&gt;&lt;/dict&gt;"; killall Dock /code/pre  Note that I added code; killall Dock/code directly after the command line from your question.  As the Dock reappeared, the VLC Dock Tile was present and I then click it. VLC opened as expected.  <comment318630> somehow when I tried it, it wasn't working <comment318655> @mrjayviper, had you used `killall Dock` directly afterward the first time? If not, that is why is didn't work. When modifying com.apple.dock you have to used `killall Dock` directly afterward, either with a `;` when done in the same command line or without it directly after. <comment318723> I didn't use killall immediately. But at the end of my script is a killall Dock. <comment318729> @mrjayviper, As many of the preferences are loaded to memory at login, then when making a change with `defaults` in this case you need to use `killall Dock` directly after as the system can/will make a changes to the copy in memory and write it back to disk file and thus overwrite what you changed as it was never memory resident. That is possibly/probably what happened to you.
