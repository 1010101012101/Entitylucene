How do I get magnet links to work with Deluge? <body> How do you associate magnet links with Deluge BitTorrent Client on OS X? On other systems, you can associate magnet links with the client through emPreferences/em, but this does not seem to be the case with OS X.  <answer236411> On OS X, Deluge is unable to associate itself with magnet links due to GTK-OSX not supporting the feature (See ticket #2420).  A workaround is to use Deluge Magnet Handler. To use it, download the ZIP, extract it, move codeMagnet Handler.app/code to the Applications folder and run it once.  The application works by associating itself with magnet links and adding them to Deluge using a AppleScript when magnet links are pressed.  <answer271290> Right-click Copy Magnet URL  Go to Deluge - Add - URL - Paste - Go  <comment327795> objc[3651]: Objective-C garbage collection is no longer supported I am getting this message when trying to use deluge magnet handler any thoughts <comment327889> @kenneth A [GitHub issue about this problem](https://github.com/Lord-Kamina/Deluge-Magnet-Handler/issues/2) has been filed. On the page, you'll find a workaround (that I haven't tried personally), that'll hopefully work until the author of DMH solves the underlying problem (which he says he's trying to).
