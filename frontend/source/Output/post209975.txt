Lost a Fusion drive boot disk <body> i can see my Fusion Drive disks (ssd+hdd) in Terminal: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ni32j.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  But i lost it in the boot and cant boot MAC OS. (please see album with photos on http://imgur.com/a/N5zY2 )  I cant repair my system, when i click "check disk" on Fusion Drive it is nothing to do.  And if i want to re-install Yosemite, system did not see my Fusion Drive disks, only bootcamp (i have a windows too).  Any solution please?  <comment253385> Can you please post the output of `diskutil cs list` <comment253499> yes, look at this please, http://imgur.com/hZZWJV3
