iPhone 4 buttons don't work <body> I was trying to free up some space to upgrade to iOS7, and after I deleted all of my music and most of my apps (social, games, etc), my Home and Sleep buttons stopped working. I'm stuck in Settings. I started the upgrade, hoping the software update might solve the problem, but the progress bar has not moved a bit. I've tried using Assisstive touch and I still cannot get to my home screen, power my phone down, read my messages, or leave Settings at all. I don't know what to do.  <answer103631> If you have a recent backup with iTunes, you could try putting the phone in recovery mode (or if that doesn't help, in DFU mode) and restore it from iTunes.  See this answer on putting the phone in recovery mode or DFU mode for instructions.  <answer103632> I suggest you do a soft reset first. To do that, just hold the Power button and the Home button together until your phone restarts.  You won't lose any data doing that.  <answer108364> Try turning the phone off but if that doesn't connect your phone to. Your computer log into iTunes and if that still doesn't work I suggest u calling apple and have the help you through the process or sending you a knew phone . All you have to do is call the number 611 and you will get a variety of options. Thanks and good luck hope you get your phone fixed.   <comment308521> This is by far the best idea. If this doesn't work, the next step would probably be to connect it to a computer or take it to an Apple Store
