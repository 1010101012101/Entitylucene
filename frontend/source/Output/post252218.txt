nginx.vim syntax highlighting <body> Attempting to use a VIM syntax highlighting plugin for editing nginx config files on El Capitan. It doesn't take.  It asks that you place these files and add these directores:  precode~/.vim/syntax/nginx.vim         &lt;-- the plugin itself ~/.vim/filetype.vim.            &lt;-- additional config file /code/pre  filetype.vim contains just this one line:  precodeau BufRead,BufNewFile /etc/nginx/*,/usr/local/nginx/conf/* if &amp;ft == '' | setfiletype nginx | endif /code/pre  The default nginx config files directory, in os x (via brew install), is   precode/usr/local/etc/nginx /code/pre  I assume the comma separated wildcard paths in filetype.vim are all the paths with which to look for nginx configuration files (.conf).  No manner of editing filetype.vim will take. I've tried adding code/usr/local/etc/nginx/*/code both by itself and as one of the comma separated arguments to the codeau/code vim scripting command.   There are no error messages. Has anyone ever used nginx.vim on os x? Much thanks!  <answer252230> Wow am I a doof. I forgot to actually turn on syntax highlighting in VIM. Once I did it worked just fine.  precode:syntax on /code/pre  Welp, at least I learned something about VIM and OS X directory structure I guess! Sorry folks.
