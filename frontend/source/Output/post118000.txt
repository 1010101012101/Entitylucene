Can I move a volume from one computer to another in Time Machine? <body> I am slowly migrating from an older Mac Pro to a MacBook Air. Both machines are backed up to two different 2TB drives using Time Machine. Recently I decided that I wanted to make the extensive data I have on my older Mac Pro more available to my MacBook Air, so I bought a 1TB portable drive which I can keep with me.  I moved approx. 430GB of data onto the portable drive ('SideCarlson'). This was enough data that I figured trying to back it up while associated with the Air would not work (I read somewhere that if TM is backing up two different computers, it can't delete old backups of the OTHER computer to make room for the current one)  So, I backed it up while associated to the Mac Pro.  strongQuestion: Can I drag this backup to the new machine's backup?/strong em(See screenshot)/emimg src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/sZren.gif" alt="enter image description here"  I'm assuming I would need to:  ol liMake sure both machines' backups are current (I see both have a backup in progress)/li liTurn off Time Machine in Mac Pro ('jPro')/li liRestore 'SideCarlson' from the MacBook Air ('Air Carlson')/li /ol  Thanks for your help :)  <answer118001> No, you can't do this. The folder you've selected strongdoesn't contain the entire backup/strong, just the changes from the last backup, and many symlinks to the older data contained in other backups. Such symlinks will break if you do this.  <comment137736> thanks! does this change at all if that's the first backup of the volume? Forgot to mention that. <comment137737> @Jeremy If it's the first backup, things are slightly different. It might work, but I'd always do a Verify Backups after such changes (⌥-click the Time Machine menu bar icon), and a backup of the backup is probably a good idea… :) <comment137741> I just tried moving and was told, "The operation can’t be completed because backup items can’t be modified." I think I'm going to try a different tack. Thanks! <comment137743> @Jeremy Yeah, Finder will prevent you from modifying Time Machine backups (for good reason). You can try with Terminal though.
