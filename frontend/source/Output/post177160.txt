Window-shadow causes weird bugs in Google Chrome <body> I'm coding a website, just with a text editor and my browser. I use Sublime Text 3 and Google Chrome. When I hover my text editor over my browser, the background color of my site gets a bit darker in the area's of the shadows of the text editor. I don't really know how to explain this so have a look at this pic:  I have this on a mac of course, but when I make a screenshot the bug disappears. (Not my own pic)  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/EA0H8.jpg" alt="&quot;Weird&quot;"  I have this kind of lag when i'm dragging, but instead of window copies, the shadow lags and instead of shadows it's like a dark shade.  It's really hard to explain without pictures!  It's kinda buggin me because with this I can't really look at my website with ease.  I hope anyone has a solution or at least a similar problem!  Thanks in advance.  <comment209455> I actually have this same problem and thought I was going crazy, or my graphics card was getting ready to die. Now that I think about it, it only happens when Chrome is in the background and there is some other window on top of it. It started not long ago, maybe around January? <comment209458> @tubedogg Yes it happened to me since January too. Maybe it's because of a software update? <comment209545> I recommend doing lots of testing and reporting it on the [Chromium issues list](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/list), where someone will probably be able to help troubleshoot and fix the bug. <comment209944> Thank you, haven't seen that service before, thanks for the tip :D
