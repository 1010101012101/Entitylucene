Choppy bluetooth audio: How to persist bluetooth bitpool settings on Mavericks? <body> I am using a Bluetooth 3.0/aptX Audio Device.br Pairing the device leads to choppy audio, due to bad default bitpool settings in OSX. The issue has been widely documented, e.g. here on stackexchange.   There used to be a fix on Yosemite by setting new defaults:   precodedefaults write com.apple.BluetoothAudioAgent "Apple Bitpool Max (editable)" 80  defaults write com.apple.BluetoothAudioAgent "Apple Bitpool Min (editable)" 48  defaults write com.apple.BluetoothAudioAgent "Apple Initial Bitpool (editable)" 40  defaults write com.apple.BluetoothAudioAgent "Negotiated Bitpool" 58  defaults write com.apple.BluetoothAudioAgent "Negotiated Bitpool Max" 58  defaults write com.apple.BluetoothAudioAgent "Negotiated Bitpool Min" 48 /code/pre  This does not work on Mavericks though:  precode# defaults read com.apple.BluetoothAudioAgent 2015-01-29 17:28:12.522 defaults[80133:934404] Domain /Users/jottr/Library/Preferences/com.apple.BluetoothAudioAgent does not exist /code/pre  Writing new settings to codecom.apple.BluetoothAudioAgent/code does not affect the actual bitpool settings on Mavericks.    I am able to set Bluetooth bitpool settings in the strongBluetooth Explorer App/strong  (which is part of Xcode):   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jqCnw.png" alt="Bluetooth Explorer"  These settings are not persisted across reboots though.   strongHow can I persist the desired Bluetooth Audio Bitpool settings across reboots on Mavericks?/strong
