iCloud sync of my note deleted some parts by itself <body> I am using Notes (the stock app) on my iPhone and on my Mac, synced throught iCloud. I have a note where I put some brainstorming in. Sometimes I add stuff on my Mac, and sometimes I add to it on my iPhone.  However, when I opened Notes on my Mac, it literally deleted a paragraph (leaving only the first letters) after about two seconds opening the Notes.app (probably, after the iCloud sync). It's gone both on my Mac and on my iPhone. emI'm sure that I did not delete or write anything on that particular lost part/em. It just merged incorrectly resulting in data loss. Worse, I can't find a way to recover the lost data. Why is this happening and how do I prevent it (keeping the same iCloud sync functionality and still using the same note)?  <comment313559> Did you see the solutions on [this question](http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/47189/88313)?  Do any of the answers help? <comment313706> @fbara I haven't deleted the note, that question is about recovering a deleted note. In my case, the note is there, it's just iCloud sync wrote on top of some of its content. <comment318404> Recovering a previous version of a note, a version prior to the accidental destruction of content may help to recover this lost content. [return] But the truth is that it isn't easy to revert a syncing mechanism when it is propagating corrupted information. <comment318423> @danielAzuelos how do I recover the previous version? I could copy it from there and paste it to the newest version back. (not the best practice, but would at least revert the data loss) <comment318689> Read the question suggested by @fsb.
