To install Haskell in OSX >= 10.8.5? <body> GCC was apparently removed from the current Xcode, here.  I would like to find a standard way to install Haskell to OSX.  Not a custom way.   Brew's packages  ul lihaskell-stack/li lihomebrew/emacs/haskell-mode       Caskroom/cask/haskell-platform/li /ul  Cabal may be one solution.   How can you install Haskell in OSX?  <answer206432> Package managers like home-brew and macports will provide Haskell  There are separate Haskell releases   There are various ones in the App Store (found by google so I may have missed some)  ul liHaskell for Mac in the App Store - for Â£15 -includes and IDE/li liHaskell Platform - Open Source also available for Windows and Linux - there is an old version in macports/li /ul  <answer232415> Haskell Stack is a good option as well. For marketing purposes: Features include automatic installation of packages and separately installed and isolated GHC. Installable from Homebrew with codebrew install haskell-stack/code.
