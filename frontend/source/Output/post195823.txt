How does Finder decide if a file should be hidden? <body> There are quite a few files/direcotries under code//code. But Finder only shows 'System', 'Library', 'Users' and 'Applications'.   I create a directory called code/mnt/code, and Finder shows it. Why? What is the difference between code/mnt/code and other directories like code/bin/code or code/usr/code that makes it shown in Finder? Or how can I make code/mnt/code hidden and make code/bin/code shown?  <answer195824> I found the answer! It is controlled by the codehidden/code flag. Open Terminal,   precode$ /bin/ls -Ol /code/pre  will show you which files are flagged with codehidden/code.  To make code/mnt/code hidden, simply  precode$ sudo chflags hidden /mnt /code/pre  To change back  precode$ sudo chflags nohidden /mnt /code/pre  Cheers!
