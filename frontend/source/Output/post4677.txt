iTunes synching all-day events one or two days early <body> Just out of the blue, iTunes starts synching my all-day events in Outlook (standalone, no Exchange server) one day after the event and in some cases TWO days early.  I've already checked the time-zone issues and tried replacing all the iPhone calendar with the Outlook calendar  Using     ul liiPhone 3g/li liOutlook 2010 64bits/li liiTunes 10.2 /li /ul  strongUpdate/strong: I've downgraded the phone to iOS 3.1.3 and still have the same problem  strongUpdate 2/strong: here is a vCal asked in comments. It's a birthday that it's on jun-6 and on the iPhone it's on jun-5  precodeBEGIN:VCALENDAR PRODID:-//Microsoft Corporation//Outlook 14.0 MIMEDIR//EN VERSION:2.0 METHOD:PUBLISH X-MS-OLK-FORCEINSPECTOROPEN:TRUE BEGIN:VEVENT CREATED:20110531T120427Z DTEND;VALUE=DATE:20090606 DTSTAMP:20110531T120427Z DTSTART;VALUE=DATE:20090605 LAST-MODIFIED:20110531T120427Z RRULE:FREQ=YEARLY;BYMONTHDAY=6;BYMONTH=6 SEQUENCE:0 SUMMARY:Cumple Juanjo TRANSP:TRANSPARENT UID:040000008200E00074C5B7101A82E00800000000C02147BE711FCC01000000000000000     01000000021D38136E245D8419393E44CC34FF56A X-MICROSOFT-CDO-BUSYSTATUS:FREE END:VEVENT END:VCALENDAR /code/pre  I see that codeDTSTART/code tells jun-5 but don't know if this affects the iPhone or how to change it.  strongUpdate 3/strong: The recurrence range start is the culprit. Outlook have different fields for the actual recurrence date and other the recurrence start, but vCal has only one date, so Outlook use the recurrence range start instead of the actual date.  <comment11965> Hi Eduardo - I'm having the same problems (iphone 4 & Outlook 2010) - I have also tried the same things as you have without any success - I look forward to any help withthis issue - Michael <comment12009> Michael: no luck so far: My iPhone calendar is useless <comment16243> Can you make a few fake events, export them from Outlook into vCal format, and then post it here? Might be helpful. <comment16259> Jordan: added vCal <comment16644> Have you considered switching to another program or service? If you're using a Mac, iCal is quite good. If you're using Windows, you could try using MobileMe or Google Calendar. (I know this doesn't answer your question, but it might help remove your problem)
