When does the arp cache get emptied? <body> does anyone know when the arp cache in OS X Lion gets emptied? Or which automatism causes it to get emptied? Is it a time period, which can be set somewhere?

The route to a directly-attached Ethernet network is installed as a  ``cloning'' route (one with the RTF_CLONING flag set), causing routes to individual  hosts on that network to be created on demand.  These routes time out periodically  (normally 20 minutes after validated; entries are not validated when not in use).  /code/pre   You can manually manage the ARP table using the codearp/code command.
