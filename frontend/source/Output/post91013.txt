how to auto download a certain attachment in mail <body> I have looked on stack exchange and other sites for a simple applescript. I have found more complex scripts that it's hard for me to understand (not knowing a lot about the applescript syntax). So, here's my dilemma:  I need to automatically download an attachment (i.e. named "blank expense report") to a specific folder (i.e. "Inbox"). That's it. I can setup the mail rule with parameters to find the attachment I'm looking for:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3ZUUR.png" alt="enter image description here"  I just need a simple script to download the attachment.   I have looked at these but just got confused trying to alter them and actually messed up some non-essential files on my computer. So, I'll stop copying and pasting code and just ask for some help.   h3Questions I looked at before this./h3  Save attachments from Mail.app based on subject  Automatically Save Attachments in Mail.app in 10.8 Mountain Lion  <answer91019> This is an edited version — quite possibly not the best one — of the script shown in this answer to the Automatically Save Attachments in Mail.app in 10.8 Mountain Lion thread, I've tested it and it works:  precodeusing terms from application "Mail"     on perform mail action with messages theMessages for rule theRule         tell application "Mail"             repeat with eachMessage in theMessages                 repeat with theAttachment in eachMessage's mail attachments                     set attachmentName to name of theAttachment                     if attachmentName is "blank expense report" then                         set savePath to "Macintosh HD:Users:yourUsername:Inbox:" &amp; attachmentName                         try                             save theAttachment in file (savePath)                         end try                     end if                 end repeat             end repeat         end tell     end perform mail action with messages end using terms from /code/pre  This script will save the attachment named "blank expense report" in a named "Inbox" at codeMachintosh HD:Users:yourUsername:Inbox/code.

I've changed the location to the correct one. I don't know how to troubleshoot this one. <comment107079> Sorry I don't know what to say, it works here. I can suggest putting some `display alert "something"` in the code to get a hint about where the script stops working properly. <comment108588> I tried what you said (thanks for the simple troubleshoot tip - i love it) and the script seemed to stop before the second to last line. Before `end perform mail action with messages`(aka the message didn't display after this section but did display before the line).
