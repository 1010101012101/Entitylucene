HTTP Live Streaming Not Working on OS X <body> I'm having trouble getting HTTP Live streaming to work on my desktop in any browser. Sample pages like the following work fine on the iPad and others' computers in Safari, but I get a black screen and no sound in Safari and a big quicktime with a question mark on mine:  precode http://developer.longtailvideo.com/player/trunk/fl5/js/test/examples/m3u8.html /code/pre  What do I need to do to make HTTP Live Streaming work on my desktop? I am running a MacBook Pro with an Intel Core 2 Duo processor, OS X 10.6.8, Safari 5.1.2, and QuickTime 10.0.  <comment39960> works fine for me. are you sure you are actually using an intel mac with safari 5+ :P? <comment39961> I've updated with my relevant specs (as I understand them). Sorry about the uninformative post. <comment39962> then try opening the console, maybe some errors occured ( Iam using Lion btw ) <comment39963> Nothing in the console :(
