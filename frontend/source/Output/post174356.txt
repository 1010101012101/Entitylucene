Can iOS devices be made to print over SSL? <body> I configured the Avahi/CUPS combination here and we can now submit print-jobs from iPhones and iPads on the LAN.  However, it seems, the job-submissions are emnot/em encrypted -- something, I'd like to rectify if at all possible. Though I "trust" the emwired/em part of the home LAN, the WiFi can, in theory, be intruded with relative ease.  Am I right suspecting the jobs being submitted in the clear by default? The reasons for my suspicion is that none of the devices prompted me about the self-signed certificate, which my CUPS-server is using...  Can the things be configured to use SSL or is that not even an option at the moment?  <comment205295> so if you encrypt it on the sender end, how will it be decrypted at the receiving end (the printer) <comment205298> First, an iOS device is not sending to printer, it is sending to a CUPS-server, which renders it into format understandible to printer and submits it there (via wired LAN). Second, encryption/decryption via SSL is too much to explain here. Your browser encrypted your comment and, somehow, the server decrypted it... Think about it.
