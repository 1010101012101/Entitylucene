Application to launch specific applications, windows, and tabs <body> I am a programmer. I'd like to improve my workflow by being able to have a "saved workspace". When I start my computer, or whenever I'm ready to resume a project, I want to launch a specific set of browser tabs, terminal windows, text editor, etc. and when finished, "save" the state of my tabs/windows so I can resume again later.  My current workflow is to never close any windows and never shut down my computer.  I don't know of an application like this but I would really like to find (or build) one.  <answer106188> Mac OS X has been trying to achieve something like this on a per-app basis using Saved Application State, however, that will only retrieve the emlast known/em state of an app, not some arbitrary one from the past.  I'm not sure of any app which can do that.  The closest that I am aware of would be a macro which could, for example:  ul lilaunch a specific set of applications/li liopen a specific set of URLs in a web browser /li liopen a specific set of files in a specific app (or apps)/li /ul  You could also add optional features such as   ul liquit all of your currently-open applications before beginning (or quit specific apps, like your email and twitter client) when you know you are going to work/li /ul  This is very simple to do in Keyboard Maestro, which has a free, 30-day demo on the site.   For example, in the image attached I have created a macro like this as an example. I will use numbers to correspond with the numbers on the image to show what each step is doing:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dZ2j1.png" alt="enter image description here"  ol liThis macro (read simply as: "series of actions") will take place either if I choose the menu from the menu bar…/li li…or if I use the keyboard shortcut I have specified. (Other actions are also available /li liQuit all applications /li liHide the Dock, if it is visible /li liLaunch BBEdit/li liLaunch Terminal.app/li liLaunch Safari /li liOpen the URL https://apple.stackexchange.com/?tab=featured in Safari./li liOpen the URL http://gmail.com in Chrome/li liOpen a folder in Finder/li /ol  this is just an example for illustration. I could have told Keyboard Maestro to run any sort of command, or open specific files in other applications.  The only thing which is emnot/em possible, as far as I am aware in any app, is the ability to say: "Ok, save everything that is on my screen right now and remember it for later."  <comment125191> Thanks for your answer. That looks pretty cool. I will have to check it out.
