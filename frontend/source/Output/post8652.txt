buffering location /tmp? <body> I was a long time Ubuntu user before I moved on to a Mac; so I'm used to seeing videos on YouTube and copying the buffered files from /tmp to another place for later viewing, if I like the video.  I tried doing the same on my Mac but its not working. Are the videos being buffered to a location other than /tmp?  <answer8749> Likely they reside in the Application's Cache directory.  Look into code(HOME)/Library/Caches/code and code(HOME)/Library/Application Support/code  <answer10616> As an alternative, you can use something like Tooble to watch videos and later download them in the format of your choice. It has a free and a pro version as far as I know. I use the free and it works.
