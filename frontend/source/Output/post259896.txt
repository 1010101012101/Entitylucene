How can I increase my scrolling speed with a third party mouse? <body> Currently using a Razer DeathAdder gaming mouse with the driver software installed, and I have tried adjusting the scrolling speed in the system preferences in both Mouse Settings and in Accessibility (not sure why there is 2 different settings).  If anyone has any suggestions, I would greatly appreciate it. I have to scroll through a lot of code when I work and my pointer finger is getting disproportionally muscular.  Using macOS Sierra on a 27 inch Late 2013 iMac.  <answer259903> Figured out the problem. The Razer official driver takes over the mouse settings, but does not allow you to configure mouse scroll speed, and the setting was too low.   Well that is annoying.  <answer259989> Some 3rd party applications add more settings to control the behaviour of the mouse/trackpad. BetterTouchTool does that, for example.  <comment325257> Same mouse.That official driver sucks in windows,too <comment325263> [SteerMouse](http://plentycom.jp/en/steermouse/) is a good replacement driver/CP for scroll, as well as customisable button layouts, on a per app or global basis.
