How to restore Mac Time Machine backup from a remote mac system? <body> I've created a backup of my Mac using the Time Machine feature. What I'd like to do is to restore this backup from a remote mac system. I have a number of Mac systems I'm testing software on. I need to get them back to a clean state before I can run another set of tests. I need to be able to do this via some remote Terminal command or similar. Any tips offered would be great! Thanks, J.
