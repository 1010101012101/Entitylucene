Unable to activate iPhone 3GS with SIM card. <body> I have an iPhone 3GS and I have the right active SIM card for it, but for some reason I can't seem to go past the activation screen.  What can I do?  <comment133478> I think I am having trouble getting a full picture of your problem. Could you describe what activation screen you are seeing (or even better, post a picture of it)? iPhones typically work without SIM cards, so perhaps there is something wrong with the phone itself. Also, did this iPhone work with a previous SIM? <comment140331> Is this still an issue? If so, can you provide a screenshot?
