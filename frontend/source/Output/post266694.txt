I have macOS 10.12.2 on MacBook Pro mid 2015.  <answer282379> I had the same issue and resolved it by signing out (Store  Sign Out) then signing back in again.   <answer285987> As suggested by the other answer, I signed out. From there I got:     This Apple ID is only valid for purchases in the German iTunes Store. You will be switched to that Store.   After this it worked.  <comment334414> Are you signed-in to the App Store with the same Apple ID that was used for the original download of those apps?
