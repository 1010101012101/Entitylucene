Mac Sierra - Batch Convert Pages to Plain Text <body> Trying to batch convert pages to plain text but I keep running into issues with file permissions. (Using Sierra 10.2.3 after upgrading from 10.2.2)     filename could not be exported. You don't have permission.   Two methods so far:   preon run     tell application "Finder"         set mfolder to "Macintosh HD:Users:me:Documents:convertme:"         set theFiles to name of every file of folder mfolder     end tell     set theFolder to "Macintosh HD:Users:me:Documents:converted:"     tell application "Pages"         activate         repeat with aFile in theFiles             open aFile             set sourceFolder to POSIX path of aFile             set newsourceFolder to characters 1 thru -8 of sourceFolder as string             set theFolder to newsourceFolder & ".txt"             export front document to POSIX file theFolder as unformatted text             close front document         end repeat     end tell end run /pre  Also tried with Automator: on Ask for Finder Item  prefunction run(input, parameters) {     inFile  = Path( input );     outFile = Path( input.toString().replace(/\.[^\.]+$/, '.pdf') );     pages    = Application('Pages');     document = pages.open( inFile );     pages.export(document, {to: outFile, as: 'PDF'});     pages.close(document, {saving: 'no'});     return outFile; } /pre  Permissions on folder set to: everyone read&amp;write  <answer272153> This script works for me, tested on strongMacOS Sierra/strong and strongPages/strong Version 6.0.5  precodeset mfolder to "Macintosh HD:Users:me:Documents:convertme:" set destFolder to "Macintosh HD:Users:me:Documents:converted:"  tell application "Finder" to set theNames to name of files of folder mfolder  tell application "Pages"     repeat with aName in theNames         set theDoc to open ((mfolder &amp; aName) as alias)         set newFile to destFolder &amp; (text 1 thru -7 of aName) &amp; ".txt" -- concat destFolder and the name without the ".pages" extension          my makenewFile(newFile)          export theDoc to file newFile as unformatted text         close theDoc     end repeat end tell  on makenewFile(thePath)     close access (open for access thePath)     -- delay 0.5 -- use the delay command, If you still have a permission issue,  increase the number of seconds end makenewFile /code/pre  <comment341789> Do `mfolder` and `theFolder` already exist and if so do you have permission to read/write to them? That said, why are you creating generic folders directly under Users, that's a poor practice! You should set the folder to read from and write to somewhere within your own Home folder as that should avoid permission errors. (That's assuming you have permission to read the source files in the first place.) <comment341808> oh, i'm actually creating them as a long sub folder under Users but truncated that for simplicity.. <comment341810> i just checked and made sure everyone had read&write permissions... still getting the same error <comment342103> Did you check the access rights on the pages files as well? How do the filenames look like, are there any non-ASCII characters in it (any umlauts or other utf8 characters)? <comment342111> cool! apparently this gets by the weird permissions issue - 'close access (open for access thePath)' <comment342255> regular ascii files... tried with others too... apparently you are supposed to use `close access` as indicated below
