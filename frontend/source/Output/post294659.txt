How to make executable .py file (for non-programmer)? <body> I'm on strongUbuntu 16.04/strong and I've created a python script for my colleague - he has strongMacOS/strong. Assume that he doesn't know anything about bash or python.   So I don't want to make him running this script from strongbash/strong. I would like him just to strongdouble click/strong on file to execute the script.   How would you do that?   Adding:  precode#!/usr/bin/env python /code/pre  alongside   precodechmod +x filename  /code/pre  Doesn't work on my Ubuntu so I suppose it won't work on MacOS  This is a top of the script:  precode#!/usr/bin/env python # coding=utf-8 import os try:     import jinja2 except ImportError:     import pip     pip.main(['install','jinja2']) /code/pre  EDIT: I can't access his Mac so either I have to give him clear instructions or create some executable.  <answer294676> You can simply rename the file and make it file extension "command" instead. Plus, you have to make it executable (like you do before with chmod +x). Simply name it "jinja.command", instead of "jinja.py" for example.  Then, you will see terminal window opened with text output (if you have one in your application), as far as the "program terminated" string.  <answer294682> You want a tool called Platypus. It provides very clear guidance on turning scripts into apps.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/usFxD.png" alt="enter image description here"  ul lihttp://sveinbjorn.org/platypus//li /ul     Platypus is a Mac OS X developer tool that creates native Mac OS X applications from interpreted scripts such as shell scripts or Perl, Ruby and Python programs. This is done by wrapping the script in an application bundle along with a native executable binary that runs the script.   <comment371933> Looks reasonable to me, why does it not work on Ubuntu? It should work on macOS, assuming the python executable in PATH has the required version and all the libraries are either installed or installable. <comment371935> I'm not sure. But even if I do this steps, when I click on file.py, it is opened in gedit (text editor). <comment371940> Didn't help, still opening in gedit. <comment371942> You should use the extension ".command" to execute files with console scripts for macOS only. The answer was about macOS, because originally you asked about mac. If you want the same thing, but for ubuntu, you should use another approach: https://askubuntu.com/questions/286621/how-do-i-run-executable-scripts-in-nautilus <comment371946> That's a Linux issue then. As long as your friend doesn't have configured their Mac to open `.py` files in an editor you should be fine. <comment371948> @MilanoSlesarik I'll add a Mac specific tool as another answer. It lets you keep your script set for all platforms and the Mac specific GUI separate. <comment371978> Would this work on a directory library?
