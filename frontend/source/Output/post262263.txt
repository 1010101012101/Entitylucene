dd command finished very quickly but does not transfer data <body> I'm trying to restore a Windows installer image to an external hard drive. To do this, I decided to use the command line because Disk Utility never bloody works.   To identify the disk, I used codediskutil list/code which generated the following output:  precode$ diskutil list /dev/disk0 (internal, physical):    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *500.3 GB   disk0    1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1    2:          Apple_CoreStorage Macintosh HD            499.4 GB   disk0s2    3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s3  /dev/disk1 (internal, virtual):    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:                            Macintosh HD           +499.0 GB   disk1                                  Logical Volume on disk0s2                                  604D1BA8-46A5-41AD-8D62-7898021A4D16                                  Unencrypted  /dev/disk3 (external, physical):    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *500.1 GB   disk3    1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk3s1    2:                  Apple_HFS 500G Storage            489.8 GB   disk3s2    3:       Microsoft Basic Data WINDOWS                 9.9 GB     disk3s3 /code/pre  I identified the disk I want to use as codedisk3s3/code, a 10GB MS-FAT partition on the external hard drive. I then unmounted it with codesudo diskutil unmount /dev/disk3s3/code. Now, to restore an ISO image to this partition, I use the following command:  code$ sudo dd if=~/Desktop/Windows.iso of=~/dev/disk3s3 bs=1m/code  I don't get any errors upon running the command initially but after only a few seconds it finishes with this output:  precode3165+1 records in 3165+1 records out 3319764992 bytes transferred in 10.191605 secs (325735246 bytes/sec) /code/pre  However much I wished this output was correct, it is not. No data whatsoever was transferred to the drive. How is this possible?  Thanks in advance  <answer262272> Everything is OK except that you shouldn't use ~ in dd commands (it's not forbidden but error-prone) and of=~/dev/disk3s3 is a file in your /Users/yourusername/dev folder (which probably wasn't intended but explains the 326 MB/s) instead of the real destination em/dev/disk3s3/em.  So better enter:  precodesudo dd if=~/Desktop/Windows.iso of=/dev/disk3s3 bs=1m /code/pre  or much better  precodesudo dd if=/Users/yourusername/Desktop/Windows.iso of=/dev/disk3s3 bs=1m /code/pre  <comment328538> Or use: `sudo dd if=$HOME/Desktop/Windows.iso ...` <comment328549> Ahh stupid typo... `~/dev/disk3s3` isn't even a thing haha! <comment328551> @RoemerBakker If you have a dev folder (visible or invisible) in your user folder the command **will** create the file disk3s3. If you **don't** have a dev folder, no file will be created and you get an error: `... No such file or directory`. So check your $HOME/dev and delete the file disk3s3... ;-)
