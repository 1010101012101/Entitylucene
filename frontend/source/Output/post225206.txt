Can an iPhone 4 be updated to iOS 9? <body> I would like to update to iOS 9.2.1 on my iPhone 4, which is currently running iOS 7.1.2. Is this possible?  <answer225209> Sorry but iOS 9 isn't supported on iPhone 4.  As you can see at the bottom of this page, the oldest supported iPhone is the iPhone 4s.  http://www.apple.com/ios/whats-new/  iOS 8 isn't even available for iPhone 4. As you can see here.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iOS_8#Supported_devices  The last supported OS is iOS 7.  <comment273259> Welcome to Ask Different. What have you tried? Are you looking for Apple's page of what hardware supports iOS 9.2.1 or is there something else you don't know.
