Why do I get 'low battery' as an alert despite changing notification of type 'phone' to banner? <body>    settings  notifications  phone      alert style when unlocked: banners   so why am I getting 'low battery' warnings as alerts?  I wouldn't mind but the fact that the OS doesn't detect I am in the middle of typing or other activity is shockingly bad UI design  <comment175004> The purpose of an Alert is to do just that, when ever a Alert was triggered. The low battery alert is important to make sure you do not loose your work.
