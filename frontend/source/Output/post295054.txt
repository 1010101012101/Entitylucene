macbook pro - disable csrutil without recovery mode <body> So, my MacBook Pro just died and it appears to be the standard known issue with the graphics card. There seems to be a possible fix by moving some system files around.   However, to do this, I have to disable SIP protection.   To disable SIP, i have to boot up in recovery mode.  MacBook won't boot up in recovery mode - grey screen of death  MacBook can boot up in single user mode however.  There are tales that you can boot in single user recovery mode by holding down command-R-S on boot, but that did not work for me.  What can i do?  <answer295055> You can't, and that's by design. If an attacker could disable system protection while the OS was booted it'd be pointless. If you find something, please file a radar because this is an important security component. Single user mode is the same as normal OSX just stopped a bit before a bunch of niceties load, so no dice there. You'll have to get into recovery mode somehow and if you can't even boot to single user recovery you might have a bigger issue than just GPUs.   You could, potentially, boot using an eGPU if I understand the issue. Issue is an eGPU is hard to find and more expensive to buy than just fixing your laptop.  <comment372406> Can you bring it to Apple? <comment372429> I did and they diagnosed the problem as a bad graphics card. Came home and researched it and wanted to try this test before doing the $500 logic board fix. If I go back, do you think they can fix it?
