On OSX what is the opposite command to "say", i.e. what command is there for speech recognition? <body> I'd like to be able to enter a command that registers a speakable word that OS/X can listen for all the time. When the user speaks that word, it should launch an app. Similar to the "OK google" idea.  But is this possible these days? Last I heard of people doing this was in 2010.  <answer171156> If you go to System preferences -- Accessibility-- Speakable items In settings turn on speakable items, and you can provide a keyword. After saying the keyword you can say commands.   <comment201375> There's no such thing in yosemite. <comment201459> Yes, Yosemite does things a little differently, but you can still set up your own voice keywords: http://www.macworld.com/article/2834532/ok-mac-using-automators-dictation-commands-new-in-yosemite.html <comment207733> That article appears to be out of date already.
