Incoming iPhone 5 calls showing only the number, but the caller is in my contact list <body> I just unblocked my iPhone 5 with a Gevey SIM and extracted my contact list from iCloud.  Every contact shows up, no problem there, but when someone calls me, only the numbers appear but no name from the caller, even having that contact on my contact list.   Even if it seem to have all my contacts in order, it doesn't seem to merge or I don't know what to do. I restarted the iPhone, connected it to iTunes... What could be wrong?
