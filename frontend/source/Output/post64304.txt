Apple Numeric Keyboard can't render the at sign "@" on Mac Mini <body> I just got a new numeric keyboard for my Mac Mini but when I press codeShift + 2/code, I don't get the at sign (@)--instead, it's a double quote. Then, codeShift + 4/code shows a euro instead of code$/code, codeShift + 6/code an ampersand (&amp;) instead of a code^/code, etc. How do I fix this?  <answer64306> I checked "US," then the checkbox beside "Danish" was enabled, then I unchecked it.  <comment75489> Which language is set for your Mac Mini? <comment75490> I just saw now from the Input Sources that "Danish" is checked but for some reason the checkbox is disabled. I'm following this tutorial: www.wikihow.com/Change-the-Language-of-a-Mac
