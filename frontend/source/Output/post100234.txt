How to bend a path in Keynotes? <body> I can not find the 'curved path button' in the Build Inspector which allows me to curve a path. Can anyone tell me where to find it?   <answer100236> You can find it in the strongBuild Inspector/strong under the strongAction/strong emtab/em.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/AbyPf.png" alt="The Build Inspector"   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0Yj6B.png" alt="The Curved Path Button"  <comment117965> At my version the boxes beneath 'Path' were empty (no lines in it) so I did not realize what they were for. Thank you, ths was all I needed to know!
