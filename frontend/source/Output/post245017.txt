How can I truncate filenames after X number of characters using Automator or AppleScript? <body> I have IFTTT sending several new desktop wallpapers per day from Reddit to Dropbox. These wallpapers arrive often with very long filenames. I need a way to automatically shorten their names (without renaming to date and time) when they're downloaded to my Mac by Dropbox.  Could someone please give me an Automator folder action or AppleScript I can put in Hazel to truncate the filenames after X number of characters? I want the action to run automatically, so it can't require me to select Finder items or supply the number of characters to keep; it just needs to run by itself as a folder action or AS via Hazel.  Thank you.  <answer245688> Do we have to be concerned about the names being the same? If not, this should work for you as an embedded AppleScript in Hazel:  precodetell application "Finder"     set original_name to name of theFile     set short_name to characters 1 thru 10 of original_name as string     set name of theFile to (short_name &amp; ".png" as string) end tell /code/pre  You'd set Hazel to run this rule on "any file" then "Run AppleScript" (embedded).  You can change the number of characters easily. I picked ten. Do what works for you. Also, I guessed that your images are ".png" files-- you would change that to ".jpg" or whatever.  I hope this helps you!  <comment304326> Perfect! Thank you very much! <comment304488> You're welcome. My pleasure.
