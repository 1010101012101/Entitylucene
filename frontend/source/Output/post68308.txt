How do I copy the location of a track to the "Comments" section in iTunes? <body> I dont understand why this is not working. If anybody knows how to resolve this issue:   precodetell application "iTunes"   copy location of track 1 of playlist "Test" to Comments end tell /code/pre   Applescript does now show an error but when I see in iTunes, the "Comments" field is still empty.  Thanks!  <answer68310> Because you copy the location to the codeComments/code variable.  Here's how to put the location in the codecomment/code tag.   precodetell application "iTunes"   tell track 1 of playlist "Test" to set comment to (its location as text)   -- or set comment  of track 1 of playlist "Test" to (get location of track 1 of playlist "Test") as text end tell /code/pre   <answer68311> This should do the trick:  precodetell application "iTunes"     set theLocation to location of track 1 of playlist "Test"     set the comment of track 1 of playlist "Test" to POSIX path of theLocation as string end tell /code/pre  The codeas string/code is the key here, otherwise the types are incompatible.  If you want it as a one liner, you can do:  precodetell application "iTunes" to copy the POSIX path of (location of track 1 of playlist "Test" as string) to comment of track 1 of playlist "Test" /code/pre  If you want the old Mac style paths with colons (codeMacintosh HD:Users:rob:Music/code) instead of Unix style (code/Users/rob/Music/code), you can remove the codePOSIX path of/code parts of either of those.
