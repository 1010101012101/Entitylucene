RTF files created using the 'touch' command will not open <body> I'm no expert on CLI or using the terminal or anything, but I like playing around with my computer.  When I create a .txt .html or .md file or whatever using the 'touch' command in terminal, they work fine. But .rtf file I create just give me the error   "The document “foo.rtf” could not be opened."  What am I doing wrong? Are you not able to create files in this manner?  <answer101440> As you've likely discovered, codetouch/codeing a nonexistent file will create a zero-byte file with the name you specify.  (codetouch/code is also used to update the modification time on an existing file.  See codeman touch/code for further details.)  The problem you're running into is that though a completely empty file is valid HTML, text, or Markdown, it is emnot/em valid RTF—this is true of many file formats, actually, which are structured in a particular way and require some data to be present be valid.  Based on my experimentation, the bare minimum RTF file appears to be  precode{\rtf1} /code/pre  If you'd like to create a blank RTF file from the shell, try this:  precodeecho '{\rtf1}' &gt;Foo.rtf  /code/pre  Note the above will overwrite codeFoo.rtf/code if it exists.  <comment119516> Thank you, @zigg. I really appreciate that you explain the reasoning behind this. If I may ask for my own understanding, what is happening with {\rtf1}? Is that setting some sort of data about the file? <comment119518> I believe all RTF documents use it as the top-level construct.  Try saving out an RTF document and using the `cat` command to dump it to the screen—every one I've seen starts with `{\rtf1`.
