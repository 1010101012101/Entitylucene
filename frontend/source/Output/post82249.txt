Sound always comes from Apple Thunderbolt Display even with headphones connected <body> I have an issue using the Apple Thunderbolt Display. I have a Dell XPS laptop with Windows 8 where I connect to the display over Thunderbolt, but every time I try to listen to some music or video, the sound comes from the screen, not from my laptop, even if I plug headphones into the laptop. How can I solve this problem? I want to work using my laptop and the screen but I want to redirect the sound to my headphones. Is this possible?  <answer82251> strongIn Windows/strong, you can typically choose a different output-source using this approach:     For switching outputs, try this:br   Right click on the speaker icon in the tray. Choose "playback   devices". Select from the list of playback devices (speakers, hdmi,   usb headset,) (the device you want) Choose "Set Default" Your audio   output will instantly switch subsupSource/sup/sub   For quick access to this, you can download this application.  strongApplicable to OS X users/strong:br You should be able to see the earphones in the music menu. Hold down kbdAlt/kbd while clicking the Audio-icon in the menubar. There you can switch between the different audio devices, like the external screen and the earphones.  This can also be done from System Prefrences - Sound and the tab Output.  <answer189307> For those seeing this in OS X instead of Windows, there is a separate sound output selection box for "Sound Effects". Make sure to select Headphones.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/U8siH.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment94903> It's impossible I am using Windows 8 <comment94905> Oh, sorry. I'll see if I can find a solution that works there as well. <comment94910> Ok thanks it works perfectly. <comment94911> I'm glad! You're welcome. <comment94926> On OS X, you can also hold Alt and tap one of the three volume buttons on the keyboard. It'll open Sound Preferences.
