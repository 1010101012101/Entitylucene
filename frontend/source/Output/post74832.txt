right shift key goes to desktop <body> I have an imac running OS 10.8.2 with a bluetooth keyboard.  I have had it for about 8 weeks.  When I hit the right shift key, all the open windows run off the screen and I am looking at the desktop.  When I hit it again, the windows come back.

Suggestions?    <answer74851> Is this setting &#x65;&#x6e;&#x61;&#x62;&#x6c;&#x65;&#x64;?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Uur3h.png" alt=""
