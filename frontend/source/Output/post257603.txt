Now when i open Terminal I get this  precodeLast login: Mon Oct 17 01:36:24 on ttys000 -bash:  : command not found -bash:  : command not found -bash:    git: command not found -bash: gt: command not found -bash: /dev/null: Permission denied -&gt;&gt; $  /code/pre  the last line is changed in StackExchange's text editor, I do not understand why please look at the uploaded photo below - this is how it looks in my terminal  I deleted bash_profile and I still get the same.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/cj1MV.png" alt="Stupid screen shot"  Every command I write is followed by:   precode-bash:    git: command not found -bash: gt: command not found -bash: /dev/null: Permission denied /code/pre  What should I do it to stop it?  Update from comments: Here's what I put in the file.  precodeexport CLICOLOR=1 export LSCOLORS=GxBxCxDxexegedabagaced parse_git_branch() {     git branch 2&amp;gt; /dev/null |     sed -e '/^[^*]/d' -e 's/* (.*)/ (\1)/' } export PS1="\e[0;35m-&amp;gt;&amp;gt; \e[1;34m\W\e[0;32m\$(parse_git_branch)\e[0;37m $ " /code/pre  <answer258133> The code&amp;gt;/code is a syntax error, apparently caused by HTML markup in whatever source you copy/pasted this from.  Where you see code&amp;gt;/code the author intended code&gt;/code and where you see code&amp;lt;/code the author intended code&lt;/code.  If there's an code&amp;amp;/code that will need to be replaced with a literal code&amp;/code etc.  See a listing of HTML entity codes for a somewhat more exhaustive list.  <comment321741> Note the file is not bash_profile but .bash_profile <comment321760> Thank you Mark, I edited .bash_profile and it is back to default now. In my confusion I created two files .bash_profile and bash_profile. Any idea how to change my terminal look into ubuntu like style and colours without getting this weird messages? <comment321762> I also forgot about the existence of the hidden files:) <comment321795> The wierd messages are because you messed you PATH and are nothing tom do with prompt colours - there are other questions re coliours <comment321806> can you give us the content of your .bash_profile? You can edit your first post and add the content there. I think there is something wrong in your profile. <comment321807> thanks, I have noticed that I have had a wrong link to the article I have been using. I have edited my post and it shows the correct link. Could you please have a look at it and see why the recommended lines put into my .bash_profile are messing my path? <comment321808> Using the article I wrote this into .bash_profile:              export CLICOLOR=1 export LSCOLORS=GxBxCxDxexegedabagaced   parse_git_branch() {    git branch 2&gt; /dev/null | sed -e '/^[^*]/d' -e 's/* \(.*\)/ (\1)/' }   export PS1="\e[0;35m-&gt;&gt; \e[1;34m\W\e[0;32m\$(parse_git_branch)\e[0;37m $ " <comment321810> Please ask a new question regarding the faulty color guide instead of spamming the comments. <comment322602> There's a comment on the blog post about this as well, but it's rather obscurely phrased.
