Photostream/Photo import duplicates <body> If I use photo stream and later plug my iPhone into the computer. Will I end up with a bunch of duplicates? Or will it import from my phone only any photos that weren't previously uploaded, for whatever reason, via photo stream?  <answer139224> strongNo duplicates will be uploaded/strong to Photo Streamâ€”only media that didn't get uploaded will be uploaded. This general rule also applies to photos transferred to other devices; the other device won't upload duplicates either.
