Why does Mountain Lion keep using the wrong screen saver? <body> I have my screen saver set to Arabesque. If I move my mouse down to the Screen Saver hot corner, I get Arabesque. If I sit and wait for the screen saver to start automatically, I get Arabesque.  But if I leave my computer for any length of time and come back to it, it's almost always on Message, putting the name of my Mac up for everyone to see. I dislike this behavior. If I go to System Preferences after this happens, it's still on Arabesque, it's just ignoring the setting.  What's going on? Is there any way to fix it?  <answer87513> "Almost" always? Uncheck the use random screensaver button in the Desktop &amp; Screen Saver preferences.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7PgeJ.gif" alt="enter image description here"  <answer87584> If your computer is locked, the screensaver settings for the root user account is used instead of your own. You can change those settings according to the answer to this question: How can I set the Mac OS X screensaver when not logged in?  <comment102322> Do you lock your computer before leaving it? If so, you might be getting other settings than your own user's.

That question led me to [this answer](http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/16515/4920) on a different question which was exactly what I needed. Add an answer to that effect and I'll mark it correct! <comment102405> I read your question.  No need to be rude. Selecting Arabesque has nothing to do with the state of the "Use random screen saver" checkbox.  I was just trying to be helpful.  Maybe you should edit your question to more accurately describe your problem. <comment102447> Ah, I see. Mountain Lion doesn't have that checkbox there. "Random" is an option along with all the other screensavers. Even so, the behavior I described doesn't fit your assumption, and I thought you were a bit sarcastic in your answer. I do apologize if that wasn't your intent, and I un-downvoted you. <comment102458> Thanks.  I'll un-downvote your question as soon as i'm able.  Right now, my vote's locked in unless the question is edited. <comment102459> done.  cheers, mate.
