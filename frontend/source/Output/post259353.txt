Video file renamed to .exe by MacBook now unplayable. Help? <body> So guys, recently I got some videos from a security camera. The videos were in mpeg/mp4. They worked fine on Windows with a third party player. After trying to play those videos on my Mac they were renamed or converted (I don't know) to an .exe file... I tried renaming them back but now I can't play them! Does anyone now how to fix this!? Thank you!   <comment324471> How did the files get renamed with a `.exe` extension in the first place? I'd like to see the first 30 bytes of one the files, so in a Terminal do the following.  Type `cat `, that's "cat " followed by a _space_. Now drag & drop one of the files that got renamed onto the Terminal window and it populates the command line with its _fully qualified pathname_. Now type (or copy and paste) `| head -c 30 | xxd -p` and press enter.  The output will be in _hex_ format, e.g.: `0000001c667479706d7034320000000169736f6d6d703431617663310000` <comment324475> Another way to find out what format the file is actually in (or at least make a good guess), is to open Terminal, type `file ` ("file" followed by a space), then drag & drop the file into the Terminal window, then press Return. The `file` command will analyze its contents, and report what format it looks like.
