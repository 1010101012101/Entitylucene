Restoring lost icons <body> I recently installed Yosemite on my MacBook Air. I note that my Reading List items no longer display the icon/logo from the web pages. They were very handy for quickly locating the item I was looking for without having to read through all the text. Is there a way to restore them?   <answer193008> Lets try following to restore your old reading list:  Quit Safari. In the Finder, hold down the option key and select      Go  Library   from the menu bar.   The reading list is stored in the file Safari/Bookmarks.plist in the Library folder.   You have two choices:  Restore the file from a strongbackup/strong that predates the issue; or  Move the file to the Desktop, relaunch Safari, and import from the old bookmarks file (File  Import Bookmarks...).  <comment230087> Eek! Not sure what I did wrong. History folder has now disappeared. plist file is on the desktop but after trying to import it, I get the message there is no reading list. If I try to start a new reading list, no icons come with the web references so the original problem remains. Sigh. <comment230481> I did not say anything about delete. Do you or do you not have a back up ? If you moved it to the desktop and it is not working move it back.
