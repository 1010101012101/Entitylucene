How to set default ownership of a shared folder? <body> How can I set default ownership of newly created files and directories of a shared folder to the original directory owner?  The original intention is letting B read/write A's shared Google Drive folder.  ul liWith both users logged in./li liA's Google Drive folder is shared./li liB can read/write files in A's Google Drive folder./li /ul  The problem is that whenever B creates files in A's folder, the permission is only for B(read/write).  How can I make those newly created files (by B) have ownership to A with read/write permission?
