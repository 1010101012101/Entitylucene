Command found with `which` at the new paths but still tries to run from the old path <body> I have installed new version of codenpm/code in the custom directory code.npm-global/bin/code and removed it from code/usr/local/bin/code. The new path is declared:  precodePATH=/usr/local/bin:./node_modules/.bin:/Users/dmitrizaitsev/.npm-global/bin:... /code/pre  and the new codenpm/code is found with codewhich/code:  precodewhich npm /Users/dmitrizaitsev/.npm-global/bin/npm /code/pre  However, it still attempts to run from the old path and fails:  precodenpm -bash: /usr/local/bin/npm: No such file or directory /code/pre  Any idea what is wrong here?  <answer265536> The old path is still cached by the shell. Either open a new tab/window or run codehash -r/code to clear it.  <comment332914> Thanks, that was it, makes me feel ashamed ;)
