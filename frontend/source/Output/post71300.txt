How can I unbind a UDP port that has no entry in lsof? <body> On my Mac, I'm having trouble with a UDP port (500) that is "already in use",  but it doesn't have an associated process anymore.  precodesudo netstat -na | grep "udp4.*\.500\&gt;" /code/pre  shows   precodeudp4       0      0  192.168.50.181.500     *.*                                udp4       0      0  192.168.29.166.500     *.*                                /code/pre  But lsof doesn't show a process on port 500 (ie "sudo lsof -i:500 -P"   reports nothing).  Note that I am using "sudo" for these calls, so it should show all resources.    How can I figure out how to unbind the resource attached to port 500 so I can use it again?    <comment82801> And if you try `sudo lsof -i@192.168.50.181:500 -P` and `sudo lsof -i@192.168.29.166:500 -P`? <comment82858> @Jaume,  blank result, while netstat still shows the ports.  This is driving me nuts, it's making my vpn client not work.
