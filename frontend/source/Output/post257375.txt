macosSierra: Apple Mail Crashes/Won't Launch <body> Mail ran fine last night.  This morning it won't launch and all I can do is Force Quit from the Dock.    Tried a restart, no luck  Tried a safe boot followed by another reboot, still no luck.  Ran DiskWarrior; no luck.  Googled the problem and found these instructions, followed them, but again, still no luck:  In ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.mail/Data/Library/Saved Application State, remove the folder com.apple.mail.savedState to the trash, empty the trash and restart your computer.  Did so, and mail still won't launch.  I went to Console/All Messages and entered  in the search box.  This was at the top of the list, and had the date/time stamp for early today when I first attempted to Launch Mail:  10/15/16 7:23:10.790 AM Mail[440]: 5B033FA6-93A4-4A07-ACAF-9D4E0DF9226B.mailsignature: Syncing with cloud -- updating local; no cloud data not reachable, error: Error Domain=NSCocoaErrorDomain Code=260 "The file “ubiquitous_5B033FA6-93A4-4A07-ACAF-9D4E0DF9226B.mailsignature” couldn’t be opened because there is no such file."

Many thanks.  <comment321343> If you run Time Machine backups you could try restoring the "/Users/rgirou/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~mail/Data/V3/MailData/Signatures/ubiquitous_5B033FA6-93A4-4A07-ACAF-9D4E0DF9226B.mailsignature" file. If you don't have it you could try editing (make a copy first!) the "ubiquitous_AllSignatures.plist" file in the same directory and remove the section with the dict/dict tags that points to this file (it should have "5B033FA6-93A4-4A07-ACAF-9D4E0DF9226B" between string tags). <comment321347> Thanks for replying.  When I go to ~/Library/Mobile Documents, instead of seeing individual files, this is what I see:  https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1597869/clip_1.png   However, when I go to a TM backup several days old, I see multiple files. What gives? <comment321355> TO MEET THE CHARACTER LENGTH RESTRICTIONS, THIS COMMENT IS IN TWO PARTS.  PART ONE:  I fixed it, but I don’t know exactly why Mail now works and I’d be beholden to anyone who might have the time and patience to point out the why and wherefore.  On my 2013 MB Pro running Sierra and on my iMac running El Capitan, in a finder window when I navigated to…  ~/Library/Mobile Documents  …the path at the bottom of the finder window was:  Mac HD  Users  home folder  Library  Mobile Documents  followed by the cloud symbol. <comment321356> PART TWO:  It was NOT the same path on my wifes 2012 MB Pro, running Sierra.  Her path did not end with the cloud symbol.  I decided to turn off iCloud Drive on both my iMac and MB Pro and restart just to see what might happen.  Well, what happened is that Mail is once again funtioning on my iMac.  Mail also continues to function on my MB Pro.  The ~/Library/Mobile Documents folder is gone.  Can any of you make sense of this??  Many thanks,
