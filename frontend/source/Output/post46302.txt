Multiple-partition hard drive on Airport Extreme <body> Is there a way to have multiple partitions on a hard drive plugged into an Airport Extreme? I have a 3TB hard drive, and would like a 2TB partition for storage, time machine backups (mac formatted), and then a 1TB ntfs formatted for stuff accessible to windows computers. However, if I have more than one partition, the disk doesn't show up at all in Airport Utility or in Finder. Is there a way around this limitation?  <answer46311> No, this isn't possible. According to Apple Support:     strongTime Machine canâ€™t back up to an external disk connected to an AirPort   Extreme/strong, or to an iPod, iDisk, or disk formatted for Windows.   However, the same KB also notes that:     You can use Time Machine with a Time Capsule, and with USB, FireWire,   and Thunderbolt disks. The backup disk can be directly connected to   your computer or be on a network. strongIf the backup disk has been divided   into partitions, you can use one of the partitions./strong   You just can't have that drive hooked up to the Airport Extreme.  <comment52900> What is the partition scheme of the disk? <comment52930> Hmmm, when it has one hfs+ partition, I can use time machine with it just fine. I remember my pleasant surprise when I hooked it up to the Airport Extreme for the first time and my Mac popped up a box asking if I wanted to use the new disk for Time Machine. I was afraid the airport didn't support multiple partitions, though.
