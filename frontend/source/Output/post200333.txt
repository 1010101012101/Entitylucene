Finding lost partitions <body> I am resetting my sister's MBP late 2010 to factory defaults. It's all backed up. I'm reinstalling from the recovery partition currently. Before I started working on it today, it had the very descriptive problem: "wouldn't boot."  I previously had installed Ubuntu on this since she wanted to try it, and it was run as a dual boot system for about a year. Now, the disk space needs to be brought back into Mac, since the HDD was almost full. To top it off, Grub/rEFInd seem to have gotten lost at some point along the way during an upgrade, so Ubuntu is functionally gone anyway.  I did some research, took it into safemode, which did boot, backed up, and then booted into recovery (codecommand/code + coder/code), opened up disk utility, formatted, and clicked the code-/code button on the three Linux partitions (boot, swap, and file system, I believe).  Now, when I look in Disk Utility, on my 320GB HDD I see a ~200GB Macintosh HD (which I have erased and formatted), a Recovery HD, and there's over 100GB missing. There's no other partitions, and I can't expand the Macintosh HD partition.   Immediately after removing the partitions, I had a Partition Table error when I ran Verify on the HDD. Repair kept failing, so I rebooted into recovery mode and ran repair. Now there's no error, but still no drives.  When click on the HDD and go to the Partition tab, I can choose 1 Partition, which does correctly show 320GB. Otherwise, I can't find the lost 100GB. I tried enabling debug mode (something like codedefaults write com.apple.DiskUtility DUDebugMenuEnabled 1/code) and checking making everything visible, but the partitions still are not visible.  My questions:  ol liIs it possible to reinstall without the disks (not my machine, no idea where the disk is) if I change the drive to 1 partition and format it? Am I going to be able to do this from Recovery Tools?/li liFollowing Unable to increase partition size with subsequent blocking partition, I believe after reinstalling OSX I will be able to use a 3rd Party utility, probably gParted, to move stuff around on the drive. Can I use gParted from an Ubuntu live disk for this?/li liIs there a way to make the partitions reappear is disk utility so that I can at least format them?/li /ol  hr /  After reinstall finished:  Edit: Per the comment, here's the output of codesudo gpt -r show /dev/disk0/code  precode      start       size  index  contents           0          1         PMBR           1          1         Pri GPT header           2         32         Pri GPT table          34          6                   40     409600      1  GPT part - C12A7328-F81F-11D2-BA4B-00A0C93EC93B      409640  423215696      2  GPT part - 48465300-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC   423625336    1269544      3  GPT part - 426F6F74-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC   424894880    1269536      4  GPT part - 48465300-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC   426164416  198977999            625142415         32         Sec GPT table   625142447          1         Sec GPT header /code/pre  And a screenshot of DiskUtility's output. As you can see, my 320.07GB HDD has a partition just shy of 217GB codeMacintosh HD/code.

The easiest procedure to solve your problem is to boot to Internet Recovery Mode and completely reformat the internal drive and reinstall OS X:  According to this Apple support document your MacBook Pro (Mid 2010)* can be upgraded to use Internet Recovery after applying a firmware upgrade. Since the firmware upgrade was published in 2012 I assume that it was applied already.  So to answer the first part of your first question: After booting to Internet Recovery Mode you may install Mac OS X Lion. In Internet Recovery Mode usually the Mac OS X the Mac originally was shipped with will be installed. For Snow Leopard Macs like your MBP Mid 2010 Mac OS X Lion will be installed.  To initiate the Internet Recovery Mode restart your Mac and press kbdalt/kbd kbdcmd/kbd kbdR/kbd.br The prerequisites for an Internet Recovery are listed here: Recovery/Internet Recovery. In a few words you need the latest firmware update installed, either ethernet or WLAN (WPA/WPA2) and a router with DHCP activated for a successful internet recovery.br On a 50 Mbps-line it takes about 4 min (presenting a small animated globe) to boot into the Recovery Netboot image which is loaded from an Apple server.  After booting successfully open Disk Utility and repartition your disk to 1 JHFS+ partition with a GUID partition table. Quit Disk Utility and start 'Reinstall OS X'. Depending on your internet connection the reinstall will take some time.  The second part of question 1 as well as the questions 2 and 3 are obsolete after following the above instructions and successfully reinstalling Mac OS X Lion.  *: A MacBook Pro (Late 2010) never was produced/sold, so I assume it's a MacBook Pro (Mid 2010)  <comment241402> Please add the output of `sudo gpt -r show /dev/disk0` entered in Terminal to your question. <comment241424> @klanomath - see update <comment241498> Internet Recovery is different from a regular recovery reinstall, which downloads from the internet? It put Mavericks on it when I did that, which I thought was odd. I'll try this fix over the weekend. Thanks! <comment241501> @Josiah "Internet Recovery Mode" is a netboot image downloaded from Apple with almost the same features as the Recovery HD on your main disk. I think IRM is even possible without any internal hard drive. **One** of the features of IRM is reinstalling an operating system. The big advantage (and one of the other features) of the IRM is the possibility to completely manipulate your internal HDD/SSD without regard of any existing OSs/recovery volumes/boot volumes etc.
