MacOS keychain encryption strength <body> On a Mac not using hard drive encryption, how difficult would it be for an attacker with physical access to a machine to break into the keychain? This document answers the question for iOS 10 (the keychain uses AES 128 in Galois/Counter Mode). But I can't find a document for MacOS.  <comment370821> iCloud keychain uses AES 256 ( https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202303 ) and local keychains use Triple DES for passwords and keys in a keychain, but I can't find a valid link to an official document that proves it.
