Bootcamp Windows Partition Won't Boot After Accidentally Changing Boot-up Partition <body> I was messing around with the startup partition on my Windows 7 partition on my Mac and accidentally changed it to the Mac OS X partition. So when I boot the Windows 7 partition it says the error message "Missing Operating System". This error also shows up when I try to boot the Windows 7 DVD from the Mac drive selector screen. My question is how do change the boot partition on my Windows 7 partition if the partition won't even boot? I really don't want to install a new Windows 7 partition.  strongMac Specifications:/strongbr Type: emMac Pro (Mid 2012)/embr Processor: em3.33 GHz 6-Core Intel Xeon/embr Memory: em32 GB 1333 MHz DDR3 ECC/embr Graphics: emATI Radeon HD 5770 1024 MB/embr Software: emOS X 10.8.4 (12E55)/em  <comment116057> Hi and welcome to Apple.SE. Could you please edit you question such that it actually contains a question? I can see what you want to do (boot into Windows 7 again), but it is better when you state it yourself such that people don't have to guess. <comment116059> Thanks for correcting me. I edited the description and added the question that I'm seeking. <comment116163> So you press and hold Option while the system is booting, you then select the Windows 7 DVD, what happens exactly? It goes straight to a screen stating "Missing Operating System"?
