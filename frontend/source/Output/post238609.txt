Is it possible to use Safari Technology Preview for handoff from iPhone? <body> When I open a page in Safari on my iPhone the handoff icon pops up in the dock on my Mac. However clicking on the icon will open Safari. As I am using Safari Technology Preview as my default browser I would like to know if there is some hack that would enable me to use is as a "handoff browser".  <answer275514> This is indeed possible, but only if emSafari Technology Preview/em is your default browser as set in strongSystem Preferences â†’ General/strong. If you use a different browser, then the Handoff will always use the original Safari.
