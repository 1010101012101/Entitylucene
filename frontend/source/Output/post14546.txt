Can I restore only selected files from Time Machine Backup after a fresh OS X re-install? <body> I'm thinking to reinstall my Mac OS X on my Macbook Pro and starting fresh (instead of recovering from a Time Machine backup)  The question is:  If I do that, after OS X is reinstalled, will I be able to pick only certain files to be restored from my Time Machine backup?  The scenario is basically I want to start with a fresh OS X install and restore my iTunes library and possibly a few other documents.  <answer14547> You can do a fresh OSX re-install.  After that go into Time Machine and restore what you need.  <comment15678> That is exactly what I wanted. So it is possible.
