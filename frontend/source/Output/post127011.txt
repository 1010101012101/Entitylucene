"drag n drop" application to convert images to base64 string (for web development) <body> I'm after an osx program that will convert an image into a base64 string (for web development).   Basically replicates this: http://webcodertools.com/imagetobase64converter/Create  I suspect there is no application, and in that case I'd be interested if I can get the terminal command which will encode, to apply to a certain file on Right-Click  subFollowup question: Can I give Automator apps a window?/sub  h1SOLUTION/h1  I combined the two solutions below, to create an application with the following code  precodefor f in "$@" do     openssl base64 -in "$f" | pbcopy done /code/pre  And infact I made a dropzone target using Platypus, as shown in my subsequent SO question/answer  <answer127014> One of your possibilites is :   ul liCreate an Automator service /li liAt the top select : Service receives selected strongimage files/strong in strongFinder/strong/li liAdd a Shell Script action /li liPut the following script in it  ul licodeopenssl base64 &lt; "$1" | pbcopy/code /li /ul/li liSave the service /li /ul  Now you can from the codecontextual menu &gt; Service &gt; yourServiceName/code of every image in the finder get the base64 encoding copied into your clipboard !  <answer127015> h2Base64 Automator Droplet/h2  You can use Automator to create your own Base64 droplet. Mac OS X includes codeopenssl/code which can encode files to Base64; this superuser question explains how, OS X: Base64 encode via command line  ol liLaunch Automator.app/li liCreate a new application/li liAdd a strongRun Shell Script/strong action/li liSet strongPass input:/strong to strongas arguments/strong/li liWithin the script, replace codeecho/code with the script below./li liSave your workflow as an application/li /ol  To use your application, drag and drop files onto it. A new base64 encoded file will appear next to the original file.  h2Shell Script/h2  precodefor f in "$@" do     openssl base64 -in "$f" -out "$f.b64" done /code/pre  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KNJat.png" alt="Automator Base64 droplet"  To learn more about using Automator, see Apple's Mac Basics: Automator.  <answer128733> I wrote an Applescript for BBEdit: I only use jpg images for this, but it could be adapted for other images and other editors easily:  precode-- choose file set _a to choose file of type "jpg"  -- convert path to posix path set _b to POSIX path of _a  -- strip newlines and place in clipboard do shell script "openssl enc -base64 -in " &amp; _b &amp; " | tr -d \"\\n\" | pbcopy" set myClip to the clipboard  -- set strings with placeholder texts for BBEdit set _start to "&lt;img alt=\"&lt;# some text #&gt;\" width=\"&lt;# width #&gt;\" height=\"&lt;# height #&gt;\" src=\"data:image/jpg;base64," set _end to "\" /&gt;" set _string to _start &amp; myClip &amp; _end  tell application "BBEdit"     set selection to _string end tell /code/pre  <comment148783> Thanks. Hm, first try I couldn't get this to work. I'll have another crack when I get some time. But I did combine the use of pbcopy with another answer! <comment364782> Or use this handy webpage: https://jpillora.com/base64-encoder/
