Can't start Octave 3.8.0 in GUI mode <body> I installed Octave 3.8.0 using homebrew. The Octave official FAQ says I can use code--force-gui/code option to start octave with the GUI.   But when I use codeoctave --force-gui/code command in the terminal, nothing happens differently. That is, Octave is still started in command-line interface.   How can I fix that?  <answer122015> I found the answer and I will post it here for anyone else that needs it.   Octave gui requires the codeqt/code package (see the answer by bpabbot here). So in order to use the gui, octave should be installed with this command:  precodebrew install octave --with-qt --with-fltk /code/pre  Or if you have already installed it without codeqt/code, you can codereinstall/code it:  precodebrew reinstall octave --with-qt --with-fltk /code/pre  However, as it currently stands, the formula for version 3.8.0 of octave has an issue and does not install code--with-qt/code. There is a bug reported, and it will be fixed for 3.8.1 version. You can see more details here.   <answer231799> I had a similar problem with Octave 4.0.0, when I installed it as hadi suggested I got this message:  precodeThe graphical user interface is disabled by default since it is still buggy on OS X; use brew with the option --with-gui to enable it.   Octave was compiled with gnuplot; enable it via graphics_toolkit('gnuplot'). All graphics terminals can be used by setting the environment variable GNUTERM in ~/.octaverc, and building gnuplot with the corresponding options.  setenv('GNUTERM','qt')    # Requiers QT; install gnuplot --with-qt setenv('GNUTERM','x11')   # Requires XQuartz; install gnuplot --with-x11 setenv('GNUTERM','wxt')   # Requires wxmac; install gnuplot --with-wxmac setenv('GNUTERM','aqua')  # Requires AquaTerm; install gnuplot --with-aquaterm  You may also set this variable from within Octave. For printing the cairo backend is recommended, i.e., install gnuplot with --with-cairo, and use  print -dpdfcairo figure.pdf   When using the the qt or fltk toolkits then invisible figures do not work because osmesa does currently not work with the Mac's OpenGL implementation. The usage of gnuplot is recommened. /code/pre  What worked for me was adding the --with-gui:  precodebrew install octave --with-qt --with-fltk --with-gui /code/pre  Or reinstalling:  precodebrew reinstall octave --with-qt --with-fltk --with-gui /code/pre  <comment141649> How did you install Octave  ? <comment141672> @MatthieuRiegler If you mean the specific command that I used in homebrew, it was `brew install octave`. <comment368101> Not sure if this is still valid, brew complains: Warning: homebrew/science/octave: this formula has no --with-fltk option so it will be ignored! Warning: homebrew/science/octave: this formula has no --with-gui option so it will be ignored! Warning: homebrew/science/octave: this formula has no --with-qt option so it will be ignored! <comment373770> Note that none of those options exist anymore on the Homebrew formula.
