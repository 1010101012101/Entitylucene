Errors using brew to install python3 <body> I'm trying to install empython3/em using embrew/em on a 2008 MacBook (OSX Lion).  I have a few years using emapt-get/em in Linux environments, but this is my first time trying to install something using embrew/em.  Per the instructions at Get Your Mac Ready For Python Programming and Install Python 3 on Mac OS X and use virtualenv and virtualenvwrapper I entered:  precodebrew install python3 /code/pre  This was after accidentally trying to install version 2.x of python using  precodebrew install python /code/pre  The empython/em package installs fine, but when trying to install empython3/em I get  precodegcc-6 -Wno-unused-result -Wsign-compare -fno-common -dynamic -DNDEBUG -g  -O3 -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -o FileSettings.o -c ./FileSettings.m In file included from /System/Library/Frameworks/Foundation.framework/Headers/Foundation.h:120:0,              from ./FileSettings.h:9,              from ./FileSettings.m:9: /System/Library/Frameworks/Foundation.framework/Headers/NSTask.h:75:24: error: expected identifier or '(' before '^' token   @property (copy) void (^terminationHandler)(NSTask *) NS_AVAILABLE(10_7, NA);                         ^ /System/Library/Frameworks/Foundation.framework/Headers/NSTask.h:78:1: error: expected identifier before 'end'  @end  ^ make[2]: *** [FileSettings.o] Error 1 make[1]: *** [install_PythonLauncher] Error 2 make: *** [frameworkinstallapps] Error 2  READ THIS: https://git.io/brew-troubleshooting If reporting this issue please do so at (not Homebrew/brew):   https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/issues  These open issues may also help: python &amp; python3: fix sqlite3 on sierra https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/pull/3134 Warning: You are using OS X 10.7. /code/pre  Per the errors I checked python &amp; python3: fix sqlite3 on sierra which seems to indicate the fault lies somewhere with emsqlite3/em however the link at python3 (v 3.5.1) failed to build on 10.7.5-x86_64 indicates its an issue with the compiler?  I'm not sure where to go next in the troubleshooting process.  <answer249595> I have no way to test it as I am not running 10.7 anymore, but the second issue you posted looks like the exact same error and a successful fix was in the comments:  precodebrew install homebrew/dupes/apple-gcc42 brew install python3 --cc=gcc-4.2 /code/pre  This basically installs a compatible version of gcc and overrides compiler selection when installing python3.  <comment310244> Which version of OSX?
