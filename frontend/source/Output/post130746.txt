VNC Client that can send Ctrl+Alt+Delete? <body> Is there a VNC Client for OS X that can send kbdCtrl/kbd+kbdAlt/kbd+ kbdDelete/kbd? I've googled, searched have not found. I frequently VNC into Windows machines and need to send this key combo in order to log in.  <answer130749> iTeleport is my VNC client of choice, and does precisely this.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nTcqz.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer130750> Apple Remote Desktop can send Control Alt Delete:     If you use Remote Desktop to administer a PC that's running VNC, you may be wondering how to send the Ctrl-Alt-Del command (Control-Alternate-Delete) from a Mac to the PC. Though Mac and PC key mapping differs, you can use an alternate key combination in Remote Desktop 2.0 and later to send the command.      For full-size (desktop) keyboards, use Control-Option-Forward Delete.   http://support.apple.com/kb/TA22781  <answer186785> The built-in strongScreen Sharing/strong application on OS X is a VNC client that can send Ctrl-Alt-Del:  Laptop keyboard: kbdfn/kbd+kbdcontrol/kbd+kbdcommand/kbd+kbddelete/kbd  Full-size keyboard: kbdcontrol/kbd+kbdoption/kbd+kbddelete/kbd  <answer222881> If you are using a Mac and screen sharing on a Windows machine, use kbdfn/kbd+kbdctrl/kbd+kbdoption/kbd+kbddelete/kbd.  <comment153388> Off topic: I recommend using NoMachine as remote desktop solution.
