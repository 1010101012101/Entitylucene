Services menu on right click in Apple Mail missing? <body> In macOS Sierra, Mail app, I select a message and right click. The "Services" selection is missing.  I can select text within a message and right click, seeing the services menu, but I swear this worked before just fine and I've used it a ridiculous amount of times with specific apps.   This: Services submenu disappeared from contextual menu of right click did not help.  <answer270060> Might need to update your plugins for Sierra (if you use that Mac OS). I had the same issue with Omnifocus clip o iron and had to update it here: https://discourse.omnigroup.com/t/clip-o-tron-in-sierra/26977
