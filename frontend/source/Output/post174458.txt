How to select text on Google Search, when using Chrome for iOS7? <body> Once you type the text to be searched on the omnibox, it is replaced by a long URL, e.g. https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=how%20to%20select%20text%20on%20google%20search%2c%20when%20using%20chrome%20for%20ios7%3f  Then, if you want to select some of the previous text, tap and hold will not work.  Is there other alternative?  <answer174459> You can double tap to select a word, then just adjust the selection. More hints on this link  <comment205421> I searched for iOS on the menu, I didn't notice this option. It makes sense. <comment205422> IF you would prefer this question there I believe the proper procedure is for you to flag here and request a mod migrate this. <comment205423> Shame though to lose you from here - you would seem to be a welcome addition! <comment205424> Can you clarify what you mean by "losing me"? <comment205425> So far (you have not had much time) this has been your only activity here. If you like Ask Different you might not want to return here! <comment205426> Ah! :-) Don't worry, I'll be around when able to contribute or to ask!
