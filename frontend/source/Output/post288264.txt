Xcode 8 and iOS 11 incompatibility despite having copied device support files <body> I have set up up a new computer (MacBook Pro) from a backup I made yesterday from my old computer (MacBook Air). In the process of that setup, I changed my user's home folder name, strictly following the apple guide on that topic.  On my old computer, I had to move Xcode's device support files to an external disk and then manually created symbolic links between those files and the code~/Library/Developer/Xcode/iOS DeviceSupport/code directory. All of that worked, even when I installed Xcode 9 and linked its new device support files to Xcode 8 (using this tutorial, but again symlinking instead of copying). Unfortunately, this approach does not work anymore on my new computer. On this machine, I moved all of the (before linked files) from my external Volume to code~/Library/Developer/Xcode/iOS DeviceSupport/code.   However, if I now want to run a project using Xcode 8 on my iOS 11 device (which did work on my old machine), I get the following message: codeThis iPhone 6s Plus is running iOS 11.0 (15A5304i), which may not be supported by this version of Xcode./code   I have tried various methods, copying the needed files to both code~/Library/Developer/Xcode/iOS DeviceSupport/code and code/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/DeviceSupport/code, but none of the approaches seemed to work.
