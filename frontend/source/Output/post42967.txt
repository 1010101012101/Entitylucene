openURL not working? <body> I have my apache2 server running on my macbook pro and I have an ssh session into my iphone which runs on iOS 5.0.1. I have a folder "files" in my webroot which has a few mp3 files. When I try accessing those files using the browser in my iPhone, the media files are played and I can see the corresponding logs in /private/var/log/apache2/access_log.  However, when I try opening the files from the iPhone terminal(via the ssh session) by using the command line utility "openURL", I dont see any logs at my server side which leads me to believe that the files are not opened at all.  Am I doing something wrong? An example of what I tried looks like :-     $ openURL http://192.168.71.71/files/1.mp3   Thanks!
