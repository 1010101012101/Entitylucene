Move windows around a desktop -- and to different desktops -- using only the keyboard? <body> Here's what I'm trying to accomplish using only a keyboard:  ol listrongMove a window to different areas/corners of a desktop/strong/li listrongMove a window to different desktops/strong/li listrongSet/unset a window as shown/sticky on all desktops/strong/li /ol  Yes, I know #3 could solve #2 by emstickying/em a window, pressing kbdctrl/kbd+kbd&#x2318;/kbd+kbd&leftarrow;/kbd/kbd&rightarrow;/kbd, then emunstickying/em it, which would be acceptable, but i'm hoping for something a little more elegant :)      NB, if 1..3 can be solved in AppleScript, that would be great because Spark has been invaluable to tie an AppleScript to a global keyboard shortcut. However I don't think AppleScript can do this type of window location manipulation and a native Cocoa app may be required.   I really want to return to my emkeyboard-only nirvana/em but in my adoptive platform and shed Ubuntu Desktop.  <answer28299> There are many, many different sharewares out there that let you move windows around using shortcuts. Just look for window manager in the Mac App Store. I would recommend BetterTouchTool. It's a freeware that let's you customize just about anything. For example here is the shortcuts I have created for myself :  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ljip8.png" alt="enter image description here"  http://blog.boastr.net/  <answer28306> Moving windows to another space:  ul liSizeUp (still works for me in 10.8)/li liSpacey (stopped working in 10.7)/li /ul  Moving windows to another display:  ul liBetterSnapTool/li liBetterTouchTool/li liFlexiglass/li liMoom/li liOptimal Layout/li liSizeUp/li liSpectacle/li liWindow Mover/li /ul  <answer119263> I'm still on Mountain Lion, so can't vouch for Mavericks. However...  ShiftIt is also worth a mention.  Keyboard only, but works great for me for corners, fullscreen and next screen functionality.  For configurable transparency and stickiness I use Afloat (source on GitHub)  <answer236155> Moom is pretty awesome and will allow you to do #1 and #2. https://manytricks.com/moom/  <comment32512> Actually, it seems SizeUp offers the best options for #1 and #2. OTOH, coming fresh from OSS, I'm conflicted by supporting a "nagware" product... Thanks ;) <comment32513> I did try BetterTouchTool a few weeks ago but found it to have issues in Lion which I hope would be fixed soon. I did however completely forget that it has the option move windows to corners, which satisfies #1, but cannot do #2 or #3 ...well, at least its donation-based ;) <comment34784> After downgrading to Snow Leopard last weekend, BetterTouchTool has been working great for me! <comment44615> Divvy is another option, not quite as powerful as these but lightweight and useful. <comment78285> Both SizeUp and Spacey don't work in Mountain Lion (according to their description). :( <comment288976> Do please add a few more details about Moom to your answer.
