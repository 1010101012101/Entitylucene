Apple Music - Allowing Explicit Content Disabled <body> I've just started using Apple Music and searched for Metallica. And most of their albums are greyed out. After sometime searching for the answer i could see that all the Albums with the Explicit Content is greyed out.  I checked my Itunes settings and as i figured, the setting for "Restrict Music with Explicit Content" is checked. But here is the strange part : I cant 'uncheck' the option. The option is checked and greyed out.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rvMqo.jpg" alt="Itunes Options"  Anyone have any idea how to uncheck that option and get access to Explicit Content?  Note: My apple account belongs to the Indian Store.  <answer194253> This is the reply i got after chatting with the customer team for over half an hour - Due to the laws between the countries. The iTunes Store in India does not offer explicit content on the music store!!!  <comment231329> Is there a mobile device management profile installed on the computer, such as from your work? You can check this by going to System Preferences. If a Profiles icon appears in there (silver starburst with a checkmark) then one is installed. <comment231377> @smoooosher Nope, this is a personal computer and only one user(admin). <comment231629> am not sure, but maybe the same implies to other places. Hope i am wrong and there is a work around for this, cauz this sucks!
