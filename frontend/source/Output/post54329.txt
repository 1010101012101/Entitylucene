Can I get the CPU temperature and fan speed from the command line in OS X? <body> Is there a command I can run from the command line in OS X to get the current CPU temperature and/or the fan speed(s)?  To be more specific, I'd like to be able to get the same info available in the iStat widget under the Fans and Temps tabs on the command line.   I'd like to be able to find these values at the command line so it could be scripted and plugged into a monitoring setup on my Mac - I have a data-nerd desire to collect and graph these values (and other stats) on my Macbook over time.  On Linux, it seems like this would be possible by reading a pseudo-file under the code/proc/code directory, but I'm not sure how to do the equivalent on OS X (if it exists).  <answer54332> strongUpdate:/strong @PressingOnAlways has notified me that this software is now considered legacy by its developer. Further details on the stopped support can be found on their legacy-software website.  Assuming you installed it in code/Applications/code you'd need to run the following:  code/Applications/TemperatureMonitor.app/Contents/MacOS/tempmonitor -c -l -a/code  Site: Temperature Monitor  <answer110237> This open source command line utility worked for me: https://github.com/lavoiesl/osx-cpu-temp.  <answer127453> The iStats ruby gem lets you see the CPU temperature via the command-line.  h3Installation/h3  code$ gem install iStats/code  h3Usage/h3  code$ istats/code  img src="https://i.imgur.com/KMAIRkD.png" alt="Screenshot"  <answer195937> On BSD systems, the codesysctl/code utility can provides similar information as the code/proc/code tree in Linux. It actually report some CPU/GPU temperature information from Xnu CPU Power Management (XCPM):  precodesysctl machdep.xcpm.cpu_thermal_level sysctl machdep.xcpm.gpu_thermal_level /code/pre  However this doesn't seem to be a temperature reading but only an indication of the temperature level compared to some reference.  <answer228208> Im on OSX 10.11  https://github.com/nicolargo/glances  This one on python has auto-update &amp;&amp; colors built-in and can be installed with a simple curl or wget command if requirements are already met. Requirements  precodepython &gt;= 2.6 or &gt;= 3.3 (tested with version 2.6, 2.7, 3.3, 3.4) psutil &gt;= 2.0.0 setuptools /code/pre  <comment62259> Thanks for this. I take it if I need to install this third-party app for it, there isn't a known built-in way to do the same? <comment62327> No, I don't think there is. I've used that same program to display the values with Geektool for a time but didn't find any information about a built-in tool. Mind you that that was more than a year ago, so there ,ight be now. I doubt it though. <comment114960> It would be great if there was a copy of `tempmonitor` on [homebrew](http://brew.sh/) <comment149043> `tempmonitor` does not show fan speed <comment152277> sudo gem install iStats failed on brand new MBP Mavericks. Error looks like this: http://hastebin.com/lihaqiyeyu.vhdl <comment152281> Unfortunately that's a known error. If you take a look at the [Github repo](https://github.com/Chris911/iStats) there's a note about it. You can either install Ruby using RVM or brew or use this command to install the gem instead: `sudo ARCHFLAGS=-Wno-error=unused-command-line-argument-hard-error-in-future gem install iStats` <comment165478> Note TemperatureMonitor does not support any Macs made after October 2013, or so it told me when I tried to run it on my MacBookPro Retina. <comment169644> Awesome, works like a charm (nice sparklines too). Just had to do it with "sudo" <comment179006> As of Oct 1st, Temperature Monitor has been suspended - they went "Pro". <comment220723> this no longer is viable as this software is no longer kept up to date. <comment229232> For live updates: `watch -n0 istats` (I had to `brew install watch` on OSX before doing the above) See: http://superuser.com/q/361902 <comment230579> To get rid of display errors use this: `watch --color istats`. <comment230610> @Chris911 You're awesome, thanks <comment234548> I thought it will be harder to compile this, but it's not! Works like a charm! <comment254014> Hi Chris, I know nothing about Ruby - what's the full path to iStats? <comment254015> Once iStats is installed you should be able to run the `istats` command from any path. <comment280705> Worked like a chard in El Capitan. <comment281451> second to el capitan working with this command <comment321915> Thanks, Dust! I'm not much for building stuff from scratch but this was easy and works out of the box. M. Lavoie is using code Apple released a while back:  Apple System Management Control (SMC) Tool Copyright (C) 2006 but it works fine on my 2011 Mini. <comment334764> Glances doesn't show me fanspeed and cpu temp.
