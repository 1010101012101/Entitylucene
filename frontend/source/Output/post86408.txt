What's wrong with my Outlook search? <body> Ever since doing OS X 10.8 updates, a pair of machines with Outlook refuse to look back further than 2 weeks during e-mail searches.  Spotlight settings all look OK.  I even forced an index deletion/re-creation with "sudo mdutil -E".  Index does go away, but comes back the same way, only being able to search the last 2 weeks worth of items (and there are items going back years it should be finding).  Mailbox size is right around 1.9 GiB.  Ideas?  <answer89590> I see this happen somewhat often in our office environment where Outlook 2011 is connected to our Exchange server. Typically a spotlight re-index will do the trick, either using the method you tried or by adding the HD to Spotlight's privacy pane, then removing it a few minutes later. Sometimes I have to go a step further &amp; remove preference files. spotlight.plist, outlook.plist, etc... Beyond that I will sometimes be forced to rebuild the Outlook identity using the Microsoft Database Utility (hold opt while opening Outlook). Hope that helps! (Oddly it's always 2 weeks here as well)  <comment99829> I see this happen somewhat often in our office environment where Outlook 2011 is connected to our Exchange server.

Outlook identity rebuild fixed it. <comment105219> Glad to hear that worked!
