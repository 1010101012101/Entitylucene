How to remove applications in virtual machine (via VMWare Fusion 5) from Open With options on Mac OS X <body> I'm running Windows 8 on a Mac using VMware Fusion 5. I don't want to see the Windows apps in the Finder's "Open With..." options.  I have seen other answers that do not work with this version of VMware.   Things that I've tried.   ol liDelete the applications folder from each VM package/li liUncheck the applications option in the Virtual Machine - Settings./li /ol  <comment102183> To avoid getting the same answers again, can you please add (or link to) the things you've already tried? <comment102191> I suspect that you need to rebuild the 'Launch Services Database', but I don't currently have Fusion to test.
