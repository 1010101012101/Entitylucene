resize Chrome window larger than screen <body> I'd like to resize Google Chrome to 5000x5000 pixels and then take a screenshot of the document. But I'm running into trouble resizing the height of the browser to 5000px.  I tried the suggestion of using an AppleScript like this:  precodetell application "Google Chrome"     activate     set the bounds of the first window to {0, 0, 5000, 5000} end tell /code/pre  and then capturing a screenshot by  precodepressing ⌘⇧4, then space, then clicking the window /code/pre  Unfortunately, the dimensions of the captured screenshot are only code10224 × 1978/code Ie. the height is much smaller than I expected. (The width is roughly 2 x 5000 due to having a 2x pixel density retina display)  I also tried using a Chrome browser extension to take the screenshot (Full Page Screen Capture) after running the AppleScript. The resulting screenshot has dimensions of only code10000 × 1518/code (the height is still much smaller than expected).  Finally, I confirmed that the window is not as tall as I specified, by opening a Chrome JavaScript console (jQuery happens to be available in my document) and checking code$(window).height()/code and code$(window).width()/code  precode$(window).height(); 759 $(window).width(); 5000 /code/pre  I'm using a Macbook Pro whose native resolution is 1440 x 900, and running OS X Sierra.  strongExpected result/strong: I expected the height of the resulting screenshots to be at least 5000px.  strongActual result/strong: The screenshot height was less than 2000px.  How can I make the browser height 5000px? Preferrably without purchasing an app.  <comment333671> I'm going to guess you are running into some limitation imposed by the OS. <comment333691> On a tangent, there is a Chrome Extension called Full Page screen capture, perhaps that can help you capture whatever you are looking for on the page. <comment333742> @pal4life: "I also tried using a Chrome browser extension to take the screenshot (Full Page Screen Capture) after running the AppleScript.

Also you could perhaps connect the laptop to another display which does this by default so you can get this out of the box instead of having to manipulate this. <comment349973> @pal4life Those extensions don't work if there are elements on the page with fixed heights that scroll the overflow. To get a complete screen shot the only option is to resize the window first
