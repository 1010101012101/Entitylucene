Delete an old icloud account with defunct email and forgotten password <body> I have an old email/id apple iCloud account on an iPad mini that I can't delete because the email is totally defunct and I cannot remember the password.   I have a newer iCloud account that I use for everything and have no problem with it, except that I cannot use it on my iPad mini because it keeps asking me for the old account's password. I have read through the boards and am stuck!  So, defunct email and forgotten password and I don't care if I have to reset the entire mini as long as it wipes out the old iCloud account. I haven't used the mini for a while so it doesn't have anything that can't be synced.  HELP- please. Soo frustrating to realize mistakes in hindsight! Thanks, Alison  <answer201530> Contact Apple Support. Usually when you create an Apple ID, you supply a credit card #, an address, phone number, etc, all of which can be used to verify your identity. Worth a shot.  <comment242965> You've found the anti-theft lock.  If you can't log into to the Apple ID online or change its password then your stuck hard....
