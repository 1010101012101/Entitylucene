Which Terminal theme and plugin is this <body> I came across the following screenshot of someone's Terminal and I'd like to know how that person managed to display the full path on top. I also like the color scheme.   Can anyone point me in the right direction?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bV3P7.png" alt="Terminal window"   <answer230371> You can set some parameters using the Terminal Preferences.  The rest is up to the application that's running. It this case that's might be an editor, or a specific https://spaceship.airforce/ related application.  <answer230386> My bet is on the agnoster zsh theme with a custom color scheme.  RobbyRussell Angoster theme for zsh  You may need to install Oh-My-Zsh first. For that, take a look at ohmyzsh  <comment281187> Almost all the git visual customizations of titlebar and prompt line are based on `zsh` so that would be a great place to start in making your path look like the one pictured and have better control over what's in the title bar of the terminal.app window. <comment281209> That's pretty close! Thanks, will look into that.
