Using AppleScript to open Mail by MessageID <body> Using the AppleScript below I am unable to open the message ID. This same message ID is in a note in my Reminders app and clicking on the link works correctly there.   precodeset emailID to "message://&lt;DB43DAF1-7B87-4DE5-99DB-EC11CB0F6FF7@gmail.com&gt;"  tell application "Mail"     open location emailID end tell /code/pre  I get the pop-up error     The operation couldn't be completed.      (MCMailErrorDomain error 1030.)      Mail was unable to open the URL "(null)".   I've researched that error code but the answers don't seem applicable. Also, when removing the word "location" from my AppleScript, Mail will open but with a blank new email.   Any help getting this script to actually open the email with that ID would be greatly appreciated.  <answer260623> Mail is not smart enough to just tell it to open a emdocument/em by just its codemessage id/code in the manner you're trying to do it. You need to tell Mail where to look for it, as in what emmailbox/em it's in.  The following example worked for me when codeMessageID/code was set to one in my emInbox/em using its proper codemessage id/code however in this example I'm using the codemessage id/code shown in your OP.  pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"codeset MessageID to "DB43DAF1-7B87-4DE5-99DB-EC11CB0F6FF7@gmail.com"  tell application "Mail"     activate     open (first message of inbox whose message id = MessageID) end tell /code/pre  Note that the example emcode/em above is limited in that it doesn't gracefully trap an emerror/em, so the example emcode/em below adds a codetry/code emstatement/em  with an codeerror/code emstatement/em to handle an emerror/em gracefully.  pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"codeset MessageID to "DB43DAF1-7B87-4DE5-99DB-EC11CB0F6FF7@gmail.com"  tell application "Mail"     activate     try         open (first message of inbox whose message id = MessageID)     on error eStr number eNum         display dialog eStr &amp; " Number: " &amp; eNum buttons {"OK"} default button 1         return     end try end tell /code/pre  <comment326341> Muchas gracias. These emails will be in my Sent box, so I simply changed "inbox" to "sent mailbox" and we're good. I can't thank you enough. Saved me quite a bit of time.
