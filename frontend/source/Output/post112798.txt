“PowerPC applications are no longer supported” – Microsoft Office <body> I am running on Mac OS X 10.8.2.  I have a licensed copy of Microsoft Office, and haven’t had a problem using it, until a recent update!  Since then, whenever I try to open it I get the following message:     You can't open the application 'Microsoft Word' because PowerPC Applications are no longer supported   How do I resolve this, please?  <answer112806> PowerPC applications were allowed on Intel Mac with Rosetta. Rosetta disappeared with Lion, if I remember well (There were 2 OS between Mavericks and Snow Leopard). The solution is either get a new version of Microsoft Office, or downgrade your Mac OS X.  <comment132426> What version of Office are you using? <comment132427> @BartArondson MS-Office 2011 <comment132460> Although this answer is true in itself, it doesn't help the OP, it's a bit too general. The real issue here is that an application that worked fine suddenly turned into a PowerPC app after an update. <comment132464> Can you check the exact version of Word? Go to Applications - Microsoft Office - Word and right click and press Get Info. It should be something like 14.3.8 or 14.3.9 <comment132465> Indeed, now that he mentioned what version of Microsoft Office he has, it's quite a weird issue. <comment132466> I suggest you try to reinstall it. <comment140411> Was the recent update an update to Office or Mac OS X? <comment183846> Office 2011 was released as Intel-only. I think Office 2008 was the last build that contained PowerPC binaries.
