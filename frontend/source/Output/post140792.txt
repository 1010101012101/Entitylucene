used MacBook 13" Late 2008 (A1278) vs MacBook 13" white Mid 2007 vs current MacBook 13" <body> strongI'm working with a/strong   h2MacBook 13" white (Mid 2007)/h2  with   ul liIntel Core2 Duo 2.16 GHz/li li3 GB RAM (max.)/li li1 GB hard disk/li liMacOS X 10.6.8/li /ul  Disadvantages:  ul lilimited to 3 GB of max.

I have some applications which are working with large databases (size of several GB) like strongDevonThink Pro/strong, and with the very short amount of RAM it is a pain to work when the MacBook is unresponsive. (so even under normal conditions very often I have only 15..80 MB free RAM according to Activity Monitor). I'm also working with a large LaTeX document, where I think more processor performance could also be helpful (it takes 5 minutes to create the pdf file).  In short: I would like to buy a more powerful MacBook, but I do hesitate spending 1000 EUR for a new MacBook model. So I had a look at offers of used MacBooks and found this one for an (at least absolutely) quite low price of &lt;350 EUR:  h2MacBook 13" Late 2008 (A1278)/h2  ul liIntel CoreDuo 2.4 GHz/li li2 GB of RAM built-in (but could be expanded to 8 GB for +100 EUR)/li li128 GB SSD drive/li /ul  h1my Questions/h1  ol liThe Late 2008 MacBook is already 6 years old and only 1.5 years "newer" than my current one.
