To sync AudioMemos timestamps with your calendar? <body> I am trying to find a way how I can sync the timestamps of my recordings to my calendar so I know when I have recorded things.  I am using the application AudioMemos at the moment.  How can I sync AudioMemos' recordings to my calendar?  <comment146621> If you access the audio recordings via remote access, are the timestamps correct? <comment146626> Yes, the timestamps are correct. The only thing is to visualise them with your calendar or in some timeline.
