Mac Mini Display Size <body> I have a new Mac Mini connected to my HDTV with an HDMI cable and the desktop is larger than my screen so I can't see the menu bar at the top.  How do I adjust this?  <answer150585> Go into System Preferences - Display - adjust the Underscan scale.  <answer150641> ul liSystem Preferences/li liDisplay/li liAdjust the resolution/li /ul  Adjusting the resolution can be somewhat of a personal preference depending on how you want it to be sized. After you've done that, it should always look that way when you have it connected to that particular HDTV.  <answer150714> Also many HDTVs have a way to zoom in and out for when the signal doesn't fill the screen. Look for a zoom button (or some such...) on its remote control
