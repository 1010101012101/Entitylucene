Input language stuck in English <body> I tried to change input language by pressing shortcut kbdcommand/kbdkbdspace/kbd and also by choosing language on the menu bar. It automatically switches to English language.   The only way I found to fix it by rebooting the Mac.  Maybe someone knows another way?  I'm using English, Japanese and Russian on a MacBook Pro running OS X Yosemite 10.10.5.  <answer244226> By putting Mac to sleep(holding the power button for couple sec) and then log in again it solves the problem, and I'm able to switch languages again.  <comment300944> There is no input source called "English".  Do you actually mean US? <comment300945> Does this happen in all apps including TextEdit, Mail, Safari? <comment301079> @Tom Gewecke Yes, you're right "US" :) Yes, it happens in all app.
