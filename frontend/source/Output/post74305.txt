Unable to Turn iTunes Match Off <body> I Have some mp3 files in my iTunes library that will not go through iCloud, i.e., the cloud icon has a line through it.  When I disable iTunes Match on the pull down menu, iTunes still has "iTunes Match is on".  Please Help!  <comment86293> Maybe mention which OS, which iTunes version, which menu ... <comment86297> I found the solution to my problem!  I turned iTunes Match off on the phone itself.  Now I am able to sync all my files manually! <comment86299> We encourage people to answer their questions in the answer section. That lets other people know how you solved your problem.
