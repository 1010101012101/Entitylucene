Extract PDF Annotations in Automator isn't getting the content <body> OSX Yosemite 10.10.5. I'm using Preview.app to annotate PDFs. Now I want to extract all of the annotations from the documents, so I open Automator.app and connect the "Get Specified Finder Items" and "Extract PDF Annotations" together.  I ran it, and I get all of the metadata of annotations, but not any of the content.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qD7js.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment290214> I get the same behavior for El Capitan.
