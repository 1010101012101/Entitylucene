Still shot from video on iPhone <body> I took a video with my iPhone 5s. I would like to print one frame of this video as a still picture. I tried taking a screen shot of it, but ended up with the menu on the top and bottom of the picture. Is there an easier way of keeping one frame of a video as a still picture?  <answer212217> If you tap the screen, the top and bottom bars disappear, and you can take your screen shot then. However, taking a screenshot may give you a lower quality result that may not look nice printed out. iMovie (Mac or for iPhone) should be able to do this without a loss in quality, as well as other video editors / certain video players (e.g. VLC).  <answer215493> There are several apps if you want to do it on iphone.  I used Vhoto for a while ago. They also added gif conversion. Its free so you can try easily Here are the key features taken from itunes description.     Key Features:       ul   liRecord or import your videos/li   liVhoto finds and creates GIFs and pics/li   liTrim to create the perfect loop/li   liNudge to get the best moment/li   liEasily text GIFs and post anywhere to Tumblr, Instagram, Facebook, Twitter/li   li100% free! /li   /ul   <comment256223> Welcome to Ask Different.  Are you looking for a software suggestion? If so, please specify iOS or Mac or Windows or a combination. <comment256229> Or with VLC's snapshot feature. <comment372113> In iOS10 you're stuck with the pause icon in the middle of the image. <comment372114> @JustinEmlay pause icon? What app? <comment372138> Stock photo app to view videos.  When you pause it the start icon is right in the middle.  http://i.imgur.com/roeoXlT.jpg <comment372139> Play it then pause it and it doesn't come back, at least not in iOS 10.3.3
