System Integrity Protection (SIP) creating problem for oci_connect(): OCIEnvNlsCreate() <body> After I upgraded my OS to El Capitan (which comes with SIP), I am getting error in codeoci_connect()/code     Warning: oci_connect(): OCIEnvNlsCreate() failed. There is something wrong with your system - please check that DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH includes the directory with Oracle Instant Client libraries   If I disable the SIP, everything works fine again. But I understand keeping SIP disabled is not good for security. So I was looking for a solution to keep the SIP enabled and make codeoci_connect()/code work like before.   I am using XAMPP server for PHP and have oci8 for oci_connect.   I had a post on SO for this, where couldn't find any help yet : https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35356318/xampp-in-os-x-el-capitan-oci-connect-ocienvnlscreate-failed  <answer233822> Oracle ships instant client libs with wrong search paths. You can manually fix them by using:  https://github.com/kubo/fix_oralib_osx  AFAIK SIP influences how library search path is working. DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH can be ignored.
