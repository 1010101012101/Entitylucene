Recreate unknown users on crashed mac <body> About a month back one of our Macs crashed and we had to restore it. The computer had an external drive connected to it and all the data is still there. Though some of the users are "missing". If we look at the permissions the user field says "Loading..." (or something similar, not an English machine) for some of the users.  If we goto the terminal and use codels -l/code on the drive the 3rd column gives us a GID/UID and the 4th says codenogroup/code. (thanks Jason Salaz, for your answer).  Can we somehow recreate this group or user?  <comment102801> Wouldn't it be easier to just reassign a different owner/group to these files? <comment102803> The group has different permissions for different folders and there are alot of folders & files so it would take some time to do it by hand. <comment102804> Changing the group ownership (with `chgrp -R`) does not change permissions per se.
