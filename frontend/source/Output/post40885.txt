How to make this kind of global hotkey? <body>    strongPossible Duplicate:/strongbr   Create global shortcut to run command line applications       I want to assign a command to a certain key. This command will fire no matter what window is active. It will do the same thing as typing a certain command in terminal. I was able to do this in Linux, but how can I set this up in OSX Lion?  I want to run the terminal command without the terminal window opening up at all.  <comment46304> By command, do you mean a Unix-style command-line command?Do you want this command to run in a new Terminal window, in the frontmost existing Terminal window, or to run but not in a window at all? It looks like your question is the same as the one identified above as a duplicate, but if you are asking something else, edit to show the differences and we can reopen this.
