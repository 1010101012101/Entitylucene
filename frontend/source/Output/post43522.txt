Helvetica font rendering issue on MacBook Leopard <body> So I have just re-installed Leopard on my MacBook and recovered from my Time Machine only to find I have font rendering issues with the Helvetica font:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zEUDb.png" alt=""  This happens in browser or in apps like Mail. Can anybody offer a solution?  <answer43531> You may have a problem with your font caches. Download a copy of the free Onyx for Leopard, and execute a maintenance/cleaning task for Fonts:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/SLSra.png" alt="Onyx"  It is recommended that you restart your computer after that. Take the time to see the other maintenance/cleaning options around. It's good to use Onyx every now and then to start from scratch. I use Cocktail which is essentially the same (but paid). I use it probably 4 times a year, but it helps keeping things clean.  Mac OS X doesn't really need these utilities to work, because it does have its own cleaning scripts and jobs, but after so many years of OS X experience, I've noted that some things can escape (or get corrupted) and these small utilities (either one) will save you some time.   <answer43532> It looks like the Helvetica Fractions font, which is pretty much incompatible with OS X.  You may need to remove it entirely.  <answer43570> I was forced to update to Leopard 10.5.8 to get MS Office working. This update did in turn fix the issue with the Helvetica font. Many thanks guys.  <comment49461> Have you tried clearing the font caches with `sudo atsutil databases -remove; atsutil server -shutdown; atsutil server -ping`?
