How can I show iPhone display in Macbook or iMac i.e. on larger screen? <body> I like to read books in PDF Expert while waiting busses. When I go home, I would like to see the iPhone screen on iMac or Macbook. I have VGA -adapter but I have no external display with male-VGA so cannot use it. So how can I show iPhone display in more large screen such as Macbook or iMac?  <comment83484> If you have a newer iPhone and an Apple TV, you can show your iPhone display on a really large TV screen. <comment83492> do you have an external display with female-VGA port? <comment83527> @ShineethHamza no, I don't have. I have iMac, Macbook -- available.
