Replaced /usr/bin/vim - now I get error messages <body> I tried to upgrade from the default vim install on Mac OS X (vim 7.2) to the one used by MacVim (vim 7.3) by creating a symlink:  precodeln -s /Applications/MacVim.app/Contents/MacOS/Vim /usr/bin/vim  /code/pre  However, now I get the following error messages:  precodesk@supernova:~/ &gt; /usr/bin/vim E254: Cannot allocate color Red E254: Cannot allocate color White E254: Cannot allocate color Blue E254: Cannot allocate color Red E254: Cannot allocate color Grey E254: Cannot allocate color Blue E254: Cannot allocate color Brown E254: Cannot allocate color SeaGreen E254: Cannot allocate color SeaGreen E254: Cannot allocate color Yellow E254: Cannot allocate color Red E254: Cannot allocate color Blue E254: Cannot allocate color Magenta E254: Cannot allocate color DarkCyan E254: Cannot allocate color LightMagenta E254: Cannot allocate color Grey E254: Cannot allocate color Blue E254: Cannot allocate color Magenta E254: Cannot allocate color Red E254: Cannot allocate color Yellow E254: Cannot allocate color Black E254: Cannot allocate color LightGrey E254: Cannot allocate color DarkBlue E254: Cannot allocate color Grey E254: Cannot allocate color DarkBlue E254: Cannot allocate color Grey E254: Cannot allocate color DarkBlue E254: Cannot allocate color LightGrey E254: Cannot allocate color LightBlue E254: Cannot allocate color LightMagenta E254: Cannot allocate color Blue E254: Cannot allocate color LightCyan E254: Cannot allocate color LightGrey E254: Cannot allocate color Grey90 E254: Cannot allocate color Grey90 E254: Cannot allocate color LightRed E254: Cannot allocate color DarkGrey E254: Cannot allocate color LightGrey E254: Cannot allocate color Cyan Error detected while processing /Users/sk/.vimrc: line    1: E185: Cannot find color scheme desert Press ENTER or type command to continue /code/pre  Anyone knows how to fix this? If I run just codevim/code or code/Applications/MacVim.app/Contents/MacOS/Vim/code directly I don't get the error messages. Only if code/usr/local/bin/vim/code gets called. Either directly or via another command line application.  hr  Just if someone comments that I could have simply created an alias, I actually did that before  precodealias vim=/Applications/MacVim.app/Contents/MacOS/vim /code/pre  however, some other command line tools were still using code/usr/bin/vim/code.  <answer14301> Looks like it has something to do with your color scheme. Deactivate the desert theme in your .vimrc and see whether it helps. Change codecolorscheme desert/code to code'colorscheme desert/code.  The best way to avoid such problems is to install vim 7.3 from the mac ports.   <answer14312> Changing something in /usr/bin is not the best way to go about things as Apple can just overwrite it again.  The errors are probably as @karmatic says but probably the best thing to do here is put the symbolic link in /usr/local/bin and make your shell have that in the path earlier than /usr/bin.  As far as I know no command line tool uses /usr/bin/vi directly (I use emacs so I would spot having to use vi) What they do is use the environment variable $EDITOR so set that to /usr/local/bin  <answer14317> This is a known issue. From code:help MacVim/code:  precodeNote: Starting MacVim by creating a symlink to &gt;     .../MacVim.app/Contents/MacOS/Vim with 'ln -s' does not work. /code/pre  I found a lot of people getting a string of E254 errors from using a symlink. See this ticket on the MacVim issue repository. The solution follows:  pre    Most likely this is because you have symlinked directly to     the Vim binary, which Cocoa does not allow.  Please use an     alias or the mvim shell script instead./pre  MacVim comes with a startup shell script, codemvim/code. You can alias it to codevim/code if you'd prefer to use it instead of the system vim. If you want to start vim in the terminal rather than as a gui application, set the alias to codemvim -v/code. Add codeexport EDITOR=vim/code to your code~/.bash_profile/code to make sure that any terminal applications are using the now-aliased vim. This should cover all your bases.  <answer50018> I don't have any rep yet so I can't comment on michaelmichael's answer but based on his answer I edited the codemvim/code wrapper script to add another case statement. So that if $name was codevim/code it will add the code-v/code option. I then symlinked code/usr/local/bin/mvim/code to code/usr/local/bin/vim/code.  precode47 # vimdiff, view, and ex mode 48 case "$name" in 49     vim) 50         opts="$opts -v" 51         ;; 52     *vimdiff) /code/pre  This was all because in some cases I couldn't rely on EDITOR being set or on aliases but I could rely on /usr/local/bin being in PATH.  <answer223584> codebrew install vim/code  codesudo ln -s /usr/local/Cellar/vim/&lt;VIM_VERSION&gt;/bin/vim /usr/bin/vim/code  By the way, if OS is EI Capitan , you have to disable SIP as blow:  How do I disable SIP  <answer225465> Highly recommend using homebrew's code--with-override-system-vim/code.  Installs MacVim and creates the /usr/local/bin/vim symlink. Works for command line codevim/code as well as invocations of codeEDITOR/code.  Here's the command:  precodebrew install macvim --with-override-system-vim /code/pre  (On a side note, the brew version of MacVim works well with YouCompleteMe plugin)  <comment15407> Unfortunately not. I tried that before. I then don't get the `E185: Cannot find color scheme desert` error, but still all the others. <comment172865> Actually the full listing of what fg colors are available are hard coded.  https://github.com/b4winckler/macvim/blob/master/src/syntax.c#L7580-L7587
