Why screenshot of same content appears more saturated on iPad 3 retina vs. Macbook Air LCD? <body> When I scale a screenshot of the same image from my iPad 3 retina to that on my MB Air the resulting image appears more saturated (unsure if it's a uniform saturation). Why does this happen? Can I transform my screenshot from my LCD monitor to match a screenshot from my iPad 3 by changing the resolution, saturation, contrast, etc?  <answer154507> You could, but how would you know which is correct?  You would need accurate profiles for both screens. This could be done with colorimeter hardware/software, something like ColorMunki em(No affiliation, it's just what I use myself)/em, which can calibrate emboth/em your Mac &amp; iPad screens [also PCs, if you have them]  An app like Photoshop [&amp; possibly Gimp, though I've never used it] could then do the translation between the two, though once your screens are correctly calibrated, you may not need to.
