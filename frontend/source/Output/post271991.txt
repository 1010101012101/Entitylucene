How to set the Escape key to quit a Service? <body> I want to be able to hit the kbdEscape/kbd key on my keyboard to stop a Service (that is comprised of a em"Run AppleScript"/em action in Automator) while it is in the middle of running.  Incidentally, if one hits the kbdEscape/kbd key while a Service is running, that Service will immediately stop by default. However, five seconds after you hit the kbdEscape/kbd key and the Service is terminated, a dialog pops up with an error:     The action “Run AppleScript” encountered an error.   Is it possible to implement the same function, except without the error, perhaps by using AppleScript?  <comment342105> Related: [Stack Overflow - stop applescript script from running on keypress ESC](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/33294628/stop-applescript-script-from-running-on-keypress-esc) <comment347190> Oddly enough, I just tried this again today, and I found that the Escape key does in fact now quit a Service without giving the user any error. I'm not sure if I should delete this question or not, at this point. I guess that I'll just wait and see if the error ever makes another appearance...
