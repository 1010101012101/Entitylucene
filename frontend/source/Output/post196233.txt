How to update Java from 8 Update 31 to 8 Update 51 when install fails? <body> I'm trying to update Java on my Mac OSX Yosemite.  In the codeJava Control Panel/code, it states:  precodeA critical Java security update is available.  8 Update 51 (57 MB)  Your current version is Java 8 Update 31. It is recommended that you update  now to keep your system secure. /code/pre  I click the codeUpdate Now/code button and it brings up the codeSoftware Update/code dialog that indicates I must relaunch the browser to update, but it will not need to reboot the computer.  I click the codeInstall Update/code button which brings up the codeUpdating Java/code dialog that downloads 60 MB, extracts it, and then very briefly says codeready to update/code before disappearing.  Returning to the codeJava Control Panel/code shows I'm still on codeUpdate 31/code, repeating the process has same result.  How can I get the update to actually install?  <answer196244> When an automated update process fails without an explicit reason then one method of dealing with it is to manually uninstalled the present installed version and then install the current full version downloaded manually from the source website.  Looking at How do I uninstall Java on my Mac?, which applies to versions 7.0, 8.0 on OS X for the strongJRE/strong, one needs to do the following:     strongUninstall Oracle Java using the Terminal/strong      strongNote:/strong To uninstall Java, you must have Administrator privileges and execute the remove command either as root or by using the sudo.br   Remove one directory and one file (a symlink), as follows:      ol   liClick on the strongFinder/strong icon located in your dock/li   liClick on the strongUtilities/strong folder/li   liDouble-click on the strongTerminal/strong icon/li   liIn the Terminal window strongCopy and Paste/strong the command below:      codesudo rm -fr /Library/Internet\ Plug-Ins/JavaAppletPlugin.plugin/code      codesudo rm -fr /Library/PreferencePanes/JavaControlPanel.prefpane/code/li   /ol      Do not attempt to uninstall Java by removing the Java tools from   code/usr/bin/code. This directory is part of the system software and any   changes will be reset by Apple the next time you perform an update of   the OS.   strongManually download the latest version from:/strong Java SE Downloads  strongNote:/strong  For normal strongBrowser/strong usage choose the strongJRE/strong however if wanting to use the latest Java from the Command Line in a Terminal choose the strongJDK/strong.  Additionally if you already have the Java JDK installed I noticed that after updating from version 1.8.0_45 to 1.8.0_51 via the strongJava Control Panel/strong under strongSystem Preferences/strong that it only updated the strongJRE/strong components to version1.8.0_51, not the strongJDK/strong and it remained at 1.8.0_45.  So I uninstalled the strongJDK/strong following the directions in Uninstalling the JDK as well as the commands from the directions listed above.     strongUninstalling the JDK/strong To uninstall the JDK, you must have Administrator privileges and execute the remove command either as root   or by using the sudo(8) tool.

This directory is part of the system software and any   changes will be reset by Apple the next time you perform an update of   the OSbr   *The 7u4 and 7u5 releases were installed into a directory that does not follow this format. To uninstall 7u4 or 7u5, remove the 1.7.0.jdk   directory from the same location.   I then downloaded the current JDK and installed it and am now using the latest version of Java both in a Browser and the Command Line in a Terminal.  <answer196277> No need to uninstall the current version. From the Java website just download the Java 8 update 51 (JDK)from Oracle site and install manually. After installation, no need to reboot the machine. Check version in Terminal or Java panel. It will show the updated version.  <comment234384> Have you tried uninstalling the installed version and manually download the current release and then install it? <comment234437> No need to uninstall the current version. Just download the update 51 and install. Check version in Terminal or Java panel. It will show the updated version. <comment240940> @PratikaRana I see the same issue - The Update doesn't seem to have any effect.  Repeating the Update still has no effect.
