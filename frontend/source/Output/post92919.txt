How to use environment variables in applescript <body> I'd like to use my environment variables, which were defined in my environment.plist file, in my applescript.  How do I do that, for instance:  precodelog "Glassfish Home: " &amp; AS_HOME /code/pre  Where AS_HOME is my environment variable.  <answer92921> Try this:  precodelog "Glassfish Home: " &amp; (system attribute "AS_HOME") /code/pre  <comment109006> That's it, thanks!
