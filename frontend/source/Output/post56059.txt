How can I verify a Lion FileVault recovery key? <body> I have a volume that is encrypted with OS X Lion's full-disk FileVault. When I enabled FileVault I was given a recovery key, which I wrote down. I'd like to verify that the recovery key that I wrote down is correct before I store it somewhere safe.  How can I verify that a FileVault recovery key is correct?  <answer56095> After you enable FileVault2 you will be prompted to restart your Mac.  Upon startup you will be presented with a dialog box asking for your password. Typing in the wrong login password three times will produce a note under the password field which states, "If you forgot your password, you can… …reset it using your recovery key."  Click the triangle-button next to that message to reveal the Recovery Key textfield (which replaces the password textfield)  If the recovery key allows you to login then you know it worked. You will be asked to change your admin password if use the recovery key.  http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4790  <answer57246> You should boot on the Recovery HD and use Terminal there to unlock the drive using the recovery key (you can't check the recovery key if you are booted on the crypted disk, since the unlocking process will fail: already unlocked).  To start with, you will need to identify the Logical Volume UUID of the encrypted drive using the diskutil corestorage list command:  precodediskutil corestorage list /code/pre  Running that command will give you a listing of all Core Storage volumes.   Once you have the UUID of the encrypted volume, you can then unlock the encrypted volume using the following commands:  precodediskutil corestorage unlockVolume UUID /code/pre  When prompted enter the passphrase you would like to test.

The codefdesetup/code command was expanded to support recovery key changes and verification.  codesudo fdesetup validaterecovery/code will prompt you for the key, which should be entered in all caps with the hyphens.  <comment64441> OK. That is a little more destructive than I had hoped, but I guess its a good excuse to change my admin password. <comment64473> @acm — The recovery key is intended as a last resort if you forget your admin password. <comment64486> Yes, I understand that. But I'd like to verify that my transcription of the recovery key is correct. Trust but verify, etc. Otherwise, when I need it most, it won't be right... So I had hoped there was a utility that would let me determine if a given key was valid. <comment135323> → acm: I agree with your need to check without any side effect. I want to check what I have to trust, otherwise I won't. Excellent question & argument. <comment135475> Excellent and simple procedure with no side effect ;). <comment163300> Excellent question :). Never enter a dark room without checking the exit first.
