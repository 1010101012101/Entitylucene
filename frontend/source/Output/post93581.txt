mobi file on Kindle - MacPro & MacBook <body> I bought an electronic book.  I downloaded the mobi version of the book.  And loaded it into my kindle-macPro.  Started reading it, highlighting, etc...worked great.  Then I wanted to read the book on my macbook.  Opened up kindle on my macbook and the book wasn't there.  So, I copied the file from my kindle directory, loaded into kindle, it opened up, but it didn't have any of my hightlights.  I do not own a kindle device.  Is there an easier way for me to share the book across multiple machines?  <answer93588> I would recommend using the Send to Kindle program from Amazon for synchronization. It has options to send to other devices (like your macs.)  <comment109894> Wow, thanks for this.  You know, I think it worked.  I still don't see my high-lights showing up.  But at least it is remembering my last read-position.  Over the weekend, I'll clean-up kindle and try again...will post my findings.
