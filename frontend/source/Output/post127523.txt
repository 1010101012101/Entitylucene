Office for Mac requires activation password on every boot <body> I have an Office 365 subscription on a Mac Mini running Mavericks. On every boot, I am prompted to enter my Office 365 account user name and password to activate my Office for Mac installation. Is there any way to make the activation permanent?  <comment149400> Have you received any support from Microsoft on this issue? <comment149561> @Buscarì›ƒ, it asks for username (email) and password.
