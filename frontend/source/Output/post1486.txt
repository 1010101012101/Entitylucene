Where are bash profile startup files? <body> I know that you can have a code.profile/code or code.bashrc/code file in your home folder to customise Mac OS X 10.6.4 Terminal bash startup.  Every time I start up Terminal, there is a line that tells me "You've got mail". I am trying to find where this line is stated in my startup files, but can't find .bash nor code.profile/code nor code.bashrc/code in my home folder.  I also read that the global settings file is in code/etc/profile/code and code/etc/bashrc/code, but they don't seem to tell me anything:  strong/etc/profile/strong  precode# System-wide .profile for sh(1)  if [ -x /usr/libexec/path_helper ]; then         eval `/usr/libexec/path_helper -s` fi  if [ "${BASH-no}" != "no" ]; then         [ -r /etc/bashrc ] &amp;&amp; . /etc/bashrc fi /code/pre  strong/etc/bashrc/strong  precode# System-wide .bashrc file for interactive bash(1) shells. if [ -z "$PS1" ]; then    return fi  PS1='\h:\W \u\$ ' # Make bash check its window size after a process completes shopt -s checkwinsize /code/pre  BTW, there is no code/etc/bash/code  Any ideas? Thanks!  <answer1494> That particular line (codeYou have mail/code) isn't actually part of bash's startup but an alert that your local account on your computer has received mail for some reason.  You can use codemail/code to read and delete the message or just delete the message (most likely a bounce back or something from development) from code/var/mail/username/code  <answer1495> This probably doesn't answer the mail question but here is some more info on the startup files.  Are you searching for the files in Finder?  Make sure that you are searching from a terminal and using codels -A/code so that hidden files (files beginning with a 'code./code') show up.  The following is from the Bash Reference Guide.  It describes the startup files that are executed when you start a new terminal window in OS X (which is an interactive, login shell).   h26.2 Bash Startup Files/h2  This section describes how Bash executes its startup files. If any of the files exist but cannot be read, Bash reports an error. Tildes are expanded in file names as described above under Tilde Expansion (see Section 3.5.2 [Tilde Expansion], page 19).  Interactive shells are described in Section 6.3 [Interactive Shells], page 75.   h3Invoked as an interactive login shell, or with ‘--login’/h3  When Bash is invoked as an interactive login shell, or as a non-interactive shell with the code--login/code option, it first reads and executes commands from the file code/etc/profile/code, if that file exists. After reading that file, it looks for code~/.bash_profile/code, code~/.bash_login/code, and code~/.profile/code, in that order, and reads and executes commands from the first one that exists and is readable. The code--noprofile/code option may be used when the shell is started to inhibit this behavior.  When a login shell exits, Bash reads and executes commands from the file ‘~/.bash_logout’, if it exists.  <answer8459> This notification is configured by environment variable codeMAILCHECK/code. See codeman bash/code and search for codeMAILCHECK/code (press code//code and type codeMAILCHECK/code to search in the man page).  Here's the relevant excerpt:  pre  MAILCHECK               Specifies how often (in seconds)  bash  checks  for  mail.   The               default  is  60 seconds.  When it is time to check for mail, the               shell does so before displaying the  primary  prompt.   If  this               variable  is  unset,  or  set  to  a  value that is not a number               greater than or equal to zero, the shell disables mail checking. /pre  To verify that this variable is indeed set, run codeecho $MAILCHECK/code  To disable this notification, add the following line to your code~/.bashrc/code  pre unset MAILCHECK /pre
