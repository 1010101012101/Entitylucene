Network Share set permissions don't work <body> I'm trying to use set default permissions for directories and files but not having much joy. What I am trying to share a specific directory on a local external drive connected to the server internally. Everyone in the group has access to the drive and can view all the files.  However once a new file is created by emmac08/em, the group permissions are not set and only that user has access to modify it.   Here is an example of two txt files. The one created by emmac08/em has 644 permissions and all other users like emmac07/em etc. can't write to the file.   I have a group called staff and have added everyone to it, but new files created don't follow.   precodedrwxrwxrwx+ 159 root  wheel  5406 22 Aug 11:08 PROJECTS  0: group:Staff allow list,add_file,search,add_subdirectory,delete_child,readattr,writeattr,readextattr,writeextattr,readsecurity /code/pre  New file created:   precode-rw-rw-rw-@ 1 root   wheel     351 22 Aug 23:17 test4.rtf  0: group:Staff allow read,write,append,readattr,writeattr,readextattr,writeextattr,readsecurity  1: user:aserver allow read,write,append,readattr,writeattr,readextattr,writeextattr,readsecurity  2: user:ckadmin allow read,write,append,readattr,writeattr,readextattr,writeextattr,readsecurity  -rw-r--r--@ 1 mac08  wheel     352 22 Aug 23:26 testet11.rtf  0: group:Staff allow read,write,append,readattr,writeattr,readextattr,writeextattr /code/pre  I can manually update the permissions through the strongGet Info/strong window but this requires me to reset permissions every time a person saves a new file to the drive. Any idea what it could be?  <answer250258> To create a properly working emProjects/em share do the following:  On your external disk create a folder "Projects". Share this emProjects/em with default permissions in Server.app  File Sharing. The default permissions are 755, the default owner is the user who created the folder and his primary group (e.g. adminuser:admin):  precodedrwxr-xr-x+   6 adminuser  admin  -       204 Aug 23 10:54 Projects  0: user:_spotlight inherited allow list,search,file_inherit,directory_inherit /code/pre  In this folder create another folder with the name emProjects/em. Change the permissions to 770 and the group to staff:  precodemkdir Projects chown adminuser:staff Projects chmod 770 Projects /code/pre  The permissions now look like this:  precodedrwxrwx---+   6 adminuser  staff  -       204 Aug 23 10:54 Projects  0: user:_spotlight inherited allow list,search,file_inherit,directory_inherit /code/pre  Then add an ACL for the group emstaff/em:  precodechmod +a "group:staff allow list,add_file,search,add_subdirectory,delete_child,readattr,writeattr,readextattr,writeextattr,readsecurity,file_inherit,directory_inherit" Projects /code/pre  with the result:  precodedrwxrwx---+ 2 adminuser  staff  -   68 Aug 23 11:09 Projects  0: group:staff allow list,add_file,search,add_subdirectory,delete_child,readattr,writeattr,readextattr,writeextattr,readsecurity,file_inherit,directory_inherit  1: user:_spotlight inherited allow list,search,file_inherit,directory_inherit /code/pre  The complete path to the Projects folder (containing a emtest/em folder and a test.txt file - emData/em is the name of my volume on the external disk) is then:  precode/Volumes/Data/Projects/Projects: total 0 drwxrwx---+ 4 adminuser  staff  - 136 Aug 23 11:24 . #this is /Volumes/Data/Projects/Projects  0: group:staff allow list,add_file,search,add_subdirectory,delete_child,readattr,writeattr,readextattr,writeextattr,readsecurity,file_inherit,directory_inherit  1: user:_spotlight inherited allow list,search,file_inherit,directory_inherit drwxr-xr-x+ 6 adminuser  admin  - 204 Aug 23 11:09 .. #this is /Volumes/Data/Projects  0: user:_spotlight inherited allow list,search,file_inherit,directory_inherit drwxr-xr-x+ 2 adminuser  staff  -  68 Aug 23 11:24 test  0: group:staff inherited allow list,add_file,search,add_subdirectory,delete_child,readattr,writeattr,readextattr,writeextattr,readsecurity,file_inherit,directory_inherit  1: user:_spotlight inherited allow list,search,file_inherit,directory_inherit -rw-r--r--+ 1 adminuser  staff  -   0 Aug 23 11:24 test.txt  0: group:staff inherited allow read,write,execute,append,readattr,writeattr,readextattr,writeextattr,readsecurity  1: user:_spotlight inherited allow read,execute /code/pre  Now any subsequent file and folder of em/Volumes/Data/Projects/Projects/em can be modified by any user in the group emstaff/em. You may tweak/tighten some of the permissions by not adding them (e.g. readextattr and writeextattr)  <comment310606> Who created the file test4.rtf? <comment310645> I did but then manually reset the permissions so that Group could have access. <comment310647> You did this with your root user? Or has the root user ownership been propagated to subsequent files by updating the permissions in the get info window? <comment310649> Yes if I use get info and reset permissions from the root folder Project it does propagate to all folders. But without that if I create new folder or file it only sets permissions for RWX for user who created it. <comment310797> Great looks to be working thanks, now how come that can not be done thought UI? appreciate he help. <comment310798> @namit It can be done partially with the get info window by adding a 4th entry (e.g. a new group or user). It's not as fine-grained though. Else: [propedit](http://www.eosgarden.com/en/freeware/propedit/overview/) <comment310799> Thanks appreciate your help banging head off wall why this kept resetting and hit and miss on users. <comment310801> @namit This is standard UNIX behavior. You may change umask though - which is not recoommended. Standard umask is 022. If you change it to 002 you will get a similar behavior as with the provided chmod +a command. The linked app (somehow abandoned-ware) works at least with 10.9. <comment310807> @namit If the linked app (PropEdit works) in your system, you can [legally](http://www.eosgarden.com/en/freeware/propedit/buy/) use the following key to register it:  0GYF-CMX2-49X3-B1VH-8CA9 <comment311217> After 2 days of messing with this have moved all files to new disk and this seams to be working much smoother. Something looks to be definitely broken with internal disk. <comment311224> @namit Hmm primary disks??? <comment311253> Have 2 disks in server and both seam to not take permissions correctly, have it connected to external hard disk and sharing off that. Will wait and see if users are happy.
