How to disable delete shortcut in Mail <body> In mail I often accidentally end up moving email to trash by hitting the delete key (I've remapped keys on my keyboard so delete is closer to other frequently used keys). Since mail already has a cmd + delete shortcut through the menu items, I'd like to disable this default behavior.  Is there any way to not have delete move emails in Mail?  Note: I want to over ride just the delete key, not the menu item shortcut cmd + delete.
