How can I find the free app of the day? <body> I'm a Mac user. I want to know which software will help me find the free app of the day in the App Store?  App store always lists the free apps, but it doesnâ€™t display the original price of the applications.  <answer36579> I use Store News which is excellent for finding out price drops and discounted apps.  If you have an iOS device, try AppZapp - allows you to set watch lists, and push notifications and has the ability to track Mac Apps too.  <answer36639> AppShopper is my personal favorite . Notifies you change of version bumps and price changes if the item is in your strongWant/strong list.  <comment48522> i think we didn't need version bump? App Store can do itself right?
