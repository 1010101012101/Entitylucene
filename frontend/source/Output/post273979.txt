Recovery Mode is taking too long to erase my USB stick <body> I had some problems with my USB stick so I wanted to erase it via Disk Utility but a "Operation failed" message appeared.  So, I am currently erasing it via Recovery Mode.  However, it is taking too long and it's stuck in "Mounting disk" message.   Any solution? What happens if I shut down my computer and just use another USB stick?  Please help ASAP.   Thanks.   <answer274028> Here's a trick that I've used before.  On the Disk Utility sidebar, if you select the emstorage device/em, not the partition, you have the option to emcompletely/em erase the disk and rebuild the partition table.  It looks like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/S1XMY.png" alt="enter image description here"  Compare this to what you see if you just try to erase and reformat the partition:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5g1Mo.png" alt="enter image description here" Notice that the "Scheme" option is missing.  If you use this option (which I believe is what you're trying to do), then it's trying to work with the existing partitioning and metadata, which has the potential to cause problems like what you're seeing.  <comment344440> Which macOS are you using? <comment344442> @Bob macOS Sierra. I unplugged it and plugged it in again and tried to erase it via Disk Utility but it says "couldn't open device". <comment344444> Were those the exact words?  I'm familiar with a dialog that says "The disk you inserted is not readable by this computer," but not "couldn't open device."  Does it give an error code?  (they usually look something like `-1000`) <comment344445> Yes, check my recent question in my profile it contains a screenshot.
