Since when is it possible to CMD-Q Finder? <body> I am on OSX 10.10.1. As of very recently (can't be more than a couple of days, else I would've noticed it sooner I think), I am able to quit the Finder by hitting kbdâŒ˜/kbd-kbdQ/kbd, which will emquit/em the Finder app, not only close the window. There is also a Quit Finder menu entry, I don't know if that was there before. I asked someone who also uses Yosemite and as expected, they can't do it.  The question is: Why is this suddenly possible, has anyone else experienced it and how can I revert this change?   <answer167876> The Quit menu item in Finder can be enabled by  ul liOnyx, Cocktail, Secrets etc/li liDirectly in Terminal with codedefaults write com.apple.finder QuitMenuItem -bool YES/code/li /ul  <comment196854> Onyx, Cocktail, Secrets etc could all enable that. It's a toggle-able item. If you're any good with terminal it's com.apple.finder QuitMenuItem bool [but I'm no good with terminal so idk how to convert that info to a terminal command] <comment196855> You're right, that was it! I use Onyx, but can't remember having checked the box. <comment196857> Cool. I'll drop it to an answer for future users - though I hope some kind soul will edit in the correct way to do it in Terminal, for completeness. <comment196862> Thank you for the edit patrix, makes it a good Question & Answer now.
