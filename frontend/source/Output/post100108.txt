However i am only able to boot up with 1x2gb ddr 1067mhz and a 1x4gb 1333mhz. If i were to put in 2x4gb ram into the macbookpro, there will be a boot issue. weird sound will be heard.  <comment117837> Make sure your ram is seated correctly. Sounds coming out of the computer when upgrading ram isn't normal. It will either boot or not boot at all. <comment117925> does it means that even if there is incompatibility issues such as higher mhz in the ram, the macbook will still not produce a sound? <comment117945> Is it a beeping sound or a physical hardware sound? If it's beeping then the ram is not compatible.
