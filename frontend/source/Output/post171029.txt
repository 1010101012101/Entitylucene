Is there a way to capture the current cursor image in OS X <body> I'm trying to report a bug where the cursor shape matters. The two easy screen capture methods exclude the cursor:  ul liCommand-Shift-3/li liThe Applications-Utilities-Grab program/li /ul  With grab you can set a specific cursor, which misses the point.  Here I want to capture the cursor shape that occurs when the mouse is in a specific place in a specific application.  How can I capture the entire screen, just as I see it, including the cursor?  <answer171031> You can use the CLI:  precodescreencapture -T 5 -C /path/to/file.png /code/pre  supcode-T &lt;seconds&gt;/code is the delay before taking the screenshot. code-C/code captures the cursor in the screenshot./sup  Related: Taking a screenshot of a tooltip
