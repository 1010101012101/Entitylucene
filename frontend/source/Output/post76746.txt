Error "/dev/disk04 could not be mounted" when using NTFS-3G <body> I use NTFS-3G in order to let myself read and write to my external hard drive in the correct format. My Mac is also bootcamped with Windows 7 on the other side.   Every time I startup my Mac I get an error saying that code/dev/disk04/code could not be mounted, and it asks me to force or abort it.  Any ideas as to where the root of that problem might be? I think it may be related to Boot Camp.

What solutions have you tried?

Can you add that to your question? <comment88982> how can i get the output? sorry im a Mac noob <comment88984> Open your *Terminal.app* from Applications/Utilities, then enter the command `diskutil list`. Paste the output here in the editor, and don't forget to select the text and press `Ctrl-K` so the code is indented properly. Also, where and when *exactly* is the output shown? In a window in Finder? <comment88985> Ok, will go grab my mac on my lunch in a couple hours and post the output then :) for now, the errors come up in an error window when i first logon to the machine. And it also comes up when i plug a USB device in such as my harddrive. <comment89423> I'm pretty sure i added it after installing bootcamp if that creates an issue?   Will try the fix on that link tonight, thanks!
