One hookup docking station / port replicator <body> They just got me (my very first ever) macbook pro at work.  I am really digging it thus far. One thing I would really like to do is "dock it" to my existing rig.. two dvi displays, keyboard, mouse, etc.  I know apple doesn't do docking stations so I was wondering what my options are?  So far it looks like I am going to have to plug and unplug up to 4 cables to accommodate my setup.  This is totally a pain.  I dock and undock my current laptop up to 5 times a day.  I don't want to have to mess will all these wires every time.  I thought apple was antiwire?  strongIdeally what I would like is: One cable (thunderbolt?) that goes to a box that has two high resolution ports for displays (dvi, hdmi, displayport, etc) and a few usb ports for my keyboard, mouse, and other miscellaneous stuff./strong  I don't suppose that could also power my macbook?  If not, then I will just have to live with two cables I suppose.  So far I can only find these "boxes" with just one hi-res port.  <answer140389> There are few docking solutions available for MacBooks:  ul liBelkin Thunderboltâ„¢ Express Dock/li liBelkin USB 3.0 Universal Docking Station with Dual DVI/li liHenge Docks' Horizontal Dock *preorder/li liZenboxx Zendock *kickstarter/li liLandingZone/li /ul  There are probably few more options that were not listed above.

I want one the "real" docks. So if I use one of the Thunderbolt hubs, then all I would need to so is get some thunderbolt to DVI connectors? <comment165689> what about hubs that include a dvi? [link](http://goo.gl/Hm8vsB). Then I can hook up two non thunderbolt displays right? Convert one TB to DVI and convert one HDMI to DVI. This seems like a viable solution? <comment165692> There are some constraints about using thunderbolt adapters with daisy chain thunderbolt connections. Read more on FAQ on the answer. Every Mac have a limit on how many displays it can handle. But you can also add USB displays if you really need to.
