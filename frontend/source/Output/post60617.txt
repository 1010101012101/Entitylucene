how do i uninstall an app in mountain lion? <body> I'm trying to uninstall MAMP and MAMP pro from my mountain lion macbook and don't know how i should do that. I tried dragging the icon from my launchpad to the Trash, but it doesn't work.br What should i do?  <answer60622> Go to the Applications (it should be in the sidebar of the Finder) and drag the app into the trash from there.  <answer60624> MAMP has a specific uninstaller in the disk image you installed with. Mount that disk image and you should see the uninstaller. Go here for more information.  For the rest of your apps that don't have specific uninstallers, use AppZapper, which is a nice utility. There are a few alternatives (CleanMyMac has a built in function for this) http://www.appzapper.com/  <answer67149> There are a few issues with uninstalling MAMP; I found a blog post that details what you need to do to fully uninstall MAMP here which refers to a Stack Overflow answer here  <comment69778> read the question wrong the first time - just updated my answer. <comment69780> i trashed the disk image, of course :) i'll try appZapper <comment69782> ok i had used a mac with 10.6.8 and i was wondering where the hell the Application folder had gone :) <comment69783> I would advise against using AppZapper if it's got an uninstaller built for it. Try Applications/MAMP Pro/... and see if the uninstaller is there. <comment69846> actually there is the uninstaller, but if i try to do use that, after inserting the password i get "Error - the privileged action failed"
