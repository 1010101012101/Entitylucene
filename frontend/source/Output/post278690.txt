Music uploaded to iCloud grey/unavailable on iPhone <body> Over the weekend I spent a lot of time downloading my personal library from Google Music and uploading to iCloud/matching with iTunes on my Mac. I've removed all the local copies from my Mac, and can still stream the music from the internet just fine.  However, despite everything seeming to have gone fine, when I go to Apple Music on my iPhone and look through my library, a lot of the music is showing up but is greyed out and unavailable. This is often portions of albums, where the rest of the album is showing up and available. Also, the artwork is missing. The image below shows what I mean. Some tracks are there, some aren't, and no artwork.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wgbWv.png" alt="album with unavailable tracks and no artwork"  Despite all this, there are no issues on my iPad. Everything is showing up without any problems.  Is there some way to force the Music app on my iPhone to sync with iCloud? Is this a common problem? Does it just take a while for it all to sync? Am I just being impatient?
