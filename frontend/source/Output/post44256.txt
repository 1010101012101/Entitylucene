Is there an Apple list of terminal based tweaks? <body> Googling for terminal tweaks shows sites this one which show how to tweak OS X via the Terminal. Are there any Apple or exhaustive lists of these settings anywhere on the net?  <answer44257> There is a pretty good database full of codedefaults write/code commands at http://secrets.blacktree.com/  They also have a PrefPane that allows you to use System Preferences to set these hidden preferences.  <answer44259> h1Mac Kung Fu Book/h1  It's not a free resource ($23), but I believe it should be mentioned here.  About the book:  ul liMany of the tips in this book exploit settings or experimental features never officially made public./li li"exploit secret settings and hidden apps"/li li"tweak your system" /li li"learn valuable security tricks"/li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LWWrC.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer44403> As it turns out, there appears to be a way to scout for these settings yourself. Neat.sup[1]/sup  sup[1]/sup Props to this user for linking the above article in this answer.  <comment50289> +1 That's a really good resource I like to just skim through! <comment50301> What problem are you trying to solve? I'm tempted to just close this since it's the equivalent of "what books can be written with a text editor" or "what programs can be thought up with Xcode". Terminal is so powerful and self-modifies the system, so the true answer is infinite. <comment50380> Question seems straight forward enough - nathang pointed to one such list.  'Exhaustive'?  Well, probably only Apple could answer that but 'comprehensive' is pretty darn useful.
