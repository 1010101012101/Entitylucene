Is the color of a Macbook influencing tone of the display screen? <body> My question may seem subjective but I would like to have scientific or experienced feedback about it.  I'm currently trying the new Macbook Gold Rose and I don't feel really happy with it because I feel the aluminium color changes the tone of the screen. I mean that light must be reflecting on the Rose aluminium of the keyboard and may give a rose tone to the screen. Or maybe my eyes see the Rose aluminium and make the tone of the screen appear changed.  Am I going mad or can it be true ?  And if the color of aluminium influences our eyes about the tone of the screen, which color is the most neutral ? Dark aluminium or silver ?  Thanks
