How can I make Arabic fonts in GIMP work? <body> If I select an Arabic font like Kufi (كوفي) and enter text into GIMP 2.8.14 on OS X 10.11, this is the result:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YVbJ6.png" alt="Screenshot of GIMP with broken Arabic"  As you can see, the letters are incorrectly disjointed.  If I right-click on the text and select "From right to left", it makes no difference. In the text tool's options, I can change the language from English to Arabic, but it makes no difference. I can also change the justification to centered or to left-aligned, but it makes no difference.  Some fonts I select do render with the letters connected, but it looks like it's simply using a fallback font.  <answer212371> You better ask Gimp! Gimp FAQ :  http://www.gimp.org/docs/userfaq.html Or ask Gimp Support.  <comment256446> The FAQ doesn't have an answer to this question.
