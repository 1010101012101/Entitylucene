Cannot close Microsoft Word document <body> I am using Microsoft Word for Mac on my MacBook Pro OS X (Yosemite). I tried closing a Word document but clicking on the red button made it turn gray and nothing happened. I can minimize the Word document, but can't move it to trash nor save the document.  <answer174030> I wasn't able to Quit Word from the drop down menu, but I found that when I clicked the Apple icon in the upper left corner, I could click on Force Quit and that worked!  <answer217523> In Mac MSWord with the document open and the three buttons x + - not showing you seem to have no facility to close the document without quitting Mac MSWord.  You can go to the File drop down menu and select Close file. The active document closes.   Mac MSWord remains open, so you can continue work on other documents. It is my experience that not all Mac MSWord documents I am working in present without the no x + - buttons phenomenon . So there seems some underlying issue ...  When the buttons are visible the File dropdown menu does not yield this Close file option.  <answer245115> Just hit escape and file will shrink, and options to close, minimize reappear  <answer263942> Just hit " command q" and it will close all windows.  <comment204685> moving to trash is not a word operation is it? What happens if you quit Word? <comment204693> MS is usually good in telling you why. So look for a message (probably hidden behind other windows). <comment204766> are you using 365 or 2011? <comment302118> Welcome to Ask Different.
