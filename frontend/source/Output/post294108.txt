Can’t get my volume button to work at all <body> Recently my MacBook Air stopped allowing me to adjust the volume. Whether I press kbdF12/kbd or kbdF11/kbd it shows a emforbidden/em symbol on it, as in the picture below.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5uKay.jpg" alt="Volume Forbidden"  After some research I discovered there is a mute button in System Preferences, and you are supposed to make sure that it isn’t muted. However I don’t have the option to unmute it.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/G2AtY.png" alt="No output devices found"  Anyone know what to do in this case? I’ve restarted the computer several times but that didn’t fix anything.  <answer294273> I've had a similar problem with other macs. Resetting my PRAM  by pressing command + option + p+ r during reboot fixed the problem for me   <comment371198> Are you sure your speakers weren't damages in any way? <comment371200> Seems to be a somewhat known glitch with the Air, some more discussion here that might help: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/1736638?start=345&tstart=0 <comment371432> In the picture, it just shows the desktop and the command window - no menu bar, dock, or files on the desktop. Did you hide those for the purpose of this question, or are you logged into your computer differently?
