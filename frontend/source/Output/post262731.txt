How to fix HDD failure on a MacBook Pro? <body> My daughter's Mac failed to boot. I did:  ol liRecovery Mode - would not allow to reinstall OS X, Disk Utility failed./li liInternet Recovery Mode - doesn't work/li liCreated external drive with OS X, rebooted successfully from it./li liTried everything "standard", not working, Repair fails. /li liErased HDD (worked); rest no change, tried again Disk Utility etc. with no results./li liTerminal attempts:  precodediskutil verifyvolume disk0s2 The volume could not be verified completely. File system check exit code is 8. diskutil repairvolume disk0s2 The volume could not be verified completely.

If it's a hardware issue, your best bet would be to replace the failing drive with a new one.  Your MacBook Pro (MacBookPro7,1) is a Mid-2010 model which means it's a 7 year old drive (if it hasn't been replaced) which is well beyond the lifespan of spinning hard drives.  At this point, I would recommend upgrading to an SSD and even maxing out the memory for best performance.  While I agree with @klanomath that it emcould/em be the SATA cable, it's not the most likely culprit given the age of the laptop and drive.  My money is on a failed hard drive.  However, a replacement SATA cable is fairly inexpensive part to replace and if you decide to go that route, it won't be an expensive investment.   <comment329144> I'd suspect the [SATA cable](https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/MacBook+Pro+13-Inch+Unibody+Mid+2010+Hard+Drive+Cable+Replacement/4304) to be faulty - which is pretty common for a number of different MacBook Pro models; your daughter's included. <comment329246> Hi Allan and @klanomath, thanks for your suggestions. A couple more hints: First Aid always fails. Erasing HDD works. Installing OS X to HDD does not work (installation process always freezes). I can only boot from external drive. What is interesting: HDD appears to be completely full (after erasing and formatting), that is strange. Any more suggestions how to figure out if the issue is file system, failed HDD or just SATA cable, please? <comment329248> If it's the cable it will fail "everywhere" on the drive, not just in certain parts.  Try doing a secure erase and see if there are problems.  Also, just for grins and giggles, issue the command `diskutil info /dev/disk0 | grep -i smart`  and post the result.  Also, try running [Apple Hardware Test (AHT)](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201257).  Hold the D key while booting from a powered off state with the AC adapter connected. <comment329269> SMART status: Verified. <comment330076> AHT could not be initiated. After a couple of format/reformat attempts... has to go for the hardware check, I guess <comment330909> I am still leaning towards a failed disk.  If you swap it out with a new one, the problem should go away.
