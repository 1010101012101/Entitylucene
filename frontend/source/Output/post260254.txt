Open app in background from Terminal <body> I'm trying to open an app in the background from the Terminal by using the code-g/code or code--background/code flags like so  precodeopen -g -a Franz /code/pre  Unfortunately, the app isn't opening in the background. I've also tried the codej/code flag, which is supposed to hide the app, according to the help:  precodeUsage: open [-e] [-t] [-f] [-W] [-R] [-n] [-g] [-h] [-b &lt;bundle identifier&gt;] [-a &lt;application&gt;] [filenames] [--args arguments] Help: Open opens files from a shell.       By default, opens each file using the default application for that file.         If the file is in the form of a URL, the file will be opened as a URL. Options:        -a                Opens with the specified application.       -b                Opens with the specified application bundle identifier.       -e                Opens with TextEdit.       -t                Opens with default text editor.       -f                Reads input from standard input and opens with TextEdit.       -F  --fresh       Launches the app fresh, that is, without restoring windows. Saved persistent state is lost, excluding Untitled documents.       -R, --reveal      Selects in the Finder instead of opening.       -W, --wait-apps   Blocks until the used applications are closed (even if they were already running).           --args        All remaining arguments are passed in argv to the application's main() function instead of opened.       -n, --new         Open a new instance of the application even if one is already running.       -j, --hide        Launches the app hidden.       -g, --background  Does not bring the application to the foreground.       -h, --header      Searches header file locations for headers matching the given filenames, and opens them. /code/pre  The app opens in the foreground as if the I had simply called  precodeopen -a Franz /code/pre  Any idea why this doesn't work and an alternative?  <comment362332> I've tested it with several applications on macOS 10.12.5 and it works well. The problem is maybe related to the Franz application.
