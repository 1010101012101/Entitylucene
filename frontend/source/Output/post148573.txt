Apple Care email + payment request <body> Just got this email.  Did not open the link (since the price looked ridiculous).  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5OniD.png" alt="applecare"  The link would lead to a look a like the Apple Log In window.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/EHXIu.jpg" alt="log in"  What is up with that? someone trying to collect Apple ID information for next stage of criminal activity.  It looks like (bad) SCAM to me!?  <answer148575> Wouldn't trust it as far as I could spit it.br But strongemdon't ignore it/em/strong - that just lets them keep doing it to other people for longer.  Forward the email to reportphishing@apple.combr as per this Apple KB article - Phishing &amp; Other Suspicious Emails  I recently learned that many of the spelling &amp; grammatical mistakes in such phishing attempts as this are specifically designed to keep 'smart people' away &amp; prey only on the less savvy.br A cruel way to think.  <answer148576> The fact that the email originates from csparks@pineland.net, and the misspelling (responsinility) and grammar mistake ("In case of not paying") tells me it is a SCAM.   Delete and move on.  <comment174997> Don't ignore it, report it. <comment175000> Thanks for the phishing@apple.com <comment175010> It's very obvious spam. Look at the URL. Look at the mis-spellings and poor grammar.
