Will a sata3 SSD work properly on a Mac mini (Mid 2010) with 2.4 GHz CPU? <body> I have a Mac mini (Mid 2010) with 2.4 GHz CPU and willing to upgrade its HDD to SSD.   Can I use a sata3 SSD for it?  <answer31207> Nope, because SATA3 in a Mini began with the 2011 models, or with Core i5/i7 processors. The SSD would saturate the SATA2 bandwidth, but I don't see why you would spend more money for the little extra speed it's gonna give you. Stick with SATA2 SSDs is my advice.  <answer31243> Yes, you can.    Here are the theoretical bus speeds   SATAI   - 150 MB/sec - 1.5 Gb/sec SATAII  - 300 MB/sec -  3 Gb/sec  SATAIII - 600 MB/sec -  6 Gb/sec  In theory, a very fast drive could saturate a SATA2 bus, but if it does, it will still send the data, just slower than it's capable of.  If that bothers you, just buy a slower SATA2 SSD drive.  Regardless, you'll be very happy with the performance upgrade over a slower drive.  It's the best upgrade investment you can make.    <answer33776> SSDs with SATA-strongX/strong are strongbackward compatible/strong.  ul liSATA3 is compatible with SATA3, SATA2 and SATA1 connections/li liSATA2 is compatible with SATA2 and SATA1 connections/li /ul  I for example use a SSD with a SATA3 capability on a SATA1 bus. (Crucial m4 in MBP 3.1)  emMy advice:/em Always take the latest SSDs. They have a emmore refined garbage collection./em It's also preferable to take a SSD with SATA3 in order to profit from the faster bus speed in case you use the SSD in another computer some day.  <comment38549> It's preferable to take a SATA3 in order to profit from the faster bus speed in case you use the SSD in another computer some day. SATA3 SSDs are backward compatible with SATA2.
