Costs of canceling repair? <body> After cracking my iPhone, I contacted apple support, started a service request, and filled out the ""Send in for Service" option. However, I am now trying to cancel (which apparently is done by simply not sending the package), but I need to know if there are any costs from a cancelled request.  iPhone 5s, iOS 8.4  <answer195966> Call 1-800-APL-CARE and give them your case number. If you have a specific repair quote and phone number to call, you could try that as well.  Cost depends on if they have done the repair and/or can reverse what they did in my experience.  <answer195969> In my experience Apple typically doesn't charge for cancelled repairs or returns however you should check your local area by contacting Apple Support.  You can find your local Apple Support number here.  <comment233996> I apologize if I was not clear: I have not sent the phone in, and was wondering whether there were any charges from getting the box itself that one is supposed to send the phone in. <comment234000> Also, why did you delete my other question? It was related. <comment234001> I edited this to have one question per question. Feel free to ask the second question and link here or explain in more detail how they are related. <comment234002> Again - You might be on the hook for the service fee. What did they quote you for the repair? Apple breaks things down quite clearly if you arranged service with them directly. If you don't have a quote, you might not owe anything and they'll either say keep the box or send it back.
