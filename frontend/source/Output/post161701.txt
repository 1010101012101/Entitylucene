How can I force an application to be launched to the 2nd monitor? <body> I'm on OS X 10.10.1 Yosemite.  How can I force a newly launched application to open to a specific monitor?  How can I force a new window that a current application is opening to open in a specific monitor?  Failing sufficient answers to these first two questions--how can I move a borderless window?  hr  I have a two-monitor set up.  Many games that I play, when launched in "Full Screen" mode make the second monitor completely useless.  The particular game in question, when run in Windowed mode, does not have the green full-screen button available in the top left.  However, it does allow me to set a custom resolution and set it in borderless mode.  So I've set the game's resolution to 1920x1060 (my monitor's resolution minus 20 pixel height to account for the menu bar at the top).  If I launch this game with borders, I can move the window wherever I want, but I also have to look at the border around the edge of my screen the entire time, which I'd rather not do.  Plus, for some reason, the game handles edge-scrolling significantly better in borderless (or full screen) versus windowed mode.  With that said, however, I can't seem to figure out how to get the game onto my second monitor.  My first monitor has the dock on the left side, and that's where I want the dock to be.  But the game launches to this first monitor, and the dock sits over top of it.  I don't want to autohide the dock.  I don't want the dock in another position.    I just want the dock on the left side of my left screen, and I want the game to launch on the right screen (or let me move it there) in this borderless window mode.  I'd prefer it launching over there versus me moving it because when it does launch to my left screen, it puts itself in the perfect position--all four edges line up perfectly, and this would be difficult if I were moving it manually with my mouse.  <answer161720> When the app is on the dock do left click on it and it will appear a menu. Select Options → Assign To Desktop on Display 2.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NzCnC.png" alt="enter image description here"  Alternatively, I used Moom, that let me move a window from one monitor to another with a defined shortcut. In my case kbd⌥/kbd+kbd⇥/kbd. But this is a paid software.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pCkEV.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer211240> Not sure if you're problem was solved, but this did the trick for me http://www.macworld.com/article/2990037/operating-systems/solve-mission-control-failing-to-allow-displays-as-spaces.html  <comment189378> I don't have these options for the application in question.  http://i.stack.imgur.com/Y838a.png <comment189384> Do you have this option for other apps? I have it in all apps. <comment189549> I have this for other apps, yes. <comment190642> @nhgrif I remember these options showing up were sometimes dependent on the way the application was launched (i.e. from Spotlight, the Dock or double clicked in the Applications folder). Could you please try different methods and see if that shows the options? <comment190654> @BartArondson This launched through Steam. Any idea how else to launch it exactly? <comment190655> @nhgrif did you apply the answer to steam app? Could you try? <comment190664> I will try in a bit. <comment190976> @jherran Trying to move Steam to the 2nd monitor didn't work.
