How to show all dates (jubilees) from contacts on calendar <body> There is 1 calendar, that shows only birthday dates from contacts on iphone/mac OS. But if 1 contact has several dates (e.g. jubilee, birthday of kids or other important dates) that i want to be shown in calendar on iphone or mac OS.br How can it be done? And can it?br Thanks.  <answer239938> Nope. You can add custom dates in Contacts  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0s4ik.png" alt="enter image description here"  and create repeating events in Calendar,  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/tDMGT.png" alt="enter image description here"  but there's no automatic linkage between the two. The best you'll get is something like BirthdayScanner which scans emall/em dates in Contacts then allows you to add them to your Calendar, but there's no first-party automagic solution.
