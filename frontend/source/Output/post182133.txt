GPS Location and Date Stamps on iPhone Photos <body> Over a year ago, I took photos on my iPhone and sent them to someone via Verizon Wireless. The GPS location and date are stamped on the photos. The person receiving the photos (who is on my Verizon Share Plan and also has an iPhone) now has to prove he was not at the location where the photos were taken. Yet there the photos are on his phone, showing date and place, even though he was not present. Is there a way to prove that the photos were sent to him and he was not present and did not take the photos himself using his own phone?   <comment216697> Do you have the same model phone? If not, the photo's EXIF data may show differences in the spec of the device it was taken on. There are many tools & online resources for examining EXIF data - e.g. http://exifdata.com or http://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/ <comment216699> Since anything (any information) can be modified (if you know how) there is no way to legally confirm that. The only way to "prove" is to find the original message when the photos were send.
