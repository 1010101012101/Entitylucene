Daisy Chain two DP 1.2 Displays to USB-C on a late 2016 MacBook Pro <body> I want to connect two daisy chained Dell U2515H displays to my late 2016 MacBook Pro which only supports USB 3.1 Type-C. The goal is to only have to use one cable to connect my Mac to power, 2 displays, and the displays built-in USB hub. As far as I understand, the Dell display's support all features very well.  I recently bought a DP to USB-C cable to connect one of the displays to my Mac while the two displays are connected to each other via display port.  As a result the two external displays are mirrored, the battery does not get charged and the display's USB ports do not connect. What's happening? Is this an issue with the cable or the Mac?
