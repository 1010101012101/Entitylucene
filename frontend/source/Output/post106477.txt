Numbers floating sheets <body> In Numbers, how can I get the spreadsheet to remain stationary on the page?

Scrolling was never mentioned in the question. If you found my answer incorrect you might have mentioned the other answer which is essentially the same (go to menu  select Arrange  select Lock). I may not understand your point here.
