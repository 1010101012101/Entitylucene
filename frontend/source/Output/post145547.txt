Unable to install Eclipse for all users <body> I would like to set up Eclipse to run for all users of a Mac running OS X 10.9.4 (Mavericks).  I logged in to the administrator account (User) and did the following:  ol liI installed the latest version of the JDK (jdk-7u67-macosx-x64.dmg)./li liI downloaded the tarball of the latest version of Eclipse standard Luna./li liI double-clicked on the tarball (eclipse-standard-luna-R-macosx-cocoa-x86_64.tar.gz) to uncompress/unzip it./li liI dragged the created eclipse folder into Macintosh HD/Applications./li liI double-clicked on the Eclipse Application in the eclipse folder and launched Eclipse./li /ol  The problem occurs when I log out of the administrator account and in to an ordinary user account.  When I double-click on the Eclipse Application, I get this error:     You can't open the application "Eclipse" because it is not supported   on this type of Mac.   I don't think this is the real reason.  I am able to run Eclipse as an ordinary user if, as that user, I uncompress that same tarball and launch its Eclipse application.  Back to the version I installed as User, if I try running codeApplications/eclipse/code from the command line as an ordinary user, I get this error:  precode-bash: ./eclipse: Permission denied /code/pre  Digging through, looking for a permissions problem, I found:  precode-rwxr-x---@ 1 user  staff  34608 Jun 12 01:08 /Applications/eclipse/Eclipse.app/Contents/MacOS/eclipse /code/pre  After chmod'ing this file to 755, I can get Eclipse to run for ordinary users if they double-click on the link code/Applications/eclipse/eclipse/code in the Finder.  This seems like a hack, though, and lacks robustness.  Specifically, I'd like to get the Eclipse Application working so it can appear in the dock.  If I launch via the eclipse link code/Applications/eclipse/eclipse/code and then right-click on the Eclipse icon in the dock and save it, I cannot launch with it later, or I get the same error as above:     You can't open the application "Eclipse" because it is not supported   on this type of Mac.   What is the right fix?  <answer145692> I fixed the problem with:  precodechgrp -R everyone /Applications/eclipse /code/pre  A way to preempt the problem, for anyone doing a new installation, is to do the following before unzipping the tarball:  precodenewgrp everyone /code/pre  <comment215716> I tried this without success.  Any other ideas? <comment215772> @Fyrefly In what way did it not succeed?  What error did you get?  You may need to be superuser to run those commands.
