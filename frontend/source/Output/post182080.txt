iCloud Calendar sync error 400 on OS X 10.10.2 <body> I've been using Calendar with iCloud for a long while without any problems. Now, I have a permanent error displayed in Calendar:     The request for account “iCloud” failed.      The server responded with “400” to operation CalDAVAddSubscriptionCalendarQueueableOperation   I've searched around online and have tried all of the proposed solutions, but none of them seem to fix the problem. What should I try next?  <answer182097> Lets try this to Reset your iCal operations.  Back up calendars and Disable calendars:  Go to:  ~/Library:  /Calendars  /Library/Preferences/com.apple.CalendarAgent  /Library/Preferences/com.apple.iCal.plist  move all to the desktop.  Restart.  <answer233394> I am running Yosemite 10.10.5 to make this happen I had to first Show All Hidden files by:  1) Open Terminal and type the command: defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles YES  2) Hit Return  3) Mouse over the Finder icon, hold option, right click and relaunch finder  4) Open a new Finder window and navigate to: /Users/username/Library/Preferences/  5) Locate the two files: com.apple.iCal.plist, com.apple.CalendarAgent  6) Move them to the desktop and restart  This is different than the instructions above in that the location of the folders you're looking for may or may not be in the same place depending on which specific version of OS X you're running. This is the only place I was able to find the files.  <comment216617> Hard to say without knowing what you've tried so far... <comment216650> 400 is the missing of correct Internet address. Check your settings. <comment217062> That worked perfectly, thank you! <comment283741> how do you back up calendars and how do you disable them ?
