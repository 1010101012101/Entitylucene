How can I disable the eject key on my mac keyboard? <body> I have a Das Keyboard for Mac that includes an eject key just to the right of the backspace key and to the left of the home key. I never need to use it, and it accidentally press it constantly which causes my CD tray to open. It's really annoying.  Is there anyway to disable this key?  If there's a way to keep the key's other functionality that's accessed by holding various modifiers (for example kbdcontrol/kbdkbdshift/kbdkbdeject/kbd to put the display to sleep) that would be great. However if there only method disables the key entirely, I'm okay with that.  Note that I'm using Sierra so using Karabiner is not an option.  <answer286277> While you say "Note that I'm using Sierra so using Karabiner is not an option." you will find that Karabiner Elements, which does run in Sierra, will do what you want.  <comment361150> Unfortunately their GitHub page has the following note: "Karabiner-Elements cannot modify eject key due to the limitation of macOS API."
