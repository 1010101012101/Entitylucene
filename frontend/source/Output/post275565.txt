Can I stop predictive typing from suggesting emojis? <body> I hardly ever use emojis in my messages. Recently, I used one in a text and now predictive typing always recommends emojis for my words.  Is there any way that I can keep predictive typing on, but not have it suggest emojis?  <answer275567> I've found a workaround in this apple discussions thread from 2016:  go to:  Settings  General  Keyboard  Keyboards  Edit  Delete Emoji.  this will remove emojis from your keyboard, and as somebody commented, will also change the predictions.  and a quote from another person, more recent comment from feb '17:     I have discovered a solution however, install GBoard - Googles   keyboard. You can turn of emoji suggestions in settings and it's   significantly quicker. Also the glide function works well.
