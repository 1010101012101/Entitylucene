Not able to get a partition that fills SSD <body> I installed a 512GB SSD in my Macbook Pro. Unfortunately, I cannot seem to get a partition over 256GB. I tried a couple of time to erase it in recovery mode but it does not work.  I just want one big partition.  Does anyone know what is happening?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/eIkez.png" alt="Disk Utility"  precode$ sudo gpt -r show /dev/disk0        start        size  index  contents            0           1         PMBR            1           1         Pri GPT header            2          32         Pri GPT table           34           6           40      409600      1  GPT part - C12A7328-F81F-11D2-BA4B-00A0C93EC93…       409640   511524320    511933960   487011680      2  GPT part - 48465300-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECA…    998945640     1269536      3  GPT part - 48465300-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECA…   1000215176           7   1000215183          32         Sec GPT table   1000215215           1         Sec GPT header /code/pre  <answer222011> Your new 512 GB disk has about 260 GB of unallocated disk space (starting at block 409640 and ending at block 511933959).  The on-board OS X tools don't allow you to move the beginning of a partition (the second partition starting at block 511933960) to smaller block numbers (like 409640).  My advice: create a new partition in the unallocated disk space. Clone the content of your current main volume to the new one. Then remove the current main volume and expand the new main volume. Additionally you should change the wrong type of your Recovery HD (i=3).  strongPreparation:/strong  ul liAttach a backup drive and backup your drive./li liDetach the backup drive/li liRestart to Internet Recovery Mode by pressing kbdalt/kbd kbdcmd/kbd kbdR/kbd at startup. Booting to Recovery Mode is not conducive because the Recovery HD will be removed in one of the steps below. And you can't remove a partition used as a boot volume.    The prerequisites are the latest firmware update installed, either ethernet or WLAN (WPA/WPA2) and a router with DHCP activated.br On a 50 Mbps-line it takes about 4 min (presenting a small animated globe) to boot into a recovery netboot image which usually is loaded from an Apple/Akamai server.  I recommend ethernet because it's more reliable. If you are restricted to WIFI and the boot process fails, just restart your Mac until you succeed booting.  Alternatively you may start from a bootable installer thumb drive (preferably Yosemite or El Capitan) or a thumb drive containing a full system (preferably Yosemite or El Capitan). If you boot to a full system and login as admin you have to prepend codesudo/code to execute special commands like codegpt .../code!/li /ul  strongModify the GUID partition table/strong  Not to get confused with the index number and the relative on-disk position of a partition:  AFAIK the default gpt settings allow 128 partition entries in the partition table. The index strongi/strong of those entries runs from 1 to 128. You may use any free index number to add a new partition. The on-disk position of a partition is independent of the index number. Example: You can add the first partition (block 2-1000) with i=43, the second (block 1001-2000) with i=42 and the last one (block 2001-3000) with i=2. To remove the entry of the second partition you strongmustn't/strong use i=2 (the on-disk position) but i=42!  ul liEnter codediskutil list/code and codegpt -r show /dev/diskX/code (with diskX: the disk identifier of your internal disk (probably disk0)) to get an overview.

Also tried in recovery mode, where I also tried erasing. <comment268930> @benrchn Did you clone the previous drive to the new one? <comment268962> Nice, it worked! Thanks <comment268964> @benrchn Good to hear ;-)! How did you get that much un-allocated disk space? Did you `dd` the old drive to the new one? <comment268965> I have no clue. When I installed my new SSD I started from a clean install, not a copy.
