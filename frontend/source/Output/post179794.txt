How many items are stored in an iPad clipboard? <body> In iPad how many items can be stored in the clipboard?    How does one select from one of the past entries?    Where does it get stored and how to access it?  <answer179796> One item (independent of the type, can be text, can be an image) can be stored at a time in the clipboard and it is not possible to access past entries. The clipboard is stored in memory.  <comment213291> And is it same for images and text? <comment213292> it's the same for everything, clipboard is ephemeral & stores only the last copied item, whatever it may be. It is immediately & completely replaced by the next copy action.
