How to print full presenter notes WITHOUT slides in Keynote <body> I have a 50 slide presentation with extensive notes, and urgently need to print out those notes.  Keynote 6 appears to offer no way to do this.  All print options include slides, and/or do not print the full notes.  Any notes that exceed one page, will simply be truncated from the printout.  Is there any way to copy/paste, export, or print the presenter note text in full, without (or even with at this point!) the slides?  <answer142533> This applescript should do it for you:  precodeglobal presenterNotes tell application "Keynote"     activate     open (choose file)     tell front document         set presenterNotes to presenter notes of every slide as text             set the clipboard to presenterNotes         do shell script "pbpaste &gt; ~/keynote-notes.txt"     end tell         quit application "Keynote" end tell /code/pre  <comment168060> Interesting... I'm long past needing to do this, but the next time I have occasion to do so, I'll give this a shot.  Thanks! <comment168061> All good, yes I thought given some of your other questions you would have already written the script yourself. Just added it for completeness, plus it was fun to write. <comment292078> Works perfectly as of 05/2016! Thanks @Deesbek!
