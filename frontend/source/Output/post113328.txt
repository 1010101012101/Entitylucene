Parental Controls Through Terminal <body> I have it setup so that my son only has 1 hour of computer use per day. He commonly needs extensions, and I think the only solution to do it while I am away is through terminal. Is there a way to extend the remaining time via a terminal command? Please note that I am only looking at answers through terminal not other 3rd party software.  Thanks.  <answer113332> You can change code/Library/Managed\ Preferences/Username/com.apple.familycontrols.timelimits.v2.plist/code under the key codetime-limits/code there are 2 dictionaries you may need to consider :  ul liweekday-allowance/li liweekend-allowance/li /ul  Both have a key "secondsPerDay" you may change.   You may edit the code.plist/code by converting it to XML using codesudo plutil -convert xml1 theFile/code and then edit it with your favourite command line editor.   <answer113345> You can also change the setting with PlistBuddy:  codesudo /usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c 'set time-limits:weekday-allowance:secondsPerDay 10800' /Library/Managed\ Preferences/test/com.apple.familycontrols.timelimits.v2.plist/code  Replace codetest/code with the username.  When I tried using fast user switching to log in on a test account, switching back to my main account, and setting the limit to a few seconds, I wasn't able to log back in on the test account. I don't know if the changes are applied immediately if the account is in use though.  <answer170160> From http://blog.takelap.com/2010/05/how-to-set-mac-os-x-parental-controls.html  If you want a script to "do it all for you"  create a script (file) like "limit.sh"  precode#!/bin/sh  # Force times to a lower value than the usual default.  # 15 minutes TVAL=900 USER=user /usr/bin/dscl . mcxexport /Users/$USER -o /tmp/usertimes$$.exp \     com.apple.familycontrols.timelimits limits-list awk -v TVAL=$TVAL 'BEGIN { flag=0 }                    /timeLimitSeconds/ { flag=1;print;next }                     flag == 1 { $1="&lt;integer&gt;" TVAL "&lt;/integer&gt;"; flag=0}                    {print}' &lt; /tmp/usertimes$$.exp &gt; /tmp/usertimesnew$$.exp /usr/bin/dscl . mcximport /Users/$USER /tmp/usertimesnew$$.exp /bin/rm -f /tmp/usertimes$$.exp /tmp/usertimesnew$$.exp /code/pre  then code$ chmod u+x limit.sh/code  and run it with sudo.  <comment134201> Hmm, appears sometimes the timelimits file is setup with slightly different structure than what's listed here (mine doesn't have a weekday-allowance key, but lists the days separately, so this particular command didn't work).  Converting to xml and editing the file manually worked though. <comment134821> Unfortunately it appears that this file is auto re-generated at login time, so modifications only affect the current session.  Anybody know a workaround out there?
