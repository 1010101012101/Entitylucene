Son is bypassing parental controls <body> I have set weekday time limits &amp; bedtime under parental controls, but my son and his friends have figured out how to bypass them. When he gets a notification that he has x time remaining, I have seen him switch rapidly to mission control and then the notification goes away and never logs him off.  I am running Mavericks.  Does anyone know if they fixed this bug in Yosemite?  I logged an issue with Apple and they never responded.  <comment199597> regardless what you do, you are stuck with a computer genius who will always find a way to trick the system :) -- if you have Apple Airport Extreme you can set additional parietal controls there. http://www.apple.com/lae/airportextreme/features/security.html <comment199649> props to your son! <comment199893> Yosemite is free? Why not upgrade and test it out? <comment201024> I run bootcamp and as far as I can tell, Apple hasn't fixed the issues they are having with upgrades.  https://discussions.apple.com/thread/6602253 <comment265982> I did upgrade to Yosemite and he is still able to thwart parental controls.  He has now figured out how to bypass Windows 8 parental controls as well.
