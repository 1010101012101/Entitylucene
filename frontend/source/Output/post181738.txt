Photos App & faces sync <body> I am using the new Photos App (Yosemite). Everything is synchronised (iCloud) but the faces.  Is this a feature or a bug?  <answer181740> Smart folders — including Faces — on the Mac are (for now) local only. Not only will Faces not sync with iPads or iPhones, they won't sync with other Macs either.  <comment218550> Do you have a source for this information?
