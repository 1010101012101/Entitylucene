Gray exclamation mark in Photos (Sierra) after importing raw pictures from my camera <body> Yesterday I had my first photo session with my new Fujifilm X-T2. Today, I inserted the SD card on my mac, opened Photos (Sierra) and saw all the pictures I took (raw). I proceeded with the import, and all seemed ok.  But even If I can see the thumbnails for all the pictures imported, when I open some of the photos I just get an exclamation mark.  I've tried importing/deleting multiple times, I've tried rotating,unrotating. Nothing. Apparently Photos doesn't like some of the pictures I took :(  Any suggestion?  <answer280081> The problem is your camera is too new! Apple Photos does not yet support RAW files from the  Fujifilm X-T2. Apple should release an update that will add this support, but I could not tell you when that might happen. For the full list of supported camera RAW formats, see this site.  <comment352238> Edit: just released I added the wrong link! Link has been corrected <comment352241> Thanks Noah. That's very dissapointing, but I'll have to wait... <comment352243> @fazineroso if you're looking for a workaround solution, Adobe Camera Raw v9.6.1 (Photoshop and Lightroom) supports X-T2 RAW.
