How to bulk rename in OS X with my requirements <body> Is there a utility that can rename filters in multiple subfolders and then rename the files inside sequentially?  E.g. I select codemy-pictures/code and it'll do its magic and sequentially rename all the files in all the subfolders. For each new subfolder, the numbering resets to 1.  strongold structure/strong  precodemy-pictures (parent folder) -- folder1 ---- in-costa-rica.png ---- swimming-at-beach-costa-rica.png -- panama-folder ---- panama-canal.png ---- with-witch-doctor.png /code/pre  strongdesired/new structure/strong  precodemy-pictures (parent folder) -- folder1 ---- 0001.png ---- 0002.png -- panama-folder ---- 0001.png ---- 0002.png /code/pre  <answer115779> The following lines in Terminal should do the trick  precodefor dir in my-pictures/*; do     if [[ -d "$dir" ]]; then         cd "$dir"         i=0         for file in *; do             echo mv "$file" $(printf "%04d" $i).png             (( i=i+1 ))         done         cd -     fi done /code/pre  I've put in an codeecho/code statement to suppress execution so you can test it first. If the output looks ok, just remove the codeecho/code and rerun.  This assumes that there are no more than 1000 files in each subfolder, none of the files is already renamed and that all of them are PNG pictures.  By default, files are sorted by name. If you want to sort by date, replace the second codefor/code statement with  precodefor file in $(ls -t); do /code/pre  <answer115837> If you can do with selecting the individual sub-folders, there's an app for that. It might not do exactly what you desire but might save a lot of time nevertheless.
