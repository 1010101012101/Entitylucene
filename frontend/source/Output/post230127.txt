Google Chrome: Error 11 after setting Automatic Updates <body> Yo, got the following issue: Google Chrome is running on OS X El Capitan. After I set "Automatic Updates for all Users" to true at the "About" page in Google Chrome and entered my credentials (this process obviously needs root rights) this error message appears now on the "About" page:    precodeUpdate failed (error: 11) /code/pre  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/tWCnc.png" alt="Error Message"  After I googled this error message I visited the following link that describes my problem very well: https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=520135. Sadly none of the approaches works for me (Reinstallation worked neither), so I ask here if anybody has any idea to solve this problem ?  <answer246768> Just found this How To Fix Chrome Update Error 11 On A Mac     ol   liOpen Finder.
