Apple hardware iPhone 4s SIM card <body> Can I set up my new iPhone with the SIM card it came with and then switch back to my old SIM card next week? Will it change my phone number or change anything on my phone at all?  <comment123561> It should not cause any issues. But is there a specific reason why you'd like to switch to your old SIM? Are you getting the new iPhone from a different carrier? You can either comment here or (preferably) edit your question.
