How does ExpressVPN work in OS X? <body> I've just installed ExpressVPN, which connects via an app. While it's connected, there is no extra VPN connection listed in codeSystem Preferences-&gt;Network/code, and the menu bar VPN status does not indicate that it is connected. strongIt is working fine/strong, so my question is purely out of interest:  How does this VPN work, under the hood? How does this app cause all network traffic to go through the VPN connection, when it doesn't set up a system VPN?  <comment344186> Are you seeing it work at all? What tells you it is working? Please edit a little more into the question to avoid having close votes as too broad. <comment344341> @bmike Cheers, hopefully my edit has clarified things.
