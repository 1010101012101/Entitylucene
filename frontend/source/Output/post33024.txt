Print e-mail conversation in Mail.app <body> Does anybody know how (if possible) to print a whole conversation thread in Mail.app?  <answer33191> I have a work around for you that works and is a bit quicker than copying to pages.   What you do is: 1. Highlight the emails that you want to print. Either the whole thread or selecting particular emails by holding the apple key and selecting the mails.   ol liClick the 'forward' button. This compiles all the emails into on big email/li liPrint! and you are done. /li /ol  <answer55067> There's no way to do this, at the moment. I've looked through the whole web.  <answer126058> In Mail.app on OS X 10.9, Mavericks, this is default behavior when only the conversation is selected in the inbox.  <answer199633> There is a way to do this.  Right Click on the Conversation in the Inbox Preview, Select "Forward As Attachment" this  will separate each message, Send to yourself, and you will be able to open each message and print or save.  <answer215916> One way is to select your thread and use the 'Save Asâ€¦' feature. This will generate a RTF file with all thread messages concatenated. The RTF is then easy to convert to print or convert to PDF. I've tested this with OS X 10.11.1.  <comment63172> It doesn't compile them into one big e-mail. :( <comment63196> The whole, really? :-) <comment63209> Ahahah, nearly. ;) <comment135252> How about saving each mail to PDF and then combine (drag & drop) them into one PDF and print? <comment260874> This has probably been introduced recently. Thanks for the suggestion. :)
