Airport Extreme to 3 Sony Airplay speakers <body> I'm was wondering, before purchasing the Airport Extreme , if it was possible to connect my 3 Sony Airplay speakers  to the 3 LAN Ports of the Airport Extreme and airplay simultaneously as multi-room audio from my Iphone ?  <answer254611> Can you connect multiple Sony Speakers?  Yes.  Why wouldn't you be able to?  The AirPort Extreme is just like any other WiFi router in as much it is a router, a switch, and a WAP (Wireless Access Point) like any other wireless router.  The Sony speakers are just like any other WiFi speakers in as much they are clients on a WiFi network.  strongThe real question here is does iOS support streaming to multiple AirPlay speakers simultaneously?/strong  Currently, the answer is NO.  This is a limitation of iOS.  However, there is an App called Airfoil Satellite which gets your around this limitation.
