Uploading app to app-store with same name for another developer id <body> Let me explain clearly,  I have developed an application and created an app in the app-store with an apple developer id. But, not uploaded the binary version.  Now I need to upload the app with another apple id with the same name. I know if I delete the old one I can reuse the name with other id.  I need to know two things about this,  Is there any time gap required for using the name after deleting the old app(can I create immidietely after deleting the old app)?  Is it possible to use the same Bundle identifier that I used for the old one?  <answer111563> Sorry but this can not be done  <answer112099> As the old app's binary version is not uploaded and reviewed, I just renamed that application and then used the name for the new developer id.  Apple accepts the name and the app is now in review.  <comment132152> I've always wondered this myself. Thanks for the information!
