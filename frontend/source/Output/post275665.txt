Connecting VPN/proxy to Mac with a profile preventing vpn setup <body> I have a MacBook Air that was given out by my work to use. It has a profile on it setting some limitations. For example, 'Network', 'Users and Groups' and 'Profiles' are all grayed out in system preferences. As well I get a popup in the top right corner reminding that this computer is being managed.  The plus side is that I am admin on this computer and am able to use 'sudo' in terminal.  In the past and current time, I have been using a proxy setup in my browser (which doesn't get blocked) for all my browsing needs at work.  Now I want to setup a SoftEther VPN on my home PC so I can use that, but most of the time only HTTP and SOCKS are supported, not IPSEC and L2TP.  I am still quite inexperienced with networking, but I see only 2 good solutions:  ol liSetup an HTTP or SOCKS proxy server alongside the SoftEther VPN server I have so that I can connect to my home PC that way, then use a program to route network traffics of selected applications to that proxy (Proxifier for OS X)./li liSomehow bypass VPN restrictions using my sudo access to the computer./li /ol  I cannot remove their profile as my workplace would see and ask questions, especially since this is not my own property, but still want to use VPN services to connect to my home PC from anywhere.  Thank you very much for your time. If is any other information needed to help out, please leave a comment and I will be sure to add whatever is needed.
