How to make mosquitto broker auto-start on Mac OS (without homebrew)? <body> I understand that using homebrew, a plist file will be provided and a user can use launchctl to install that plist file.  But, I am not using homebrew(nor macport). I built mosquitto binaries directly from mosquitto source distribution and I would like to be able to start mosquitto broker automatically (just like other daemons).  <answer276008> The homebrew mosquitto launch agent looks like this:  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt; &lt;!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"&gt; &lt;plist version="1.0"&gt; &lt;dict&gt;   &lt;key&gt;Label&lt;/key&gt;   &lt;string&gt;homebrew.mxcl.mosquitto&lt;/string&gt;   &lt;key&gt;ProgramArguments&lt;/key&gt;   &lt;array&gt;     &lt;string&gt;/usr/local/opt/mosquitto/sbin/mosquitto&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;string&gt;-c&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;string&gt;/usr/local/etc/mosquitto/mosquitto.conf&lt;/string&gt;   &lt;/array&gt;   &lt;key&gt;RunAtLoad&lt;/key&gt;   &lt;true/&gt;   &lt;key&gt;KeepAlive&lt;/key&gt;   &lt;false/&gt;   &lt;key&gt;WorkingDirectory&lt;/key&gt;   &lt;string&gt;/usr/local/var/mosquitto&lt;/string&gt; &lt;/dict&gt; &lt;/plist&gt; /code/pre  Depending on your installation directory of mosquitto modify the two path strings in emProgramArguments/em  and the path of the emWorkingDirectory/em.  Also modify the Label to org.user.mosquitto (to avoid future conflicts with a poss√≠ble homebrew mosquitto install) and then save the file as org.user.mosquitto.plist to ~/Library/LaunchAgents/.  Load the agent with codelaunchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/org.user.mosquitto.plist/code.  hr  Under certain circumstances (the make install options which you didn't specify in your question) it may be necessary to save the plist file to /Library/LaunchAgents (instead of ~/Library/LaunchAgents), modify permissions to root:wheel 644 and start it with:   precodesudo launchctl load /Library/LaunchAgents/org.user.mosquitto.plist /code/pre  hr  Now you can test the installation and ensure the server is running successfully.  Open a new command window and start a listener.  precodemosquitto_sub -t topic/state /code/pre  In another window, send a message to the listener.  precodemosquitto_pub -t topic/state -m "Hello World" /code/pre  <comment347755> thank you.  One thing not mentioned in your answer is to ensure the WorkingDirectory given in the plist file exists.  Another thing is that I used `launchctl list | grep mosquitto` and check the first field (should be a valid pid) to see if the mosquitto broker is successfully launched. <comment347756> @TzunghsingDavidWong Hmm I didn't state it explicitly but implicitly: "Depending on your installation directory of mosquitto modify the two path strings in [...] the path of the WorkingDirectory."  ;-) <comment347757> my bad... overlooked that point.  In my case, I didn't install anything.  I simply recovered mosquitto binaries and shared libraries from a time-machine backup and dropped them into my /usr/local.  And they just work 8-)
