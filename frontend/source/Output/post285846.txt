How can I reconnect my MacBook Pro (2011 10.9.5) to my Airport Extreme in my Timecapsule? <body> strongMy MacBook Pro (2011, 10.9.5) is suddenly unable to connect to my ISP./strong  When I ran the Diagnostics, it could NOT find any Base stations, most importantly, my own.   All of the other hardware pieces connected to my network (iMac, e-HP3830) had no problem connecting with the Base station and therefore none connecting to my ISP.  I used Airport Utility (with an Apple Tech on the 4th call to 1-800-MYAPPLE!).  The error turned out to be my MacBook's sudden inability to find its "Airport Card" and therefore could not make the connection.  Does this mean I have to $ Apple for a new card &amp; replacement?
