How to change timestamp of movie on iPhone? <body> When I recorded a movie with my iPhone, the date was not set correctly. So now the video shows up in the wrong order in the Photos app.  strikeIt seems the video date is inferred from the file created/modified timestamp./strike How do I edit the timestamps of the file stored on my phone?  I figured out how to modify the timestamps of the file on my PC, but I don't know how to put them back on my phone while retaining the edited timestamps.  ul liWindows explorer does not support copying files to the iPhone/li liiFunBox will copy files to the iPhone, but updates the timestamps at the same time/li /ul  strongupdate:/strong  MOV files have EXIF data, too. I used ExifTool to edit the tags like this:  precodeexiftool.exe IMG_2439.MOV \              -"CreateDate"="2016:10:12 20:59:55" \              -"ModifyDate"="2016:10:12 21:02:37" \         -"TrackCreateDate"="2016:10:12 20:59:55" \         -"TrackModifyDate"="2016:10:12 21:02:37" \         -"MediaCreateDate"="2016:10:12 20:59:55" \         -"MediaModifyDate"="2016:10:12 21:02:37" \            -"CreationDate"="2016:10:12 20:59:55-05:00" /code/pre  However, deleting/modifying this file on my phone must have removed it from the Photos app database... I can't see this movie at from my iPhone, now. Only from the file system when connected to a computer.  <answer270172> strongModify the database at code/Photodata/photos.sqlite/code./strong (Camera roll photos are sorted by codezaddeddate/code, so setting this date to codezdatecreated/code will sort them in the expected order.)
