cgpdftraster quit unexpectedly: Report sent to apple; just after installing Sierra ; canon 640 will not print from rear tray <body> Canon 640 will not load &amp; print from rear tray after installing Serria?  <answer258270> From Cannon KB : Canon PIXMA MP640     Please Note: There are currently no macOS 10.12 Sierra printer drivers available for PIXMA products. This issue is being investigated and we hope to have these drivers available soon.   I guess you'll either have to wait, or go back to El Capitan.    It's always wise to check compatibility for mission-critical apps &amp; devices before jumping to a new OS.
