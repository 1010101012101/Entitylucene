Mac OS won't install after multiple attempts <body> I've been trying to set up a new Mac but I keep running into issues when installing the OS. I've tried two different, brand new SSDs (Samsung) with both a USB drive with Sierra and one with Yosemite but nothing has worked. There were no errors. It just goes back to the recovery menu after every installation. I've reset the PRAM and am now attempting to install via the wi-fi. Here are the specs:  MacBook Pro (15-in, Mid 2011), 2.6 Ghz i7, 16GB Ram  It might be important to note this had a 500GB HDD and 8GB RAM before I got two new sticks of 8x2 and the RAM didn't seem to take with that HDD installed (I had a kernel panic situation). I also used Time Machine with the previous hard drive and have tried restoring that way but it just restarts halfway through every time. Any ideas?  <comment358709> Presumably you tested with the new RAM removed again, before deciding to nuke & pave? BTW, 'nothing has worked' doesn't tell us anything about the issue - what you tried, where it failed, what the error was... <comment358711> There were no errors. It just goes back to the recovery menu after every installation. (Added above) <comment358717> I'll test with the new RAM removed after this next recovery attempt.
