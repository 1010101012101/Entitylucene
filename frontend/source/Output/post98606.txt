iMac wakes up without any noticeable reason <body> I have a iMac 27" late 2012, OS X 10.8.4 and last night it woke up from sleep-mode while I was 3 meters away from it. Nobody but me was in the room. The login-Screen was visible. After some seconds the main screen went black again, but the screen of the second monitor (from LG, connected via a thunderbolt-adapter) kept glowing in a dark gray light. So I hit a key on the keyboard, the mac woke up again, and I sent it to sleep by pressing the power-button. Now both screen was black and I went to bed.    I did google that today and I found the command codepmset -g log/code which prints out a hybernate-log, and in this log I found evidence for even more strange wake-up-events. This is a part of this log:  precodeTime stamp                Domain                Message                                                                     Duration    Delay      ==========

night? Why did my iMac wake up?  h2UPDATE/h2  precodesyslog |grep -i "Wake reason"  Aug 10 20:00:00 huberts-imac kernel[0] &lt;Debug&gt;: Wake reason: EC.SleepTimer (SleepTimer) Aug 10 22:50:31 huberts-imac kernel[0] &lt;Debug&gt;: Wake reason: EC.SleepTimer (SleepTimer) Aug 11 00:01:34 huberts-imac kernel[0] &lt;Debug&gt;: Wake reason: EC.SleepTimer (SleepTimer) Aug 11 02:51:55 huberts-imac kernel[0] &lt;Debug&gt;: Wake reason: EC.SleepTimer (SleepTimer) Aug 11 04:07:31 huberts-imac kernel[0] &lt;Debug&gt;: Wake reason: EC.SleepTimer (SleepTimer) Aug 11 05:35:46 huberts-imac kernel[0] &lt;Debug&gt;: Wake reason: EHC1 Aug 11 07:15:55 huberts-imac kernel[0] &lt;Debug&gt;: Wake reason: EC.SleepTimer (SleepTimer) Aug 11 09:15:54 huberts-imac kernel[0] &lt;Debug&gt;: Wake reason: EHC1 Aug 11 11:14:09 huberts-imac kernel[0] &lt;Debug&gt;: Wake reason: EC.SleepTimer (SleepTimer) Aug 11 12:40:27 huberts-imac kernel[0] &lt;Debug&gt;: Wake reason: EHC1 Aug 11 13:11:04 huberts-imac kernel[0] &lt;Debug&gt;: Wake reason: EHC1 Aug 11 15:08:25 huberts-imac kernel[0] &lt;Debug&gt;: Wake reason: EC.SleepTimer (SleepTimer) Aug 11 17:23:56 huberts-imac kernel[0] &lt;Debug&gt;: Wake reason: EHC1 /code/pre  codeEHC1/code corresponds with the times when I did wake up the machine.br codeEC.SleepTimer/code are wake-ups that happened without my interaction.br What are codeEHC1/code and codeEC.SleepTimer/code?  <answer98608> Check your log messages by typing following in Terminal while looking for the time stamp for when it occurred.  precodesyslog |grep -i "Wake reason" /code/pre  which will give you a comprehensive report only for wake up reasons.  UPDATE:  Looking at your log now, it all looks normal.   Be aware that the only time your computer can do some housekeeping is during the sleep time. That is intended by design.   However, to prevent strongunwanted/strong wake ups disable the wake for wifi network access.  <answer98615> If you have web-pages open (or applications that are communicating with a server on the web), they will try to codeping/code your computer occasionally to check it is still alive. The computer will come out of sleep when this happens (although the screen should stay off).  <comment115804> I added the output of your command to my posting <comment247097> A web server ping a client computer? This doesn't make sense.
