Macbook pro mouse unable to select links. Gives out pop up menus instead <body> I have a recent problem with my Mac mouse as well. More often it stops clicking/selecting links. When I click links on the internet, it seems to be inactive and instead of taking me where I want to go, it gives out different pop-up menus instead of letting me go in the menu and attach a photo img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QD6LI.png" alt="enter image description here" or click to be taken to another website img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/B7cBx.png" alt="enter image description here". After trying for quite a few times, it just changes back to active again by itself. Please see screenshots attached. I have 2 mice and it happens with both. Anyone else had this problem? Is there a solution? Thank you in advance.  <comment372537> If it does it on more than one mouse, best guess is your Ctrl key is stuck. <comment372541> Thank you for your reply. I really appreciate. I just checked Ctrl, it doesn't look like it is stuck. Also like at the moment everything is fine and then it just gets stuck and after I click around for like 6 or 7 times, it lets me click the link or whatever I am doing. It happens quite a few times a day every day. It is quite disturbing though when I have to work and do some research and don't have few minutes to wait for it go back to normal, that's why I am trying to find the solution.
