High Sierra Public Beta - Cannot Connect to the App Store for Updates <body> I just installed the MacOS High Sierra Public Beta on my mid-2012 MBP. In the App Store, I can scroll and click through all the pages in Featured, Top Charts, Categories, and Purchased with no problems, as usual. However, despite having notice of 6 updates available, whenever I click Updates, it immediately displays the "Cannot Connect to the App Store" window. Is there something I'm doing/not doing that's causing this and how may I fix? Thanks.  <comment370704> Have you tried signing out and back in, then try updating? <comment370709> Yep, restarted, signed out/signed back in, rinse, repeat. Any further suggestions? <comment370710> Sorry, no... maybe it has to do with the fact it's beta software... there's always bugs with beta software. <comment370716> Yeah, I submitted the issue via the Feedback Assistant, too. Will submit an answer if I get anything back.
