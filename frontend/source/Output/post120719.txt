Why CMD+N opened new popup Terminal window doesn't follow the default preference? <body> I love Mac terminal in Dark and had set up the default color scheme to a dark one. Every time I open the terminal it's OK but I found that if I open one terminal window and then open another one via kbdCMD/kbd+kbdN/kbd the new one still remains in the original white one.  How can I make sure every Terminal window I opened all in the default preferences?  I am using OS X 10.9.1.  <answer120721> If I understand the question correctly, this is an easily doable through normal terminal preferences. Go to terminalpreferencesstartup  Here you can set the default behavior regarding window color scheme, including what color scheme new windows use.  <answer127348> I ran into this same thing recently although I'm on OSX 10.6.8. To fix on my version, I did the following:  ol liTerminal  Preferences  Settings/li liSelect the desired style from the list on the left/li liClick the Default button below that list/li /ol  <comment149239> Correct answer!
