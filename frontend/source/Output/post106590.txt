Error while creating OS X Mavericks bootable USB <body> I am running on codeOS X Mavericks GM/code and now that codeMavericks/code has finally released, I downloaded it from App Store. I wanted to make a bootable USB of it so I followed This Tutorial but when I tried to run the command for copying the files from code.app/code to codeUSB/code I got the following error  precodeAnkurs-MacBook-Pro:~ Ankur$ sudo /Applications/Install\ OS\ X\ Mavericks.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/Untitled --applicationpath /Applications/Install\ OS\ X\ Mavericks.app -nointeraction Password: sudo: /Applications/Install OS X Mavericks.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia: command not found Ankurs-MacBook-Pro:~ Ankur$ /code/pre  What can I do to resolve this issue?  strongEDIT/strong Using DiskMaker X I got the same error  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yiDjx.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer106717> strongSolved it/strong  I copied the same codeInstall OS X Mavericks.app/code in a different Mac that was running on codeMountain Lion 10.8.5/code and tried DiskMaker X and it worked. I'm not sure but maybe the reason was that codeOS X Mavericks GM Build/code doesn't support the command that was used or maybe there's a different way to copy things on codeOS X Mavericks/code using terminal.  strongUpdate/strong  I tried making another bootable USB using my Mac (OS X 10.8.5) with the same codeInstall OS X Mavericks.app/code but failed to do so, it seems that you can only make a bootable USB on the same system that you've downloaded codeMavericks/code on. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Y7uCv.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer121687> Had the same problem. Thought the file "createinstallmedia" was missing, but that wasn't the case. Then I realised I simply needed to make it executable with the following command:  precodesudo chmod +x /Applications/Install\ OS\ X\ Mavericks.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia /code/pre  This will create the executable that DiskMaker X initially couldn't find.  After running the command above you shouldn't have the error anymore.  Hope that helps :)  <comment125145> well, did you assured that the file is existent? If you open the finder you can open the package with a right click and then "show folder contents" <comment125146> I already checked it, it's there. I can see `createinstallmedia` <comment125148> Not sure if this will fix your problem, but you also have the wrong syntax. At the end of your command, it must be a double dash, so `--nointeraction` <comment125151> tried it, didn't help, tho I am able to make bootable disk of `Mountain Lion` with `DiskMaker X` <comment125186> I would recommend re-downloading the Mountain Lion installer just to make sure your copy isn't somehow corrupted.  I used the same command you have and it worked perfectly for me. <comment125321> Interesting. I got a different error from 10.6 ( http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/106172/create-bootable-drive-from-command-line ) <comment312251> I didn't immediately notice that `createinstallmedia` is an executable within the newly-downloaded `Install Mavericks.app`, as opposed to somewhere already in the system path. <comment321891> this worked for me too! thanks :D
