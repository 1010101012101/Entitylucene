What file systems can work with OS X File Tags? (HFS+, ExFAT, NTFS, etc.) <body> What file systems can work with OS X File Tags? (HFS+, ExFAT, NTFS, etc.)  I have an NTFS data drive in a Windows machine that I might move to an external hard drive enclosure, if I can use Tags with the NTFS drive from my new Mac.  (it's a Seagate drive, so I'd use their free OS X NTFS driver)  If NTFS will not work with OS X File Tags, what other file systems will work with it?  Assuming that File Tags work with some file system that a Windows machine could read (including using third-party drivers), what would happen if I had tagged a file or directory, then disconnected the drive from my Mac, then attached it to my PC, then moved or modified the tagged file or directory, then disconnected the drive from my PC and connected it to my Mac?  Would the tag still be associated with the file?  <comment209568> So basically your goal is to find a file system which will allow you to share tags between OS X and Windows? <comment209569> Wish you luck - I've been trying to find one for **years** Tags show over SMB on NTFS [remote drives], but I can't see them on the actual Win machine <comment209613> I wasn't expecting tags to be usable from Windows, thought it would be nice if they were.  I just wanted to ensure that I could use tags on OS X on any file system, and from OS X without Windows messing them up.  I've done some more research.  It looks like tags are store in the .DS_Store folder, so any file system should work.  I imagine that if Windows changed a file's contents but not its path, then the tag would still be associated in OS X, but if the file's path were changed, then the tag would no longer be associated with the file.
