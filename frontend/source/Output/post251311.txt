How can I modify Info.plist under EI Capitan 10.11.4 or Later <body> This problem bothers me since I tried to add a hardware(smartcard device) information to the support list, so that I can use this smartcard device under my macintosh. But I don't have permission to modify this list file(Info.plist) on EI Capitan 10.11.4 or 10.11.5. Before 10.11.4, there is no this permission thing, I can't see why apple doing this.  Anyone knows how to modify the Info.plist(directory: "/usr/libexec/SmartCardServices/drivers/ifd-ccid.bundle/Contents/")?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/UZYYE.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/v3vSH.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer251329> The culprit (as suggested by klanomath) is likely System Integrity Protection, that protects (except others) also the /usr directory. To switch it off  ol liSwitch off your Mac/li liBoot into recovery (when you press power button, you should be already holding kbdcmd/kbdkbdR/kbd keys, hold them as long as the display is clear white)/li liIn the recovery system, go in the menubar to Utilities  Terminal /li liTerminal window will pop-up. Enter:   codecsrutil disable/code/li liConfirm with enter/li liClose Terminal, restart the computer through Apple logo in top left corner/li /ol  From here on, the SIP is disabled and you can edit your file. It should be noted, that after you are done with your modifications, you should definitely re-enable the SIP. The method is same as above, the only difference is that you will type into Terminal:  precodecsrutil enable  /code/pre  <comment312327> What's wrong about following the error message? Depending on your SIP status you may have to disable it addtionally! <comment312773> Thank you so much for the answer, it's exactly what I needed. And your English is far more better than mine. BTW, your account name here is cute :p. <comment312774> @klanomath You see, I am new in Macintosh and I didn't know there is a System Integrity Protection. Anyway, now I know and the answer GoodDog gave is perfect. Thank you. <comment312776> ... you are too kind :)
