How set up a local domain such as local.test? <body> I'm web-developer and I need local domains. Before 10.7.2 update, I'm just fix /etc/hosts as I need, but new update crash this solution. How fix this new "feature"?   <answer27541> This answer on the question Lion “hosts” File Bug is relevant here as well.  All additional entries to the HOSTS file must be above the:  precodefe80::1%lo0 /code/pre  Make sure there is at least one line break after the last entry. Like so:  precode127.0.0.1 LLL.localhost 127.0.0.1 LLL.localhost # /code/pre  Although you probably can't tell, there is another line following the # symbol. One more thing to mention, using kbdSpace/kbd instead of kbdTab/kbd between 127.0.0.1 and localhost might help too.  <comment31610> possible duplicate of [Lion "hosts" File Bug](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/27415/lion-hosts-file-bug)
