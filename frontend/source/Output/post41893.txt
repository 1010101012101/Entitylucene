Ejecting USB-Partitions on boot - works but not entirely <body> I have an USB drive with four partitions. SuperDuper uses these partitions to back up my mac. Since SuperDuper is scheduled, I have the USB drive constantly connected. But quite frankly the noise of the USB drive is driving me nuts. So I eject the partitions every time I boot the mac up. SuperDuper is configured so that it mounts the partition when it is scheduled to back up and unmounts it again.   I am trying to find a way so that I do not have to manually eject the partitions. I have two methods that work. I edited the /etc/fstab file with the UUIDs and prevent the partitions from mounting and I tried the method of making a logon script that calls a "do shell script "diskutil unmount....."". Both methods work. The partitions do not get mounted. BUT the drive motor does not "turn off". I have to go into Disk Utility and eject the unmounted (light-gray) drive again for the USB drives motor to be quiet. It doesn't really matter which one of the four drives I choose to eject again, ejecting one does the trick.  I also noticed that if I automatically eject three of the drives on boot and then manually eject the fourth one that the USB drive powers down. So there seems to be a difference between ejecting via script and right-mouse click "eject".  Does anyone know why this is? Is there a way to eject the partitions so that the USB drive understands this?  Thanks   <answer41901> As Harald suggested the solution is to use "diskutil eject" not unmount.   For anyone else looking at this thread, my login script looks like this:  precodedelay 5 try    do shell script "diskutil eject \"/Volumes/MYPARTITION\"" end try /code/pre  Thanks again!  <comment47529> You are aware that there is also `diskutil eject …`, right? <comment47535> That did the trick! Thanks! <comment164080> I wonder whether `diskutil unmountDisk device` would also have the required effect in this case – unmounting all volumes without ejecting …
