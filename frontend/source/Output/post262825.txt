Mac Mini Changing Static Routing <body> I am a beginner on this. When I perform a netstat -nr.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/B8KzS.png" alt="enter image description here"  I need to change   precodedefault    192.168.1.254 default    link#4 /code/pre  to   precodedefault    link#4 default    192.168.1.254 /code/pre  What command to swap this sequence?  <answer262931> Why don't you go to System Preferences - Network to change it manually, with GUI.  <answer263045> The first thing to try with multiple en0 / en1 / en2 on a Mac OS would be to explicitly set the service order in the network preferences.  ul lihttps://support.apple.com/kb/PH25445/li /ul     You canâ€™t change the order of virtual private network (VPN)   connections because they already take priority over non-VPN   connections.      ol   liChoose Apple menu  System Preferences, then click Network./li   liClick the Action pop-up menu , then choose Set Service Order./li   liDrag services into the order you want./li   liClick OK, then click Apply to make the new settings active./li   /ol   <comment329396> The order of those two entries makes no difference. It basically maps the hardware interface to the IP address for that interface. Could you unravel your question one step back -  what are you trying to get done or what is failing? <comment329460> link#4 is actually goes to another subnet IP. When I do a ping, it fails to reply only until I remove the first default network hardware. My other Mac mini I don't know why link#4 is the first default and is working well. <comment329461> I can change the ordering from the UI? <comment329464> Aah - I missed that. Changing the service order in network prefs would be my first thought. <comment329508> Hey yeah! Problem solved using your method!
