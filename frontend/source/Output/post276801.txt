Getting Yosemite instead of El Capitan <body> I purchased a Macbook Air 10.11.2 El Capitan back in February 2016. I didn't install any upgrades because I'm satisfied with El Capitan.   When I started having problems earlier this year (2017), I decided to make a clean reinstall of El Capitan.  The only option left for me was to download it through Internet recovery so I waited until it finished downloading.    After downloading, it came up with the Recovery mode.  I erased the Mac partition and reinstalled OSX.  It appears to be different, instead of having El Capitan it gives me the Yosemite version.  That's unacceptable to me.  I purchased my mac that came with El Capitan but the downloaded version is Yosemite (which I think I was scammed by the store seller).   Is this something normal or something I have to complain about back to the store?  Also, Yosemite is giving me an error upon entering my Apple ID, it says that the item is temporarily unavailable.   What should I do now?  I need help,  and I would appreciate it much.  Thanks!   <answer276806> I think You should make clean install of El Capitan from USB. You were not scammed, don't worry. I was in the same situation. strongIt can be done under one condition - You've updated somewhere in the past to the El Capitan and You can see it in Purchased section in AppStore./strong That's nothing complicated, first make sure that You have downloaded El Capitan from AppStore. Than You should make bootable El Capitan USB and clean-install it on Your Mac.

Apple will re-install the OS free of charge in their stores. <comment348638> Where did you buy the MacBook?
