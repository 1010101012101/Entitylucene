How to repair/synchronize videos in DCIM folder with Photos app <body> ul liI removed a file codelarge.MOV/code from the DCIM/102APPLE folder. This video still appears in the camera roll, but understandably cannot be played.  /li liI also copied coderestore.MOV/code to the DCIM/102APPLE folder (that I had previously deleted) via iFunBox. It doesn't show up in the Photos app./li /ul  I think there is a similar problem with image files that are added/deleted outside of Apple software.  How can I remove codelarge.MOV/code and add coderestore.MOV/code to the Photos app? My guess is an internal database used by the Photos app must be rebuilt.  I have tried forcing the Photos app to close, and rebooting my iPhone without success.  I'm guessing How to Fix Your iPhoto Library When Some Photos Aren't Showing might be a solution, but I don't have a Mac.  <comment324986> The folder structure of an iDevice is not a 'user-accessible/modifiable' area. You should **never** play in it as though it were an external hard drive. Any errors resulting from messing in there are unpredictable at best, terminal at worst. <comment324987> Also, your 'link' is not actually a link :/ <comment324988> @Tetsujin: thanks, I fixed the link.
