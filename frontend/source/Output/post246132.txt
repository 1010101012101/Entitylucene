alias can't be opened <body> This is about a MacBook running on 10.10.5 whose disk has recently been repaired (to try to solve the present issue) using Disk Utility. I created an alias as follows:  precode$ cd ~/Desktop $ ls -ld drwx------+ 13 erwann  staff  442 Jul 14 12:41 . $ touch foo.bar $ mkdir baz $ ln -s foo.bar baz    $ ls -l baz total 8 lrwxr-xr-x  1 erwann  staff  7 Jul 15 11:02 foo.bar -&gt; foo.bar /code/pre  Next, I use Finder to 'Show [the] original' associated with the alias created in 'baz'. I get:     The alias “foo.bar” can’t be opened because the original item can’t be found.   Any suggestion to fix this?  <answer246138> The link needs an absolute path.  precodeln -s foo.bar baz /code/pre  will create an alias in codebaz/code pointing to the file codefoo.bar/code. But the file codebaz/foo.bar/code does not exist, hence the error you received.  You want:  precodeln -s ~/Desktop/foo.bar baz /code/pre  which will create an alias in the codebaz/code directory pointing to code~/Desktop/foo.bar/code.  <comment303390> Have you tried to simply right click and select Make Alias? then move it where you want to?
