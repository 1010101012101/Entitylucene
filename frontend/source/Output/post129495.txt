Sharing WIFI stops working when PPPoE connection goes down? <body> I'm temporary sharing my Wimax (PPPoE) connection (connected via Ethernet cable) trough Wifi. It all works fine, until once a day when my internet provider seems to go down for ~5 minutes and OS X (10.9.2) doesn't reconnect. When the internet connection is lost, the WIFI sharing dies as well. Any ideas how to keep the WIFI alive?   (I don't have keyboard and mouse to the mac mini, so currently my only way to connect to the mac mini is via VNC. but when the wifi is down, i have to hard-restart the computer to get the wifi back up.)
