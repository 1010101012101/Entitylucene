How to reset iBooks app in OS X 10.10 <body> How can I reset the iBooks app, I mean completely reset it to the version that was installed and when first opened, where the app would show "Welcome to iBooks" and "Get Started"?  I think I must remove a em.plist/em file or something similar from Library, right?  <answer248966> You can try this , open terminal. in the Terminal.app found in the '/Applications/Utilities/' folder  Type the command and arguments:  /usr/bin/defaults delete ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.iBooks This will wipe the plist file. But may not trash it.  Now when you open iBooks , will be back to the default.  This will work with many Apps.   <comment308661> I do not use iBooks however the only way I could get Welcome to iBooks screen back was to delete the "$HOME/Library/Containers/com.apple.iBooksX" folder. Note that in doing this is may remove access to preexisting iBooks content, I don't know for sure since I do not use iBooks.  Proceed at your own risk! (And why I'm posting this as a comment, not an answer.) <comment308797> Thanks, it worked fine. The app crashed once, but it's working fine now. <comment336339> @user3439894 worked, but only once! The next time I turned it on and opened the app it was not the welcome screen! None of the ways worked. I think I should find a better way by myself ;-)
