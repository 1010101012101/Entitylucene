Remove name from macOS Sierra menu bar <body> In previous versions of OS X, you could remove the name from the menu bar. I can no longer find the option for this in the Users &amp; Groups window in System Preferences.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Uw3q5.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Searching Google and even this site hasn't provided any answers, so how do you do it?   <answer272911> Open System Preferences - Users &amp; Groups - click on Home icon (Login Options) - Show Fast User Switching as strongicon/strong  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yjY3z.png" alt="enter image description here" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Vlk5o.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment343031> My name, by default, does not appear on the menu bar in macOS (10.12.3) however I only have one account. Does your system have more then one account (other then Guest) setup? <comment343034> I did a google search and, literally, the first 8 items returned indicate how to do this on Sierra. <comment343038> @fsb good for you, I did a few searches and could not find the answer. Hence I asked here.
