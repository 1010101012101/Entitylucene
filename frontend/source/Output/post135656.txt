Startup Screen Flashes Pink <body> During boot, I see the gray screen with the Apple logo, then the entire screen flashes pink for a couple seconds before boot continues normally.  Is this a problem/symptom of something?  MacBook Pro Retina, 15-inch, Early 2013, Intel HD Graphics 4000  <comment160811> do you have any peripherals plugged in? <comment160813> I see something like this, not pink, but a weird static/snow pattern. I haven't noticed any other symptoms myself though. <comment160946> Thanks for your replies -- no peripherals (other than magic mouse). <comment161388> This is sometimes an indication of HDCP handshake failure for HDMI attached displays.  I haven't seen it on an attached laptop display before though.
