Apple installer issue in terminal where -target keeps saying; error cannot find Volume <body> I am trying to use the Apple Installer commands to install a package and the output is that it was successful, however, the end result is that nothing actually happens meaning the package never gets installed or launched. Could someone please look over the commands and tell me what is wrong or try it themselves to see what could be the issue?  precode#Machines must have cURL installed as a prerequisite to download software from internet or FTP server   #grab files from www.teamviewer.com or custom FTP server curl -O http://download.teamviewer.com/download/TeamViewerHost.dmg  #Mount and Install TeamViewer hdiutil mount /Users/TeamViewer/Downloads/TeamViewerHost.dmg sudo cp -R "/Volumes/TeamViewerHost" /Applications  #Run installer sudo installer -package /Applications/TeamViewerHost/Install\ TeamViewerHost.pkg -target "/Volumes/TeamViewerHost"  #Unmount package cd ~ hdiutil unmount "/Volumes/TeamViewerHost/" /code/pre  Or what else I have tried is this with the same result:  precode#Machines must have cURL installed as a prerequisite to download software from internet or FTP server   #grab files from www.teamviewer.com or custom FTP server curl -O http://download.teamviewer.com/download/TeamViewerHost.dmg  #Mount and Install TeamViewer hdiutil mount /Users/TeamViewer/Downloads/TeamViewerHost.dmg  #Run installer sudo installer -package /Volumes/TeamViewerHost/Install\ TeamViewerHost.pkg -target "/Volumes/TeamViewerHost"  #Unmount package cd ~ hdiutil unmount "/Volumes/TeamViewerHost/" /code/pre  If I change the target to where I want it to be installed to such as:  precodesudo installer -package /Volumes/TeamViewerHost/Install\ TeamViewerHost.pkg -target /Users/User/Applications  /code/pre  I get an error that says Installer: error trying to locate volume.  The need is to install TeamViewer over SSH through terminal, but Installer is not playing nice. Any help would be greatly appreciated.
