Macbook Pro 2012 SSD bootcamp <body> I am about to receive my Macbook Pro 2012, I have a 240gb ssd, and the 500gb drive that the mac came with.  I have also purchased a caddy and a USB enclosure to replace the superdrive.  What steps do I have to follow to put Windows 8 on the ssd and leave mac on the original drive? Will the caddy have to have the SSD Windows drive?  If so does that mean that it will be sata2 and non-ahci?
