Print file from terminal via smb <body> So UI printing fails with no reason as always.  I hope that I can get more details by printing from command line.  Tried  precodesmbutil print //user@host/share file /code/pre  got:  precodesmbutil: unknown command print /code/pre  Do I have to install something?  (I have OS X 10.10)  <answer181977> What you are really looking for is a codesmbclient/code alternative using codesmbutil/code but just like you, I couldn't make it work. So what you can do is to install samba with homebrew  like this:  precodebrew install samba /code/pre  If codebrew link/code complains with:     Error: The `brew link` step did not complete successfullybr   The formula built, but is not symlinked into em/usr/local/embr   Could not symlink emlib/auth/embr   /usr/local/lib is not writable.   you can link smbclient manually:br  precodecd /usr/local/bin sudo ln -sfv ../Cellar/samba/3.6.25/bin/smbclient smbclient sudo chown -R your_user /usr/local/bin/smbclient /code/pre  Now you should be able to print like this:  precodesmbclient "\\\\your.server.com\\YourSharedPrinter" -U "Domain\User" -c "print YouFileToPrint" /code/pre  <comment177012> print is a windows command - look at lpr for Unix printing. Also what app are you printing with - was there anything ion the console. What promter were you printing to <comment177014> @Mark thank you for reply. I need to print to smb share, and I don't know what is the "promter". I set up the printer in CUPS, and now there it says: pending since date "Unable to connect to server". And I have no idea if the problem is in reaching server or authenticating or whatever else. That's why I wanted to try to use command line which usually in verbose mode can give you a log of 2 A4 pages, where you can find something useful. (I was just printing from Preview with standard OS X stuff) <comment177016> I found this for you to try: print [-connection_options] //user@server/share file <comment177017> @Buscar웃, yes, but this is part of `smbutil`, right? That's what I was using and it says that the command is unknown <comment177018> I assume you have the network share option installed/activated ? <comment177019> See also http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/125577/printing-to-a-windows-printer-from-the-command-line-smbclient-c-print?rq=1 - which implies print is not part of Apple's smbutils - Possibly get a version direct from samba? <comment177021> @Mark, `print` is not strictly a windows command; It's also present with the Linux version of smbutils, and it once was included in the OS X version. You are quite correct about `lpr` — this is the command one would use to print from terminal on OS X. <comment339703> Doesn't work at the time of this comment. The `samba` package has been removed from brew's core formulae. I tried installing it using `brew install homebrew/boneyard/samba` but that failed too, with the following error: *Error: samba was moved to homebrew-boneyard because it has unfixable issues. Please do not file any issues about this. Sorry!*.
