How can I remove the explicit label from a song? <body> I bought a song from iTunes that is marked as explicit. However, the song is not actually explicit. When I try to edit the song's info in iTunes Music Library.xml, it simply reverts to the original information upon opening iTunes. Is there any way to remove the explicit label?   bEdit:/b I would emprefer/em to do this without any third party software, but it doesn't matter too much.  <answer35464> h2Remove rating for one song/h2  The app subler allows to edit a song's info manually.

Thanks though. <comment40376> This label is not set by iTunes, it is set by the record company, in this case is Prospect Park.  With in music explicit lyrics are not necessarly fould words or drug refrences, they can be marked due to violence, or a whole album can be marked explicit if the concentration of songs contain these refrences.  Songs are also marked in this way if the tone is not suitable for minors, as this was a seperate sticker for recordes before partenal advisory and explicit lyrics. These record stickers have now all combined to just be a standard explicit lyrics. <comment40379> Having tried tweaking the xml file myself without success, I've found a solution using simple software. I've added it to the answer. <comment40470> Okay, if nothing better is posted, I'll accept.
