Why apps are installed to my iPad and not to my iPhone? <body> Whenever I press "Get" to download an app in iTunes (either on iOS or Windows OS), apps are installed in my iPad and never to my iPhone.   However, after "Get" becomes "Downloaded" and I go to App Store on my iPhone, I see a down-arrow in a middle of a cloud. When I press it, then the app is installed in the phone.  How to fix this ?   <answer224491> Settings  iTunes &amp; App Storebr Enable Automatic downloads for Apps  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kv713.png" alt="enter image description here"  Also make sure that 'Automatically install new apps' is enabled in iTunesbr emwindow in picture artificially shrunk to save space/em  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FLtgg.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment272254> Thanks for your answer. But, in fact, this option is enabled already in my "iTunes & App Stores" settings. <comment272255> added iTunes option too
