Is there a Quick Look plugin for epub? <body> Is there a Quick Look plugin to preview .epub (ebook) files?   <answer40227> Yes, there are several:  ul liePub-quicklook @ github (free)/li lieBookQuickLook (free) (outdated)/li liEPUB QuickLook plugin (free)/li /ul  <answer249427> ePub-quicklook is the only plugin that is being maintained up to 2016.  It comes in two parts:  The codeepub.qlgenerator/code plugin is designed to extract the cover images from EPUB files to use as the file icon, and present a nice overview of the EPUB in QuickLook.  The codeepub.mdimporter/code plugin is designed to extract information from EPUB files (metadata as well as text content) and index it so that Spotlight can search it.  To install, download the either files, or both from github Releases.  Then copy the unzipped codeepub.qlgenerator/code file into code/Library/QuickLook//code (for all users) or code~/Library/QuickLook//code (for the current user only).  And copy the unzipped codeepub.mdimporter/code file into code/Library/Spotlight//code (for all cusers) or code~/Library/Spotlight//code (for the current user only).  <comment260286> A quick note on the differences would have been nice.
