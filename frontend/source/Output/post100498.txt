All text boxes : The opposite of ctrl+v (like in emacs) <body> I like using kbdctrl + v/kbd on mac for jumping with the cursor to the next screen - something like kbdpage down/kbd but the cursor moves too.  Do you know any way to do the opposite - jumping to the previous screen - like kbdpage up/kbd but also with the cursor moving?  I'd love a universal solution - i.e. working in all text boxes.  UPDATE: I've refreshed my mind that there's a key binding in terminals that does exactly what I want and that's kbdmeta + v/kbd but that doesn't work in all Cocoa text boxes as kbdctrl + v/kbd does.  <answer100500> The Emacs command for page up is Meta-v.  Unfortunately, Cocoa only seems to implement the Control-key commands, not commands with Meta.  (Alt is used for special or international characters.  Alt-v gives me a square root key on my keyboard layout.)  <answer100539> ⌥⇞ and ⌥⇟ (option-page up and option-page up) also move the caret, like ⌃V.  You can make ⌥V scroll a page up and move the caret by saving a property list like this as code~/Library/KeyBindings/DefaultKeyBinding.dict/code:  precode{   "~v" = pageUp:; } /code/pre  It is also possible to make the page up and page down keys move the caret:  precode{   "\UF72C" = pageUp:;   "\UF72D" = pageDown:; } /code/pre  The codepageUp:/code and codepageDown:/code methods don't do anything in web views (including Safari) or in Numbers though.  See http://www.hcs.harvard.edu/~jrus/site/cocoa-text.html or http://lri.me/keybindings.html for more information.  You can also use KeyRemap4MacBook to remap ⌥V to ⇞, or ⇞ and ⇟ to ⌥⇞ and ⌥⇟. See this question.  <comment118265> Maybe `ctrl+^` ? <comment118271> You many want to rephrase your question to specify which app to which you are referring. I can infer you are speaking about emacs, but others may not. <comment118272> Meta on OSX is `Esc` by default. `Esc+v` works. <comment118274> `meta+v` works only in terminal for me (`esc+v` or `opt+v`). <comment118275> @Dave Thanks, I edited that, I was thinking of an all-around solution that would work in all Cocoa-based text boxes. In terminal I'd use `meta + v` as suggested in one answer. <comment118276> @mouviciel I tried that, and it doesn't seem to work. Is it supposed to work only in Terminal or in all text boxes? <comment118324> Thanks! I had tried that before but I thought it didn't work in 10.8. I think `⌥ + ⇞` and `⌥ + ⇟` is acceptable. It works for me in Pages. And I was after moving the caret actually. <comment118327> Okay, now `⌥ + V` does scroll the page up, but I had to change layout from U.S. Extended to just U.S.
