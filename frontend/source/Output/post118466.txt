Configure and personalise external keyboard buttons on Mac? <body> Ok, in fact what I am trying to customise and personalise are mouse buttons. As seen from my previous question here, I use SteerMouse to successfully configure the buttons on my Logitech M545 mouse.  However, there are two buttons, the side buttons, that cannot be detected by SteerMouse. After testing, I find that strongthese two buttons, when pressed, actually correspond to keyboard operations/strong. That is why SteerMouse is not able to configure them two.  Therefore, my question is equivalent to configuring two buttons of an external keyboard. How may I do this?  <answer118472> The first step might be to discover what key codes they are putting out. Key Codes will do this for you.  Then you will find that KeyRemap4Macbook will allow you to map those keycodes to something useful.  <comment138233> Thanks! Just tried Key Codes, and find out that one button actually corresponds to a combination, command+d. Can KepRemap4Macbook deal with the combination key case? <comment138235> Also, command+d is sometimes useful, e.g. adding a page into favourite in Safari. So overriding it may not be a good idea, I think.
