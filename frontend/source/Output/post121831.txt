Cannot send iMessages from my iPad mini <body> I cannot send iMessages from my ipad mini. I get a "message send failure" message each time I try. I am sending to other Apple devices, and the function used to work. I've tried powering down my device and I've changed the setting allowing messages, turning it off and then on to reinitiate it.   <comment142077> Could you log out from iCloud and log back in. <comment142095> Log out of what?  If from iCloud, how would I do that? <comment142136> Settings  iCloud  Account . Sign out there <comment205316> Have you checked if you have Internet connection at all? I always revert back to the browser when I have connection problem in other applications. Even if you are behind a firewall or proxy, the browser seems to have the easiest way out to the Internet.
