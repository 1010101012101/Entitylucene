Converting AIFF to MP3 in iTunes on El Capitain <body> In my MacBook, running El Capitan 10.11.6 with iTunes 12.4.3.1. I'm right clicking on the sound file inside iTunes in order to convert it from an AIFF to a MP3 — I do not see either of the options “Create MP3 Version” or “Convert Selection to MP3,” even after restarting iTunes.    How can I convert the file?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/VyALW.png" alt="enter image description here" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Om1VP.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer248665> Hold kbdoption/kbd while selecting the file(s), and then go to codeFile &gt; Convert &gt; Convert/code to MP3. You should see the option there.  <comment308172> Hold option key and File  Convert  Convert to MP3? Anything? <comment308181> @ruddfawcett Yes.
