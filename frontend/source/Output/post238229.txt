El Capitan Terminal command to toggle clock between Analog and Digital? <body> Is there a terminal command that will toggle between the Analog and Digital clock in the menu bar?  Can do it via point-and-click, but would like to incorporate it into a script that prepares my computer for recording screencasts.  <answer238233> Make it analog: codedefaults write com.apple.menuextra.clock IsAnalog 1 &amp;&amp; killall -KILL SystemUIServer/code  Make it digital: codedefaults write com.apple.menuextra.clock IsAnalog 0 &amp;&amp; killall -KILL SystemUIServer/code  <answer238234> Here you go, set it up (codetrue/false/code)  precodedefaults write com.apple.menuextra.clock IsAnalog -bool true /code/pre  Reset SystemUIServer for changes to take effect  precodekillall SystemUIServer /code/pre  <comment292056> remark : the reason I use true/false here is that's the same way how the OS set it via UI. Use `...IsAnalog YES/NO` or `...IsAnalog 1/0` you will still achieve same result :)
