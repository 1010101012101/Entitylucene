Mavericks or El Captain for old MacBook Pro (early'11) <body> In case of performance for multithreaded applications, development (Java) and virtualization (Parallels 11), what's better - upgrading to 10.9 Mavericks or El Captain? (or Yosemite) ?   Now I'm on 10.8.5, MacBook Pro 15", i7-2.0x4, on SSD with 16GB RAM  P.S. upgrading needed as Parallels 11 doesn't support 10.8  <answer228823> Go El Cap. The marginal performance decrease (especially on your machine) is near zero compared to 10.9. You'll get better support, newer features, newer apps, etc.  <comment279063> You'd be better off upgrading to the newest system. You would be getting the newest tools, and would have access to the newest items, making future upgrades a much greater span of time <comment279074> where is the main performance degradation of El Cap then - in OpenGL apps (games, video etc.) ? I was also looking other discusstions about it. <comment279122> @yetanothercoder Huh, I haven't seen any threads about that. Can you link the thread you're referring to? <comment279263> I've seen some concerning fps degradation, ex: http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/16070567139 <comment279277> @yetanothercoder Interesting, I don't know anything about thatâ€“I haven't experienced any degradation personally.
