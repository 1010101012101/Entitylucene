Terminal command to get all of a file's metadata? <body> Is there any way to get emall/em of the metadata associated with a file in Terminal? By "metadata" I mean things metadata and properties that are not stored in nor derived from the file's contents (i.e., checksum, UTD, image resolution, etc.), but rather reside in the filesystem's data about the file (i.e., last time changed, inode, permissions, extended attributes, etc.).  <answer222497> I mean, codels/code can give you a lot of information with the code-l/code flag  precodeuser@example.com:~# ls -l .bashrc total 6980 -rw-r-----. 1 user   user    14499 Jan  6 17:59 .bashrc /code/pre  There is your last touched, owner, group, and permissions; then there is codemd5sum/code for that:  precodeuser@example.com:~# md5sum .bashrc 2aa4f74675fa647d23d3dbbe31e9c4d1  .bash_history /code/pre  <comment269636> adding a `-i` flag to the ls invocation will print inode information as well <comment269707> Check out the 'stat' command, and 'mdls' for spotlight metadata. 'ls' also has '-e' and '-@' options that give more info when used with the '-l' option.
