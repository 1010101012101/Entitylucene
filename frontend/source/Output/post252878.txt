Want to automatically change font size in Chrome & Finder upon resolution change <body> Every day I go between working in clamshell mode on a 40" display at a high resolution (e.g., 3840x2160), then working on the laptop display at low resolution (e.g., 1440x900).  Undocking the laptop triggers the resolution change automatically.  However at 4K I need to increase the zoom in Chrome and the font size in Finder so text is easier to read.  Is there any way to do this automatically? I can probably write Applescripts to do the changes, but how would I trigger them whenever I switch displays/resolutions?  <comment314650> I have a similar scenario and just use an AppleScript app on the Dock and click it when switching between the two environments. Now I haven't used [EventScripts](http://mousedown.net/mouseware/EventScripts.html) however the `Screen configuration changed` event in this app seems promising to have your script run automatically upon resolution change. That said, I couldn't find detailed info on that event and why I'm posting this as comment. You may have to contact the author to find out for sure this would work for what you want. Although for only $3.99 USD, it's almost worth just checking out.
