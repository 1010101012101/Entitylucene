read creation date from file name and change - batch <body> I have files that are named like "clip-2014-01-31 18;50;15.mp4", i.e. "clip-YYYY-MM-DD hh;mm;ss.mp4".  How can I set the creation date and time according to how it is specified  in the file name for all 2000 files I have in a folder. I know the command codetouch -t/code changes the creation date, but I do not know how to extract the date/time information from the file name and put this into a command so this is done automatically for all files.  <answer142555> You're lucky because the numbers in your file names are in just the order codetouch -t/code needs.  This command in the terminal will work. You just need to make sure your working directory is set to the folder you want to do:  precodefor f in *; do     t=$(echo $f | sed -E 's/([A-z]*-)|([ ,;])|(\..*)//g' | sed -E 's/(.*)(..)/\1.\2/')     touch -t $t "$f" done /code/pre  To break it down:  codefor f in */code sets the variable codef/code to the name of each file in the directory, in turn.  codedo/code puts everything until the codedone/code into the codefor/code loop.  codet=$(â€¦)/code sets the variable codet/code to the output of the commands in the parentheses.  The first codesed/code command matches any letters before a code-/code symbol, the code-/code code;/code and the codespace/code symbols, and the file extension, and deletes them.  The second codesed/code command inserts a period between the mm and ss values, as touch requires.  codetouch -t $t $f/code changes the file modification and creation times to the value of codet/code on the file codef/code.  Tested on some dummy files with whatever version of codesed/code ships with Mavericks.  <comment167977> @mcanwo please can you mark this answer as accepted.
