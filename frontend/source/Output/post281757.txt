Script for getting windows from beyond display border <body> I have a problem with my new monitor. Often when I unlock the screen, there are windows that are hanging beyond desktop border. It is quite irritating having to drag them back to the window centre manually.  Luckily, I've found a script that can do it for me: https://github.com/bradchoate/gather-windows/blob/master/Gather%20Windows.applescript  Unfortunately, it only works from the script editor window. When I try to run it by clicking on its name in the script menu bar it does nothing. I tried saving it as an application and running it, to the same effect.  Anyone can help me with that?  <answer281766> I went to the strongURL/strong in your question, click the strongRaw/strong button, copied the emcode/em and pasted it into strongScript Editor/strong, where I saved it as an emapplication/em named: strongGather Off-Screen Windows.app/strong  I then went into strongSystem Preferences/strong  strongSecurity &amp; Privacy/strong  strongAccessibility/strong, as show in the image below, and added the strongGather Off-Screen Windows.app/strong.  I moved some windows off-screen, then ran the strongGather Off-Screen Windows.app/strong, and it completed without error and moved the off-screen windows fully onto the screen.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/07lKm.png" alt="Insert Image 1"  Now while I added the strongGather Off-Screen Windows.app/strong to strongSystem Preferences/strong  strongSecurity &amp; Privacy/strong  strongAccessibility/strong after having saved it, had I not done so, I would have expected to see the following emdialog boxes/em when I ran the app, (which sometimes one or both may not appear):  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6dyQL.png" alt="Insert Image 2"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/i9kyO.png" alt="Insert Image 3"  That said, let me say that while I have not studied the emscript/em in depth to have a through understanding of it mechanics, nonetheless, I see what I consider some poor coding in this instance in the beginning and would change the following line of emcode/em from:  precoderepeat with proc in application processes /code/pre  To:  precoderepeat with proc in (application processes whose visible is equal to true) /code/pre  The reason this change makes sense to me is, as an example, at the moment I have 38 application processes running of which only 10 are visible and therefore it's seems senseless to query further the 28 application processes that aren't even visible.  Also note that I even minimized some of the off-screen windows before running the app and when I unminimized them, they were then completely on screen. So the codevisible/code property in this instance is about the process not minimized off-screen windows that while minimized are not visible.  <answer281767> I would use Automator to create a service that runs the Apple Script. And, as a bonus, you could also use System Preferences to assign a keyboard shortcut to the service.  Below are the steps involved for each.   strong1. Create a service using Automator/strong  ol liLaunch Automator (usually found within your Applications folder)/li liGo to File  New/li liSelect Service and click Choose/li liIn the top right hand of the window that appears, ensure that "No input" is selected from the emService receives/em drop-down list/li liEnsure the emIn/em drop-down list is showing "Any application"/li liIn the second column containing the long list, find "Run AppleScript" and double-click on it/li liThis will add the Run AppleScript window on the right/li liNow, strongreplace/strong the (* Your script goes here *) with the script you want /li liSave the service using a meaningful name (e.g. Gather windows)./li liQuit Automator/li /ol  Now I would test the service by moving a couple of windows off screen. You can run the service from emany/em application by going to the Services list within any Application menu (e.g. Finder  Services, Safari  Services, TextEdit  Services, etc) and select the service you just created.  Assuming it works, you can also create a keyboard shortcut to run it.  strong2. Creating your shortcut/strong  ol liGo to System Preferences  Keyboard  Shortcuts/li liSelect Services from the sidebar/li liFind your service (it'll be in the list on the right-hand side)/li liAdd a shortcut by double clicking on the service name/li liNow go to System Preferences  Security &amp; Privacy  Privacy/li liSelect emAccessibility/em in the sidebar/li liClick on the + sign (you may need to unlock the padlock if it's locked)/li liAdd Automator./li liAdd Finder (to find this you will need to navigate to em/System/Library/CoreServices/Finder.app/em)./li liExit your System Preferences./li /ol  Now you should be able to use the keyboard shortcut to run the service.  strongNOTE:/strong I am aware that for emsome/em users keyboard shortcuts do not seem to work even though they've been assigned to a service. This is a whole other topic, but if this happens in your case, at least you can run the service from within any application you're using.  Let me know how you go.  <comment354722> Thank you for the answer and the tips on modifying the script. Would you have any suggestions on how to modify the script to work with multiple monitors? Right now it gathers the window on multiple monitors only when the window is off-screen at a border that is not adjacent to another monitor. <comment354727> @autoencoder, As noted in my answer, "_while I have not studied the script in depth to have a through understanding of it mechanics_", I'll have to study the _code_ a bit to see if I can address the issue with multiple monitors, although I can only test with two monitors. <comment354826> This is a great question. I have this problem too! Thanks for sharing the script you found. <comment354939> That would be great! Let me know if you come up with something. I looked at the script and it gets dimensions for the whole desktop and checks that each window is within those dimensions. It would be nice for the script to iterate between individual monitors with their corresponding windows. Unfortunately, I have zero experience with Apple Script and don't know where to start.
