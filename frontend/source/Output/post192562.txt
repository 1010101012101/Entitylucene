How to prevent AutoOpen feature for apps <body> Several vendors provide their drivers with codeAutoOpen/code feature: image file contains single application SomeApp usually installs drivers or connection manager.  I've discovered how it works: Mac OS X finds codeSomeApp.app/Contents/MacOS/AutoOpen/code executable and runs it. I've tried to create such application from scratch and this method works fine. This is huge security hole like autorun feature on Windows.  How to disable this feature permanently?  <comment229153> I do not have a single auto open? give me a example of such app so I can try it <comment229156> Huawei/ZTE connect manager, for example <comment229162> I have Huawei but it is not Auto starting. <comment229165> Image auto opening can be disabled with `AT` commands. I can share my connection manager if you want. <comment229170> sure go ahead answer your question <comment229174> Link to mega: http://bit.ly/1IsMxUm
