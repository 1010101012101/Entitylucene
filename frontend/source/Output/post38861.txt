Where is the cron log file in MacOSX Lion? <body> I want to troubleshoot a cron job that worked fine until a recent modification, but I can't find the cron log file, where is it?    <answer38865> By default, cron does not log output of executed jobs. It is possible to log the fact that cronjobs have been executed, but that is not the default on OS X either.  In order to investigate cronjob execution output, I suggest modifying your cronjob line to redirect STDOUT and STDERR to logfiles. In your crontab file or after running codecrontab -e/code, however you go about it, add something like the following to your job line:  code0 0 * * * yourcommand &gt;/tmp/stdout.log 2&gt;/tmp/stderr.log/code  Doing this should send STDOUT (normally printed or echo'ed output to STDOUT) to a text file named stdout.log in the /tmp directory, and STDERR to stderr.log in the temp directory. Many utilities use STDERR to print special error messages out when they're application errors, and not errors generated by the program's actual execution. (You can read more about STDERR on Wikipedia.)  <answer38976> Turned out when cron is running the job (as me), code/usr/local/bin/code is not in the codePATH/code.br I found this by trial and error and building the job from scratch from a simple things that I knew would work and gradually added things until I found the problem.    About the other suggestions and answers:br For some reason (at least on my machine, which is running a Lion upgraded from SnowLeopard) codecron/code does not use the parameters specified in the plist files that codelaunchd/code is sopposed to read code/System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.vix.cron.plist/code or maybe cron on Lion does not write anything to stdout or stderr.    By the way I am using http://s3tools.org/s3cmd to codesync/code a folder with an Amazon S3 bucket as a backup (like a primitive DropBox).    <answer103491> Much easier to simply add the following to code/etc/syslog.conf/code :   precodecron.* /var/log/cron.log  /code/pre  Then restart syslog       precodesudo launchctl unload /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.syslogd.plist  sudo launchctl load /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.syslogd.plist  /code/pre  Tested and working on OSX 10.7.4  <answer199258> By default, "logging" is not enabled. But you may get some useful information by running the codemail/code command.  TL;DR on the codemail/code command: press enter to read messages, and then codeq/code and enter to quit.  <comment43999> Is it really a cron job or are you using launchd. Cron has been deprecated on OS X. <comment44000> Did you set a log file for the cron job? <comment44002> it is actually a `cron` job I set it up with `cron -e` and I can see it with `cron -l` and I am sure it worked on Lion and before that on Snow leopard for a long time. <comment44003> and no, I don't manually set a log file for 'cron' itself, although I write to a log file inside the job and it has stopped working recently after I changed something. <comment44005> Thanks, that's exactly what I have been trying to do, it looks like that `cron` for some reason fails to run the job in the first place. if I run the job myself by typing the command in the terminal it runs and outputs to the logfile but if I wait for the `cron` to run it nothing happens, at least no change in the log file, I was thinking maybe a "cron log file" or there was any traces in the consol it could help me find out what is going on, recently I changed my shell from bash to zsh but I don't think that could have affected this either. <comment44006> According to http://erikslab.com/2011/02/04/logging-with-launchd/, you could modify the cron plist (`/System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.vix.cron.plist`) with a Stdout/Stderr path to debug cron itself. I don't recall if `launchctl unload`ing and `launchctl load`ing the plist is sufficient, or since it's a system daemon if you'd have to restart entirely. I'd suggest the latter just to be sure. <comment44127> Ali, Since you have the answer, please post it as an answer and accept it. Do not edit it into the question. You are not only allowed, but encouraged, to answer your own question. <comment279657> I like this idea - but in 10.10.5, my `/etc/syslog.conf` says `# Note that flat file logs are now configured in /etc/asl.conf`.  That file has a different syntax, it's not clear to me how to configure logging in it. <comment288067> Very good, thanks. Mine showed me that there was an unrecognized command with my Cron. Cheers!
