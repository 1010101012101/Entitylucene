iPhone 6 charges on selective cables <body> I have an iPhone 6 which charges on cables selectively. Meaning, I have other devices: iPad Mini and other iPhone 5s, and they all charge fine on any cables, except for my iPhone 6.   I took it for repair and the technician replaced the charging port. The existing charging port had dark marks.   However the problem still exists. I immediately pointed it out to the technician, and he has no clue why this happens. The battery discharges rather quickly.   Any ideas?  <comment369455> What are the 'dark marks'? If the original charging port had been damaged from some electrical malfunction that caused a short and the 'dark marks' are actually burn marks, perhaps the internal circuitry of the iPhone it self has been damaged.
