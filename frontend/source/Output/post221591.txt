Alternative email client that supports tagging, message scheduling <body> I'm looking for an email client that supports my ideal workflow:  ol liemails can be tagged and then searched for via multiple tags./li liemails can be hidden until I can act upon them. /li liKeyboard driven./li /ol  I've found the following:  ul liMailTags - $30. Add-on to Mail.app./li liSparrow and MailBox reportedly supported this workflow, but are now no longer active./li liMailPilot $20, doesn't seem to support tags./li liMailMate $40. No tags./li liAirmail $10. No tags./li liOutlook. Not really interested in buying MS Office./li /ul  What else am I missing out there?  Edit: This is for an IMAP server, not Gmail.  <comment268338> I suspect that tags aren't well supported as they are primarily a Gmail feature, I believe. I like Airmail as it supports Gmail shortcuts and is a nice UI, but it doesn't support tags as you mentioned. Does Postbox support tags? <comment268362> Thanks, I wasn't aware of postbox!
