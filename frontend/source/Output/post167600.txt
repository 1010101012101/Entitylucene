Duplicate a Safari tab along with associated browsing history (OS X) <body> Is there a way to duplicate a Safari (Safari 7 for OS X) tab and carry its browsing history to the duplicate? Like, when I do kbdCmd/kbd-kbdL/kbd, kbdCmd/kbd-kbdEnter/kbd the copy has no history, as if I just pressed kbdCmd/kbd-kbdT/kbd and pasted the URL of an existing tab.  Any suggestions on how to implement such a feature in case none exists will also be highly appreciated.  <answer204581> Not a solution (yet), but fyi you might want to keep an eye on this, if it gets implemented: https://github.com/thiemo/duplicatetabbutton/issues/2  <comment196512> Nope. Chrome behaves as desired though.
