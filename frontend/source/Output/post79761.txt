Editing System Preferences via Terminal <body> Am looking to edit system preferences settings via the command line but cannot for the life of me find the correct names of variables.     In Login Options under Users &amp; Groups, I would like to be able to change the Display login window from list of users to 'name and password'.br   In Date &amp; Time, I would like to know how I change the time to a server we use.   Enable fields in Sharing   Setup Energy Saver settings   It would be great if someone can help me out or point me in the right direction as I know you edit the preferences .plists but its knowing what to add or finding the preferred naming conventions.  Thanks.  <answer79765> First off, you can check out a website that lists a lot of these things: http://secrets.blacktree.com/  I, however, just took a brute-force solution:  Copy the Preferences folder  precode$ cp -r /Library/Preferences before /code/pre  Launch System Preferences. Make a change via the GUI. Probably best to do one change at a time,   e.g. I changed "Display Login Window as:"        from "List of users"        to   "Name and password". Quit System Preferences.  Copy the Preferences folder again:  precode$ cp -r /Library/Preferences after /code/pre  See which files changed:  precode$ diff -ur before after Binary files before/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow.plist and after/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow.plist differ /code/pre  Compare the two versions. Since they are binary files, you'll need to convert them to XML for comparison. I use an alias for this:  precode$ alias plist='plutil -convert xml1 -o /dev/stdout' $ diff -u &lt;(plist before/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow.plist) &lt;(plist after/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow.plist) --- /dev/fd/63  2013-01-23 18:20:29.000000000 +0200 +++ /dev/fd/62  2013-01-23 18:20:29.000000000 +0200 @@ -9,7 +9,7 @@     &lt;key&gt;RetriesUntilHint&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;integer&gt;3&lt;/integer&gt;     &lt;key&gt;SHOWFULLNAME&lt;/key&gt; -   &lt;false/&gt; +   &lt;true/&gt;     &lt;key&gt;lastUser&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;string&gt;loggedIn&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;key&gt;lastUserName&lt;/key&gt; /code/pre  At this point we have located the setting.  Confirm we have it with codedefaults/code:  precode$ defaults read /Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow SHOWFULLNAME 1 $ sudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow SHOWFULLNAME -bool false $ defaults read /Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow SHOWFULLNAME 0 /code/pre  Launch System Preferences and confirm it changed.  <answer79767> codesudo opensnoop -n cfprefsd/code shows what property lists are being accessed. You can also just sort the preference files by modification date: codels -t {~,}/Library/Preferences/{ByHost,}/code.  For preferences in the user domain, you can also run codedefaults read &gt; temp/code, change some preference, and run codediff temp &lt;(defaults read)/code.  <comment166630> Did you manage to configure the login options? <comment330880> on macOS 10.12.1, `opensnoop` just prints error messages; first `dtrace: system integrity protection is on, some features will not be available`, then a list of messages like `dtrace: error on enabled probe ID 5 (ID 167: syscall::open:return): invalid user access in action #11 at DIF offset 2`; the second part seems to work well
