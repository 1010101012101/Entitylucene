How to cancel photo burst <body> Saw an answer but it was 2 years old and thought there might be changes.  Is it possible to disable the "burst" feature on photo's???  Thanks.  <answer239340> No, you can't disable taking photos with burst mode.   In codeSettings/code you can only disable the upload of burst photos to your strongiCloud/strong account but you can't turn off burst mode.  I would recommend going to Apple's Feedback page and providing your feedback that you'd like them to include this as an option.  It's possible Apple will put it on the product roadmap if many people suggest it.  <comment293909> Thank you very much for your prompt and thorough answer. <comment293915> You're welcome.
