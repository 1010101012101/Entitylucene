Contents of gmail "Spam" folder appearing in search results <body> I updated Mail.app that comes with Mountain Lion and it seems to be unable to identify "Spam" folder located in my Gmail account as a spam folder.   Consequently, it treats "Spam" as a regular mail container and shows me junk mails in Spotlight search results, even though the checkbox "Also search in Spam folder" is not checked in Mail.app's Preferences.  Is there any known way to make Mail see that Gmail "Spam" folder is in fact for spam?
