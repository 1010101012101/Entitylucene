Will RAID-0 speed up OS X that is installed on external SD card? <body> I'd like to have some portable OS X installation that I'll be able to use with different machines (MacBook at home, MacMini at work, etc.) I installed Mountain Lion on my 32GB class 10 SD card recently. On disk intensive applications this setup feels a little bit sluggish.  May be it's possible to setup RAID-0 with SD card and machine's internal HDD. Will it work and speed up overall disk IO?   And what will happen if I shutdown and eject SD card from some machine and insert it to another one which internal HDD is still unsyncronized with SD card?  <comment72704> Even if it were technically possible (I believe it's not), since you would be loosing the portability of the SD drive when it's part of a RAID set, why not just install the OS to the internal HD? <comment72708> Totally unrelated to question comment: your avatar looks like Moss from IT Crowd â€” http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Ayoade )
