How to completely disable auto-save and versions in Mac OS X Lion? <body> I hate the automatic saving and versioning in Mac OS X Lion.  Is there a way to completely turn it off?  (This has been asked before here, but the answer and the linked article are completely wrong, so I thought I'd try again.)  <answer34231> I agree, too many assumptions on Apple's side what users need and especially what can be controlled by the user → hint: new full-screen apps on dual-/multi-monitor setups (fail)    For Versions it's quite similar, no control for the user :(  The only thing I found so far is checking the size of the Versions folder code/.DocumentRevisions-V100/code and deleting it if I think it takes up too much space.    strongNote: This is a very bad idea ! It will delete all your previous versions of doucuments/files/strong  precodesudo rm -rf /.DocumentRevisions-V100 /code/pre  You could then prevent the re-creation of that directory by    precodesudo touch /.DocumentRevisions-V100 /code/pre  But that creates a big mess, leaving you unable to re-save documents in Apps featuring "Versions &amp; Autosave"    Not a satisfying solution. I really hope someone finds a way to turn it off or that one of the next OS X updates gives the user more control.  Hackinations: 5 really good Lion tweaks mentions that the switch codeNSDocumentAutosaveOldDocumentDayThreshold/code could be used to tweak autosave but I couldn't find any details about its function.   And it seems the deamon code/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/GenerationalStorage.framework/Versions/A/Support/revisiond/code is responsible for creating the versions - if you rename or move it and restart, "Versions" no longer functions but this is a strongbad idea again/strong as all processes that depend on that deamon run into serious troubles.    Anyone with better ideas ?  <answer37363> I found a way to disable Versions (not Autosave) in a (hopefully) non-destructive reversible way: (re)move the SQLite database that Versions uses  emCareful, this comes with absolutely no warranty and may break your system!/em  codesudo mv /.DocumentRevisions-V100/db-V1 /.DocumentRevisions-V100/db-V1_off; sudo touch /.DocumentRevisions-V100/db-V1; sudo killall revisiond/code  If it worked you'll be notified e.g. in Textedit when you strongclose/strong a document:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/d9sC1.png" alt="enter image description here"  That (probably) means that your document will still be automatically saved in certain intervals, but once you close it (or the program) you can only retrieve the latest version (and Time Machine backups, if available).  The changes can be undone with codesudo rm /.DocumentRevisions-V100/db-V1; sudo mv /.DocumentRevisions-V100/db-V1_off /.DocumentRevisions-V100/db-V1; sudo killall revisiond/code  hr  strongEdit 2012-04-04:/strong  Versions (especially of Autosave) may still end up in code~/Library/Containers/code as nicely described in this answer.  <answer52390> I intentionally was searcing for hidden defaultssup1/sup and fortuitously stumbled across a codedefaults/code setting that disables Auto Save, Versions and Resume, all at once.   If you have a tolerance for potentially breaking things (joke), try the following Terminal command (for Preview in this example):  precodedefaults write -app 'preview' ApplePersistence -bool no /code/pre  Replace codepreview/code with the name of whatever app you wish to perform this on.  Alternatively, you can configure this globally with this command (but beware that this causes slow logins, so not recommended):  precodedefaults write -g ApplePersistence -bool no /code/pre  I can confirm that this works for TextEdit, Preview, Automator and Safari (for disabling Resume), but it should also work for other Apple applications like iWork, Xcode, iPhoto etc. It also works for some, but not all, third party applications. My machine hasn't gone up in flames (joking again) but as long as you have a good backup system, these settings seem stable to change and test.   For TextEdit, you must emadditionally/em run the following command, in order to avoid sandbox errors:  precodedefaults write -app textedit AutosavingDelay -int 0 /code/pre  [This effectively disables the emold-style/em, pre-Lion autosaving completely, so the sandbox won't complain anymore about TextEdit trying to automatically save stuff without your "consent".]  Another option, is a TextEdit fork called "TextEdit+", that thankfully isn't sandboxed (surprisingly, TextEdit is actually open source). It can be downloaded here.  Disabling codeApplePersistence/code also restores Save As in most apps, except in Preview, iWork and maybe some others. In those cases you can use the codeExport…/code menu item instead. This is almost identical to Save As, except that you have to manually open the document after saving it. Just assign Command-Shift-S to codeExport…/code in these applications, and you'll get something very similar to Save As there too.  To restore normal behaviour, run:  precodedefaults delete -app 'preview' ApplePersistence  defaults delete -g ApplePersistence  defaults delete -app textedit AutosavingDelay /code/pre  hr  sup1/sup Thanks to Lri for his excellent one-liner for finding hidden codedefaults/code settings.   <answer180013> There is a much much simpler way to do it that was only introduced in OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion.  According to this post, you just have to enable strongSystem Preferences  General  Ask to keep changes when closing documents/strong.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zXiBZ.png" alt="Disable Auto-Save"  <comment54574> Can you name sources which you have used in your answer? <comment54575> I cooked this up all by myself, inspired by the [Lion review on Ars Technica](http://arstechnica.com/apple/reviews/2011/07/mac-os-x-10-7.ars/14#versioning-internals) <comment59935> This is it. I just tested in Preview, and it works fine for me, without prepending `/Library/Preferences/` and without the sudo, just `defaults write com.apple.Preview ApplePersistence -bool no`. If this will be an official option in Mountain Lion, even better! <comment59992> It does seem to work with some third party applications, or at least WriteRoom and Byword. `defaults write -g ApplePersistence -bool false` also works. <comment60023> I don't recommend setting this globally. TextEdit, for one, will not function properly, and it could have other adverse effects. Also, logging in took longer/seemed to hang for a while, when I tried this. <comment189971> I don't think this works in Yosemite.  If I crop an image in Preview, for example, it will immediately update the version on disk. :-( <comment196434> Any way to disable this in only certain cases? It's annoying to see all these .sb files in my Dropbox folder! <comment213618> Hi Xehaust, while this link may answer the question, it is better to include the essential parts of the answer here and provide the link for reference.  Link-only answers can become invalid if the linked page changes. Please take a look here: [Why and how are some answers deleted?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/help/deleted-answers) <comment213705> When the question was asked by @houbysoft in 2011, concerning OS X Lion (10.7), this "much simpler way to do it" was not available yet in System Preferences. <comment329948> Note that as of macOS 10.12 Sierra disabling ApplePersistence for Preview causes 'Save As…' to disappear completely from the File menu.  This did not occur in El Capitan, and is likely a bug.
