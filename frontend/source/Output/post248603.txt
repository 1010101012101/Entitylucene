Open iTunes U files with VLC on iPhone <body> How can I open iTunes U videos and audio files in an external player, such as VLC?  VLC does not show up in the share area [^] and sharing is only possible for the course title. Clicking, swiping left or right, and holding down the finger (2-stage 3D touch) do not add options to the media link. The file opens in the default media player.  <comment308057> Welcome to Ask Different.
