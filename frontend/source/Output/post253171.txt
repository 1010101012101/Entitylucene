Rename iOS 10 Memories <body> There is a memory I would like to save on my phone, but the name of it is just the name of my home town, which is quite boring. I know by default it looks like all the memory names are just the name of where the photo was taken.  I was wondering strongis there a way to change memory names?/strong  <answer253172> Open the memory and tap on the existing title. The video will start playing. Tap again anywhere on the screen, then tap subsubimg src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/d1XAj.png" width="30"/sub/sub and set the name as the title.
