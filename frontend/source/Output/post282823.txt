Old MS Outlook Express for Mac copy/export/move <body> Have an original Apple iMac OS 8.5 , with MS Outlook Express for Mac 4.01 .  My wife and I would like to copy/export the old email messages(from our courtship) off that system.  What File Extensions were used for email messages then?  What folder(s) should I be looking for?  <answer282842> Your question doesn't specify how you want to be able to view/store them, but I can think of a few options. Unfortunately, MS Outlook Express for Mac 4.01 doesn't offer any emexport/em option, so these are all workarounds.  strongBackup the actual data/strong  Before doing anything else you should backup the actual data. I'm going to assume everything is in its default location, but if not this should be enough for you to locate where the data is.  ol liDouble-click on the emMacintosh HD/em icon on your desktop/li liYou should see an emInternet/em folder - open this folder/li liNow you should see an emInternet Applications/em folder - open this folder/li liYou emshould/em now see the emOutlook Express/em folder - open this folder/li liYou emshould/em now see an emOE Users(s)/em folder - open this folder/li liNow you'll see a emMain User/em folder - open this folder/li liNow you'll see an emInternet Mail/em folder - this is the folder that contains all your email data, including Inbox, Sent Items, etc./li liCopy this folder onto another disk /li /ol  Now that you've got the actual mail data backed up, it's time to look at a number of options.  strongManually drag &amp; copy the emails you want/strong  One option you have is to select all the relevant emails, drag them into a folder on your iMac's desktop, and then transfer them to be read with MS Outlook for Mac. To do this:  ol liCreate a folder on your old iMac's desktop/li liOpen Outlook Express/li liSelect the emails you want to keep (or you could just select all)/li liUse your mouse to drag them all into the folder you created at Step 1/li liOpen the folder to check that you now have emx/em number of files in there (there should be one for each email)/li liNow you need to transfer that folder on to your newer Mac. Probably the easiest way to do this is to copy the folder onto a USB flash drive and then transfer them via the drive onto your newer Mac. However, depending on your setup, you may have other options open to you./li /ol  Once you've copied the folder onto your newer Mac, you can open it using MS Outlook. Depending on the version you have, you may need to drag an individual email onto the Outlook icon on your Dock in order to view it.  strongUsing various apps as a go-between to view emails in Apple Mail/strong  If you're wanting to access these old emails in Apple Mail, one option may be to use others apps as go-betweens to try to get the data into Apple Mail. However, this may be a hit/miss exercise. By way of example, one way this could work is to do as follows:  ol liDownload Outlook Express 5 to install on your old iMac/li liDownload Eudora 5 to install on your old iMac/li liUse Outlook Express 5 to import your emails from Outlook Express 4/li liUse Eudora to import the email from Outlook Express 5/li liTransfer the Eudora data to your newer Mac/li liUse Apple Mail to try and import mail from Eudora/li /ol  The above is not a step-by-step guide, just a broad summary. As you can see though, it requires a lot of importing data into various formats and may or may not get you to your end goal.  strongSave your emails as PDFs/strong  This option is probably a good one in that you can view them on any device and choose to combine them as one PDF, or make a book, etc from them.  Probably the easiest way to do this is to download an old version of Adobe Acrobat to install on your old iMac and use that to save each of the emails as PDFs. You can then transfer the PDFs to your newer device.  Another option is to do this after you've transferred the emails to your newer computer via one of the above methods.  strongSave your emails as Text/strong  This option is another good way to go, because like PDFs you can view them on any device. In fact, you can do this directly from Outlook Express as follows:  ol liCreate a folder on your old iMac's desktop/li liOpen Outlook Express/li liSelect one of the emails you want to keep/li liGo to File  Save As/li liIn the Format drop-down menu, select SimpleText Text Document/li liNavigate to the folder you created at Step 1/li liClick on the kbdSave/kbd button/li liRepeat Steps 3 to 7 for each email you want to keep/li liNow you need to transfer that folder on to your newer Mac (e.g. using a USB flash drive)/li /ol  Once you've done this they will each open in TextEdit (or another similar app if you're using Windows etc). Once there you can print, save as PDF, etc.  <comment356458> I should be able to help you do _something_, but you need to provide more details. You can do this by editing your question (use the _edit_ link below it). I assume for starters that the old iMac still functions okay, along with its USB ports? Also, is your old iMac still able to access the internet? Presumably you're not just wanting to print your emails, so how do you want to be able to view/store them? Are you still using a Mac, or are you now using a PC (or something else)? What email software do you now use? And anything else you can think of that may be relevant/useful?
