How to auto connect to VPN upon login/boot? <body> So far, I've been using the build-in VPN tool of Lion.  I would like to auto connect my VPN whenever I'm connected to the internet.  strongIs it possible to auto connect my VPN whenever I'm connected to the internet with the build in tool?/strong  If auto connect is not possible with the build in tool, can you provide me with an alternative that is free?  <answer32395> strongApple Script/strong provides a good solution:  precodeon idle     tell application "System Events"         tell current location of network preferences             set myConnection to the service "VPN University"             if myConnection is not null then                 if current configuration of myConnection is not connected then                     connect myConnection                 end if             end if         end tell         return 120     end tell end idle /code/pre  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ix8lz.jpg" alt="enter image description here" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1fK2P.jpg" alt="enter image description here" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rXxH0.jpg" alt="enter image description here" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/UFYmO.jpg" alt="enter image description here" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/s16a2.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer290394> Another way to go about this, is by creating a Configuration Profile (using Apple Configurator). Using this tool, recreate your VPN configuration and save the file. After you've created the file, open it up in a text editor and look for the following:  precode&lt;key&gt;VPNType&lt;/key&gt; &lt;value&gt;(...)&lt;/key&gt; /code/pre  Add the following below:  precode&lt;key&gt;OnDemandEnabled&lt;/key&gt; &lt;integer&gt;1&lt;/integer&gt; &lt;key&gt;OnDemandRules&lt;/key&gt; &lt;array&gt;     &lt;dict&gt;         &lt;key&gt;Action&lt;/key&gt;         &lt;string&gt;Connect&lt;/string&gt;         &lt;key&gt;InterfaceTypeMatch&lt;/key&gt;         &lt;string&gt;WiFi&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;/dict&gt;     &lt;dict&gt;         &lt;key&gt;Action&lt;/key&gt;         &lt;string&gt;Connect&lt;/string&gt;         &lt;key&gt;InterfaceTypeMatch&lt;/key&gt;         &lt;string&gt;Cellular&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;/dict&gt; &lt;/array&gt; /code/pre  Now after you've installed this profile, a checkbox "Connect on demand" should be shown in the "Network" system preferences. Now macOS will keep your connection alive. Bonus feature: you can also add specific rules about when the VPN should connect or disconnect, depending on which Wifi network you're connected.  See Configuration Profile Reference on Apple's Developer Site for all on-demand rules. And see also the strongSwan wiki where some examples are shown.  <comment37119> Great! Worked like a charm. I'm using Lion 10.7.2. <comment69073> Isn't there an option for this under "Advanced" in Network Settings? I don't have my Mac with me. <comment69169> Is there a way to do this with Viscocity, the Open VPN client? <comment75884> @christian Good question! I don't know. I've asked their support via [Twitter](http://twitter.com/sparklabs) and have not yet received an answer. But you can try to get a solution in their [forum](http://www.sparklabs.com/forum/). So far, I've been using the amazing [Shimo](http://www.chungwasoft.com/shimo/) VPN client which supports OpenVPN and has this feature build in. However, this does not answer your question :). <comment75908> @christian The latest version of Viscosity has a setting for this. When you select a VPN profile and edit it, there is an option at the bottom to start this VPN service when Viscosity starts. <comment347103> still working perfectly on 10.12.3
