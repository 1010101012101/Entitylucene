How do I shade the region between two curves in Grapher? <body> How do I shade the region (or area) between two curves in Grapher?  I'm looking for a way to do this in a 2D graph. The only example which comes close to this is the "Evaluation and Integration" example, but I can't figure it out.  For example, I would like to shade the region bound by these two curves:  precodey = x^2 - 2 y = 0  /code/pre  I'm assuming it's possible based on this comment.  <answer42070> First select both equations in the sidebar, and then emEquation » Integration…/em in the menu.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HXivo.png" alt="enter image description here"  In the dialog, it has preselected emArea Between Curves/em. Confirm it.  You can change the color in the inspector window.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/D5iBQ.png" alt="enter image description here"  hr  Since your second equation is codey=0/code, you could just select the first one, and integrate it, selecting emArea/em in the dialog. The result should look the same.
