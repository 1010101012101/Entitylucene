OS X can't unmount disk <body> My 1TB LaCie Rugged THB decided it was a good idea to stop working all of a sudden. If I open it in disk util I sometimes see an actual name of a partition, but most likely it's not the real name.  In Terminal I tried:  precodediskutil list /dev/disk0    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *251.0 GB   disk0    1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1    2:                  Apple_HFS Macintosh HD            140.0 GB   disk0s2    3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s3    4:       Microsoft Basic Data BOOTCAMP                110.1 GB   disk0s4 /dev/disk1    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:     FDisk_partition_scheme                        *1.0 TB     disk1    1:                  Apple_HFS                         150.1 GB   disk1s1    2:                 DOS_FAT_32 BAK_WIN                 150.0 GB   disk1s2    3:                  Apple_HFS                         100.0 GB   disk1s3    4:                 DOS_FAT_32                         120.0 GB   disk1s5    5:                 DOS_FAT_32                         480.1 GB   disk1s6 /code/pre  And then to unmount this:  precode$sudo diskutil unmountDisk force disk1 /code/pre  gave this: Forced unmount of disk1 failed: at least one volume could not be unmounted Than for each disk:  precode$sudo diskutil unmount force disk1sn /code/pre  Always: disk1sn was already unmounted  Because I wasn't able to do anything with my external HDD I made a desperate attempt to erase everything on it, including unbackuped files, cause this used to be the backup plan. This was the try:  precode$ sudo diskutil eraseDisk JHFS+ DISK_VOLUME disk1 Started erase on disk1 Unmounting disk Error: -69888: Couldn't unmount disk /code/pre  But it didn't work as well. If you have any idea to get the HDD working or even safe the files, I would be really grateful. brbr Almost forgot about this from Disk Utility:br Disk Utility canâ€™t repair this disk. Back up as many of your files as possible, reformat the disk, and restore your backed-up files.  <answer218815> For me, none of the solutions were working: sudo unmount, sudo unmountDisk, unmountDisk force, etc., with /dev/disk4, /dev/disk4s1, /dev/disk4s2, and so on. All failed. The last thing I tried - eraseDisk - gave me the same error: Error: -69888: Couldn't unmount disk  Then I decided to see if there were any processes in my way, so I ran codesudo lsof|grep disk4/code and found a process working on one of my partitions. I killed the process id and suddenly the disk mounted again! Success!  <answer256232> The same thing happened to me because I was in the same directory as the USB drive.   I went back into my home directory (cd ~) and ran the command again and it worked.   <comment253398> Just to be clear - you don't need any files from this drive, just that you want it to get erased and put back into service? <comment253401> I'd like to have the files, but if there is no other way, I'd be grateful to be even able to use it again. But would mean the loss of many fotos :-/ <comment264545> Well the disk hasn't worked until today. But I kept it, lets see what I can do :) <comment264549> Good luck, hope it works! <comment264830> Although I believe in your answear (also found it in other blogs) my system won't recognize the drive anymore. But thank you anyway :) <comment264981> @PeterSchmucki can you see the disk at all when you run `diskutil`? (I have more experience fixing bad drives on windows, so that would be my next solution: find a windows machine and delve into it there.) <comment265012> Wasn't able to see it `diskutil` last time, however I sometimes see the drive on Windows 7. I have my main disk partitioned, I could boot from Windows. My VM of Linux on the other hand never saw the disk, probably a configurtation issue, don't really sure about it though <comment328642> this worked because I was trying to unmount the disk while I was in the disk (dooh). I just used ``cd ..`` to go up a level which moved me outside of the disk I was trying to unmount. <comment342447> For me, macOS was helpfully trying to fsck the disk. The offending process was 'fsck_hfs' with '/dev/rdisk...' open.
