folder modified before it existed <body> I did a complete reinstall of OS X El Capitan last week-deleted the old Macintosh HD and installed OSX. Upon checking some hidden folders, I noticed that some files have codeDate Modified/code and codeCreated/code property set to dates such as February 12 2016. I find that peculiar, because I installed OSX last week. How come I have folders on my computer that were modified even before they existed? Is this a leftover from Apple's team of engineers, meaning that they created this folder on that date?  <answer237407> The original codeInstall.framework/code used codepax/code to deliver the payload. codepax/code will attempt to preserve file metadata. codepax/code was repackaged into a proprietary binary whose behavior mimics codeditto/code which also preserves creation or birth time. I have files installed on my computer that have modification dates before my computer was manufactured.  <comment290729> Is it possible that you're seeing the default date that a specific folder was updated?  I know I've seen this on Windows where an update will put a created date on the folder as the date of the upgrade or a default starting date. <comment290730> Quite possible indeed. <comment290741> As do I too. +1
