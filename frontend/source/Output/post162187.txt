dnsextd messages in console <body> I'm running OS X 10.10.1 and keep getting thousands of lines like the following in the system console log.  precode12/16/14 2:57:02.937 PM dnsextd[9384]: ConnectToServer - 10 failed attempts.

Has anybody had the same issue? Any ideas on how to fix this? I've tried rebooting, stopping/starting dnsextd from launchctl, but had no luck.  <answer167539> As the man page says "dnsextd is a daemon invoked at boot time, running alongside BIND 9, to implement two EDNS0 extensions to the standard DNS protocol."  My guess is that you are getting these errors because dnsextd is running on your Mac and trying to talk to BIND, but BIND is not running. You can check this by running the following command. If it comes back blank, then BIND is not running.  precodepgrep named /code/pre  I think the solution to this problem is to just turn dnsextd off using the below command. Unless you are running this Mac as a DNS server for other devices then I'm not sure why you'd need either running.  precodesudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.dnsextd.plist /code/pre  <comment189595> `dnsextd` is intended for certain DNS query functions. See `man dnsextd` in Terminal. Have you checked that your DNS entries in your network settings are valid and reachable? <comment189600> Yes, this happens on at least 5 different networks and happens *all* the time. <comment189605> I'm somewhat stumped. It **may** be related to some Bonjour activity that's failing for whatever reason. <comment195328> @Brethil Do you use any DDNS services like DynDNS or is your Mac member of an Active Directory domain? <comment195460> I'm not using any DDNS services. I'm not part of any Active Directory Domain that I know of. How would I go about in checking this? <comment195611> You can find out if your computer is part of an AD domain by using dscl interactively. From Terminal, type `dscl` and at the `` prompt, type `list`. If you see `Active Directory`, your computer is a member <comment195639> Nope: `Entering interactive mode... (type "help" for commands)  list Local   Contact Search` <comment196414> Is this Mac being used as a server? <comment196446> Indeed BIND is not running, pgrep named returns nothing. My Mac isn't really being used as server (apart from file sharing  with AFP and screen sharing with ARD/VNC), but isn't dnsextd part of the default daemons? <comment196472> Nope, it just runs as an addition to BIND. And BIND doesn't run by default either.
