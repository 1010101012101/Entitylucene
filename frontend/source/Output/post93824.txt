Homebrew errors; update fails <body> Homebrew has been working fine for years...until today. Anyone know what's going on and/or how to fix it?  precode$ brew --config HOMEBREW_VERSION: 0.9.4 ORIGIN: https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew.git HEAD: cce7d7a441a7b699d4c1cc6d9726e325d09e0e12 HOMEBREW_PREFIX: /usr/local HOMEBREW_CELLAR: /usr/local/Cellar CPU: quad-core 64-bit ivybridge OS X: 10.8.3-x86_64 Xcode: 4.6.2 CLT: 4.6.0.0.1.1365549073 GCC-4.2: build 5666 LLVM-GCC: build 2336 Clang: 4.2 build 425 X11: N/A System Ruby: 1.8.7-358 Perl: /usr/bin/perl Python: /usr/bin/python Ruby: /Users/meltemi/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.0.0-p195/bin/ruby  $ brew update error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by merge:     Library/Aliases/fishfish     Library/Formula/aamath.rb     Library/Formula/abcmidi.rb     Library/Formula/agedu.rb     ...

Aborting Error: Failure while executing: git pull -q origin refs/heads/master:refs/remotes/origin/master /code/pre  <answer93825> Fixed it with a codegit checkout -- ./code followed by a codegit clean -f/code.  <answer93884> The codebrew doctor/code should be helpful about this, next best thing to try is repairing formulae from taps with codebrew tap --repair/code. If that still does not help, try the following steps:  codebrew untap &lt;X&gt;/code where  is from codebrew tap/code.  codecd $(brew --prefix)/code  codegit clean -fd/code  codegit reset origin/master --force/code  codebrew update/code  codebrew tap &lt;X&gt;/code to have your taps again.  <answer231182> This may help:  precodegit --git-dir $(brew --repository)/.git reset origin/master --hard git --git-dir $(brew --repository)/.git clean -fd /code/pre  Then check again with codebrew doctor/code for any issues.
