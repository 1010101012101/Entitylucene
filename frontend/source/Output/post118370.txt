How can I close apps properly/shutdown the system via ssh? <body> I need to know if there's a proper way to close apps via ssh and if it's posible shut down the system without the codesudo halt/code or codesudo init 0/code (because I think those ways are not good for the system when there are apps running)  <answer118372> To close apps, use  precodeosascript -e "tell application \"Mail"\ to quit" /code/pre  supReplace codeMail/code with the name of the app that you want to quit./sup  To shutdown correctly, use  precodeosascript -e "tell application \"Finder\" to shut down" /code/pre  <answer118380> I have to start by saying that there is nothing wrong with using codehalt/code or codeshutdown/code from the command line.  In fact if you issue either of those commands then any running applications will get exactly the same message from the system as if you chose "Shut Down..." in the Finder.  The advantage of using codesudo shutdown/code is that you can shutdown the system regardless of which users are logged in.  <comment138137> I guess i can have aliases of that in my `.profile`, right? <comment138139> @naoxink Indeed <comment138150> If you are going to use `osascript` in a shell script or the command line then you have to be incredibly careful with quote characters and spaces. The first version of this answer had them all wrong. Also, this method will only work if the user logged on to the Mac and the ssh user are the same **and** there are no other users logged on. <comment138151> If I exec `halt` or `shutdown` the running apps will appear when I log in next time :/ <comment138153> I suppose it will be something like this: `alias myHalt='osascript -e "tell application \'Finder\' to shut down"'`. Am I right? Anyway it seems to be more issues with this method than `halt` option :/
