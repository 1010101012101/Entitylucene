How do I re-add Apple Music app to my watch? <body> I removed the apple music app from my phone, and now that I have the Apple Watch, I want to see if the apple music app is better than the alternatives.  I've installed the app from the app store, and see it correctly on my phone. However, when I look at the watch, the apple music app doesn't appear.  On the iPhone, within the apple watch app, there is the option to install or remove apps from the watch.  Since this is a "system" app, I'm unable to download the Apple Music app onto my watch.   I'm considering a hard-erase of the watch, but that might be excessive, and might not work. What are my other options?
