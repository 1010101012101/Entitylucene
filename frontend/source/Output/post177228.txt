(Easy way of ) Turning gmail events to (google) calendar on Iphone <body> I have default mail , Gmail , calendar and google calendar apps on IPhone. When I get an event (from lets say meetup ), I have to copy paste bits and pieces from mail/Gmail app to Calendar/Google Calendar! What gives? Isn't there an easy way to export a Gmail (event) to IPhone Calendar/Google Calendar app on IPhone?  I have also tried using chrome and Gmail web site to copy/import and event to Google calendar directly but I ended up copying and pasting the event details over again. In 21st century surely there must be an open format for calendar events. ( Or is that only possible in Star Trek universe?)
