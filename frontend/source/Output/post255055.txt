Caching service usable for ISP? <body> We have an ISP with a few thousand users which connect by PPPoE. Each user has his own public IP.  We have central caching DNS servers (Ubuntu Linux 16.04 with BIND version 9.10.3) and users are transparently forwarded to them.  According to the documentation, users stronghave to/strong set a DNS search domain entry to make everything work. If I understand correctly, if the DNS search domain field is empty, then possible clients don't query an advertised Wide-Area DNS-SD service like _aaplcache._tcp. This part is impossible for us because there is no DHCP server.  Other parts of the requirements seems OK and ready right now .  I want to know that is there any trick / workaround to transparently forward Apple updates to our existing macOS Server (macOS Sierra Server 5.2) Caching Service in ISP scale?  Note: Currently we have unofficial implementations like squid but we want to move to official ways for better performance and bandwidth saving.  <comment317614> Yes . We want transparent cache for Mac/IOS downloads .
