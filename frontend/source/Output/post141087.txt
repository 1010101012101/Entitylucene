How to install .dict.dz/.index files to OSX dictionary.app <body> I have a dictionary that consists of a codedictionary.dict.dz/code and codedictionary.index/code files. How can I install this dictionary for use with OSX dictionary app (running Mavericks)?  It works fine with GoldenDict, but I'd prefer to have this dictionary amongst the rest.  DictUnifier, which I have used to install a few other dictionaries, doesn't recognize the file.  <answer245322> It looks like your input files are in the DICTD format. This can be converted to AppleDict XML source and then compiled for use with the OSX built-in dictionary using pyglossary as described at https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/119166/66812.
