add /home to time machine backup list <body> I would like to backup the /home directory on a macbook pro running osx 10.8.5 using time machine, unfortunately this is directory is ignored by default. According to this post:  On OS X, what files are excluded by rule from a Time Machine backup?  the file:  precode/System/Library/CoreServices/backupd.bundle/Contents/Resources/StdExclusions.plist /code/pre  stores the list of built in exclusions where the /home path is under paths that are excluded. Can I delete the line that contains the /home directory in order to add it to the list of directories that time machine will back up? What are some unintended consequences that I might run into by doing this?  <answer197888> You don't need to do this. OS X uses /Users/(username) instead. /home is there for compatibility.  This Apple Support Document describes how Mac OS X handles multiple users.     Your home folder isn’t actually named “Home.” It’s named with your user name. If your Mac has several users set up, each user has a home folder.   <comment236692> So the computer was changed using the solution described here:   http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1362703/how-can-i-use-the-home-directory-on-mac-os-x  so that the home directory could be used. Since files are now stored in /home, I would like to have it automatically backup
