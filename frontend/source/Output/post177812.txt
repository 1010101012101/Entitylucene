How can I restore just a few files to an iPhone from a backup? <body> I have an iPhone backup on my computer and I'd like to restore just a couple of files. (I already know which files I need, even though their names are obfuscated.) The backup is very old so I don't want to just restore the entire thing, which is the only officially-supported action. What tools exist to do this kind of thing? I'm not willing to jailbreak my phone for this.  <comment210532> There is an app called iMazing that will allow you to possibly do what you want. It's $30USD. I've used it to extract some pictures off of an old phone that wouldn't transfer the normal way. Be careful when poking around in the file structure in your phone though.
