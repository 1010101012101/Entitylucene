How can I revert the appearance of the close, minimize and zoom buttons with iTunes 10? <body> The new vertical layout is causing me all sorts of grief - is there any way to revert this back to the normal horizontal orientation of the close, minimize and zoom buttons of every other Mac OS X window?  <answer1042> Do this on Terminal:   precodedefaults write com.apple.iTunes full-window -int -1 /code/pre  <comment855> I would +1 this a million times over if I could. <comment868> Alternatively it's `-boolean YES`.

And will his work on other programs? <comment912> I don't test it, but have you try : defaults write com.apple.iTunes full-window -int -0     ? <comment1015> @Moshe: Yes changing it to -int 0 or -boolean NO will revert it.
