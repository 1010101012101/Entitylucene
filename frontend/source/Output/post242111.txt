CoreDragCreate error - drag&drop and copy-paste stop working <body> From time to time drag&amp;drop and copy-paste stop working. Somehow the clipboard machinery gets messed up (I suspect Microsoft Remote Desktop is causing it). In the console I see the following sequence when I try to drag something:  precode09-06-16 10:13:54,991 Finder[59451]: CFPasteboardRef CFPasteboardCreate(CFAllocatorRef, CFStringRef) : Lock timeout 09-06-16 10:13:54,991 Finder[59451]: CoreDragCreate error: -4960 09-06-16 10:13:54,991 Finder[59451]: error in CoreDragDispose: -1850 /code/pre  The console displays similar lines for every application that I try to drag in.  What is causing this issue and how can it be fixed?  <answer243213> I don't know what is causing the issue, but the codepboard/code process is responsible for copy and paste.  Restarting it might provide a fix (temporarily), and can be less disruptive than logging out.  From this answer:     Check if the pboard daemon is running:      codelaunchctl list | grep com.apple.pboard/code      If the pboard daemon is running, then stop and start it. If it's not running, start it:      codelaunchctl stop com.apple.pboard/code      codelaunchctl start com.apple.pboard/code      Then, you may need to restart the application(s) where cut-and-paste is not working.   <comment298304> When this happens, does a reboot fix it? Your log file references Finder, is it only Finder where copy-paste stops working? or does it stop working in all programs? Is it copy-paste of files specifically that breaks, or is it all kinds of (textual) copy-pastes? <comment298306> Both a reboot and a logout fixes things. Copy-paste (textual - have not tried files) and drag&drop stop working across all programs. <comment299523> Sounds promising! I will verify this if the problem pops up again. <comment300047> Hmm. Looks like I still need to restart each and every application I want to copy into.
