Switch to different app in different desktop instead same desktop <body> I have 2 windows of Chrome opened in Display 1 &amp; 3. Beside that, there is Terminal run in Display 1. Display 2 has some windows from other apps. In this case, I offten switch between Terminal in Display 1 and Chrome in Display 3.  When I open Terminal in Display 1 and do kbdCmd ⌘/kbdkbdTab/kbd window switch to Chrome in Display 1, instead of Display 3. Currently, I have to shift right/left the space twice to switch it.  Is there shortcut key to accomodate this case?  <answer254033> There are many variants on this question...   In short, Spaces is not designed to accommodate any app on strongemmore than one Space/em/strong.  So the simple answer is, "No."  Possible alternative workarounds...  ul liUse kbd Cmd ⌘ /kbd kbd ` /kbd to switch between open windows of the app you just switched to./li liUse dedicated key commands to switch to a specific Space rather than App - by default kbd Ctrl ⌃ /kbd plus kbd [number] /kbd - &amp; remember where each one lives. This is my preferred method, which I've been using since Spaces was invented./li /ul  <comment316227> To activate the second possibility go to System Preferences, Keyboard, Shortcuts, Mission Control and activate the ticks "Switch to Desktop 1" and "Switch to Desktop 2". <comment316231> Sometimes I use "Ctrl"+"Number", but number of space is hard thing to remember for me especially when work with many windows. Edit: Actually when I move Chrome in Display 1 to Display 2, I can easily move between terminal in Display 1 and Chrome in Display 2/3 just with "Cmd ⌘"+"Tab". It just my 2 cents <comment316232> I sort my Spaces in 'patterns' of 'like' apps... eventually you just remember the numbers. Moving a window to a specific Space can be done by holding the title bar, then switching to a Space; the window will move with you - but it cannot be remembered if the app now occupies more than one Space.
