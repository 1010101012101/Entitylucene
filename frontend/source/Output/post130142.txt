Jailbroken lockscreen crash <body> I have the iPod touch 4th generation running jailbroken iOS 6.1.6.  The iPod is working fine except for when I lock it. When I try to wake it back up again, it doesn't come on. If I leave it for like a minute after trying to turn it on, it restarts the whole iPod for some reason.  Any ideas?  <answer130157> Boot into Safe Mode by holding the volume up button on boot. If the problem doesn't occur in Safe Mode, it's a substrate tweak causing the problem. Still in Safe Mode, go to Cydia and uninstall any lock screen related tweaks until the problem is fixed.
