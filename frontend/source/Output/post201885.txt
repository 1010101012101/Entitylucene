Set time range for iTunes Recently Added <body> Currently iTunes' Recently Added section only extends back around three months (I think) and I'd like it go back further than that, like 1 or 2 years, say.  Does anyone know how to change this?  <answer201888> Right click the playlist &amp; Edit - it's a Smart Playlist, so you can set any parameters you like, including how far back in time it should look...  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/CXPJN.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment243438> Thanks for the response, but I'm talking about the Recently Added in My Music, not the Recently Added playlist.
