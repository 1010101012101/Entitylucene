How can I display the date on actual photos taken with iPhone? <body> I need some photos that I have taken to be dated. The date must be displayed on the actual photo (in a similar fashion to how one would think of film photos), but I have no idea how to do this? My understanding is there is an app that does this, but I haven't been able to find it.  Is there an app, or any other way, that would facilitate this?  <answer93022> DateCam S is a free app that will add the date to photos that you take automatically.     This app simply adds date on your photos.      So now, you can see when the photos were taken!   There are also apps that let you manually add any text (e.g. a date) to your photos. I have used and recommend Camera+ due to its stylistic formatting of the text.  <answer129139> Photo Timestamps is a third party app that provides this information. It's not free, but it's also not $4.99. It's got a really clean, minimal interface (obligatory disclosure: I made it).  <comment109134> Do you desire to have this done with the push of a button, or would you not mind manually typing the date? <comment109135> I wouldnt mind manually typing the date I just need it to appear on the photo so I can send this on/print it
