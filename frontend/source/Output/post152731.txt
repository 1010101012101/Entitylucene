My headphone jack and speakers sopped working <body> My headphone jack and my speakers are not working at all. They just randomly stopped when my macbook air was closed. Is there any system preferences that i need to change?  <answer152750> The solution is from here and it worked with me:     There seems to be a bug whereby if the headphones are plugged in when the MBP is put to sleep and are not present when it is rewakened, the headphones stop being recognized. The solution is to:      ol   liUnplug the headphones/li   liPut the MBP back to sleep (close the lid; without an external display hooked up)/li   liPlug the headphones back in/li   liWake the MBP by opening the lid./li   /ol      This should fix the problem.   <comment179820> What are your current audio settings in System Preferences  Sound?
