Reinstalling XCode <body> I just upgraded to Lion, and was having problems with my old XCode installation, so I just removed it completely by running   precodesudo /Developer/Library/uninstall-devtools sudo rm -rf /Developer /code/pre  Now having removed the developer tools, I would like to reinstall them. But as soon as I go to the App Store, XCode is still marked as installed. How can I make the App Store realize that XCode has been uninstalled?  <answer21806> The App Store actually recognizes the Install Xcode.app file in the Applications folder.  So, in order to reinstall, just run Install Xcode again from the Applications folder.  But, if you wish to redownload from the App Store, just delete the application from the Applications folder, empty your trash, and relaunch the App Store if it's open.  <answer246722> try this in terminal:  precodexcode-select --install /code/pre  it brings up and downloads developer tools for you  <comment367728> I changed my directory to Applications. Then I ran `install Xcode`. Here's what I got: `usage: install [-bCcpSsv] [-B suffix] [-f flags] [-g group] [-m mode]                [-o owner] file1 file2        install [-bCcpSsv] [-B suffix] [-f flags] [-g group] [-m mode]                [-o owner] file1 ... fileN directory        install -d [-v] [-g group] [-m mode] [-o owner] directory ... ` Is there anything else I should be doing? <comment367790> @Honey Apple has actually changed how they handle the Xcode install since this original answer. Now, you can just delete Xcode from your Applications folder and download again from the App Store.
