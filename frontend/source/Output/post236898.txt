getting an error -25299 attempting to create account and password for proxy <body> I changed the proxy settings with the following code:  precodesudo networksetup -setwebproxy Wi-Fi IP_ADDRESS PORT on USERNAME PASSWORD /code/pre  It does indeed changes settings, but throws an error saying:  precodeerror -25299 attempting to create account and password for proxy /code/pre  What could be the reason for this? I think it has something to do with codeKeychain app/code, since after changing proxy in Network tab, I also need to press codeAllow/Always allow/code when this popup is triggered(right after changing proxy settings). Using sudo command above doesn't manage this popup.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ILBYW.png" alt="enter image description here"  Any idea how to solve this problem?  <comment293695> Any luck with this? <comment293707> Ended up ignoring it.
