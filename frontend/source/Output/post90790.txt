Releasing Same app for different clients on appstore <body> My company wants to make an app, that it can release on app store with the profile of different clients. Let me explain scenario.  For example, they have got 2 clients A and B. They want to release "MyApp" with the profile of client A, so that their users can download "myApp" seeing developed by A. Similarly, they also want to release it with the profile of client B, so that client B's user can download it.   strongNote that/strong Only icon will be changed for individual client.  So my Question here is that is it allowed by apple? If yes then how can I do it? Thanks.  <comment106624> Release as two different apps <comment106691> Means by making two bundle identifiers for the same binary? will apple accept this? <comment106710> Well they won't be the same binary will they - they will have different names - I suspect if youarequering that you will have to ask Apple what you can do - or else try one and see if Appleaccepts it <comment106712> Ok thanks for suggestion :)
