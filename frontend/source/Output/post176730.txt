How can I make iTunes start again after disabling it? <body> Since iTunes tries to steal my 'Play' button on my keyboard, I disabled it a few months ago. I now wish to buy a movie from the iTunes Store, which means I have to re-enable iTunes.  Problem is: I can't remember what I did to disable it. Currently, after disabling it, starting iTunes shows the icon bouncing but then doesn't launch any windows. Reinstalling iTunes doesn't help. On the command line, I get the following output:  precodeopen /Applications/iTunes.app  2015-03-14 21:03:43.082 open[67755:13439350] Metadata.framework [Error]: void _MDItemMarkAsUsedForPath(CFStringRef): was called with a NULL path  /code/pre  strongHow can I make iTunes start again?/strong  <answer176735> Figured this one out myself:  ul liRe-disabled iTunes via Play Button ITunes Patch/li liThis (while still stopping iTunes from eating the play button) now makes iTunes launch normally again./li /ul  <comment208750> Perhaps you have used https://github.com/thebitguru/play-button-itunes-patch/ ? It seems to remove a path, and since this can't find a path, that may be it.
