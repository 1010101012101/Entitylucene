What is nfsd on macOS? <body> I have two questions regarding codenfsd/code on OS X:  ol liWhat is managing the start/stop phase of this daemon? Launchd? It has an enable and disable mode, but I don't know what does this do./li liWhat is the default status of this service. Enabled or disabled? Should I leave it on disable if my code/etc/exports/code file is empty?/li /ol  <answer178903> nfsd is invoked by launchd while booting by the accompanying com.apple.nfsd.plist file in /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/.  As you can see close to the bottom of the following picture,  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zLiQU.jpg" alt="com.apple.nfsd.plist"  it's only kept alive, when /etc/exports exists. If the path doesn't exist, nfsd will not run.  So removing /etc/exports will disable nfsd temporarily until the path is recreated  or executing  precodelaunchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.nfsd.plist /code/pre  will disable it permanently - even after reinstating /etc/exports (not recommended).  <comment211967> What GUI did you use on the screenshot? <comment211968> @zsero It's [LaunchControl](http://www.soma-zone.com/LaunchControl/) coded by soma-zone. <comment211969> Thanks! Also, I did a tiny test. If I leave it on enabled without the exports file, I get the following log on every boot: http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=X1CJyPmA I think it might delay the boot process a bit. I'd be really curious what is the default state on a clean install. <comment211970> @zsero The default state is indeed enabled on all my Macs/VMs. I think the message is provoked by an outdated but cached plist file. <comment211972> It seems to be triggered by `nfsd disable|enable`. If I do that the override warning appears in the GUI app and the conditions are not checked at start. The fix is to remove the override. <comment354110> please correct /System/Library/LaunchDaemons <comment354112> @freedev Thanx - stupid mistake...
