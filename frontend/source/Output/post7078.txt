Is there any multiple terminal emulator for Mac OS? <body> I love the command line and I would like to see an app like Terminator (for Linux) in my MacOs:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FeBDo.png" alt="enter image description here"  It seems there are ports of that app for Mac emavailable/em using Fink or Ports. But I found it's a hell to install them... it depends on a lot of things which depends on other things which... etc.  So I've been wondering if there's a MacOS native app like that (free or not)...  <answer7080> iTerm 2 claims to be able to do this.  hr  Edit: I just downloaded it, and it seems to work well enough that I think I'll switch from iTerm 1:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/AYFwO.png" alt="enter image description here"  I'm not sure what's going on with you and macports, but I just installed tmux using macports. it took about 30 seconds, and was completely painless.  hr  FWIW, I've subsequently spent enough time with GNU screen that I basically just use it for everything at this point. iTerm is nice if you want a local, mouse-driven multiplexer, but almost everything I do is server-side at this point, and doing it all over one SSH connection is much better anyways.  <answer7143> Install GNU Screen, or TMUX via macports/homebrew or by compiling it by hand.   <answer7177> I'm a big fan of SizeUp which lets you tile windows using keyboard commands. This doesn't put different views in one terminal, but it does let me easily have a bunch of views open at once and organized neatly.  <answer7206> Use gnu screen, it does what you want, split your single terminal window into many windows all within the same GUI window. (though you'll probably want a newer version than what comes with OS X as the ability to split on both axis is newer than the version of screen already installed on your mac.)  <answer60472> I think iTerm 2 and TotalTerminal are all great tools to improve the efficiency when working on terminal and command lines.  <answer132909> Terminator was just ported to Mac OS X via the homebrew package Manager.  precodebrew install terminator /code/pre  See the PR or the recipe.  Tested on OS X 10.9.2 the main functionalities work.   <answer135463> I found that GNU screen does exactly what I want (just type codescreen/code in terminal), but only after I spent a few minutes learning some basics.  Here is the jump start I needed on key bindings (straight from the man page) - note that you need to install the GNU version for vertical splits (listed after the FAU version that was in my Mavericks).  strongScreen version 4.00.03 (FAU) 23-Oct-06/strong   (included in Mavericks and likely similar in earlier)  pre        The following table shows the default key bindings:         C-a '       (select)      Prompt for a window name or number to switch to.         C-a "       (windowlist -b)                                  Present a list of all windows for selection.         C-a 0       (select 0)         a|            a|        C-a 9       (select 9)        C-a -       (select -)    Switch to window number 0 - 9, or to the blank window.         C-a tab     (focus)       Switch the input focus to the next region.  See also split, remove, only.         C-a C-a     (other)       Toggle to the window displayed previously.  Note that this binding defaults                                  to  the command character typed twice, unless overridden.  For instance, if                                  you use the option "-e]x", this command becomes "]]". /pre  ...  pre       C-a S       (split)       Split the current region into two new ones. /pre  ...  pre        C-a ?       (help)        Show key bindings.         C-a \       (quit)        Kill all windows and terminate screen. /pre  ...  pre        C-a *       (displays)    Show a listing of all currently attached displays. /pre  strongAdditional items with 'Screen version 4.02.01 (GNU) 28-Apr-14'/strong   (installed using codesudo port install screen/code just now)  All of the items listed above in the 4.00.02 (FAU) version, as well as:  pre       C-a S       (split)       Split the current region horizontally into two new ones.   See  also  only,                                  remove, focus. /pre  Same above, but this clarifies that it is horizontal. ...  pre        C-a |       (split -v)    Split the current region vertically into two new ones. /pre  Note: I tried searching the web for this, but words such as 'screen', 'terminal', and 'split' are so common as to make the man pages easier for me.  <answer191434> There is also the following:  strongcsshx/strong  <answer290880> For macOS 10.12 cssh from https://www.macports.org works great, whereas the homebrew version fails.  <comment7545> Worth noting that the Terminal app in OS X supports lots of windows and tabs. Does that not do it for you? <comment7546> @Cristian: what specific features are you looking for? btw, awesome avatar :) <comment7547> @Nathan and @calavera what I want is to have different terminal consoles inside the same window. With the Terminal app I can open tabs and open different windows, but that does not offer the same flexibility of `Terminator`. <comment7548> @Christian You can save a group of windows, and even have that auto-open with Terminal. Use Window- Save Windows as Group. Not all you want, but a step in the right direction, I think. <comment7549> Still not as flexible as I want, but it's worth knowing that. Thanks. <comment7550> Odd definition of hell. There is dependency bloat (which is annoying), but the whole point of fink is you type `fink install terminator` and walk away, come back in 10 or 120 minutes, and it is done. <comment7551> Totally not what you're looking for, but.. check out http://ldopa.net/2006/01/14/glterminal/  Hella awesome. <comment7552> @mankoff it seems easy, but trust me: it's much easier to edit the ebuilds of my Gentoo manually and compile G++ than fix the fink repository (it just does not work for me). <comment7553> @Cristian Awesome terminal programme in Ubuntu. Hope some kind of solution exists in OS X. <comment7562> Love it! Just what I was looking for. Thank you! <comment7721> +1 Yes, thanks for this one, a great find. <comment7730> It's worth noting that it's still alpha, though it seems stable enough to me. <comment70018> Can someone say with more detail what the attraction is? And how is this better than Window Groups? (You can layout several windows, then choose **Window  Save as Group**. Then you can open this set of windows again later with **Window  Open Window Group**. <comment70019> If this is important to you, consider providing feedback to Apple at http://www.apple.com/feedback/macosx.html. If you have a (free) developer account, file an enhancement report https://developer.apple.com/bugreporter/. <comment98146> +1 for mentioning (the yet unknown) TotalTerminal. <comment160556> Isn't GNU Screen included with Mac OS X now? It's been my terminal multiplexer of choice for years; though I plan to look at tmux. <comment227342> As a matter of server-side vs client-side: iTerm2 now natively integrates tmux and can use a single ssh channel to communicate with tmux on the server. <comment288957> -1 for mentioning (the now "no longer under active development) TotalTerminal. No. Not really, no minus 1. But I just went to have a look to try it out, and it's no longer developed. However iTerm2 IS AWESOME, so take a +1 instead lol <comment289025> meh, I'd been using terminator, but unhappy with how little it was integrated with osx. Look at the other answers re iTerm2. It eats terminator for breakfast. Sarah. <comment289036> main shortcuts work, but I agree the integration is moot...
