How to fix a dual boot (rEFInd) when Windows is not booting? <body> I used strongbootcamp/strong and strongrEFInd/strong for dual boot of OS X 10.9.5 and Windows 7 on Macbook Pro 17" Early 2011. Worked well and stable.  I tried to setup a strongthird partition/strong, using the free space of the first one, and formatted it FAT strongusing the disk utility of OS X/strong. I did not touch anything from within Windows.  After this, rEFInd did not show up and   precodeNo bootable device -- insert boot disk and press any key /code/pre  Deleted the newly created partition.  rEFInd shows up and lists two boot options. strongI can boot into OSX - but upon chosing the second option rEFInd cannot find a bootable Windows partition any more./strong  I am not able to add the free space to the OS X partition. There are 30 GB left and if I change the size of OS X from 50 to 80, it adjusts the value to 50 again.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/riclC.png" alt="disk utility"  The creator of rEFInd was so kind to point me to gdisk as a tool to solve this problem.
