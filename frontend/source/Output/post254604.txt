New iPhone 7 had AT&T sim in it <body> I just bought an unlocked iPhone 7 in an Apple store. When I tried to put my sim in it - an AT&amp;T sim popped out. This surprised me because the phone wasn't refurbished and the AT&amp;T iPhone isn't the unlocked one - the T-Mobile one is. The phone works fine and unfortunately I threw away the packing so I don't have additional information.  Is this normal?  <comment317013> AFAIK they all come with a carriers sim installed.  None are carrier locked the way they used to be with carrier 2 year contacts. <comment317043> All iPhones purchased in an Apple store are unlocked (assuming you pay full price and don't use carrier financing or subsidy). What carrier did you tell them you were going to use it on? As long as it's unlocked it doesn't matter what SIM came pre-installed.
