exclude certain mailaccounts from sound notifications <body> In iOS6, on iPhone 5, how can I disable sound and vibration for a specific mail account only? I have one mail accounts that is a bit to highly frequented, which results in a lot of ringing and vibration. However all the other mail accounts behave just fine.   Unfortunately I only see one global setting for the whole mail app.  <answer75075> You should be able to accomplish this from the Notifications section of the Settings app, which allows you to set the kind of alerts each app uses:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rqTIpm.png" alt="Notifications in Settings" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/c5UG0m.png" alt="Mail in Notifications"  In that panel, each of your mail accounts will be listed separately, and can be configured individually. I have one account, for example, set to not even badge the Mail.app icon, let alone play sound:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Keh9ym.png" alt="List of accounts" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gS5tqm.png" alt="Settings for mail account that does not notify"  <comment79930> Maybe you can consider setting mail retrieval to Manual for this account, which will only check for new mails when opening the Mail app? <comment79940> That'd be one solution, yes. Not optimal though.
