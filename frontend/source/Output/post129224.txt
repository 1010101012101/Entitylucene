Is it possible to change Calendar.app's color scheme to give today a more distinct background color? <body> I'm running 10.8.5. I use Calendar.app pretty heavily (it's hooked up to the Exchange server at work) and my only continual beef is that the current day doesn't stand out enough visually.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/CwlMM.png" alt="Screen shot"  I don't see any preferences to tweak this. Am I missing something?  <answer129232> There is currently no way to do this, either through the app's visual or hidden preferences.  You can provide feedback to Apple regarding this at the following page:  ul lihttp://www.apple.com/feedback/ical.html/li /ul
