Accidentally deleted the wrong iPhone backup from iCloud <body> I hope you can help me.  I've recently gotten way too fed up with all the "not enough space" issues on both my iCloud and MacBook that I've deleted some of the wrong things by accident in my attempt to make space.  First was iPhoto off my MacBook, and that scared me at first, until I realized I can use BackBlaze to get it back...long slow process, but possible.    Then I got caught in the disaster that is the iTunes update fiasco!  My iTunes is basically my laptop access to my iPhone, I don't use iTunes for anything else really.  So I reluctantly updated iTunes.  Ugh.  But my iPhone needed more space in iCloud to do the update.  I'm in the mood to delete whatever I have to, and also rid myself of these annoying banners about "not enough space" and I'm not prepared to start paying iCloud for more space.  So I deleted my daughter's iPhone from iCloud, she needs her own iCloud anyway. Only it wasn't my daughters iPhone i deleted, it was mine.  I picked the wrong one.  Now I'm stuck in limbo between updates, and I cannot wake up my phone the way it was before I started this update process.  It is frozen.  If I could just access it, I could save the photos from my grandmothers funeral and my nieces baptism (both last week, and not among the lost files on BackBlaze).  Help?  Thank you!  Bridget  <comment183373> Are you trying to update directly 'over the net' on the phone, or by downloading the update to iTunes first? That in itself will save a good deal of space. point 2. Make sure you manually back your phone to iTunes at least once a month & set it to wifi backup whenever plugged in. That way, Backblaze can do its job, because the backups are on your Mac. <comment183374> point 3. Use iPhoto to keep photos long-term. That way you have them in 4 distinct locations always; mac, phone, backblaze, iCloud. <comment183647> I've downloaded the update to iTunes first.
