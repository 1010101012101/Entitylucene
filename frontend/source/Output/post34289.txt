Is there a UNIX-style triple click to select path in Terminal.app? <body> In Red Hat, if there is a path somewhere on my terminal window and I triple click it, the whole path is selected. I can then easily copy it using middle-click or a regular copy-paste.  This doesn't seem to work in Terminal.app, i.e. triple click selects the whole line which is most of the time useless.  Is there a way to change this behavior? Should I look into other terminal apps like iTerm?   <answer34439> Although this doesn't answer your question directly, a better terminal program is probably iTerm2. This does allow for this kind of selection, even nicer, double clicking also automatically copies it to the clipboard as well!  <answer34481> The shortcut for Terminal.app is kbd&#x2318;/kbd+kbd&#x21E7;/kbd+doubleclick.

Any tip for Terminal.app? <comment39387> +1 Term2 = Terminal on steroids <comment39396> Thanks @romeovs! I made the initial post on the iPhone, where there seems to be no way to get to the editing help. <comment62698> In Lion, it's  ⌘+doubleclick, but it opens Safari not copy the selected URL to the clipboard. <comment62699> ⌘+K clears all saved lines. To clear the screen, use control+L. <comment62719> @lhf I don't know what you mean. ⌘+doubleclick seems to do nothing in 10.7.4 for me. To select a path only ⌘+SHIFT+doubleclick works for me. <comment62743> I'm on 10.7.4 too. If you ⌘+doubleclick at any point in a URL shown in Terminal, you open Safari with that URL. But I realize it's not what you want to do. <comment62878> @lhf, ⌘-Double-Click opens URLs (and man-page references, and email addresses). Add the Shift modifier to perform selection without attempting to open URLs. NOTE: You must not already have text selected, otherwise it will treat it as “add/remove discontiguous words to/from the selection” (for comparison, try Command-Clicking and -Dragging to add discontiguous text to the selection). <comment62882> iTerm2 is way better than Terminal.app. Having a process list with Kill-Button is priceless. No more Ctrl-C. <comment63171> Prior to Mac OS X Lion 10.7, ⌘-Double-Click merely added/removed a word to/from the selection (Double-Click selects words, Command-Click adds/removes noncontiguous text to the selection) and ⌘-Shift-Double-Click would either select a path or open a URL, depending on what you clicked on. In Lion and later, ⌘-Shift-Double-Click always means "select a path or URL" and ⌘-Double-Click means "open the URL, if there is one and there isn't any other text selected".
