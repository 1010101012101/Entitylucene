Typing the control+\ (backslash) on Apple keyboard <body> I've been trying for quite some time now to figure out how I'm supposed to type the escape sequence '^\', Control+Blackslash on a Mac.  I have a Swedish keyboard with the Swedish Pro layout, and I have backslash on Shift+Alt+7, but pressing Ctrl+Shift+Alt+7 just gives me a 7, not the escape sequence I would expect.  The closest thing I found while googling is: How do I send C-/ (that is, control-slash) to the terminal?  But it doesn't give away how to do the Control+Backslash, any ideas?  <answer203144> As a user of the Danish Apple keyboard, I face similar issues. Most of the time I — unfortunately — have to remap keyboard shortcuts through strongSystem Preferences/strong  strongKeyboard/strong  strongShortcuts/strong. I researched a bit and wasn't able to find the native way to do this combo on a Scandinavian keyboard.  However, you emmight/em be able to create a service through Automator that presses the keyboard combination for you:  ol liOpen Automator/li liCreate a new document and select strongService/strong as type/li liSet strongService receives selected/strong to emno input/em/li liDrag out a strongRun AppleScript/strong action from the left pane/li liReplace code(* Your script goes here *)/code with codetell application "System Events" to keystroke "\\" using {control down}/code/li liSave and call the service whatever you deem appropriate /li /ol  Then try running it at a time when you need to press kbdCtrl/kbd+kbd\/kbd (For Terminal: strongTerminal/strong  strongServices/strong  strongName of Your Service/strong).  I'm not currently able to test this but it might be worth a try.
