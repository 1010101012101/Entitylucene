Can I use iOS 7 blocking to block iMessages between Apple IDs instead of phone numbers? <body> I have iOS 7, which provides the ability to block calls and messages. Can I block someone texting me on iMessage from their Apple ID to my Apple ID? …or can I only block based on phone numbers (not Apple IDs)?  <answer103386> Yes, on iOS 7, you can block someone from sending you an iMessage from their Apple ID. When you block a contact from sending you texts, it applies to SMS (sent to phone number) and iMessage (sent to phone/Apple ID email). Currently this works only on iOS devices. Any iMessages received on a Mac are not blocked.
