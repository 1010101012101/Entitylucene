where is ~/.vim folder? and how to install themes? <body> I downloaded color sample pack from http://vim.sourceforge.net/scripts/script.php?script_id=625  it says i should unzip and place it into ~/.vim but where is this folder? I tried unzip it to my usr/share/.vim folder but it is not working, I don't see themes added to gvim Editcolor scheme menu, and i tried  "colorscheme sometheme", "color sometheme" in my gvimrc.  Both not working for new themes  Isn't the ~/.vim should be the .vim folder in use/share? or I should create a new folder under home?  Note:there is a folder vim73 in my .vim, I guess this doesn't  affect anything  thanks for any help!  <answer39999> code~/code always is your home folder (code/Users/rororo/code for instance). If ~/.vim exists, that's where you'll find it. Unless you've used vim before, the folder likely will not already exist, so to create the folder, open Terminal.app and type  precodecd ~ mkdir .vim /code/pre  Assuming you downloaded ColorSamplerPack.zip to your Downloads folder you can then proceed with  precodecd .vim unzip ~/Downloads/ColorSamplerPack.zip /code/pre  to unpack the content into the folder. A restart of gvim may be required afterwards.  hr  On second thought, the same result can be accomplished by just opening Terminal.app and executing  precodeunzip ~/Downloads/ColorSamplerPack.zip -d ~/.vim /code/pre  <comment45234> `cd ~` can be shortened to `cd` and is not usually necessary after just opening a Terminal. <comment45235> I would strongly suggest to actually do `cd` to be sure to be in the right place. For instance the terminal on Lion just remembers the last location when opening ... <comment45245> When the folder exists, you can also navigate to it in the Finder using `Go - Go to Folder...`
