How can I find conflicting keyboard shortcuts? <body> I'm on Yosemite 10.10.4, using Safari 8.0.7.  When I press kbd⌘/kbd + kbdShift/kbd + kbd7/kbd Safari doesn't show all tabs, as it's supposed to be, but presents me with the crosshair you get when you would otherwise press kbd⌘/kbd + kbdShift/kbd + kbd4/kbd.  When I press kbd⌘/kbd + kbdShift/kbd + kbd4/kbd, I also get the crosshair. Pressing kbd⌘/kbd + kbdShift/kbd + kbd7/kbd outside of Safari also gives me the crosshair.  I already checked all shortcuts defined under "System Preferences  Keyboard  Shortcuts" and I also used the apps emCheatSheet/em and emKeyCue/em to display shortcuts, but they only show kbd⌘/kbd + kbdShift/kbd + kbd7/kbd for "Show all tabs" in Safari and kbd⌘/kbd + kbdShift/kbd + kbd4/kbd for taking selected screenshots.  How can I find out, where the conflicting key bind is coming from?   This behavior started a few days ago, but I can't seem to recall any specific changes or app installations, If there even were any...  <answer198219> I actually found the culprit...  In order to find the error I tried several other numbers with kbd⌘/kbd + kbdShift/kbd and found kbd⌘/kbd + kbdShift/kbd + kbd6/kbd triggering a screen recording interface I hadn't seen before.  Opening this interfaces options I found it originated from CloudApp and there in CloudApps "Keyboard Shortcuts" I found it (see image).  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wT0NB.png" alt="the interfering shortcut"  CloudApp must have integrated the shortcut with it's recent update.  I removed the shortcut and now Safari is working again as it should :)  <comment236935> just to correct you, the shift+7 key is actually "/" not the number 7. <comment236958> it's actually \ not /  :) <comment237147> I am using OS X with German language, so it's "7" because we have a different keyboard layout :)
