What are the different OS X clipboards <body> Everybody uses the general OS X clipboard, which can programmatically accessed with codepbcopy -general/code and codepbpaste -general/code. However I noticed that the manpage of codepbcopy/code and codepbpaste/code also mention:  ul licode-find/code pasteboard/li licode-font/code pasteboard/li licode-ruler/code pasteboard/li /ul  Which all seem to function. But how can they be accessed outside of the terminal? And if not, why do they have these descriptive names?  I also noticed that there is yet another clipboard in OS X. Go to the start of a line of text and press kbdctrl/kbd + kbdK/kbd. Now go somewhere else and press kbdctrl/kbd + kbdY/kbd. You just yanked some text from a clipboard which is none of the above, as they are all still intact. What's up with that?  <comment295890> The kill ring is a hangover from Emacs - https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Deletion-and-Killing.html#Deletion-and-Killing idk about the others. <comment295891> Have a look at the [Pasteboard Programming Guide](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/PasteboardGuide106/Introduction/Introduction.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40008100-SW1) and more specifically [Named Pasteboards](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/PasteboardGuide106/Articles/pbConcepts.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40008101-SW2). <comment295893> Is there any way to access the access the kill ring programmatically?
