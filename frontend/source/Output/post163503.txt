Connection adapter availability <body> How can I connect an older iPod touch second generation to a lightning dock? The iPod has a 30 pin connector and the dock is a lightning connection.  <answer163515> I found a link to this adapter on an Apple forum. It could be what you're looking for.  <answer163524> Sorry but I didn't understand the question correct the first time.  Adapters from linghtning to 30-pins are not officially supported by apple.  When buying such an adapter could also result in stop working when you do not expect it.  hr  For this problem Apple has introduced the  precode30-pins to lightning adapter  30-pins to lightning cable /code/pre  These products have a chip inside that garuantees that the adapters keep working, even after software updates.  These products also support sending sound and video through the adapter/cable  These are the links to the products:  30-pins to lightning adapter  30-pins to lightning cable  Keep in mind that there are cheaper, non official adapters for this. The reason because they are cheaper is because they don't have a chip inside. It could be possible that those products stop working when you do not expect it, so use strongat your own risk./strong  hr  <comment191476> You're answering a different question.
