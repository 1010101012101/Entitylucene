Intermittent stuttering after upgrade to OS X 10.9.4 from 10.9.3 <body> MacBook Pro Retina, 13-inch, Late 2013.  OS X 10.9.4 (13E28)  After the update from 10.9.3 to 10.9.4 my cursor/keyboard inputs stutter every ~5 seconds for about a second after my computer awakes from a sleep.    The problem goes away after I restart my computer twice (about 90% of the time, about 10% of the time one restart works).  The problem always returns after the computer awakes from a sleep.    This only occurs when I am using a USB - Ethernet dongle (Cisco Linksys Model No. USB 300M) to connect to the internet and when I have wifi sharing on. (In this given office I use the dongle to connect to the internet then my laptop acts as a wifi access point for other computers / phones)  I am not 100% certain that wifi sharing needs to be on to reproduce the problem.  I get no output in the console associated with the stuttering.  Has anyone experienced this problem / found a solution?  hr  From the patch notes:     Fixes an issue that prevented some Macs from automatically connecting to known Wi-Fi networks   I'm curious if something related to this caused the issue.  hr  strongUpdate: Not the dongle?/strong  I'm beginning to think the problem is associated with manually assigning my IPv4 settings (IP Address, Subnet Mask, Router) and DNS Servers.    Every time I used the USB Dongle I was manually configuring the above settings.  I discontinued use of the USB dongle and attached to a wireless router using the same manually configured settings and I'm experiencing the same stuttering at the same time as I was when I was using the dongle.  <comment165700> whos dongle is it, model ? <comment165730> It is a Cisco Linksys usb dongle.  I am out of the office where it is physically located so I don't have the model now.  Will update with the model tomorrow if still necessary. <comment165786> @Buscarì›ƒ Updated. <comment166632> Same issue, my specs: 10.9.4 new install MBP 13" Retina Late 2013 Apple Thunderbolt Ethernet adapter instead of Cisco USB Ethernet Was fine previously running on just wifi. Also changed out a monitor cable from thunderbolt to hdmi to make way for Thunderbolt/ethernet. <comment166916> @avial Does your problem persist after making your cable switch to use Thunderbolt/ethernet?  (I filed a bug report on Apple's site, hopefully they patch it up.) <comment167413> @avial I added an update about my issue not being directly related to the dongle.  Are you using manually configured IPv4 and/or DNS settings when you're using the USB dongle?
