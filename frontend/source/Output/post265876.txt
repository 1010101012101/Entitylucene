Working with a PDF in Preview...duplicate page without form fields linked <body> Working with a document (PDF file) in preview that has form fields for specific text information. I have more information than the fields allow and wanted to add a duplicate page to add supplemental information. I have tried a couple different methods and have duplicated the page but the form fields shadow one another. The fields are linked so that whatever is typed into a field on page one is automatically modified on the duplicate page and vice versa. Is there a way to break the link and make each page independent of the other?
