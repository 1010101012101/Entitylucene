Is it possible to remove sth from the keychain on iOS? <body> I develop the app for iOS and I need to save unique id for device using keychain on device and keep it persistent always whenever user install or uninstall app. I know that everything saved to 'UserDefaults' disappear along with the app. I can save sth to the keychain... but it is enough to restore iphone to delete that info.   but the question is:  Is there a simpler way to remove that key from its own keychain by user? Simply I would like to know if there are easy possibilities to remove that key and working with the app as a new device.
