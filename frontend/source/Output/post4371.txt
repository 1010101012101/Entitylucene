iOS 4.2 on iPod Touch 2d Gen : is it worth it? <body> Is there any advantage to upgrade the iPod Touch 2d Gen to iOS 4.2 ?  ul liIs the tech specs enough for that new version ?/li liDoes it consume more battery ?/li liWill it be slower ?/li /ul  <answer4376> I'd say yes. I just upgraded a pair of 2nd gen iPod Touches to iOS 4.2 and it's been really solid so far - it hasn't slowed down the device or impacted the battery as far as I can tell. If you have an Airport Express or new Apple TV the AirPlay feature is very nice - this Thanksgiving I really enjoyed being able to stream music to a pair of speakers directly from the iPod in my pocket. (this emwill/em affect your battery as the device has to keep WiFi active to stream)  <comment4203> I thought AirPlay wasn't available on 2nd gen devices? <comment4204> @MrMage Worked just fine on mine, but I only tested audio. <comment4466> Upgrade from what? 4.1? 3.x? <comment4573> The latest one. I'd say 4.1. Anyway I have done it. And I agreed with Kyle's answer.
