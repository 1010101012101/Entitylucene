How to actually start "VMware Fusion Services" on Mac OS? <body> So every time I run a VM, quit VMware, and then restart VMware hours later, I get an error stating something along the lines of codeCannot find /dev/vmmon. Make sure the kernel is loaded/code. I've gotten nowhere with trying to figure out how to resolve that other than to reboot the system. However, in Activity Monitor I can see that "VMware Fusion Services" is running when VMware actually works, and the service is not running when it's not working properly.  Is there any way that I can trace what "VMware Fusion Services" is so that I can start it manually next time I get this error?  Here are two pictures from when VMware Fusion services is running vs when it's not: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4crMH.jpg" alt="enter image description here"img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/g5Mny.jpg" alt="enter image description here"
