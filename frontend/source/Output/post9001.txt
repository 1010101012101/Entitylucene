How to open FrameMaker files on a Mac with OS X? <body> I have some old FrameMaker documents on my Mac (Intel Core Duo, OS X 1.6.6). Is there any way to open this files (readonly would be ok)? I cannot use the FrameMaker 10 trial from Adobe, because it is windows only. There has been a reader/viewer app in the past but I cannot find it anywhere.  There are two file formats:  ul licode*.mif/code is Maker Interchange Format (an XML dialect)/li licode*.fm/code is FrameMaker binary/li /ul  <answer9002> Adobe provides an online pdf creator which they state handles FrameMaker files.  However, it costs $10 a month to use it, but it might be worth a shot. (Albeit, you may convert 5 files to pdfs before you have to pay).  http://createpdf.adobe.com  <answer9275> MIF Filter  From DTP Tools.

Or, set up Bootcamp/Parallels and do the same on your system.  <comment9546> I do not find any hint that CreatePDF handles FrameMaker, but I will have a try with the test account... <comment9547> http://createpdf.adobe.com/cgi-feeder.pl/formats?BP=&LOC=en_US "Adobe Formats Illustrator® (.ai), InDesign™ (.indd), FrameMaker® (.fm, .mif), PageMaker® (.pm, .pm6, .p65, .pmd, .pmt), Photoshop® (.psd)" <comment9548> Thanks, the FAQ does not list it: https://createpdf.acrobat.com/faq.html <comment9576> Arrrgghh. There a two versions of the createpdf service: createpdf.adobe.com and createpdf.acrobat.com. The acrobat version does not work (upload does not allow *.fm, point to printer driver but that is wirndows 7 only). But I have uploaded to the adobe site and got the pdf by email! <comment9820> Sounds good, but I do not have InDesign. <comment61439> Suffering from the same I couldn't find another solution yet than the DTP-Filters (available for InDesign or Quark XPress) that allows to import and work on MIF/FM-Files. <comment103935> Unfortunately the website createpdf.adobe.com now forwards you to createpdf.acrobat.com. It seems as if Adobe does not provide anymore a service for Framemaker to PDF conversion.
