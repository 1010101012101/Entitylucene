Refresh the contents of the (right-hand side) menu bar? <body> After making a change to whether something should appear in the menubar, like so (for example):  precodedefaults write "org.pqrs.Karabiner" 'isStatusbarEnable' -bool true /code/pre  I see no change.  Nothing shows up, despite the fact that experimentation shows the preferences were correctly updated, in the same way they would be by a manual change in a preference pane or window.  Lots of sites suggest   precodekillall -KILL SystemUIServer /code/pre  to reload the "widgets" on the right side of the menu, but this does absolutely nothing.  The widgets (in the example above, Karabiner) do not show up.    How can I refresh the menu bar so that everything that is emsupposed to/em show up according to preferences emdoes/em show up?
