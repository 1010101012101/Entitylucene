OSX: How to backup personal data via CLI script or command <body> I need run a backup of the personal data from my MacBook Pro (native HDD) to an external HDD.  I have used this external drive to back up this internal drive previously via Time Machine.  I don't have GUI access due to an internal problem, but I have mounted the file system using the "single user mode" command line interface.  <comment338438> I don't think this will work in single-user mode, but it is worth a shot.  `/usr/bin/tmutil startbackup` would be the simplest way to refresh the time machine backup. <comment338473> Use the `rsync` command. <comment338478> I second the rsync idea, see: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/14754/rsync-backup-script?rq=1 <comment338514> Cheers. Never used `tmutil` before. Why don't you think it'll work in single-user mode? I'll try it. I think it's the backend to the GUI application I've been using. If it's no good, I'll try `rsync`. <comment347072> So, did tmutil work in single-user mode? Did you succeed with your goal? Either way, please answer your own question as others may have the same question (being in single-user mode or not).
