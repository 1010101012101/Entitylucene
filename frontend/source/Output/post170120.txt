Can't access Yahoo account on iphone- says 'IMAP server"apple.imap.mail.yahoo.com" isn't working' <body> My yahoo account has stopped working on my iphone 4s. I can access the account on a desktop but not the iphone. Comes up with 'The IMAP server "apple.imap.mail.yahoo.com" is not responding. Check your network connection and that you entered the correct information in the "incoming Mail Server' field.'  Any idea how to fix this? Hasn't happened before.  <answer171458> The incoming IMAP server you are getting ("IMAP.apple.mail.yahoo.com") is not a real Yahoo IMAP server. Like @Buscar said, deleting and re-adding should resolve the problem. However, it seems like the settings are getting recreating incorrectly.  What I'd do, after re-adding the email, is manually fix the settings to the right servers. To fix them, go to Settings  Mail, Contacts &amp; Calendars  (select Yahoo account)  Account. You should have the option to edit the IMAP server in the Advanced section.  If it doesn't allow you to change it, add the account manually by going to Settings  Mail, Contacts, Calendars  Add Account  Other.

I added the account on an iphone 6 and it worked fine. Any other ideas? <comment200093> check your firewall and privacy settings. <comment264825> I spent two hours manually setting up the AT&T / Bellsouth / Yahoo mail account on a friend's new iPhone. I think the main problem is that the mail server addresses end with yahoo.com, but the email address ends with bellsouth.net. I kept trying (incorrectly) to make these consistent - both ending in .net (or in .com), which never worked. I deleted everything and started over. The second time around, I was very careful, and finally noticed the difference - and it does work fine now.
