OSX not unlocking with password from screensaver <body> I have several Macs that are bound to an Active Directory network, and on occasions this issue arises:  ol liThe user locks the screen or the screensaver activates and locks the screen. /li liThe user then enters their password  /li liThe password field 'shakes' to indicate failed password attempt./li /ol  The user usually calls the Service Desk, who then reset the password but the user still cannot unlock the machine.  The call then comes to me and what I have to do is SSH into the machine then do the following (if the user has not carried out a hard reboot of the machine first):  codesudo dscl . -delete /Users/[username]/code  Once I have done that, the user can log back in but usually their password has been changed and so they have to update their keychain.  All the machines are bound to AD. They all sync their clocks to the DC's time. The OS's are a mix of 10.9.5, 10.10.5 &amp; 10.11.6  Any ideas as to why this is happening, or some pointers to what to examine?
