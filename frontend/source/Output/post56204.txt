Is it possible to boot backtrack from usb on a macbook pro? <body> I would like to boot BackTrack on my MacBook Pro from a USB drive but it seems impossible. I'm holding the Alt key on boot, but the mac only displays "Macintosh HD", i.e. it doesn't recognize my USB. Anybody knows if booting a Linux distro from a usb possible?   Thanks.  <answer56211> Apparently your USB stick, to be bootable, must be setup for EFI/GPT.  <comment64967> I tried it, but it gets stack when it tries to detect some stuff. It hangs very early in the beginning.
