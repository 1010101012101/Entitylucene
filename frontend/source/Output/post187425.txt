iOS 8 CNA not triggering <body> I'm in the process of implementing a captive access point and when testing with iOS 8, I don't get shown the captive network assistant.  When I use Android and BlackBerry, they're able to detect that they're on a captive portal.  It just seems like iOS which is the odd-one-out, refusing to display any kind of prompting for the user to sign into the network.  My portal is implemented by redirecting all traffic at an IP level to a local server, which then generates a genuine HTTP redirect to our portal.  <answer187426> iOS detects captive portals by attempting to access http://www.apple.com/library/test/success.html or http://captive.apple.com/hotspot-detect.html with the user agent 'wispr'.  Should this page request not return "Success", but still return a HTML page, then it shows the captive portal assistant. Make sure that you are correctly serving your captive portal page to this URL.  <answer196169>    My portal is implemented by redirecting all traffic at an IP level to a local server, which then generates a genuine HTTP redirect to our portal.   Ok. But you miss another part.  Your page displayed in CNA must content the codewispr/code datas.  Triggering CNA &lt;==needs== [unreachable apple url] strong+/strong [wispr datas in the html]  <comment221533> Actually, I just realized I had some detection code that was doing a 404.  Turns out, it worked!  Thank you :) <comment221550> I wish I could auto-send your answer to every captive portal that fails on my phone @grgarside  ;-) <comment221575> I'm glad I asked, this is the most direct and informed answer I've read on this subject.  Most people seem to wander around and never clearly identify what exactly the sequence is. <comment255675> What does "must content the wispr datas" mean?  Can you elaborate?
