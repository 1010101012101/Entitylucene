How do I delete an iCal event without sending notifications? <body> If I try to delete an event on iCal, it offers me these options:  ul liCancel/li liDelete and Notify/li /ul  What if I want to delete without notifying?  I'm running iCal 5.0.2 on OS X 10.7.3 using an Exchange account.  emEdit/em: Using an Exchange account.  <answer51034> A couple of years ago I wrote a script to do this. It's all at http://thefragens.com/blog/2010/04/dont-send-ical-replies/  The gist of it is the script will automatically alter an AppleScript inside the iCal package. It does not effect the code signing. The script also has a method of reverting itself. You'll likely have to install the changes each time iCal is updated.   NB: It won't work with Exchange accounts.  The zip file has the install bash script, a modified and an unmodified AppleScript.  <answer82669> You can move the event to a local calendar. When deleting you will then get the additional option "Delete &amp; do not notify".  <answer139626> In the end, I created a new calendar specifically to move event invites to, which I don't want to see anymore. Then I hide that calendar.  <answer148956> If you use iCloud the Calendar App will not allow you to create local calendars. The following answer helps.  <answer235483> As Feuermurmel says, you can create a new calendar and move it there.  But instead of hiding the new calendar, you can just delete the calendar.  Worked well for me; the event is gone with no notifications.  <answer244929> Instead of deleting, cut the event and it will be gone:)  <answer261194> I ended up doing the following:  ul licreate a new iCloud calendar/li liselect the invite, and chose the new calendar in the calendar drop down on the info pane on the right/li liselect and right-click the calendar on the calendars pane on the left and chose delete/li lipick the option delete and do not notify/li /ul  I hope this helps.  <comment58405> Thanks! Sadly, I use an Exchange account. <comment160560> Moving to a local calendar as outlined in Matteos answer has several issues: a) it's not an option if you're using iCloud (as that'll disallow local calendars) b) in Mavericks, although the option to "Delete & do not notify", the notification is sent nevertheless! <comment160565> @user959380 The answer is from 2013 and it was possible :-) You could have iCloud calendars and local calendars. <comment269343> According to the comment above and this thread (https://discussions.apple.com/thread/3705591?start=15&tstart=0), moving to a local calendar does give the option to not notify but still sends the notification. <comment269344> This is the only working solution. Essentially a "deleted" calendar. <comment328708> This doesn't work (at least in El Capitan).  It will notify the sender. <comment328977> If you came to this page because you're getting iCal spam, your best option is to block future spam using this technique: http://1wayswim.com/blog/2016/11/23/how-to-stop-icloud-calendar-spam  There isn't much you can do about spam that's already there.
