FTP does not work <body> I used CyberDuck to connect to my remote server. Some days ago CyberDuck starts says ("FTP Connection Open") then ("Read timed out. The connection attempt timed out. The server may be down, or your network may not be properly configured.").  So I have thought was a CyberDuck or Server Error, so I tried using "Connection to server..." (Finder - CMD+K) and the result is the same: cannot connect to server, when i try the windows shake as the password was wrong but I changed yesterday the server FTP account in order to be certain that the password is right.  Therefore I've thought was a server error, but this problem appears with Aruba, Netsons and Altervista, so I doubt that the problem is generated from server.  Any idea to fix?   <comment251819> What happems if you telnet into port 21 <comment252046> 200. The connection is established.      `Trying IP_ADDRESS...     Connected to SERVER_NAME     Escape character is '^]'.     220 ProFTPD 1.3.4a Server (Debian) [::ffff:IP_ADDRESS]` <comment252096> The connection is using IPv6 - do you want that? <comment252217> No, IP_ADDRESS was IPv4. Where did you see that i'm using IPv6? <comment252314> The result of telnet ::ffff:IP_ADDRESS
