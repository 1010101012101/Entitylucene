CPU Frequency is always the same <body> Macbook Mid-2010 running Sierra. If type codesysctl hw.cpufrequency/code, it always shows 2400000000. And it never changes the frequency no matter what I run. I tried to use other software to check frequency and it was the same 2.4 GHz all the time. Is there any chance to make SpeedStep working? Can I control the frequence myself? (underclocking would be great feature since coolbook app is dead).  P.S. Controlling CPU speed is most interesting thing for Core2Duo users nowadays and if there's any chance to perform it, that would be great.  <comment320233> Check CPU/GPU-frequency and power/temp with [Intel Power Gadget](https://software.intel.com/file/501089/download) <comment320235> Intel® Power Gadget only supports 2nd generation Intel® Core™ processors and later. Seems to me, my cpu is not supported <comment320247> Hmm I always thought Core 2 Duo is already the 2nd generation of Intel Core processors (compared to Core Duo/Mono) <comment320252> I wish you were right, but unfortunately I can't install it.
