Sierra Mail 10.2 set Internal Port <body> I am trying to transfer mail account settings from a machine running OS X El Capitain and Mail.app 9.3 to a machine running OS X Sierra and Mail.app 10.2.   I am running a proxy to an Exchange server and need to set the Internal Port, but that box doesn't seem to exist in Mail 10.2.  How do I set the internal port for a Mail 10.2 account?  ETA: Found the solution. Put the correct URL with attached port, i.e. un-check Automatically manage connection settings and set the Internal URL to  http://localhost:xxxxx/ews/exchange/asmx
