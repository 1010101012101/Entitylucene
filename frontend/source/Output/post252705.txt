Drive attached to Thunderbolt display won't sleep <body> I have a 5TB Seagate external USB hard drive attached to an Apple Thunderbolt display which connects to my late 2013 13" Retina MacBook. The drive is set up as a Time Machine backup drive. The only other thing connected to the display is an ethernet cable.  I unmount the external drive and disconnect my MacBook when I leave the office every evening. Before I connect my MacBook again each morning, I've noticed that the drive is powered on and fully spun up... its "drive in use" light is on and I can hear it spinning. The weirdest part is that when I connect my MacBook, I hear it spin down as if I've just unmounted it (only to have to be woken up as it mounts to the MacBook).   My concern here is that I'm decreasing the lifespan of the drive by having it spinning at full tilt for the 15 hours that I'm not even at the computer.   Why is the drive spinning up while no computer is connected? How can I get the drive to stay off during these hours?
