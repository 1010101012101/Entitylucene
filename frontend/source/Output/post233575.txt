How do I determine which revenue from the App Store belongs to which app? <body> The iTunesConnect help says:     Your financial reports are presented as groups of transactions,   displayed in distinct rows. Each row represents a unique combination   of an app, transaction type (product type identifier), price   (proceeds/customer Price), store, sale or return and promo (if   applicable).   But the downloaded report I have doesn't say which app sales are for. Is this because I only have sales for one app last month?  I'm wondering because I have a second app on the store now, and I have to pay royalties to people who helped with the games. So I need to know how much each app brings in each month.  <answer233815> There are (free) services that do that for you. You can also generate nice looking reports for the people who helped you with the games:  ul liAppFigures (we've been using them for 4+ years): http://appfigures.com/li liAppAnnie (not so much a fan personally): http://appannie.com/li liLaunchKit (goes directly to Slack, but not real "overview"): http://launchkit.io/sales/li /ul  <comment285758> I'm going to leave this open a bit longer as it might get some more answers, but this was helpful.
