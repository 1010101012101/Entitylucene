Can I use keywords in Safari as Google Chrome? <body> The main reason because I use Google Chrome on my Mac is its keyword feature that I can use as shortcut while I'm searching for something.  This is an example of my main keywords: http://i.imgur.com/dORgCC0.png  This is an example of keyword feature in action: http://gfycat.com/IlliterateBiodegradableGreatargus  Is there a way to do the same on Safari?  <answer191310> KeySearch sounds like what you want. From the website:     It uses short keywords to allow you to search any site you want, right from the toolbar.      ...      Just right-click on any search box and choose "Create keyword for this search." Type in a keyword and KeySearch takes care of the rest.   (I have not used it.)
