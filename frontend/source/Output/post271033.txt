.cshrc got empitied, aliases are loaded in opened terminal, how to retrieve them? <body> accidentally my code.cshrc/code file got deleted, which had many aliases. I have terminal tab opened in my linux machine, which has all these aliases loaded in it. How can i retrieve it so that i could write them back to code.cshrc/code file and get it back?   <answer271055> From the manual, it seems that codealias/code should list all of the aliases in the currently running shell:     alias [name [wordlist]]      Without arguments, prints all aliases.  With name, prints the   alias for name.  With name and wordlist, assigns wordlist as   the alias of name.  wordlist is command and filename   substituted.  name may not be codealias' or/codeunalias'.  See also   the unalias builtin command.
