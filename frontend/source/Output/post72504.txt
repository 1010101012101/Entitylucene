Cannot disable three finger tap look up after migrating to a new computer <body> I recently moved to a new MacbookPro and migrated my old computer's files/settings over to the new one.  For some reason I am unable to disable the ability to look up the definition to a word by using a three finger tap gesture.  ul liI have unchecked the "Look up" option in the Trackpad preference pane./li liI also disabled option to "Look Up in Dictionary" within Keyboardbr preference pane  Keyboard Shortcuts  Searching  Look Up inbr Dictionary./li /ul  I typically use BetterTouchTool to turn a three finger tap gesture into a middle click, I have disabled this feature for now and continue to have the issue where if I tap something with three fingers the text becomes highlighted and I am greeted with a definition to the word.  This happens in all applications.  Is there any other way to disable this feature?  Is there a terminal command I could try?  <answer72507> Have you tried deleting code~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.driver.AppleBluetoothMultitouch.trackpad.plist/code or running codedefaults write com.apple.driver.AppleBluetoothMultitouch.trackpad TrackpadThreeFingerTapGesture -bool false/code?  <answer73327> The laptop I migrated from was a Macbook Air that was running OSX 10.8.2.  When I migrated over to my new Macbook Pro 13" with Retina - the Retina only had 10.8.1 installed.  I learned that the update to 10.8.2 had been pulled after initially being released by apple because of misc issues on a few of their models - my 13" Retina included.  strongApple emre-released/em a 10.8.2 version of OSX today that repaired my issue./strong  <comment84202> I found the file and deleted it.  Did not help.  Even after I tried setting the settings to the desired false.  I even tried the terminal command - when I view my trackpad settings they appear to be how I want them (this feature set to false), but I still get the ability to do so when I three finger tap. <comment98377> wanted to echo Ecnalyr's experience. These commands sure *look* like they should work, but they don't work.  Perhaps somebody else knows the correct setting names for these defaults?
