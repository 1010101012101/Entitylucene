Is there any way to watch Hulu (or Hulu Plus) on the new Apple TV? <body> I was hoping Airplay might do this, but when I turn it on in the Hulu Plus app, it only streams the audio to the ATV.  <answer4321> Unfortunately, it seems that AirPlay is audio only for third-party apps for the time being, and there's no other way to get Hulu Plus on the Apple TV.  <answer5176> When AirPlay support for Safari is added (supposedly in 2011 - see below), you may be able to do this.   http://www.macrumors.com/2010/11/30/steve-jobs-airplay-video-streaming-coming-to-safari-and-third-party-apps-in-2011/   <comment5285> You still couldn't play Hulu, unless Hulu incorporates this into their app.
