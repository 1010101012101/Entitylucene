Diagnosing system lockups <body> I am having a problem with my MacBookPro5,1 (more background below): the system will randomly lock up, with the following symptoms:  ul liScreen freezes up, no corruption/li liSystem does not respond to keyboard or mouse input/li liSystem does not respond to pings over the network/li liNo kernel panic message appears on screen/li liNo messages in the system log/li /ul  I have so far been unable to reproduce the problem at all. It happens both when I am actively using the computer and when it is idle; both when the screensaver is running and when it is not; and it doesn't seem to be related to any of the peripherals plugged in (though AirPort occasionally acts up). The system passes memory tests (memtest86+ and the provided Apple Hardware Test) so that doesn't seem to be it either. Is there anything I can do to obtain more diagnostic information?  strongBackground./strong I recently had to replace the main logic board, after experiencing a problem where the laptop would not power up at all. Since then I have been experiencing random freezes and I would like to know if there's anything else that might need replacing, or if I should ask for another replacement for the main logic board while the repair is still under warranty.  <answer35871> Ask for another Logic Board diagnosis and/or replacement. There's really only three things that could ever cause failure this integral to the whole system simply halting all activity:  ol liBad Processor/li liBad Memory/li liBad Logic Board/li /ol  No matter what the result is, while you still have coverage after the recent replacement, something obviously is still wrong, and you should absolutely exercise your ability to have this re-diagnosed.  <comment41121> You forgot hard drive failure, especially if there is corruption where some of the system files are stored. That was a tough one for me to figure out on my iMac. <comment41122> Test the hard drive as well. <comment41124> In my personal experience, Hard Drive failure never locks the mouse from responding. Actions (clicks, etc.) may not do anything, but the simple act of moving the cursor still occurs. <comment41125> I'm inclined to agree with Jason. System file corruption doesn't seem likely: I already tried reinstalling the OS. <comment41555> I'm happy with your diagnosis. Just letting you know the HDD was the culprit in my case, locking it all up. <comment41569> Absolutely bizarre :/. <comment41949> Well, I took it to the Genius Bar for extending triage and they couldn't reproduce the problem. Now I'm wondering if it could be my charger that's the problem, since I forgot to bring that in for testing as well...
