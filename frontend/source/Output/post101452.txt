Remove author metadata from PDF annotations in preview? <body> I need to provide comments on PDFs as part of the refereeing process for journal articles.  How can I remove my name from the annotations I've made using Mac Preview?  (they can be seen in Inspector: Annotations, but seem not to be editable)  <answer101490> In Preview, go to preferences  In the PDF tab  Select show or Not show the name in the Annotations !  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yEkwg.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer101501> I have the exact same problem. While you should anonymize yourself in the prefs, I don't fully trust that method, so:  ol liMake a copy of the annotated PDF file/li liDrag and drop to open in a text editor like TextWrangler, or hex editor like  HexEdit (Don't worry about any binary-looking weird characters)/li liSearch for your name and replace with the exact same number of Xs or I usually throw in a space among the Xs so it looks like a different name./li liSave the file in place/li liOpen in Preview and mouse over the annotations to see the anonymized version/li /ol  <answer120460> Regarding the second answer, this emdoes not necessarily work/em if the .pdf was created using a different application, even if it is modified in Preview. emAlways/em use the Inspector in Preview to make sure the Author metadata is anonymized, and if not, change it as the first answer suggests using a text editor (TextEdit works fine).  For example, I often "print" web pages to .pdf in Safari, particularly news stories. If I open one of those in Preview and look using Inspector, my name shows up, even though I have "Add name to annotations" unchecked in Preview preferences as the second answer suggests. It stays there even if I annotate the document in Preview and save it.  I assume this is because it was added when I printed to .pdf from Safari. Safari preferences do not have a way to change user ID or anonymize saved documents in its preferences, as far as I can tell, so it reverts to System-level account information and adds my name from there when saving.  Again, emalways/em use the Inspector in Preview to make sure the Author metadata is anonymized before sending out a sensitive document.  (This should answer keflavich's question in response to Answer 2. In Preview [as opposed to common office applications or other groupware], your name is not associated with your annotations but with the document as a whole.)  <answer130305> MetaClean is a powerful tool to view, remove and edit metadata of Microsoft Office (Word, Excel, PowerPoint and Visio), OpenOffice (word processors, spreadsheets and presentations) and PDF (versions 1.0 and higher) documents.  http://adarsus.com/en/metaclean.html  Microsoft Windows, Linux, Unix and Mac OS X Platforms  <comment119548> What program are you using to make comments with? This question need a lot more detail in order to help you out. Please consider adding more details. Do you make the PDF yourself? How do you add the annotations? etc. <comment119575> This is great, but is there any way to remove my name from existing annotations? <comment119576> Brilliant, this works - all I needed to know was that my name was being stored in plaintext.  Easy enough, thanks!
