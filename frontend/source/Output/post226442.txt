How to change the input menu input method order <body> I use 3 input methods.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hUfx9.png" alt="enter image description here"  The order of input methods on here is what I want, in this order: English, Chinese(Wubi), Japanese(Hiragana) but when comes to the input menu of status bar:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pBHJX.png" alt="enter image description here"  I want to change it's order to: U.S., Wubi, Hiragana. I searched around but couldn't find any way. How can I do that?  <comment274978> Have you tried removing both and then adding them again in the order that you want? <comment274983> @TomGewecke Yes, and still the same.
