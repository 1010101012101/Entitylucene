Two external monitors via a single mini DP output on my macbook pro 13 <body> I was hoping someone might have tried this before and can tell me if it will work, before I go out and buy all the adapters.  I want to connect two external monitors to my macbook pro by connecting the following to the mini displayport only;  Mini DisplayPort 1.1a input and DVI output (mini displayport to DVI adapter 24+5 pin),   24+5 pin DVI-I Male input to Dual VGA Female Output Adapter Splitter Cable (This DVI-I VGA Cable splits 1 DVI signal to 2 VGA signals) and finally http://www.ebay.com.au/itm/New-DVI-I-24-5-Pins-Male-to-2-Dual-VGA-Female-Monitor-Adapter-Splitter-Cable-/120836187368?pt=AU_Components&amp;hash=item1c2265e4e8&amp;_uhb=1#ht_3695wt_1124  then connecting both monitors to the VGA.  I want to extend the desktop (not mirror) which I was told required the DVI adapter (rather than going straight from the mini DP to a VGA splitter).  I know I can use the mini DP for one monitor and the USB (via adapter) for the second, as demonstrated in the following video http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIVZI1cFiAw  But I would rather keep my usb ports free.  I'm just not sure if the video card can support this method...I have a feeling at best I will get a mirror. (I also run windows7 on my macbook which I prefer to use, in case this makes a difference)  Any feedback would be appreciated :)  <comment97710> Did you find an answer to your problem? To keep my ports free I got a DVI splitter cable but the monitors only mirror each other and there's no option for me to change it in my display settings.
