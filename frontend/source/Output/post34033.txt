Mail app rejects Gmail SMTP when Adium is connected to Gtalk <body> This issue is really weird, and it started right after I started the Lion update process in Snow Leopard, before even rebooting to Lion. :)  I use a Gmail account for mail and chat. When Adium is connected, Mail complains when sending a message because of a bad SMTP password. If I then quit Adium, everything works fine. How can I fix this?
