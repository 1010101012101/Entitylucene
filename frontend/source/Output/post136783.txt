Remove menu bar apps from menu bar in OS X <body> What is best method to remove menu bar apps from MacBook Pro Retina running Mavericks?  I've tried Broomstick and a few others with no real easy success.  I've also tried going through System Preferences / User Groups and then Login Items  <answer136799> Try strongBartender/strong. This lets you hide (as well as re-arrange) menu bar items, as well as providing a secondary menu bar so that you can hide icons from the main bar but still have access to them on a keyboard shortcut or menu bar item.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9Zusk.png" width="555"  <answer136804> I may be misunderstanding, but to remove items from Finder's menu bar is quite simple:  Hold down kbdCommand/kbd and drag the icon from the menu bar. Poof! It's gone.   This works for all Apple based menu bar items, and some third party items. Usually, when it doesn't work for a third party application, there is an option within the app itself to remove its icon from the menu bar.    <comment162418> Bartender is great. I really like the ability to automatically have an item made visible when the menu icon changes. For example, I have my Backup apps set to be hidden by Bartender, but when a backup is running it gets displayed in the main menu bar. <comment162419> Do you just want the icon hidden, or do you want the app removed from your system (or just prevent the app from loading)?
