Google Chrome tabs titles are not completely visible (cut) <body> Starting from yesterday I've a weird problem with Google Chrome on my iMac 5k with Yosemite (updated).  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/oocIu.png" alt="tab"  As you can see, the text is shifted down some pixel and the lower part is not visible.  Chrome is updated to the latest stable code43.0.2357.134 (64-bit)/code, I have already tried to restart Chrome and the iMac itself.  I have even Chrome Canary and on that version everything works correctly.br On my MacBook Pro with Chrome stable everything works.  How can I fix it?  <answer198416> The problem is related to the San Francisco font on Yosemite, remove it and it get fixed  <comment237441> How do you remove it and how do you also use that font on other documents e.g. Xcode <comment237729> You remove it like any other font in OS X. No need to explain.
