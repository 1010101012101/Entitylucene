Is there a way to decline Mountain Lion updates? <body> In particular, I receive update notifications for printer drivers where my current drivers work and I don't want to update them. I'd like to clear the updates from the store and stop receiving notifications about them.  <answer72551> You can hide them - right click on the listing in the App Store updates (or purchases) list. You can unhide them by logging in to your account.  <comment84274> Hiding purchases does not suppress the update notification. These updates also don't appear as purchases since they patch the OS and are updates and not purchases in the first place. <comment84276> right click on the listing in the App Store updates... list <comment84314> Yeah thanks for the suggestion, which I have done, but as @bmike said, the problem is that next time around these keep popping up. Any other thoughts?
