Which carriers support iOS 10's voicemail transcription? <body> I'm curious because I don't see any text under my voicemails when I tap on them, but I've seen videos of that being what you do, and I've read that it doesn't require any activation. I don't see why it would be limited to the iPhone 6s, iPhone 6s Plus, or the iPhone SE (I have an iPhone 6). I've narrowed it down to my carrier (AT&amp;T).  Is there a place where I can see if my carrier supports voicemail transcription?  Thanks in advance!  <answer251025> Voicemail transcription (beta) is available on iPhone 6s, iPhone 6s Plus, and iPhone SE with Siri language set to English (United States or Canada).  <comment310156> I don't know what phone you have or what carrier you're using, so for the sake of discussion, I looked up my own. My iPhone 6 Plus 16Gb is not capable of "Voicemail to Text" with Sprint. They said it was a hardware/software issue, not a carrier issue. <comment311993> Just to clarify, this means *only* on the 6s, 6s Plus, and SE, right?
