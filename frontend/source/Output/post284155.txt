Convert AA to MP3 <body> I bought an audio book from audible and want to convert it to mp3 from aa because my phone doesn't support the format. Is there any way to do that?  <answer284158> Use FFMPEG.  From their manual:       Audible AAX files are encrypted M4B files, and they can be decrypted   by specifying a 4 byte activation secret.   precodeffmpeg -activation_bytes 1CEB00DA -i input.aax -vn -c:a copy output.mp3 /code/pre  Since the file is encrypted, you will need the activation secret in order to decrypt and convert.
