How to recover a deleted book in iBooks? <body> I deleted accidentally a book that I was reading and it already automagically synced to my iPhone as well.  It was a downloaded ePub. I added notes and bookmarks there.   Now that's gone. Is there any hope to get it back somehow?  I don't see anything like emRecently deleted/em in iBooks.  Maybe we can get it from some kind of iPhone backups? In that case, I don't think my recent notes will be still there...  <answer261113> Any deleted book will automatically be added to your Recently Deleted bookshelf and can be retrieved for 2 weeks (after which it will be permanently deleted and you can't find it there).   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8F1Jd.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Luckily, iBooks saves your bookmarks, notes, and current page information with your Apple ID account, so theyâ€™re always up to date and you can read a book seamlessly across multiple iOS devices.  Just check the book on other devices or re-download it to see if the notes and bookmarks sync back.  <answer282059> Happily, it seems that by readding the eBook file in the iBooks, the notes and bookmarks are back.  I had to redownload the eBook and open it in iBooks.  <comment326976> Where is the *Recently Deleted* bookshelf? <comment327145> Tap All Books  Recently Deleted  tap the + icon to restore a book. <comment327158> Unfortunately, you just copied a snipped and an image from [this page](http://support.redjumper.net/hc/en-us/articles/201908131-How-to-retrieve-a-deleted-book). They talk about their app there, not about iBooks.
