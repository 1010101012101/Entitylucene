Preview: Unable to print as a pdf file <body> In preview tool, when i try to Print, then in the pop up, select PDF at the bottom left, the generated pdf is almost empty. The same thing in firefox pops-up: "An error occurred while printing". Chrome works fine. They were all working 10 days ago. I don’t remember doing anything after that, which could’ve caused this issue. I installed all updates, tried many workarounds suggested on the Internet for related problems, but nothing helped. Export from preview is also not working correctly – it just exports the first page even if I select all.  Did anyone encounter this issue? Any insights or solutions will be gratefully appreciated.
