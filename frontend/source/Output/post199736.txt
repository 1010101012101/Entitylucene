Apple Watch - Passbook "location aware" notification keeps appearing <body> Ever since I went to a Starbucks and paid with the Passbook app, I keep getting (what I assume is) a location aware notification to use my Starbucks passbook app.  The trouble is that I keep getting this notification (for this particular store) whether I am actually near it or not! It's getting a bit annoying as I keep thinking I have a notification when I actually haven't. I will clear it, and after 10 minutes or so, it's back again! I am wondering if this is could also having a negative impact on battery life (I haven't noticed this though).  Any ideas on how I can stop it doing this? Thanks.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mMPAI.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer199781> Go into the Apple Watch companion app on your iPhone, then go to Notifications-Passbook &amp; Apple Pay and check "Custom", and then a "Show Alerts" switch will appear. Switch it off and you shouldn't be able to receive any more notifications for Passbook on your Apple Watch.  <answer200046> The embarrassingly simple solution to the issue turned out to be a reboot :-|   <comment240758> Thanks for the suggestion. That should work... but for some reason it isn't!  That notification is still popping up every 10 minutes. Maybe a watchOS bug? I think it's finally time for me to restart my watch. See if that does the trick. <comment240800> That's strange. Try going into Settings-Notifications-Passbook and then switch Allow Notifications to off.
