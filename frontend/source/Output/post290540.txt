iBooks on iOS no longer imports non-English .epub <body> Is it possible that after some update iBooks app on iOS (both my iPhone and iPad behave the same) can no longer import non-English code.epub/code files?  I have several ebooks in Czech and recently noticed that one of them disappeared from my iBooks library â€“ while trying to re-open it again from Dropbox, iBooks just stalls and does nothing. English ebooks I have in the very same Dropbox directory work as they always did.  Some advice someone? (iOS 9.3.5, latest available on both devices)  <comment366741> Just after posting I got an idea to rename just `.epub` file and it doesn't work either. Size of ebook also doesn't matter (much larger English ebook opens while small Czech one doesn't). <comment366873> Well, after I found [E-books disappeared after iOS 9.3](https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/e-books-disappeared-after-ios-9-3.1962754/), tried several restarts (and closing iBooks off, moving `.epub` into different location etc.) but it also doesn't work. <comment369448> Well, it really looks like it just doesn't work. I get up old Mac with iTunes paired with iPad and transfer over iTunes works perfectly. Opening from within another app is broken, though. Sigh.
