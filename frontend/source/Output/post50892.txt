Developer setup install script, with Homebrew & Dropbox? <body> Installing development tools is not too hard these days, with the likes of Homebrew - http://brew.sh ... So I thought I would try to write a script with the homebrew installation and various tools, which I could use whenever I set up a new Mac.  Some people have already done something like this, see some examples here: http://www.justinball.com/2011/12/03/script-your-development-environment-setup-on-your-new-mac/  But before I do this, I had another thought. Could I simply install, via Homebrew to a folder within my Dropbox... and then when I start using a new Mac, just install Dropbox on it and point my .zshrc  script to the folder .. to get the exact same developer environment?  <answer50910> Why not simply use codegit/code (and github or bitbucket)? I think that should work better for synchronizing/saving the dotfiles. See google and various blogposts for detailed instructions, or search github directly (1), (2).
