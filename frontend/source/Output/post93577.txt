How to change iTunes metadata on PC? <body> I'm looking for a windows compatible program that will change iTunes metadata. I'm interested in changing tags that iTunes doesn't let me change, such as making a little HD flag appear next to the film and changing the media kind with all options.   All the programs are for Mac only, but the functionality I seek is something like Subler for PC.  <comment109830> Have you tried changing the info of the song/movie in iTunes by using `Ctrl` + `i` ? <comment109834> Yeah, I'm looking for something that will change metadata iTunes won't let me change. <comment110078> Anyone? Please?
