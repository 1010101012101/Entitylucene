Web Inspector crashes on Safari 7 <body> On a particular internal site, whenever I open the Web Inspector in Safari 7, it immediately hangs and then the whole tab crashes. When I close the crashed tab, I then get this message in the Console:  precode1/22/14 10:54:27.896 AM com.apple.launchd[1]: (com.apple.WebKit.WebContent.D50214F7-A6C9-46E5-8F06-71C873A2D4B8[96246]) Exited with code: 1 /code/pre  Unfortunately, I can't share a link or code for the site itself since it's internal, but here are some additional details:  ul liThis happens on three different machines running Safari 7 on OS X Mavericks/li liIt persists even if I quit and relaunch Safari 7/li liIt does emnot/em happen when I use the inspectors in any other browsers, including Safari 6 (on OS X Lion)/li liIt does emnot/em happen when I use Safari 7's Web Inspector on other sites/li liIf I inspect the site in a different browser (e.g. Firefox), there are no reported errors/li /ul  I did find this question which sounds like it describes the same problem, but there are no other details and the solution there doesn't work for me, hence why I'm posting this as a new question.  hr  UPDATE: Another potential piece of the puzzle – the Web Inspector crashes only when I'm viewing the site off the server, emnot/em locally.  I initially thought this was because I'm referencing Pingdom and Google Analytics with protocol-agnostic URLs (which don't resolve locally, so they don't load), e.g.:  precode//www.google-analytics.com... /code/pre  So that made me think something in one of those scripts was causing the crash, which would explain why it only occurred on the hosted page (where the paths resolve). But no dice: even if I prefix those URLs with codehttp:///code, the Web Inspector won't crash when I'm viewing the page locally, only off the server.  <answer118584> I have just fixed precisely the same problem on a site. Its annoying when a debugger chokes so it can't help you find the problem!  My problem was caused by a stray class making its way into a style.  precode&lt;div style="background: #ffb380; padding-bottom:30px; width:300px; text-center;"&gt; /code/pre  Removing the text-center fixed the problem and web-inspector loads correctly.  I would expect you also have an error in the page that is causing web-inspector to choke. Two approaches I can recommend:  ol liAn online error checker e.g. http://www.onlinewebcheck.com//li liTrack down the issue by removing content from the page until web-inspector loads./li /ol  <answer119396> The crash should produce a crash log. Since each Web Content is running in its own process. Open strong/Applications/Utilities/Console.app/strong and type WebContent. this should show you a crash report:     30/01/2014 21:39:20.697 ReportCrash[4191]: Saved crash report for   com.apple.WebKit.WebContent[331] version 9537 (9537.73.11) to   /Users/UserName/Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports/com.apple.WebKit.WebContent_2014-01-30-213920-1_My-Mac.crash   There will also be a button: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/UYZhD.png" alt="enter image description here" which you can click to get more detail.   in it you will see lines like:  precodeCrashed Thread:  18  Dispatch queue: CA::CG::Queue  Exception Type:  EXC_CRASH (SIGABRT) Exception Codes: 0x0000000000000000, 0x0000000000000000  Application Specific Information: abort() called /code/pre  Post this section and the thread it says it crashed on. my example is thread strong18/strong  There will be two entries for the thread.

My CSS has one "error," which is really just because I'm using a `-webkit-` prefix in one particular selector. And again, the Web Inspector doesn't crash when I'm inspecting the page locally... <comment138712> If your server/local pages use different js/html or execute slightly different that could explain it. I would  incrementally remove content from the page to discover the cause. <comment138737> See my update – the only difference between local/server was that the local version had two scripts that weren't actually loading, so I thought those were the culprit. However, even if I do load them locally, I don't get the crash. <comment139309> Hm...the tab doesn't actually seem to produce a crash log. I don't see anything in Console.app that refers to WebContent until *after* I manually close the crashed tab, which then produces the message I quoted in my question. <comment139310> Ok it was worth a punt. If you have the web inspect open for another page and then go to that Url what happens. Or if you are in console view of the web inspector.. <comment139319> If I do that, the whole thing hangs before anything finishes loading, so the Web Inspector's console doesn't have a chance to display any messages. I also noticed that none of the "Safari Web Content" processes in Activity Monitor are shown having crashed, so I guess that's why there's no crash log? <comment139388> Have you actually tried locating the issue by removing page content yet? IMHO its the only way you are going to resolve it.
