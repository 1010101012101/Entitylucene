What is causing Safari 9.1.3 to spontaneously reset cookies and browser history? <body> As of a few weeks ago on my primary machine, something seems to reset Safari browser history and cookies. Websites that I visited the day before aren't suggested or auto-completed any more, the history only goes back a day and I have to reauthenticate in Google with the iOS app.   I have a few extensions including Instapaper and Ghostery, but have had those for 9+ months and this started a few weeks ago. Is this a Safari bug, macOS issue or a sign of something malicious?  Update: I just shut down the machine, reset SMC (for another problem) and now my history is gone again. Is there a setting for resetting cookies on OS restart?
