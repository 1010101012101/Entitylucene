iSpazz 64-bit problem? <body> So there is this iTunes Plugin I wanna install called iSpazz that makes your keyboard backlight flash to the music from iTunes I dragged the file that I downloaded into the iTunes plugin folder and iTunes doesn't load up because the plugin is designated for 32-bit versions of iTunes so I right click on the iTunes app and set it so that it runs on 32-bit mode. It doesn't let me open iTunes and gives me this error img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/TUOUm.png" alt="error message"     iTunes 12.1.0.50      MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Mid 2014) 2.6 GHz Intel Core i5 8 GB 1600 MHz DDR3 Intel Iris 1536 MB   <answer170994> In short, you're stuck.  iTunes will only run in 64-bit mode Since v11 on Mavericks.  That plugin is from 2007, before 64-bit iTunes was even thought of.  Ne'er the twain shall meet, unfortunately.  <comment201113> What version of OSX? <comment285768> one of it is you need to download the older version of ITUNES. but i wont do that just for backlit because the older version is sucks and confuse to use if you have the El Capitan or latest version of Mac
