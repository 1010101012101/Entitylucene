Is it possible to deactivate the autocorrect feature just for a physical keyboard in an iPad? <body> I have an iPad with iOS 9.2 and a physical keyboard. I use the autocorrect feature when I write using the iPad directly but I deactivate it for the physical keyboard.  So far, I have to activate or deactivate this option everytime that I use the physical keyboard.  Is there any way to automatize this and make the iPad activate or deactivate the autocorrect feature depending on the keyboard used?
