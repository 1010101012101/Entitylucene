Is it a risk to keep ios 6 on iPhone 4? <body> After recently found risk for ios 7 device and releasing an update to resolve it, is it a risk to keep ios 6 on iPhone 4?  <answer122828> Since there is a known vulnerability and Apple won't let you update your iPhone 4 to 6.1.6 (yet) It is impossible to say there is no risk.   So yes there are some risk.   <answer122838> strongYes,/strong there is a risk because you're using unsupported software which is never recommended. That's the reason why Apple gave out iOS 6.1.6  One of them is strongthe SSL leak/strong which is fixed in iOS 7.0.6 and iOS 6.1.6   However, you can also install the SSL-fix by Jailbreaking your device (if you did not do this yet). You can use this guide.  emSidenote: If you have an iPhone 4 and not a 4s, as stated in your question I'd use the Jailbreak Fix. iOS 7 killed my iPhone 4. It's too slow./em  <comment143361> I can't give you a full answer, but yes, it is. <comment143362> "Is it a risk to run out dated software that's no longer really supported" ... well ...
