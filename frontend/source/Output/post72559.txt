What is the difference between the iPad Mini model numbers A1454 and A1455? <body> Apple lists the iPad mini models on the Identifying iPad models web page and lists two cellular models:  ul liA1454 on the iPad mini Wi-Fi + Cellular/li liA1455 on the iPad mini Wi-Fi + Cellular (MM)/li /ul  I can't seem to find a mapping between these models and the iPads for sale by Apple since they list the intended carrier and a different part number like MD534LL/A. Apple has a nice LTE page for iPhones, but I can't find the iPad page.  In the US, the Black 16 GB iPad Mini (2012) has the following parts for our three cellular carriers:  ul liAT&amp;T - MD534LL/A/li liSprint - ME215LL/A/li liVerizon - MD540LL/A/li /ul  None of the Apple LTE articles seem to be updated yet for the 4th Generation iPad with LTE or the iPad Mini with LTE so I'm stumped at the moment. What is the difference between the strongCellular A1454/strong model and the strongCellular (MM) A1455/strong model?  <answer72560> The comparable page you're looking for is: http://www.apple.com/ipad/LTE/. A1454 is used for AT&amp;T and similar Canadian networks only, while Sprint, Verizon and overseas carriers use A1455.  All bands are also listed on the specs page:  ul liModel A1454 ul liGSM/EDGE (850, 900, 1800, 1900 MHz)/li liUMTS/HSPA+/DC-HSDPA (850, 900, 1900, 2100 MHz)/li liLTE (Bands 4 and 17)/li /ul/li liModel A1455 ul liCDMA EV-DO Rev. A and Rev. B (800, 1900, 2100 MHz)/li liGSM/EDGE (850, 900, 1800, 1900 MHz)/li liUMTS/HSPA+/DC-HSDPA (850, 900, 1900, 2100 MHz) /li liLTE (Bands 1, 3, 5, 13, 25)/li /ul/li /ul  <answer72561> It looks like I just didn't look hard enough.  http://www.apple.com/ipad/LTE/ has all the goods on the model numbers.  The iPad mini strongCellular A1454/strong Model supports LTE bands 4 (AWS) and 17 (700b MHz). The carriers listed for this Model are AT&amp;T in the US and all Canadian carriers (Bell, Rogers, Telus).  The iPad mini strongCellular A1455/strong Model supports LTE bands 1 (2100 MHz), 3 (1800 MHz), 5 (850 MHz), 13 (700c MHz), and 25 (1900 MHz). This model is for Sprint and Verizon in the US as well as all other countries around the globe.  <comment84260> And I have absolutely no idea what MM stands for. <comment84261> I'll see if I can get an answer on MM - thanks for the assist - it looks like you pressed "answer" about 50 seconds before I had my answer composed. :)
