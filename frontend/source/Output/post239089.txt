Read specific file in Time Capsule from someone else's computer <body> I recently lost my macbook, and fortunately I have all my backups in a Time Capsule. At the moment I only have an old window PC, and a friend who has a macbook.    The question is: how do we recover the files on the Time Capsule thanks to the macbook in order to copy them into my old PC ?  We tried to navigate to the data on the TimeCapsule (i.e. code/Volumes/Data/my-computer.sparsebundle/code) we see the codebands/code folder that seems to contain the data, but we are not able to see its contents with the codeFinder/code. Is there any way to do something like "mount" the codemy-computer.sparsebundle/code in order to navigate into it ?   We connected to the Time Capsule with Wi-Fi, and  my friend runs on a macbook with OS X 10.11.4.  <answer239092> Head into Finder. On the same Wifi network as your Time Capsule, scroll down to the "Shared" section in Finder's left sidebar. There will be an icon of a Time Capsule with the name of your Time Capsule next to it. Click it, and you should be able to easily navigate through (just keep double-clicking on the relevant things) to your files.  <answer239111> I finally got the answer to my problem from the Apple Technical support. A double click on the file codemy-computer.sparsebundle/code should mount the Time Capsule as a Time Machine virtual disk. It didn't work in my case. The guy from the Apple support just told me to reboot the Time Capsule. It worked.
