Boot Camp Assistant not opening <body> I am using OS X Yosemite on a computer with an Intel processor.  After installation when I want to open "Boot Camp Assistant" it says "You must upgrade your computer's Boot ROM firmware before using this setup assistant"  How to solve this?  <comment366401> Voting to close as this isn't a programming question. Ask general Apple questions on the Apple site. <comment366417> All Macs running Yosemite are Intel based. Do you run Yosemite on a hackintosh? <comment366445> Hi Shadman, welcome to Ask Different! :) In addition to the question by @klanomath, if you're not using a hackintosh can you please [edit](https://apple.stackexchange.com/posts/290260/edit)  your question to specify the exact model of Mac you're using?
