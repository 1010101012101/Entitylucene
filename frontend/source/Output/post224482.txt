AppleScript Automator back-compatibility <body> I made a little, easy AppleScript and used Automator to launch it on click:  precodetell application "Terminal" do script "myScript" end tell /code/pre  What about back-compatibility? Can I run it on every previous Mac OS X? Will it work?  <comment272240> Here's Apple page from 2007 using `do shell script` command: https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/AppleScript/Conceptual/AppleScriptX/Concepts/work_with_as.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001568-BABEBGCF So I think it will work in the previous OS X ;) <comment272241> Ok, but in 2007 there was Automator? <comment272242> https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automator_(software) 2005 <comment272243> From https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automator_(software) first release was 2005, but I would never assume compatibility for any process on any OS older than 10.7 <comment272244> 10.7 would be absolutely fine <comment272245> Then it's more down to what is in the terminal script. For instance, something as seemingly simple as flushing the DNS cache needs different commands depending on OS - see http://osxdaily.com/2014/11/20/flush-dns-cache-mac-os-x/ <comment272247> Oh, wow, thanks!
