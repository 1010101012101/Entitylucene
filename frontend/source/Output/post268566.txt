Removing @cloud.com and @me.com email account, not Apple ID <body> I would like to get rid off @cloud.com and @me.com email addresses. I do not use them as my Apple ID, my primary email is Gmail address. I am not able to remove those two aliases only add more.   On icloud.com, I cannot delete those accounts as well.  I would like to use my Apple ID with my Gmail address only.  If I created new Apple ID now with Gmail (or any other non-Apple address), @cloud.com and @me.com wouldn't be created. But I do not want new Apple ID, I want my old one without those two Apple addresses.  PS: The problem in How do I remove or delete an @me.com email? is similar but not the same. So I'm looking for alternative solutions (in case they exist)
