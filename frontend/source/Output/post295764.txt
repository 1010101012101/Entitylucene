How to play videos using original dimensions on iPad? <body> I have a number of mp4 videos with poor resolution and/or small dimensions (dimensions: 320 x 240) that I wish to play on my iPad (running iOS 10.3.3).  When viewing the videos that have small dimensions in iCloud Drive, the video player in iCloud Drive makes the videos full screen, which makes the videos very blurry. How can I play the videos in their original dimensions instead of full screen?  <comment373541> What version of iOS are you running? And, are you using a particular video player app? <comment373542> @Monomeeth Edited the question. Added iOS version (10.3.3) and the video player software used (iCloud Drive).
