Clear CRL / OCSP cache for SSL on iOS <body> strongIs there a way to force clear CRL / OSCP cache on iOS?/strong I had a few websites (app.streamable.com, www.buzzfeed.com, etc.) failing on my iOS device since last month's GlobalSign revocation screw-up. I thought the issue would resolve itself after a few days/weeks, but it continues to result in     Safari cannot open the page.      The error was: "The certificate for this server is invalid. You might be connecting to a server that is connecting to a server that is pretending to be "..." which could put your confidential information at risk.".   Now, for similar issues, either a popup appears and I can confirm a security exception (but no such popup appears in this case) or I can manually download the certificate to accept into Profiles, but it continues to show "Not verified" even if I add the certificate manually.  The certificate in question is "GlobalSign CloudSSL CA - SHA256 - G3", with the serial  Serial #: ‎‎46:f0:8c:db:cf:2c:54:66:ef:33:01:dd:5f:34, which seems to be fine on other devices.  There have been related questions asking about clearing SSL exceptions on iOS (How do you remove SSL certificate exceptions on iOS?), which seems to be impossible without resetting all settings on the device, which isn't ideal. On OS X, the cache is cleared with (codesudo rm /var/db/crls/*cache.db/code and codecrlrefresh rp/code) and you also have the option of deleting and reinstating certificates through Keychain Access, but I can't find a way to do this on iOS.  strongOther notes:/strong Not sure if it's directly related, but on the iOS reference guide (apple.com/deployment/ios/#/apda0e3426d7), it says     The OCSP response is cached on the device for the period of time specified by the OCSP server—currently, between three and seven days. The validity of the certificate isn’t checked again until the device has restarted and the cached response has expired.    It's been far longer than 3-7 days at this point and I'm getting the same certificate failure.  ul liVisiting the same websites on iOS Chrome shows "NET::ERR_CERT_INVALID"./li liI tried setting the date/time to be automatic multiple times, that is not the issue here/li /ul
