I get a bash syntax error message every time I open Terminal <body> I've been getting this error for the past couple of months and I wonder if it's a major issue, and how do I fix it?  When I open terminal on my Mac I get this bash error:  precode~bash: /Users/admin/.bash_profile: line 1: syntax error near unexpected token 'fi' ~bash: /Users/admin/.bash_profile:line 1: 'if which rbenv &gt; /dev/null; than eval "$(rbenv init -)"; fi' /code/pre  Anybody know what's going on?  <answer198558> Open the Terminal.app and type the following line at your prompt  precodesed -i '' 's/than/then/' .bash_profile /code/pre  You do have a .bash_profile in your home directory.  <answer198585> To add a little information to fd0's terse answer.  First, you do indeed have a file code.bash_profile/code in admin's home folder - you just can't see it as all files with a name that starts code./code are invisible. In the Terminal type codels -A/code and you will see them all.  Second, your problem is that something or someone has added a line to the file containing a syntax error. The codethan/code should be codethen/code as it is part of an if-then statement. Open the file in your favourite text editor (if you don't have one then newcomers seem to find codenano/code usable so codenano .bash_profile/code in Terminal should do it) and change the line.  <comment237615> Well, that "than" should probably be "then" but I'm not really a scripting expert.  (Are you logging in to the "admin" account or is something else referencing the admin profile?) <comment237616> Login as `admin` and start `TextEdit`. Open `.bash_profile` and correct the typo. <comment237617> There isn't a .bash_profile file in admin? <comment237698> Thank you for this. I think this did the trick! <comment238400> @dmsquare please mark this as the accepted answer if you are satisfied with it.
