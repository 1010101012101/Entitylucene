Install jdk 8 without admin privileges <body> Is there a way to install or run jdk 8 without admin privileges? I would like to compile a java project I have that requires jdk 8 on a computer that has only jdk 6 installed. I am not an administrator on the computer.  <answer179805> No, you will need admin rights to install that where it would be able to be used in the way you need it to be.  <answer217217> You can use Pacifist to view the contents of the JDK installer package. You can use it to extract the files to your user library folder code~/Library/code instead of the system wide code/Library/code.  The relevant subfolders in codeLibrary/code are codeInternet Plug-Ins/code, codeJava/code, and an alias in codePreferencePanes/code.  See this screenshot for the path structure.  img src="https://i.imgur.com/j3CUUhP.png" alt="Imgur"  Moving the files can be done manually or by modifying the installer package.   <comment213302> did you check this out ? http://stackoverflow.com/a/24204430 <comment213336> @Buscarì›ƒ Just did [here](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/server-jre8-downloads-2133154.html) and there is no mac version. <comment213347> and this ?  https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/install/mac_jre.html#CHDGECEB <comment213367> It says it can't be installed for a single user and needs administrator privileges.
