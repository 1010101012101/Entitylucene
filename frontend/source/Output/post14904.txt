Address bar in Safari gone! <body> The address bar in my safari broswer has disappeared... I have quit my safari browser and reopened it, but the problem persists. This is what it looks like img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ibQHo.png" alt="My Safari" I have no idea why this is happening, but i use safari as my main browser so it has all my bookmarks, etc so i can't really just stop using it. Please help, thanks.  <answer14905> Right click in the empty area  "Customize Toolbar"  drag the address bar back up.  You probably accidentally command-dragged it out.  <answer60434> With the introduction of Safari 6.0, the command key sequence changed for this from kbdcommand/kbd + kbdshift/kbd + kbd | /kbd to kbdcommand/kbd + kbdoption/kbd + kbdT/kbd.  It's also the first item under the view menu, 'Show Toolbar' or 'Hide Toolbar.'  edit: in Safari 7.0 and OS X 10.9, this feature is still available through View  Hide Toolbar or View  Show Toolbar, however there is no command key sequence.  <comment16052> oh... thanks... <comment16053> @luca590 if this answered your question, click the "checkmark" icon by my answer to mark it as correct. :) <comment16088> oh yeah sorry about that, i had clicked it but then it told me to wait for a minuet so i went to do something else and must have forgot about it :p. my bad <comment125366> I did this on a computer and it didn't stick until the computer was ALSO rebooted. You may even have to run maintenance scripts/clear caches etc.
