How to get current input language of the input source <body> I use a third-party input source on Mac. This is the case I encounter:  ol liI input some English characters when I want to input Chinese so I have to delete the characters entered just now. Then switch to Chinese and type again./li liIf I know what is the current input language, so I can switch the input language first./li liThe input source can't display current input language but I have press kbdShift/kbd to switch between Chinese and English to see whether the current language is what I want./li liAfter some research, I find this repo bitbar. This repo can display some script output at the menubar. So I want some script to get the current input language of the input source./li liI also find this question, however this question is different from mine. It just find the input source name, not the input language./li /ol  After Googling for a long time, I didn't find a way to do this. Any one can help me? Thank you so much.  <answer251731> One possible work-around is to configure the input source so that Caps Lock is used to switch to English.  Then you can tell the IM is in that state by the green light on the keyboard (if it has one for capslock).  <comment312893> Where did you get this 3rd party input source which does both Chinese and English?  It seems like any solution which have to be something which recognizes what state it is in.  Presumably Keyboard Viewer would tell you that, but having that on the screen is probably not ideal... <comment312894> @TomGewecke Thanks for you reply. It is [RIME](http://rime.im/). Every Chinese input source can switch between English and Chinese with the same Keyboard layout. This input method I configure the shortcut kbdShift/kbd to switch between English and Chinese. The Keyboard Viewer won't tell me which state I am in. <comment312924> With the Apple IM’s, don’t you need to do capslock to type English? In that case it can be seen from the green light on the keyboard and the shading on Keyboard Viewer.  Can you configure RIME to use capslock the same way? <comment312936> @TomGewecke Yeah. This is a workaround and it works. Thank you so much. ;-)
