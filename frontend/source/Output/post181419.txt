Macbook shuts down if key combination used when booting <body> My MacBook first stayed a long time displaying the apple logo with the twirling "you roll we wait" icon that appears below that logo. I left it to find it DID boot to the usual desktop after God know how much time.  While I'm typing something harmless (some html code), it hanged with the colored beach ball. Mouse moved though.  On reboot, now I get a white screen - no logo or anything - and tried leaving it. After some time, now I get the blinking question mark folder. I read dozens of pages after google searches, and while trying the key combinations suggested everywhere , the computer just shuts down AFTER the chimes. I was hoping for a D/command D/control D to work. It will just shut down. Happens with command V and pretty much everything I try. The only thing that emseems/em to work is the command/option/p/r combination, because now it reboots always with the chime, always white screen. Help please :)  <comment215773> How old is the MacBook? It sounds like a problem with the MLB (main logic board) so you would need to run a hardware test. <comment215776> Exactly what I've been trying. D or command D after the chimes just turns the computer abruptly off. It's been with me for 1.5 years, but I got it second hand. The DVD that came with it says "OS 10.6", and has a "2009" written somewhere, but I'm not sure that date would reflect the age... me not much a Mac guy :) <comment215809> Well in the first boot attempt it was trying to fix your disk. Since that was interrupted it did not finish. Now the disk is fired. <comment215835> Thank you for your patience :) that was my impression too, up to the moment I tried the C key to boot from DVD. Inserting a DVD and trying C gives me the following: Some cd reading noise, then the DVD gets ejected. Actually whether I press or not C, the DVD gets ejected after some seconds. (Did you mean 'fired' or 'fried? :)
