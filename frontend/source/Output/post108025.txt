Is it possible to use FileMerge as standalone app? <body> I'm wondering if there is a way to use FileMerge as a standalone tool. I don't want to install Xcode, since I don't need it. I just want the FileMerge app. Is that possible?  <answer108026> Yes, this is possible.  Open your Finder and search for XCode.app. Right click and then "Show Package Contents". You'll find a folder called "Applications". Now drag File Merge out of it and you can delete Xcode.  <answer108042> FileMerge 2.8, which ships with Xcode 5.0.1 links to frameworks that are located inside of the Xcode.app bundle. Shared libraries that are used by FileMerge can be displayed by performing the command:  precodeotool -L /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Applications/FileMerge.app/Contents/MacOS/FileMerge /code/pre  The output of this command indicates that FileMerge needs to use the DevToolsInterface, DevToolsCore, and DevToolsFoundation frameworks. :  precode/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Applications/FileMerge.app/Contents/MacOS/FileMerge:     /System/Library/Frameworks/AppKit.framework/Versions/C/AppKit (compatibility version 45.0.0, current version 1247.0.0)     /System/Library/Frameworks/Foundation.framework/Versions/C/Foundation (compatibility version 300.0.0, current version 1052.0.0)     @rpath/DevToolsInterface.framework/Versions/A/DevToolsInterface (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 3000.1.0)     @rpath/DevToolsCore.framework/Versions/A/DevToolsCore (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 2404.0.0)     @rpath/DevToolsFoundation.framework/Versions/A/DevToolsFoundation (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 3001.0.0)     /usr/lib/libobjc.A.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 228.0.0)     /usr/lib/libSystem.B.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 1197.1.1)     /System/Library/Frameworks/CoreFoundation.framework/Versions/A/CoreFoundation (compatibility version 150.0.0, current version 852.0.0) /code/pre  The prefix code@rpath/code indicates that codedyld/code will use the run path list to search for frameworks that are being referenced. Specifically, FileMerge contains code"../OtherFrameworks"/code in its run path list. When located inside of the Xcode.app bundle, those frameworks are right where FileMerge expects them to be.  However, if you copy FileMerge out of the Xcode.app bundle, FileMerge will crash upon launch. This occurs because the referenced frameworks (referenced above) are not in the run path list, which causes codedyld/code to exit with an error of code"image not found"/code. The reason it cannot find those referenced frameworks is that a folder at the relative path code"../OtherFrameworks"/code does not exist, and the frameworks do not exist in any other folders listed in the run path.  To use FileMerge without the Xcode app installed, you have a couple of options:  ol liCopy FileMerge to the location of your choosing, and copy the contents of code/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/OtherFrameworks//code to one of the folders referenced in the run path list (code~/Library/Frameworks/code or code/Library/Frameworks/code are probably a couple of the best choices)./li liCopy FileMerge to the location of your choosing, and copy the contents of code/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/OtherFrameworks//code to be at code"../OtherFrameworks"/code relative to the FileMerge app (e.g., if FileMerge is at code~/Applications/code, copy the folder code"OtherFrameworks"/code to code~/OtherFrameworks/code/li /ol  emstrongEdit/em/strong  The above answer allows FileMerge to launch, but the application will terminate when you actually attempt to compare files. Apparently the application is looking for platform information at the path code../Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Info.plist/code. This means that it is necessary to copy codeInfo.plist/code from code/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Info.plist/code to code../Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Info.plist/code (relative to FileMerge.app). Here are some steps that could be used to copy FileMerge to a folder at code~/Applications/code:  precodemkdir ~/Applications cp -R /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Applications/FileMerge.app ~/Applications  cp -R /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/OtherFrameworks/* ~/Library/Frameworks  mkdir -p ~/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform cp /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Info.plist ~/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform /code/pre  <comment193473> Copying `Info.plist` don't work with XCode 6.1.1 and FileMerge 2.8 in my case â€” still getting this error:  `FileMerge[12429:1615479] [MT] ASSERTION FAILURE in /SourceCache/DevToolsBase/DevToolsBase-6000/pbxcore /SpecificationTypes/XCPlatformSpecification.m:438`  `Details:  The Mac OS X platform is missing - cannot set a default platform.`  `Object:   XCPlatformSpecification`  `Method:   +loadAllPlatforms`  `Thread:   NSThread: 0x7fe4597135f0{number = 1, name = main}`  Moving away this file from original FileMerge causes identical error. File owner and rights identical.
