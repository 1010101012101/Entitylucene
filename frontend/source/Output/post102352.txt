Command-line cloud file backup? <body> Is there a free cloud file server for personal files with shell commands like Unix codels/code, codecp/code etc. ? Along the lines  precodecloud ls [-options] pattern cloud cp-up pattern cloud cp-down pattern /code/pre  My ideal would be code/Volumes/cloud/code; then I could use emall/em Unix commands in scripts, Makefiles ... (which I'm used to: emwaaay/em simpler and more comfortable than clicking through GUIs.)  <comment120532> Are you talking about something like a WebDAV service.? <comment120543> Are you looking only for free services or would paid services also do? <comment123456> @markhunte, thanks; is there a cloud file server that supports (command-line) WebDAV ?
