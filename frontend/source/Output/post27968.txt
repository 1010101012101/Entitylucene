How do I set a persistent background image for a USB drive? <body> I'm trying to change the folder background image on a USB flash drive, using the View Options panel. However, when I eject and re-insert the drive, these settings (as well as icon positions, etc.) aren't saved. In fact it doesn't look like Finder is even creating a code.DS_Store/code file. How can I make this work?  <comment32053> Do you have a utility that deletes .DS_Store files from external HDD/USB? <comment32075> Nope. Also, the same seems to be happening for regular folders on my startup disk â€” the settings don't stick. <comment32152> What result do you get in terminal when you type: **defaults read com.apple.desktopservices** <comment32293> @ioi: "Domain com.apple.desktopservices does not exist" <comment32325> Try typing this in terminal now: **com.apple.desktopservices DSDontWriteNetworkStores false** then logout/login - then run the original command again and see what the output is. If you're running anything such as TotalFinder you need to exit that first.
