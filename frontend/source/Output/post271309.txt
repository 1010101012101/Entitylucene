I accidentally messed up on first creating my Apple ID <body> When I first created my Apple ID, I messed up on the email and had to use a different one. I'm guessing the one I created accidentally became the orignal one. After an update, my iPad mini asked for an activation code for the Apple ID I messed up on and I don't have the password at all...HELP!  <comment341083> start at https://iforgot.apple.com
