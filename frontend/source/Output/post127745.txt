Is there a simple texteditor accessible from the menu bar for making fast snippets? <body> Do you know some solution or some clever way how to link some text editor to menu bar with an icon in the menu bar?

On the Mac, it includes a menu servlet that is a simple text box, which saves to your Evernote.   You don't need to host anything of course, and there is no need to ever visit the Evernote on the web. Its easy search, inline editing, and all your notes are stored in the Evernote app. Evernote sync's to local Evernote files on your Mac, and if you prefer, it can be local only, though I suspect the menu servlet does not sync with the local only files.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8SiUm.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <comment149648> http://www.sourcedrop.net/mac this somehow solves my problem even with some overkill that it is hosted on github gist. I dont know how many previous will be displayed in history.... <comment149653> Note that if you select some text there will be a action in the services menu to paste into a new note (or into a new Aquamacs buffer or similar for other editors) <comment149656> please provide links to this apps. <comment149657> @andi These applications are already installed on your system. They are not accessible via a menulet though. <comment149658> If you have a background in Objective-C you can create a menu bar item that simply opens any of the apps in "Buscar 웃"'s answer <comment149665> @patrix you are right, so I added information <comment149667> Now you got me curious: How do you turn any of them into a menulet? I assume the process is generic so maybe you can just describe it for one of the applications? <comment149675> @Arc676 I think Buscar deleted his answer... Anyway I think about few menubar apps as my free-time-development projects ;)
