Internal (Apple SSD) hard drive problem <body> I'm having terrible issues with my Mac since I tried to restore the entire system from a Time Machine backup, which ended up showing a "an error occurred while adding a recovery system to the destination disk" message. I restarted and held cmd+R and Internet Recovery started downloading (instead of booting to the recovery partition). After the download, the menu of OS X utilities appeared and I selected Disk Utility and then I erased the Macintosh HD.  Tried to restore from Time Machine again but the problem persists. I even tried to reinstall OS X: after downloading OS X Mavericks, I got "an error occurred while preparing installation".  Here you can see the results of codediskutil cs list/code and codediskutil list/code commands:  [img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/v1W4K.jpg" alt="Terminal diskutil list[1]"  As you can see, I have no CoreStorage Logical Volume Groups and I don't see the Recovery HD partition in disk0.  <answer227307> I do believe OS X Base System is the name of the mounted Recovery Partition image.  I would suggest completely erasing every last partition on your drive (except Recovery), recreating a Macintosh HD partition, and reinstalling OS X onto the newly partitioned Macintosh HD.  As for restoring your data, you can use Migration Assistant (code/Applications/Utilities/Migration Assistant.app/code) to restore data from the Time Machine backup after you get a working system, or better, use the "Enter Time Machine" functionality from the TM menubar dropdown.
