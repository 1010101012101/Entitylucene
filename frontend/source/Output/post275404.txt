Keyboard Viewer crashes when I use keyboard command <body> When I try to invoke the Emoji and Keyboard Viewer via the Keyboard shortcut (kbdCRTL/kbd + kbdCMD/kbd + kbdSPACEBAR/kbd), the menu bar icon crashes on me and the viewer does not invoke.  I tried removing the preference file codecom.apple.HIToolbox.plist/code as suggested in this Apple Forum answer. After restarting the keyboard viewer icon appears in my menu bar (American Flag). I can select items in the menu. As soon as I invoke the keyboard shortcut however it disappears:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8HP7V.png" alt="Broken Keyboard Viewer"  Do I have a corrupt preferences file somewhere?  I am running macOS Sierra V 10.12.3.  <answer275407> After further investigation I found my startup drive was corrupt and I needed to run Disk Utility. Steps I took:  ol liDelete codecom.apple.HIToolbox.plist/code from codeLibrary/Preferences//code folder./li liRestart machine./li liHold down kbdCTRL/kbd + kbdR/kbd to run Disk Utility from Recovery HD./li liSelected Disk Utility from Recovery HD menu./li liRan First Aid on my machine./li liOnce finished, I restarted./li /ol  After restart the issue went away.
