Looking for suggestions on scheduling iCloud Photo Library uploads <body> I have a 57GB photo library that I would like to keep in iCloud Photo library, the only problem is that my ISP absolutely murders my download speed whenever I'm uploading emanything/em.  Is there a way that I can schedule Photos to upload my library emonly/em during off-peak hours (rather than waking up at 2am, un-pausing the upload and then pausing it again at 7am manually).  I was thinking maybe a third party application like emLittle Snitch/em might work (I've never tried it) or something along those lines, maybe even some kind of Apple Script.  I'm a bit over my head with this so I need some help   <answer242808> It's a bit complex but here's a way.
