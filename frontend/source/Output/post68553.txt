Dual boot MacBook Air 2012 with Windows 7 - now boots directly into Windows <body> So I attempted to set up dual boot (Boot Camp) on my new MacBook Air (Mountain Lion) with Windows 7 and failed spectacularly in the process. The Mac just boots straight into Windows now. There's no boot menu and I can't seem to find a way to boot to Mac OS X.  Hoping someone here can help.  Here's how I got into this mess:  ul liCreated a bootable Windows 7 USB key with an x64 Windows 7 ISO using Windows USB/DVD download tool./li liRan Boot Camp on the Mac, unticking the option to create a bootable Windows disk./li liChose a partition size of 64 GB for the Windows partition./li liAt this point I think the Mac tried to reboot itself, but as I was typing in a browser window at the time I seem to have cancelled that by mistake. So (and this is where I think I went wrong), I manually rebooted with the Windows USB stick in the USB slot./li liThe Mac rebooted and the windows stick took over, and I chose to install to the 64GB partition I made in Boot Camp. /li liThis all went fine, but the Mac now boots straight into Windows, but seems to be missing drivers for lots of stuff, most importantly the wireless network card. /li /ul  I can't see any way to get back to Mac OS X.  I've subsequently read about a tool called rEFIt that I was perhaps supposed to run before Boot Camp, but I haven't done that to date.  Is there any way to trash the windows partition and get back to Mac OS?  <answer68554> Shut down your MacBook, then hold down kbdOption ‚å•/kbd key and turn it on. You will see a boot menu, choose OS X. When logged in into OS X, click System Preferences  Startup Disk, and choose which OS to start by default.  To set up Boot Camp drivers, download them via Boot Camp Assistant (WindowsSupport) folder, write the installers to a USB stick, and run from within Windows.  <answer69740> Install the free bootmanager REFit or one of its branches and everytime the computer boots (after the startup chime) a screen where you can choose which one to boot will show up avoiding this problem for good. (the option key method will still work)  <comment79622> Thanks a lot, this looks promising. Back into OS X and copying the windows drivers to USB now.
