Homebrew: Why is java not installed as a dependency for Tomcat? <body> codeJava/code is listed in Tomcat's dependency list. But when I install codetomcat/code there is no codejava/code. Why?  precode$brew install tomcat $brew list | grep java | wc -l 0 /code/pre  <answer273857> If Java was already installed previously (either the Oracle or the outdated Apple Java installer) Tomcat's requirements are met and brew won't install another Java.  The small green checkmark (or red cross if Java has to be installed) will indicate this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6NZDw.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment344246> Probably Java (Oracle/Apple) is already installed: check `brew config | grep Java`! <comment344255> @klanomath you are right. I'll accept the answer if you transform your comment.
