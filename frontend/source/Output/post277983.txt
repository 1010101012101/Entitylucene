I have a human friend whose name is Siri, so can I change iPhone's Siri to another name? <body> I have a friend who is named Siri (as Wikipedia says, the Scandinavian name had "high popularity in the 20th century"). Unfortunately, conversations often go like this:     Me: Hey Siri! How are you?      Siri (person): Great, how are —      Siri (digital assistant): Very well, thank you!   I know that I can turn off "Hey Siri" entirely, but I'd kind of like to keep it on if I can. Is there any way to change Siri's name to something else? I know that Amazon Echo has a similar thing where you can change the name from "Alexa" to "Amazon", and I would like to do the same thing for Siri.  Also, I sometimes use the button to activate Siri and out of habit speak commands like "Siri, what's the weather like?", even though I know that "Siri" is optional. I'd like a solution that would work with that as well (although changing "Hey Siri" is a bigger concern).  <comment349835> Nope. Siri is, for better or for worse, stuck as Siri. You can download the Alexa app to have Alexa as a personal assistant and just shut off "Hey Siri"—or even try Hound. <comment349889> One solution would be for your friend to change her name. <comment349998> @Phong Somehow I don't think she'll go for that.
