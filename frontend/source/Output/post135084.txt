Mirror number of unread mails in title bar <body> Is there a way to show the exact number of unread mails from the Mail.app icon also in the title bar? Note that this is not the same as showing the number of unread mails in inbox, since I can change the folder to something else like a smart mailbox.  (A script which outputs this number would also be okay; I could write a menu bar item around this myself.)  strongUpdate/strong: Alternatively, a script which outputs the number of unread mails for a user-definable emsmart mailbox/em is also okay. All example code I’ve seen so far only works for non-smart mailboxes.  <answer135087> You can obtain the number of unread items with the following AppleScript:  precodetell application "Mail" to get the count of messages of mailbox "INBOX" of account "Me" /code/pre  As you mentioned you could write a menu bar item, you could use this AppleScript for it.  Alternatively, you can do this with strongMail Unread Menu/strong.br However, I'm not sure if it works with Mavericks.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HI1hb.jpg" alt=""  <answer135361> Try this:  precodeset unreadNumber to 0 set i to 1 tell application "Mail" activate get message viewer 1's selected mailboxes repeat with thisBox in result     repeat until ((message number is i) exists) is false         if read status of (message number i of thisBox) is true then set unreadNumber to (unreadNumber + 1)         set i to i + 1     end repeat end repeat display dialog "You have " &amp; unreadNumber &amp; " unread messages." end tell /code/pre  <comment160090> Your script shows the number of messages in inbox not from the folder specified in Mail.app settings. <comment160091> @Debilski Yes, but the script can be modified—change `mailbox "INBOX"` to whatever you desire. <comment160092> Does not work for smart mailboxes or at least I did not have any luck with it. <comment160450> Not 100% sure what this does but it looks as if it takes quite some time for more than just a few messages. Also, it seems to return the total number of unread messages (?) which is not what I need. <comment160466> To quote you: "a script which outputs the number of unread mails for a user-definable smart mailbox is also okay." Perhaps you need to make your question clearer.
