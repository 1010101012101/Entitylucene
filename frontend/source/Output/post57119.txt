How can I get admin access to a Mac without knowing the current password? <body> My Father died last year and I inherited his Mac Mini. My wife has retired and we are trying to set up the mini for her use but the changes we want to make require admin access and we do not have the information my father used to set up the machine.  Is it possible to reset the admin information without having the old information? If so, how would I go about it?   I am not a Mac user usually so any guidance will have to be pretty simple!  <answer57120> I'm sorry to hear about your father.  It is possible to reset the admin password to a Mac quite easily providing you have the correct install disc to match the version of the software that is running on the computer. Resetting the password does not delete any of the information on the Mac, but it will prevent you from gaining access to other passwords that are saved in the system for things like mail accounts or wifi keys that have previously been entered and saved by the original user.  Once you have changed the password you will be prompted to create a new Keychain, which is the name of the place where these other passwords are saved.  Once you have admin access you can create or delete accounts.  There is a support article on the Apple website with info on how to reset the password here: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1274  If you don't have the install disc or need more help, I'd suggest booking an appointment at the Genius Bar at your local Apple Store and they will help you reset it at no charge.  <answer57152> There are many ways to reset the login password without installation media, here are three:   h3Change the password in single user mode/h3  ol liHold kbd⌘/kbd+kbdS/kbd on startup/li licodemount -uw //code (codefsck -fy/code is not needed)/li licodelaunchctl load /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.opendirectoryd.plist/code (or code/System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.DirectoryServices.plist/code in 10.6)/li licodedscl . passwd /Users/username/code (without a trailing slash) and enter a new password.

You can find this by going to the Apple menu at the top-right and selecting "About this Mac." <comment69226> Question: Does this work on earlier versions of Mac OSX (ie, Tiger, Leopard, or Snow Leopard, specifically)? <comment69230> I've only tested them on 10.7, but the first method should work on 10.5 according to [10.5: Reset a user's password in single user mode - Mac OS X Hints](http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20080414140636495). On 10.6 and earlier you could also [reset the password from an installation medium](http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1274). <comment69233> What about 10.4? I've got a computer running 10.4.11 and no installation media. <comment69239> I don't know, but you don't probably need the original installation disk. [Installation disks for other versions of OS X might also work](http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20050819203033740). <comment69241> Ok, thanks. I'll try it and get back to you. <comment199521> the account that gets created is only a standard account, so this does not work. <comment208952> How does this improve on the existing answer from 2012? <comment230765> Does this work for an internal hard disk or flash drive encrypted with FileVault2?
