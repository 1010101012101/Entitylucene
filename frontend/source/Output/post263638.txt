MacBook Pro experiencing ping spikes to local router <body> I'm experiencing extreme ping spikes to my AirPort Extreme (local IP: 192.168.1.1), however I am not getting these ping spikes on another MacBook Pro right next to it.   Here are my ping results.  precodePING 192.168.1.1 (192.168.1.1): 56 data bytes 64 bytes from 192.168.1.1: icmp_seq=0 ttl=64 time=24.703 ms 64 bytes from 192.168.1.1: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=145.378 ms 64 bytes from 192.168.1.1: icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=975.540 ms 64 bytes from 192.168.1.1: icmp_seq=3 ttl=64 time=577.900 ms 64 bytes from 192.168.1.1: icmp_seq=4 ttl=64 time=2.802 ms 64 bytes from 192.168.1.1: icmp_seq=5 ttl=64 time=5.377 ms 64 bytes from 192.168.1.1: icmp_seq=6 ttl=64 time=5.922 ms 64 bytes from 192.168.1.1: icmp_seq=7 ttl=64 time=3.854 ms 64 bytes from 192.168.1.1: icmp_seq=8 ttl=64 time=3.522 ms 64 bytes from 192.168.1.1: icmp_seq=9 ttl=64 time=4.593 ms  --- 192.168.1.1 ping statistics --- 10 packets transmitted, 10 packets received, 0.0% packet loss round-trip min/avg/max/stddev = 2.802/174.959/975.540/316.450 ms /code/pre  MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Early 2015)  <answer291576> Please run this script from the Terminal.app:  precodewhile x=1; do /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/Versions/Current/Resources/airport -I | grep Ctl; ping -c 1 192.168.1.1; sleep 1; done /code/pre  This script checks for Signal/Noise ratio. You probably have some interference.  <answer291582> From my experience, in 90% of all cases, restarting the router will fix the issue.  <answer291590> Following this guide worked for me:  Fix Wi-Fi problems on MacOs Sierra  essentially in the folder code/Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration//code backup and delete files  precodecom.apple.airport.preferences.plist com.apple.network.eapolclient.configuration.plist com.apple.wifi.message-tracer.plist NetworkInterfaces.plist preferences.plist /code/pre  Then restart your Mac.  <comment368103> Have you disconnected *all* wi-fi or hard-wired devices (other computers, including iDevices, AppleTV(s), home automation devices, etc,) from the APEx , except for the device you are sending the pings? From these brief blips I would assume the APEx is connecting to the external network for some reason. Let it run for at least 100 iterations (or more) and see if there is some sort of pattern which would indicate a process on the APEx periodically 'phoning home'. Report back with what you see. Don't paste in a huge ping listing, please. :-) <comment368166> Interesting - I've seen that buffering come and go - are you thinking that the WiFi is roaming to check other base stations and clearing those preferences / records out keep the WiFi connection more stable? <comment369189> What about pinging a *different* node; say one of the other MacBooks on the network?  Does the problem still exist?
