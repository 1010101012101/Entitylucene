caffeinate with launchd Doesn't Work when I Close My Laptop's Lid <body> I have a launchd task that periodically initiates a time machine network backup. I've had problems with corrupted sparse bundle disk images, which I've assumed is due to the either the computer sleeping during a backup, the NAS sleeping while the sparse bundle is mounted, or some combination of the 2. So, in order to fix this I run caffeinate with launchd task and have caffeinate run my script. I found, however, that the computer still goes to sleep when I close the lid, even when AC power is connected. I did a simple test, and found that caffeinate works as expected when I use it in a terminal, and does keep my computer awake, however, in that same test initiated with launchd/caffeinate the computer still goes to sleep while the script is running.  I'm running caffeinate with the -ims flags. In my simple test I used the following script:  precode#!/bin/sh  while true; do     date | logger     sleep 1 done /code/pre  I monitor the system log with:  precodetail -f /var/log/system.log /code/pre  I'm using OS X 10.9.5.  Update: To answer Buscar's question. When I run pmset -g I see the following:  precodeActive Profiles: Battery Power           -1 AC Power                -1* Currently in use:  standbydelay         4200  standby              1  womp                 0  halfdim              1  hibernatefile        /var/vm/sleepimage  darkwakes            0  networkoversleep     0  disksleep            10  sleep                180 (sleep prevented by UserEventAgent)  hibernatemode        3  ttyskeepawake        1  displaysleep         10  acwake               0  lidwake              1 /code/pre  Update 2: I found that PowerNap was disabled in my Energy Saver preferences. I enabled it but it didn't make a difference. I also tried running "pmset force sleep 0" to disable sleep in my script, and also from a terminal with sudo, it also didn't make a difference. At this point, with this OS version, assuming this not possible with native mac tools. Ironically when I run pmset -g while the test script above is running under launchd by caffeinate, it shows "(sleep prevented by caffeinate)". I still haven't tested the case of what happens if the computer goes to sleep on its own without the lid being closed.  <comment208641> what does your pmset -g looks like <comment209783> @Buscar웃 I updated the question and posted my pmset -g output when running on AC power. Do you see anything that would prevent caffeinate from working when used with launchd? <comment209785> @Buscar웃 I thought the darkwakes parameter might have been the problem so I enabled it with the -c flag as described here: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/116348/how-can-i-enable-and-or-disable-os-xs-power-nap-feature-from-within-terminal. I restarted my computer just to be sure. No change. <comment284424> @Samuel if you ever found a solution, it would be interesting to hear back <comment284689> @Chris No solution. I have since updated from Mavericks to Yosemite but I never went back and re-tested. Someone made a suggestion about this once that perhaps it's a safety/fire hazard concern with closing a laptop and throwing it in an unventilated laptop bag, maybe that's why Apple doesn't allow this. I haven't confirmed, but I don't think you will see this issue on an Apple desktop computer.
