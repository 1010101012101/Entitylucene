Having additional scripts in your path can confuse software installed via Homebrew if the config script overrides a system or Homebrew provided script of the same name. We found the following "config" scripts: /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.4/bin/python3-config /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.4/bin/python3.4-config /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.4/bin/python3.4m-config  Warning: Python is installed at /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework  Warning: You have MacPorts or Fink installed: /opt/local/bin/port  Warning: You have unlinked kegs in your Cellar  Warning: /usr/bin occurs before /usr/local/bin  Thanks for reading!  Answer in detailed direction will be appreciated as I am just a beginner having tons of stuff to learn from you.  Really frustrated by now.  <answer257343> Do NOT remove your Apple system provided python version found at this path: /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7  In fact - you should strongnever/strong mess with any Frameworks under /Library/... unless you know what you are doing.  Your OS may have tools that depend on this version of Python that it ships.  After installing brew - did you run     brew doctor   It should tell you if you have any issues.  Also - be sure your brew install python3 (note there is not a space - 'python 3')  After installing your new Python - brew should put it under /usr/local/ not /Library/...  I suggest you use either Homebrew or Macports - NOT both.  Make sure you follow the directions on their webpages and set your PATH in your .bashrc or .bash_profile properly.  After you set your PATH in those files, don't forget to "source" the files - or simply close and reopen terminal to "refresh" your environment to the new settings.  Good Luck!  <comment315503> Use one and only one package manager you have homebrew, macports and anaconda here as well as trying to use Apple's python.  For python only  I would just use anaconda. You need to delete the others - If you need other tools for CS pick one of macports or home-brew. (Best to use what your university recommends any decent one will have install instructions)
