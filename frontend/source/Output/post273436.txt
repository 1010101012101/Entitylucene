"Authorized Activity" on gmail: snooping? <body> My husband and I have an AT&amp;T family share plan.  He has admitted reading my emails and texts over the years, but says he is trying not to anymore. Regardless, I've become increasingly paranoid and I've started checking my gmail activity log everyday.   There is one repeated hit on the activity log that confuses me, and I don't know how to attribute it to either of us (or maybe my kids while using apps). This activity shows as: "Authorized Application...name: iPhone Mail...os-version 10-xxxxx....version: 14xxxxx..... OAuth Domain Name: 45xxxxxxxx....."  I think we both have the same updated operating system and I think he has the iphone 6 plus also. I don't know how to identify his phone as different from mine.  For example, there was a hit from that above ID at 4:57 am today. We both woke up at around 4:50 this morning, and by 4:57 I had turned on my radio app (which doesn't share info with google - I checked on my google accounts page). I definitely hadn't opened any other apps or checked email at that time. I checked my phone around 9am to see if any apps were opened and there was nothing open. Is there something completely innocent going on here, and I'm just confused? He knows my gmail password, so I imagine he could access my email via his iphone's email function.
