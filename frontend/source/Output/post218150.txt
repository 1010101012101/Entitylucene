Help converting Apple Script to Shell Script <body> This Apple Script works great to mount the logged in Active Directory users network homedrive as a mounted network drive but we currently have it running as an App at login via "Login Items".   Instead I'd like to write this as a shell script so I can push it via Profile Manager as a login script since we are now succesfully running a few tasks off of a login script from PM.  Here is the AppleScript:  precodeset username to do shell script "whoami"  set homepath to do shell script "dscl '/Active Directory/CAMPUS/All Domains/' -read /Users/" &amp; username &amp; " | grep SMBHome: | cut -c 10- | sed 's/\\\\/\\//g' "  tell application "Finder"      try         mount volume "SMB:" &amp; homepath     end try end tell /code/pre  Thank you for your help!  <answer219049> Below is a starting point.  precodeusername=`whoami` homepath=`dscl '/Active Directory/CAMPUS/All Domains/' -read /Users/$username |grep SMBHome: | cut -c 10- | sed 's/\\\\/\\//g'`  mount_smbfs $homepath &lt;mount_point&gt; /code/pre  I'm not really sure of the mount syntax.  This answer may help with mount syntax.
