macOS Sierra Text overlapping textbox in Xcode 7.3.1 <body> I'm having a weird problem when trying to create a new project in Xcode 7.3.1: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/er7yi.png" alt="overlap text in xcode"  Another problem, which might related to this, is weird text placement in form in Illustrator CS6: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7FrNV.png" alt="text in illustrator"  How can I fix this? Is it a known bug? Thanks.  <comment325859> Might be something to do with compatibility?
