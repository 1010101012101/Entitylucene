Is there a Safari plugin to remove mackeeper ads? <body> I don't mind ads, banners and the like.  What I do mind is the fact that almost all the ads I see recently are ads for Mackeeper. Popups, banners, it's everywhere.  Am I the only one that has this problem?  I've recently installed AdBlock 2.5.13 to take care of the popups, yet the banners remain.   These banners state stuff as: "is your Mac slow? Use mackeeper to make it 21% faster!" I'm really getting frustrated, because:   ol limy Mac is lightning fast, /li liI've tried Mackeeper on my friend's Mac, and it really is a textbook example of a bad Mac citizen. I really dislike the app (just an opinion)./li liI'm not going to buy an app to make my Mac faster, because I know there is no such thing./li /ol  Perhaps this is a google ads problem?  <answer39478> Do you understand how to use the customization features in AdBlock to detect a specific ad and configure AdBlock to block it?  Here are the AdBlock instructions.  <answer39806> they probably "target" you and you can remove it easily remove it  form here  https://www.google.com/settings/ads/onweb/  (hit the opt out link)  and here http://www.networkadvertising.org/ (click the opt out red button)  <answer96342> Ghostery extension gives you     Full detection of tracker scripts, img tags, and iframes from over 1000 data collection services   and is available for all major browsers.  <answer118683> I see that many people have also tested mackeeper and have now very outrageous safari plugins from this site. I use now Ghostery and now bye bye mackeeper.
