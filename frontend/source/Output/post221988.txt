MacBook Pro crashes during boot <body> I'm having the following problems:  ul liafter latest El Capitan update, my Macbook Pro (mid 2010) crashes (turns off) during boot./li liI'm unable to boot in safe mode, the only way is recovery mode./li liI've ran disk utility with ok results./li liI've done PRAM reset with no effect./li liI'm trying to reinstall El Capitan as a last resort but I'm getting the following error message: "An error occured while preparing the installation. Try running this application again."/li /ul  Currently I'm really stuck in the middle of nowhere, everything I've tried goes terribly wrong and I have no clue what is going on.  Please help,  Thanks.  <answer222023> There most common cause for this error, is a time/date issue.  If you notice the time and date are wrong during the installation, try the following:  https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/166746/164066  There's more info on the error here: http://osxdaily.com/2015/01/19/fix-os-x-install-errors-cant-be-verified-error-occurred-preparing-mac/  <comment269004> I have already tried fixing time/date in Terminal, but it won't do the trick in my case... <comment269580> Are you using a third-party SSD? And is TRIM enabled? Some suggest to turn it off while installing/restoring.
