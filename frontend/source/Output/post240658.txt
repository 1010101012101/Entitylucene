iPhone 5s discharges when connected to MacBook while MacBook is charging <body> MacBook Air connected to charger and is fully charged. iPhone 5s connected to MacBook Air and battery in iPhone discharges instead of charging.  How can I troubleshoot this?  <comment295965> Tried a different cable? Tried a different port?  Does the battery icon on the 5s get a lightning bolt next to it?
