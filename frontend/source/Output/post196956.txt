Move focus between buttons in confirm dialogs OS X Yosemite 10.10.3 <body> When I try to export a file with the same name (in InDesign CS6) I get a popup asking if I want to replace the file.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yyY21.png" alt="enter image description here"  strongHow can I move focus between the codeCancel/code and codeReplace/code buttons using only the keyboard?/strong  I have found that if I press this sequence kbdTab/kbd  kbdTab/kbd  kbdSpace/kbd the codereplace/code button is pressed instead of codecancel/code, but I get no visual indication this will happen. Is this a bug?  <answer197051> There are two ways to allow the Mac to move focus between dialog boxes.  One is by going into codeSystem Preferences &gt; Keyboard &gt; Shortcuts/code and clicking the codeAll Controls/code Radio button on the bottom.  Another way to do is is by hitting codeFn/code+codeâŒƒ/code+codeF7/code to toggle between codeAll Controls/code and codeText boxes and lists only/code (code^/code+codeF7/code if you haven't switched the apple media keys to codeFn/code keys).  <answer246048> Just hit the spacebar.  (It's not necessary to use tab if the button you desire pressed is already outlined.)  This also works with highlighted checkboxes.  <comment235405> Don't you see a surround to the button as per http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/38017/237 <comment235407> @Mark no nothing
