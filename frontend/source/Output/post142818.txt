Is Boot Camp unstable? <body> I'm curious about this after using Windows 8.1 Pro on my MacBook Pro (Retina, Late 2013) because my Boot Camp partition gets thrashed a lot, and by a lot I mean every time I reboot into Boot Camp I worry that it's not going to boot.   Over the past month and a half I have had to reinstall Windows 8.1 two times and mess with the EFI partition to fix BCD issues about 5 times.   I have absolutely no idea what could be causing this, since the ISO image I'm using was downloaded after purchasing Windows 8 from Microsoft's website and the SHA1 hash checks out.   My theories are  ul liI'm being too abusive to my Windows partition (running very old software, causes crashes occasionally)/li liMy SSD is faulty (I highly doubt this but it's always possible)/li liBoot Camp Drivers have become corrupt/li /ul  Are my problems at all normal or are they uncommon and may need Apple-fixing?
