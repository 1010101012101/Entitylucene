Play music from iPhone on MacBook using iPhone 4 dock? <body> We have an iPhone 4 dock (the official apple one, and not the universal one) which I noticed has a headphone connection on the back. Is it possible to connect that to a Macbook (Pro) and play music from the iPhone through the laptop speakers?  <answer1377> While it's theoretically possible to take the sound output from the iPhone dock and run it through a 3.5" cable into the input jack in the computer, it's much easier (and better quality) to simply fire up iTunes 10 and play the media through the computer directly.  <comment1188> +1 Cool - I didn't realise they'd changed this in iTunes 10. You certainly didn't used to be able to do it in older versions (I've tried before and wondered why they'd be so brain-dead as to prevent you from doing it). Thanks!
