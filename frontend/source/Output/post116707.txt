How do I start taskgated again? <body> I killed codetaskgated/code from the Activity Monitor and since then it is not been running. How do I start the process codetaskgated/code again?  <answer116710> You can either reboot, or run  precodesudo launchctl load /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.taskgated.plist /code/pre  <answer214157> Use this command without sudo. (Worked on Yosemite)  codelaunchctl load /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.taskgated.plist/code  <answer235359> When I ran codelaunchctl load/code I got this error:  precode/System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.taskgated.plist: Operation already in progress /code/pre  So I had to run:  precodesudo launchctl unload /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.taskgated.plist /code/pre  Followed by:  precodesudo launchctl load /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.taskgated.plist /code/pre  And even then it took about a half minute for it to show up in codeps/code.  <comment136516> Thanks for the accurate answer. <comment173811> and yet, taskgated is still not running! <comment320194> Since El Capitan, you won't be able to unload the task while SIP (https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204899) is engaged. You'll need to disable it (http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/208478/how-do-i-disable-system-integrity-protection-sip-aka-rootless-on-os-x-10-11) to perform this. Rebooting might be easier...
