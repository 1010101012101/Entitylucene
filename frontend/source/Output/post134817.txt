How to show all running launchctl daemons/agents? <body> When I run:  precodesudo launchctl bslist  /code/pre  ... it shows all the running /System daemons, but I have some running from code/Library/LaunchDaemons/code and it is not showing those.  How can I show them all?  <answer134823> From launchctl's man page bslist lists "Mach bootstrap services "  To get all jobs loaded into launchctl use codesudo launchctl list/code  Daemons are not necessarily the former and other things but daemons are in the list  <comment159703> bslist lists "Mach bootstrap services " and so I think not all daemons - launchctl list shows more <comment159707> Yes, "sudo launchctl list" shows them all. Thanks! <comment159712> Yep, worked. Thanks.
