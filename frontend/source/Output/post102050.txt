contacts added to iphone4s no longer show up in Yahoo contacts <body> I noticed recent contacts I have added to iphone 4s are not showing in my Yahoo account online.  I have to do a phone restore and afraid of losing contacts.  I don't want to sync to iCloud because when they set up my iphone in the beginning I had a ton of issues of multiple contacts and crashes.  I have over 500 and multiplying that is horrible.  <answer102084> Are you using the Yahoo app? Sometimes when you try to share like this, it usually wont end up in your contacts. And is 500 literally? Because that is alot of contacts and that may be one of the reasons why you aren't seeing the contacts. You could try to take out a few contacts an if you REALLY need them, try to put them on paper otherwise you are gonna get ALOT OF PROBLEMS!! Mainly memory ones or data ones or whatever.   I hoped this worked!
