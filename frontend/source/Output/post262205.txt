MacBook Pro 2011 SSD/RAM compatibilities and investments <body> I'm a graduating Computer Science student using a MacBook Pro early 2011, 2.3GHz Intel Core i5, RAM of 4GB 1333 MHz DDR3, and running at OSX Yosemite(10.10.2).  I run memory and CPU intensive applications, especially with virtual machines and programming applications, and my MacBook just couldn't these heavy apps (deadly beach ball icon).   So, I was considering in using my savings to upgrade my MacBook's RAM and SSD until I raise enough budget to purchase a newer MacBook Pro with a better CPU and better capacity for upgrades(probably in about 5-7 months). For now, I'm stuck with my current 2.3GHz MacBook Pro.   I'm not really verse with hardware, and since upgrades are very pricey, I kinda need some assurance that my choices are sustainable and the right ones.   ol liI know it's better to upgrade SSD first before RAM. Bu in running multiple memory heavy apps, isn't it better to upgrade the strongRAM instead of the SSD/strong? Since booting apps or my laptop isn't really an issue. /li liIs a strongSamsung 850 Pro (1TB)/strong a stronggood investment/strong and is strongcompatible/strong with my early 2011 MacBook Pro? I was thinking of just installing this SSD into my emnew laptop/em when the time comes, so I thought it might be a good investment to opt for one of the 'best' SSD with a larger capacity and longer 'life'/warranty. /li liSorry for the ignorance, but when upgrading the RAM, do I really need to strictly purchase a strong1333 MHz DDR3/strong (8GBx2) in order for it to be compatible? /li /ol  Thank you very much!   <answer262218> Answer to question 1-3:br /br / strong1.SSD or RAM?/strong  My suggestion is 512GB SSD and a memory upgrade.  2.5inch SSD that is used in old macbook cannot be used in new macbook.So 1TB is not neccessary.  512GB SSD and RAM upgrade can ensure performance and avoid the choice between SSD or RAM.  strong2.RAM selection?/strong  Since you already have a 4GB ram,adding another 8GB ram could work just fine.It is ok if you want 8GB * 2 as well.  RAM frequency could be 1333MHz or 1600MHz,no need to consider about compatibility.  <answer262257> ol liMost apps interact with disk anyway, so it makes sense to upgrade the disk. I felt the difference even after upgrading to a faster SSD./li liSamsung SSDs work fine in Macbook Pro 2011. I used 1TB 840 EVO instead of Apple's stock 512GB SSD. EVO was much faster, by the way. The only thing that you should know is that if you go to Apple service, Apple's hardware test will fail on the disk only because the disk is not known to Apple. But that's nothing. My 2011 MBP works with this SSD for about three years now and the work is heavy. You may want to update the firmware of the SSD after purchasing though./li liYes, you have to stay with 1333MHz! 1600 is not stable and it will not work reliably. It may work for a while but than randomly give kernel panic. It may happen under load or when idle. I tried several 1600MHz modules including "Mac memory". 16GB 1333MHz work fine in MBP 2011. 1600 does /li /ol  <comment328494> Oh. Thanks for pointing that out. How come the 2.5" SSD won't be compatible with the new MacBooks? I was really hoping to invest on a SSD that can be reused when I purchase a new one.  And another thing I'm curious about is why 512GB SSD a common choice rather than 1TB? Other than the obvious reason of the need for storage space. <comment328502> 512GB SSD is big enough to survive 5-6 months' time with lower cost.And the new macbook(2016) use "PCIe-based" SSD,much smaller and thinner compared to 2.5 inch.
