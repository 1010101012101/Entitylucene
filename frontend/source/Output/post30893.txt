Secondary click in Lion with two fingers OR bottom-right corner click <body> I just did a clean install of Lion on my 2010 MBP. It seems as though in the system preferences for the built-in trackpad, I have the option of setting the secondary click gesture to "Click or tap with two fingers", "Click in bottom right corner", or "Click in bottom left corner".  Previous to this fresh install, I had simply upgraded from Snow Leopard where I had been able to initiate a secondary click emeither/em by a two-finger tap emor/em a click in the bottom right corner. That setting was preserved when I upgraded from Snow Leopard to Lion. When I simply did a fresh install of Lion, it's now either one or the other. Not both.  Does anyone know how I can get the "both" behavior back?  <answer41145> Sadly, I don't think it's possible to do that without a third party solution. Two popular applications that allow you to tweak the touchpad and mouse are Magic Prefs and Better Touch Tool.  <answer105705> strongRun the following six commands, by pasting them into Terminal.app./strong You can paste all six lines all at once. em(the last two lines aren't required on older versions of OS X, but there's no harm including them)/em Remember to strongpress the return key/strong:  precodedefaults write com.apple.driver.AppleBluetoothMultitouch.trackpad TrackpadCornerSecondaryClick -int 2  defaults write com.apple.driver.AppleBluetoothMultitouch.trackpad TrackpadRightClick -bool true  defaults -currentHost write NSGlobalDomain com.apple.trackpad.trackpadCornerClickBehavior -int 1  defaults -currentHost write NSGlobalDomain com.apple.trackpad.enableSecondaryClick -bool true  defaults write com.apple.AppleMultitouchTrackpad TrackpadCornerSecondaryClick -int 2  defaults write com.apple.AppleMultitouchTrackpad TrackpadRightClick -bool true /code/pre  Important: now strongreboot your Mac./strong   When you log back in, you will be able to right-click both with a two-finger tap, and by clicking in the bottom right-hand corner.  Hope this helps.  <comment46599> Perfect! Thanks a bunch! <comment190158> This also works on Yosemite <comment214465> I used Charlesisms method above but on 10.10.3 this doesn't seem to work anymore, defaulting to only the touchpad criteria set last in the terminal. Can anyone confirm this method is no longer working please? I'm new to Mac and could be doing it wrong, but I think I executed the commands correctly. Using BetterTouchTool I have managed to enable both but was hoping to do so with less clutter! <comment214470> @MattBaines Hmm, still working on my 10.10.3 Mac. I can still use both on my machine, and I assume I used the same commands when I upgraded the OS. Did you try using "killall cfprefsd" after entering the commands? <comment313885> Doesn't work in macOS Sierra <comment314447> @johnmast, Thanks for the heads-up. I have added two new lines, which should work for Sierra. <comment324285> I confirm that the above updated solutions works on macOS Sierra. Thanks @Charlesism <comment335367> Does this mean that if I am on El Capitan or Sierra, I still need all six of these commands? Or only the last two? Also, does this only work for the bottom right corner? I was hoping to get it set to use the top right corner (easier to reach with your thumb while typing). <comment337977> @user5359531 I haven't tried, but the last two would probably do fine. Not that there's much harm in using them all. All that the commands do is write new settings to a few plist files in ~/Library/Preferences and if the OS doesn't use a few of them it's no harm done
