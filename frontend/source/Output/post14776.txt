What is the release schedule for the next Mac Pro (desktop)? <body> I work on many projects at once and my MacBook Pro is not cutting it anymore. I will be purchasing a Mac Pro (desktop) soon, but want to make sure a new model is not on the verge of coming out. Does anyone know the release schedule for the next Mac Pro?  Thanks, Chirag  <answer14777> I would wait. See http://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Mac_Pro for the timeline of recent updates.  <comment15895> Voting to close. Any answer here would be pure supposition and would be obsolete once the Mac Pro is released. <comment15901> Yeah, this is too subjective. Who knows? Apple has no schedule, kinda sadly I'd say :) <comment22935> Thanks Brian. This ticket was closed every though 5 people found the answer useful. The release schedules on macrumors.com are indeed fact so I consider this a "good fit" <comment27946> @Chirag The Macrumors Buyers' Guide is not a schedule: it is statistically-based guessing.
