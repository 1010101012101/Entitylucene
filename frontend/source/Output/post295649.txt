Change the Lang attribute of websites <body> I often use the text-to-speech/screen reader feature of my iPhone. When a website does not use the html lang attribute, iOS chooses my standard language. That’s annoying on websites with foreign languages. I’m looking for a bookmarklet/favlet that changes/sets the lang attribute of the current website to the language of my choice. Does anyone know about such a tool? Or how do multilingual blind people act with this problem?
