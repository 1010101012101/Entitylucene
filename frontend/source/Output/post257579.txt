Macbook Pro keyboard keys dead after Whiskey spill <body> I spilled some (very little) Whiskey over some of the keys of a Macbook Pro 15" Retina mid-2014 - let's not talk about that - and after turning it immediately off and letting it dry for over 4 days the keyboard has gone crazy: certain keys don't work at all (h, a, and others), other keys output double characters and other work normally. Now the weird thing is - the exact same keys don't work even on an externally attached usb keyboard. How can that be? Anyone ever experienced this?  <comment321700> To prevent this question from being closed as [off-topic ("anyone ever experienced this?')](http://apple.stackexchange.com/help/dont-ask), you should edit your question to focus on the exact problem you're having, any error messages you've received, and what you've done so far to resolve it. <comment348321> Also see http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/219053/no-sound-speakers-jack-microphones-dead-after-spilling-water for a hard lesson.
