All my files disappeared from my External USB drive, macOS Sierra <body> I don't deleted the files, my External USB Hard Disk is not broken, it not suffered fall.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hGS5d.png" alt="enter image description here" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NheYo.png" alt="enter image description here"  On the second image you can check the size of the HD 1TB with 2nd partition Size of code999.9GB/code, but on the first you can see code649.69GB/code.  When I select with codeFinder/code the HD, become to very slow. The codeFinder/code can't to move to another location appears the colored wheel.

Is your drive broken? What have your tried? Have you accidentally deleted the files? What is in the .Trashes directory? What does Disk Utility say when you want to repair the disk? <comment374124> I’ve reopened this and will edit it down to one question. Let’s focus on the fsck - keep in mind that fsck will delete files and return the filesystem to a consistent state - so if you want to recover missing files Chepe- don’t run fsck and instead get recovery software first. Any changes you make can result in permanent data loss at this point. <comment374126> For fixing the filesystem - [something like this might work](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/71592/). For file recovery - look for commercial software recovery tools. You get what you pay for there - usually $50 for USB drive recovery software is appropriate. <comment374359> @bmike But I can't found the recommended software, I tried with gpt (gpart for mac) but doesn't work.
