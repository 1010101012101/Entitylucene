All 5 star song ratings in my iCloud Music Library disappeared <body> I noticed recently that all 5 star song ratings in my iCloud Music Library totally disappeared. All other ratings are still there, it seems, and 5 star album ratings are still there as well. I have no idea now this happened. I have a smart playlist that shows all songs with 5 stars; I'm not sure if this playlist had anything to do with it.  Before I turned on iCloud Music Library, I think I could've just restored an old version of my iTunes library from a backup, but I'm not sure I could do that now with iCloud. Does anyone have any ideas on this? The only thing I can think of is to load my pre-iCloud library onto another Mac, and manually copy each rating. But that would be very time consuming.
