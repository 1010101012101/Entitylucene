Macbook 2008 does not boot <body> I have a black Macbook from 2008. Some time ago I installed Ubuntu 16.04 as the only operating system (I completely deleted SO Snow Leopard). I have been using Ubuntu without problems for a year, approximately. Now I wanted to install Xubuntu from a USB, but I did not know how to boot the laptop started from the usb. After searching the Internet, I read that with "command + option + p + r" I could access to the "BIOS" of the Macbook. I did it and the laptop started as when I had installed Snow Leopard, with the classic Apple start sound ... but the screen went blank and with the icon of a folder with a question mark in the center. I turned it off, because nothing happened. Now, when I try to boot, Ubuntu is no longer started. I only hear the apple boot sound and it remains frozen on the screen with the folder icon.  Any ideas on how I can "resurrect" my Macbook?  Thanks in advance.  <comment360525> Try press CMD+R while booting, and see if you can get into recovery mode, if not you can use your recovery CD(if you have one) <comment360528> I don't know what you read, but "Macbook" and "BIOS" have never been uttered in the same sentence.  It's EFI and chances are you killed your boot partition where the efi boot loader lives. <comment360532> ⌘+⌥+P+R performs a PRAM reset. Parameter RAM stores lots of settings - such as the default OS to boot from - and this reset cleared all of those settings. <comment360533> Try performing an option-boot to see if your startup manager recognizes your Ubuntu volume. <comment360539> It does not work CMD + R, Harcker, nor option-boot, QMord. I do not have a recovery CD. Is it possible to install Snow Leopard from a CD or from the USB, or is my Macbook definitely a brick? <comment360580> Basically, you need to reinstall the bootloader (rEFInd or similar) - you can do this problem a USB
