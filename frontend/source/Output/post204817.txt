Macbook boot problems - 1 long beep, then nothing, then it's fine <body> My girlfriend's Macbook (white unibody 2010) is having some problems booting.  It can be erratic, but it generally seems to follow this pattern:  ul liTurn it on, 1 long deep beep, and then nothing (light stays on), turn it off/li liTurn it on, nothing (light stays on), turn it off/li liTurn it on, boots up as per normal./li /ul  Apparently the 1 long beep signifies a RAM issue, but when it finally boots up all of the RAM is present, and there is absolutely no problem at all with the Macbook - it will run for an entire day without a single crash or problem.  I've also tried this from the official Apple forum with no joy:     with the unit plugged into power, hold the power button for 10 seconds. While still holding it, press the left hand shift, control, and option keys for 10 seconds. Let go of those three keys while still holding the power button for 10 more seconds.    Any suggestions on a possible fix please? Thank you.  <answer204821> I once had a similar issue with my Mac Mini. Swapping the two RAM Modules seemed to help temporarily, but the issue came back and got more frequent over the next weeks/months. At the end replacing the RAM with another brand fixed it persistently. (It was "third-party" RAM from Amazon.)
