Delete all pictures in an album from library in Aperture <body> I have created smart albums, the content of which I have exported to new libraries. I now wish to delete the pictures in these albums from the Aperture library.  Is there a way to delete all pictures found in an album from the library (not simply remove them from the album or remove only the version that is contained in the album)?
