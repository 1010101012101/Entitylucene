How to sync iTunes to iPad <body> Now I have this iPad that's synced with my home iTunes. I need to add just one pdf onto it. So I installed iTunes here, but it won't sync iTunes to iPad. It wants to sync iPad to iTunes instead. Which is pointless, as the local library is empty. Both are logged on same iTunes account.
