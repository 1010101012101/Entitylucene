Navigation guidance is silent when "Pause Spoken Audio" is enabled <body> Recently, perhaps starting with the iOS 10 betas, I find myself in this situation:  ul liIf "Pause Spoken Audio" is off, then maps happily (and audibly) chatters over podcasts, audio books, etc./li liIf "Pause Spoken Audio" is emon/em, the spoken audio is paused for a few seconds of silence. /li /ul  Normal/Loud/etc. settings have no effect. Audio output is via Bluetooth in either the working or non-working scenarios. Ringer volume is up, and resets have no effect.  Anything else I can check or tweak?  Any way to "factory reset" Maps settings without doing so for the whole OS?
