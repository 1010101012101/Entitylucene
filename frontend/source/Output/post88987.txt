When viewing the songs, sort by the date added field. (You can add columns by right clicking any information header in the song list and adding check marks to the menu that shows).  Since the exact steps vary based on your OS and the version of iTunes, you can add that to your question or use iTunes help on importing songs from the computer folders and it will show you how to add those missing songs to the Library database that iTunes maintains.  Once you have an imported song, you can use iTunes to add titles and albums so that the storage on your filesystem is proper.  <answer163855> Use Media Monkey  It seemed to find tags/titles better than anything else I've used before.  Cheers  <comment105594> Actually, the OP can't even find the songs in iTunes. Could you edit your answer to provide recommendations on how to get to the songs so they can edit information?
