What parts do I need to build a iPhone <body> I'm soon planning to build a iPhone 6, but before ordering random parts, I've made a list of parts needed to have an nice overview.  A list of what parts are needed:   ul liHousing/li liLCD Screen + digitizer /li liMotherboard/li liBattery/li liVolume button flex /li liPower button flex/li liHome button + flex/li liVolume, Power and Home button spacers/li liVibration motor/li liAudio and Dock connector/li liFront camera, sensor + flex/li liBack camera /li liGPS /li /ul  Am I missing some parts for the build? I so, can you please let me know. Is there maybe a list of the iPhone parts somewhere on the internet?  <answer285210> I'm not sure you'd be able to build one from scratch using totally new parts, but you may find this iPhone 6 teardown useful.  <comment359643> Installing or using Apple operating systems on non-Apple hardware (and most other explicitly unlicensed use of product) Code-level programming questions (cocoa, LLVM, etcâ€¦) are off-topic here. We do encourage AppleScript, Automator, and UNIX shell scripting questions as well as how to use tools like Xcode for non-language specific tasks. - From Review <comment359677> I think it's possible if you buy an 100% working recycled motherboard. From there you need to build and get the needed parts together. I can't see why it wouldn't work <comment359678> I'm sure it would. I just meant you wouldn't be able to get totally new parts - well, not unless you bought a new iPhone 6, which would kind of defeat the purpose. :) <comment359680> Let me clarify my last comment - you'd be able to get new parts - I just mean you wouldn't be able to get _all_ the parts brand new. <comment359681> I understand now haha, I am thinking to buy the parts from AliExpress.
