Messages shows wrong informations in the recent chats list <body> For some contacts the preview in the recent chats list shows wrong informations. When I click on the preview, I get a totally different chat in the detail view.  emRunning Mountain Lion 10.8.2/em  Any ideas?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1U9ly.jpg" alt="Messages Screenshot"  <answer83058> It's a bug. Messages will work when it works, and fail when it fails. Unfortunately there isn't a solid fix from Apple (yet).  <comment95623> im gonna tell you bluntly, Messenger app is super buggy, and does not sync well...
