App for analyzing installers <body> Is there an app which shows contents of a .pkg file and shows which files an installer copies to my mac, what scripts it runs and so on?  <answer47083> You can extract package files and sort through their contents without actually installing them. To do this, you can often just right-click on a code.pkg/code file and select “Show Package Contents” – but that isn’t always displayed.  If that option is unavailable, you can extract code.pkg/code files using a command line tool called codepkgutil/code that is bundled with OS X. Launch Terminal.app and enter the following:  precodepkgutil --expand /path/to/package.pkg /output/destination/ /code/pre  Hint: you can drag &amp; drop items into the Terminal to print their full path, making this tip easier by typing: codepkgutil –expand [drop file here] /destination/path//code.  After that, you can go to the output path in the Finder and check out the extracted files.  Source  <answer47084> Yes, there's a shareware app called strongcodePacifist/code/strong ($20).  I've used it for years, and it works wonderfully well (even on old Macs).   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/RINhD.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  hr  Alternatively, you can download a free QuickLook extension for blazing fast previews of packages.  It's called strongcodeSuspiciousPackage/code/strong.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/aeEHW.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <comment54045> I see this was edited to say that Pacifist is shareware, but you can use it for an indefinite period of time without purchasing the software.  In a sense it's nagware.
