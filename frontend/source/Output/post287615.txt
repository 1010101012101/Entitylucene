Repair corrupt external HFS+ hdd - "resource busy" <body> I am trying to get my external hard disk to show up again on my Mac. At some point, it just stopped working. I tested it on several machines, they all produce the same results:  After I connect the hard disk, a message pops up saying the inserted medium couldn't be read (my rough translation from the German message), with the options to initialize, ignore, eject. Disk Utility is not able to help. In Terminal, emdiskutil list/em produces (after the internal hard drive):  precode/dev/disk2 (external, physical):    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:                                                   *2.0 TB     disk2 /code/pre  Doing emsudo diskutil repairdisk /dev/disk2/em results in:  precodeError repairing map: Resource busy (16) /code/pre  Also emsudo gpt -r show disk2/em results in:  precodegpt show: unable to open device 'disk2': Resource busy /code/pre  Does anyone have an idea on how to repair this disk without sending it to some expensive laboratory?  Thanks a lot, Walla  <comment363193> I'm no expert on hardware, but a repeated 'Resource busy' on multiple tests [assuming both Mac & HD have been power-cycled between tests] would tell me it's time to drop it in the trash & restore to a new drive from backup.
