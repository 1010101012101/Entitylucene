Tell iTerm2 not to remember open windows on quit <body> After a recent upgrade of iTerm2 (I'm on build 1.0.0.20120203), when I open up iTerm2, it restores all of the terminal windows I had open. How do I disable this behavior so it doesn't "remember" how many windows I had open?  <answer41909> This is the resume feature introduced with Lion.  precodedefaults write com.googlecode.iterm2 NSQuitAlwaysKeepsWindows -bool false /code/pre  <comment47541> Or (assuming it's Lion, and not an iTerm feature), remember to hold down the Alt/Option key whenever you Quit, which will work in any application. <comment47542> @scottishwildcat Yeah, thanks for pointing that out. It doesn't work with any application though. E.g. Chrome's setting in it's preferences overrides the shortcut.
