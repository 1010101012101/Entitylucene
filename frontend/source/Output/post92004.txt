Is there a way to hide certain apps from the cmd+tab menu? <body> Is there a way to hide certain apps from kbdcmd/kbd+kbdtab/kbd?  The problem I'm facing is that I have some apps (like iTunes and of course Finder) always open. But when I'm working and switching between apps that are relevant for me (Chrome, Sublime, Terminal) with kbdcmd/kbd+kbdtab/kbd I'll always see these 'irrelevant' apps in the menu.  Thanks  <answer92017> Yes, it is possible, however the only way I know of doing it also hides the dock icon.     you must modify the file named 'Info.plist' inside the Application's package (i.e. Sherlock.app/Contents/Info.plist). Open this file in your favorite text editor and add the following section (if it's already present simply change the 0 to a 1 in the string tag:   precode&lt;key&gt;NSUIElement&lt;/key&gt; &lt;string&gt;1&lt;/string&gt; /code/pre  Source  hr  In OS X 10.8+, use this instead (note LS instead of NS):  precode&lt;key&gt;LSUIElement&lt;/key&gt; &lt;string&gt;1&lt;/string&gt; /code/pre  <answer92035> You can set LSUIElement to 1 as string in the Info.plist:  precode&lt;key&gt;LSUIElement&lt;/key&gt; &lt;string&gt;1&lt;/string&gt; /code/pre  It removes applications from the application switcher, Dock, and the force quit window. It also removes the menu bar, so it's not really usable with Finder or iTunes.  Editing an Info.plist makes some applications like TextEdit and Chess crash on launch in 10.8. It also invalidates the code signatures of signed applications, so they are not allowed to access keychains automatically.  http://www.cocoabuilder.com/archive/cocoa/141753-lsuielement-and-lsbackgroundonly.html:     NSUIElement is depreciated.  However, I remember clearly from working   at Apple (Apple DTS) a few years back that NSUIElement and LSUIElement   map to the same thing (at least it did back when I was there and I   doubt that would have changed).  Though NSUIElement is depreciated (NS   stands for next step of course! and LS stands for launch services),   they are exactly the same thing for all intents and purposes.   Both LSUIElement and NSUIElement still work, and both can also be set to true or 1 as integer.  precodegrep -A1 [LN]SUIElement /Applications/*/Contents/Info.plist /code/pre  Information Property List Key Reference: Launch Services Keys:     codeLSUIElement/code (codeString/code - OS X) specifies whether the app runs as an agent app. If this key is set to “1”, Launch Services runs the app as an agent app. Agent apps do not appear in the Dock or in the Force Quit window. Although they typically run as background apps, they can come to the foreground to present a user interface if desired. A click on a window belonging to an agent app brings that app forward to handle events.      The Dock and loginwindow are two apps that run as agent apps.   Witch has an option to ignore applications:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/RkSS9.jpg" alt=""  I have just disabled the application switcher and Dock though. I mainly use keyboard shortcuts and Alfred to switch applications.  <answer207588> Sorry to be late to the party, but indeed as previous answers and comments state, this might make some applications to crash on launch. I can't make this work in Yosemite although I was able to make it work before on another Mac. Changing the TotalTerminal Info.plist did not do anything, and changing the codeApplications/Utilities/Terminal/Info.plist/code caused the crash.  As @atreat mentioned in one of the comments, the guys from strongTotalTerminal/strong are now supporting this hide via a simple command:  precodedefaults write com.apple.Terminal TotalTerminalHideDockIcon -bool YES /code/pre  This worked perfectly for me.  <answer220560> Disclaimer: I developed GhostTile  Short Anwser: just try GhostTile. It's paid though but you can try as long as you can (steal the idea from Sublime Text)  Long Anwser:  AFAIK, There are two ways to achieve this:br 1. Setup an App as Agent. E.g. Add codeLSUIElement/code key to App's Info.plist or Set App's activation policy to codeNSApplicationActivationPolicyAccessory/code.br 2. Hook Dock or other related system process to ignore some apps. Thanks to SIP(Rootless) on El Captian. It's not recommended to do so.  GhostTile is focus on hiding Apps from Dock. It's easy to use and provide multiple ways to manage the apps you hide. There is no on-disk modification, so you won't break apps' codesign signature.   Other features:  ul liYou can still get notified for the App's Dock Activity/li liExpose-like Overview/li liAlfred Workflow/li /ul  <answer223131> If you are using an iPhone and has similar problem with hiding an app from the App Switcher, you can install something like BlacklistSwitcher9.  <comment108021> holy smokes that worked better than expected thanks a lot! <comment108027> Two comments.  First, the above [STRING] format will not work in 10.8 -- you need to use a boolean type.  Second, besides hiding the app from the application switcher, modifying the NSUIElement will also hide the menu bar, so using the "hidden" applications becomes quite difficult. <comment125023> Have you had any luck with LSUIElement in Mavericks? <comment125247> It told be I had to change permissions of the Info.plist file. I changed both the plist and the Contents folder, but still no luck. I use it with an app called TotalTerminal, and that warns me that it isn't quite version compatible when it launches. I bet that may be the inconsistency. <comment125258> @atreat Ah, haven't tried it with TotalTerminal, although FYI they did release an update yesterday to provide Mavericks support <comment125648> Yep, I downloaded the update, they now support it natively with their v1.4.2 release. https://github.com/binaryage/totalterminal/issues/3#issuecomment-26988325 <comment141583> In Mavericks, this crashes for me.  I've tried a couple of different applications. <comment141584> @sandover This is probably because you're modifying a sandboxed app, which will cause it to crash upon launch to prevent modification. <comment183695> Does this work in Yosemite? Using the app Fluid, I have tried making these changes but they seem to get overwritten as soon as I launch the program. The value for `LSUIElement` is `false/`. I tried simply changing that to `true/`, and also to `string1/string`, but no dice. I save the plist file, then launch the program, but it appears in the command+tab switcher and on the dock. When I look at the plist file again, I see that it has reverted back to the original `false/` value. <comment250853> will this also hide the application window but not terminate the application program (ie run in the background?) <comment304631> Just tried this app and *none* of the apps I tried are "supported yet". Finder, Mail, iOS Simulator... <comment304659> @pkamb I'm sorry but all the apps your tried is protected by System Integration Protection (SIP) introduced in El Capitan. Could you please try other third party apps? or turn SIP off? <comment304736> Fair enough, thanks for the answer. I'd suggest a more informative error message or link to an FAQ! <comment310941> Setting `LSUIElement` in Slack's info.plist caused it to crash on launch for me. <comment356081> How do I hide Ghost Title from Cmd+Tab launcher ? I tried adding keyNSUIElement/key string1/string to Info.plist and restarting the app. It didnt work <comment356194> @mac There is a preference option called "Hide GhostTile from Dock" <comment356221> Awesome. Didn't know that option can hide ghosttile from Cmd+Tab laucher as well ;) <comment356223> That option has a unintended consequence. It adds a item in top menu bar making it cluttered now ;) <comment361390> Tested it, but on OSX Sierra it seems also "Not supported yet" for third party applications. <comment361983> @hewigovens interesting application. how did you implement the dock hiding and window switcher hiding? which APIs did you use? looking to find a similar possibility for a project. thanks in advance!
