Microsoft RDP Crash on launch <body> I work for a primarily Microsoft based IT support company, anyway today a Mac user asked me to setup RDP which I wouldn't normally have any issues with but I got onto the Mac and installed the latest RDP client from the app store (this was updated a couple days ago).  Anyway when I try to launch it from launchpad I get a crash every time, I tried reinstalling but it still does the exact same.  I am not experienced with Mac's at all so I am finding it hard to troubleshoot this, can anyone shed some light on this or point me in the right direction?  precodeProcess:         launchd [571] Path:            /Applications/Microsoft Remote Desktop.app/Contents/MacOS/Microsoft Remote Desktop Identifier:      com.microsoft.rdc.mac Version:         ???

See this tech-net link for more info OSX 10.7 Remote Desktop crash at startup.  I believe that an Mac OS X update to 10.10 (El Capitan) is available free in the App Store.  <answer295251> If you have set the resolution to 'full screen' in the .rdp connection document the connection will crash when using a high res monitor, like 2560 x 1440. Too bad the max. res. with the old versions Remote Desktop Connection is limited to 1400 x 1050 but this setting works on a high res monitor. The newer Microsoft Remote Desktop has higher res options but no Applications tab anymore, where you can set a Windows application to auto start on login, and we need that. btw: 'Old' RDC 2.1 still works on a MBP Touch Bar with MacOS Sierra. If you use 'full screen' in the .rpd document on a lower native res. monitor like 1920 x 1080 it works fine.  <comment258584> Thanks for answering my question I didn't know this.
