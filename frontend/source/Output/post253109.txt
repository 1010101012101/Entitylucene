How can I disable Universal Clipboard on macOS and iOS? <body> I've looked into the iCloud settings on both my Mac and iOS, but I can't seem to find an option to disable this feature. Is there a plist entry somewhere that I can use, or is it forced on?  <answer262366> Disabling Handoff is currently the only way to disable Universal Clipboard.  ul liMac: Go to System Preferences  General  uncheck Allow Handoff/li liiPhone: Go to Settings  General  Handoff  uncheck Handoff  /li /ul  Just so you know, Handoff uses a secure communication channel to transfer information between devices signed into the same Apple ID.   Data does not travel to Apple's servers or even over the internet. Devices advertise availability to each other via Bluetooth and data is transmitted over Wi-Fi, but only on the local network.   <comment314973> From what I can gather, it's part of Handoff, so you might need to disable that altogether. <comment314974> That sucks. I like handoff quite a bit actually, I just don't want stuff like my 1Password passwords being sent anywhere. <comment314975> @Tetsujin I just tested it, and it seems to indeed disable Universal Clipboard. Post it as an answer and I'll accept it. <comment315015> I'd rather hang on for a day or so... see if anyone can provide an authoritative way to disable it without switching off Handoff entirely.
