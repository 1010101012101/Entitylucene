iPod cannot connect <body> A pop up on my iPod 4th gen said blue skag could not connect, which freaked me out. I pressed cancel and turned off the Wi-Fi to see if I could find anything in the settings to help.  This has happened in the past but I completely reset my iPod so this shouldn't be happening. I don't know if this is a virus or an official thing. Please help.  Blue Skag is not my Wi-Fi's or iPod's name.  <comment315076> I'm assuming "blue skag" is the name of your iPod? Or the name of your Wi-Fi network? <comment315132> @AceRedstone You always have enough reputation to comment on your own questions.
