iTunes is changing the number/order of tracks in an album when it loads into my iPod. I want the tracks to stay in order <body> iTunes changes the number (and therefore) the order of tracks in an album when make a new playlist. Therefore, I cannot listen to an album in the correct order. I want the tracks to stay in order when I create a new playlist. It is worse than shuffle because the actual number of the tracks gets changed, so I cannot tell what order the tracks should be in.  <answer174772> I'm not sure why this is happening, but you can fix it by clicking on a track, going to File  Get Info (or kbd&#x2318; Cmd/kbd-kbdI/kbd) and changing the track numbers back to the correct information.  To get the correct track number, you can try googling the album. Somewhere will surely have the titles and track numbers.  <answer239462> Easy to EDIT playlist and put in order downloaded or whatever.  Click DONE and will put in new order.  My problem is I have to do this every time I open iTunes.  I agree it won't "stay" in the order set.  Especially a problem for downloaded books.  Need to make sure each playlist is in correct order before you sync.  <comment205868> When you say it changes the "number", do you mean the actual track number, or the number all the way to left of the track when viewing the playlist (as shown in [this screenshot](http://i.stack.imgur.com/YvU4z.png))? <comment205869> ah, there it is "kbd", not "key" :D <comment326659> Are you certain all the tracks on the album are "checked" so they are all *supposed* to be synced?
