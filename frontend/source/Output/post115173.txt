I'm presuming you asked this soon after Mavericks was out and 10.9 _(.0)_ was the version and 10.9.1 was not yet released? <comment145675> Any chance you would re-run your tests and document what versions are in place on a system that has been updated to 10.9.2? <comment145676> See my update ! <comment145677> 10.9.1 was released on December 16th. So it was already out. Mavericks GM 10.9.0 shipped with Safari 7.0, 10.9.1 came with Safari 7.0.1. <comment145678> Thanks. I don't think it's necessarily a bad thing that Recovery HD is stable. It will be interesting to see if/when it ever does get modified.
