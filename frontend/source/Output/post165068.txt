New Finder window opens maximized every time <body> For some reason, now every time I start Finder or ask for a new window, it occupies my entire screen (note this is strongnot full screen mode/strong, it is just normal screen mode but the Finder is resized maximally to fit the entire visible area, except the bar at the top).  I tried resizing this Finder window and closing, then restarting but end up getting a new Finder window that is resized occupying my entire workspace.  Any idea how to troubleshoot this?   Running Yosemite latest on MBP retina 13.  <answer165069> This problem is usually caused by the preference, you can try to remove the plist file temporarily. This file is in the directory code~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.finder.plist/code  <answer165078> Open a new window, resize it, then immediately close it. That tells Finder to remember the new size for all new windows. No need to throw away emall/em of your preferences just to change one.  <comment193620> yep that solved it -- thanks!
