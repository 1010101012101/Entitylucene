How do I unlock an iPhone 3GS? <body> I bought a second hand iPhone 3GS which is locked to AT&amp;T's network, I want to unlock it for use in the UK. I'm on the Redmond Pie site which can unlock and jailbreak it, but I don't know what version of iOS the phone is running. I can't figure this out either because opening Settings crashes.  <answer87469> I would strongcheck the serial number/strong (printed on the box or/if it wasn't replaced, behind the SIM tray/by entering DFU mode and checking in System Profiler or using the Identify feature in redsn0w) and, strongif it is old enough/strong to downgrade its baseband, strongrestore it/strong to the iOS version you'll want to use° and strongperform the jailbreak+iPad baseband and baseband downgrade/strong procedures.  °depending on available SHSH, of course  Seeing the poor condition of the existing system software you'll likely want to restore it anyway…  <answer89885> You can ask your service provider to unlock your Iphone 3GS.   <comment102190> Plugging the phone into a computer and looking at it in iTunes will reveal the iOS version. <comment102192> I've tried on itunes but phone does not show up, it also has no service on phone and I can't get past connect to itunes.................
