Reviewing Apple Store apps anonymously? <body> I have tested many apps and I would like to review them in the Apple Store. I use an iPad.   I don't want to review apps under the account my credit card is tied to.   How can I review apps anonymously?  <answer66307> You cannot review anonymously but Apple offers feedback through this form here.  <comment77417> That's not how the reviews work. Maybe make a blog? <comment77422> The two main reasons for anonymous reviews are: to improve the reviews of my own app, or to sabotage the reviews of my competition.  Apple has not yet figured out how to allow anonymous reviews without allowing these. <comment77429> @GEdgar my main reason for anonymity is to keep me save from attacks if I leave very critical feedback to totally junk apps and privacy. I wish Apple does not reveal my email and identity if they reveal my reviews. Well I don't care less actually but some way it would be cool to have anonymous feedback. <comment78006> I don't see why this question has garnered so many downvotes - it's a legitimate request, without an obvious answer. Presuming that the information is being sought for malicious purposes isn't a terribly-valid reason to downvote. <comment202393> Apple does not "reveal [your] email" when they publish reviews. They do publish your Apple ID username, but I believe this can be overridden if you review using iTunes on Mac/PC instead of doing so from your phone.
