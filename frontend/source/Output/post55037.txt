Lost audio while converting video files in OS X 10.7.4 <body> I was using Lion's conversion feature to change .MPG video files to a compatible format (set by OS X). The files are now viewable in QuickTime and iMovie, but the audio is completely gone. Has anyone else come across a similar issue? Would I by chance be missing a codec required to convert .MPG files correctly? Any help on this issue would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for your time.  <answer55047> Sounds like an issue with muxed audio. See here. Also, you might try converting them with Mpeg Streamclip, which is free software.  <comment63840> I'm assuming Apple doesn't support all conversion types, which is strange to me if they offer converting video files as an integrated feature. Thanks for your help!
