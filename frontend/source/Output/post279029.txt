Mac Freeze, iPhone Error Message with no iPhone <body> My MacOs Sierra freezes intermittently, especially while using Safari.In Console logs I see this message:  warning: dynamic accessors failed to find @property implementation for 'isPrimary' for entity ABCDPhoneNumber while resolving selector 'isPrimary' on class 'ABCDPhoneNumber'.  Did you remember to declare it @dynamic or @synthesized in the @implementation ?  What does this mean? I don't have an iPhone.
