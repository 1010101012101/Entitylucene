(Upgraded) Apple Notes out of sync between iPad and Mac <body> On my iPad (running iOS 9) I recently upgraded Notes.  However, on my Mac, its almost as if I didn't do the upgrade.  On my iPhone: I can utilize all the new formatting styles and features (checkboxes, lists, etc).  On my Mac: I cannot see any of the notes created on my iPad since the upgrade.  I can also not use any of the new features, they're all disabled in the tool bar.  I have removed and re-added the iCloud account from both the device and my mac, in an attempt to force an upgrade or sync on the mac.  But its not working.  Anyone have any ideas?  Thanks in advance!  <comment317645> What OS on the Mac? <comment318447> @Tetsujin Mac OS 10.11.6
