create custom links in OSX dock <body> I have a program that runs from the command line but not correctly from the icon in the applications menu. While I would like to figure that out, all I want right now is  way to create a link in the dock where I can click that link, and run the command that lauches the program correctly.   <answer188805> I use the platypus tool/framework to roll scripts into apps all the time:  ul lihttp://sveinbjorn.org/platypus//li /ul  The code for it is available and it's a free download with a request to donate financial support if you can/care.  <comment223559> Could you edit this if you feel the icon not working is relevant? What is the "applications menu" you speak of? A screen shot might help. I've edited out the second question but feel free to put that back in if it's clear how you have one thing to solve and not two.
