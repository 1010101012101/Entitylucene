How to secure multi-user remote desktop <body> I need to set up a multi-user remote desktop OSX server, which users will access using a remote desktop client, such as OSX screen sharing or VNC.   The administrator can just reset the user's password and log in as that user. What can be done to prevent this?  <comment309562> Full blown consulting is not something that we do here.  Your scope is actually quite large (a bit vague, too) and this is something you should outsource to a consultant/company for assistance if this is beyond your capabilities. <comment309566> @Allan Thanks for the tip. I'm not looking for "full blown consulting". I have removed the background information and simplified the question. <comment309567> The answer to the question, now as written, is pretty obvious:  don't make that user an Admin.  The Admin, by definition has access to reset passwords. <comment309568> @Allan The user accounts are standard accounts. I need an admin account to create user accounts. As an admin I don't want to be able to log in as those users.
