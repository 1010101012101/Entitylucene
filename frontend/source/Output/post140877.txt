Applescript File vs Alias <body> I have these two Applescript commands in which they both point to the same file  precodealias "Macintosh HD:Users:scott:Dropbox:Downloads:AppleScriptFinderGuide.pdf" file  "Macintosh HD:Users:scott:Dropbox:Downloads:AppleScriptFinderGuide.pdf" /code/pre  The alias command works just fine.  However the file command does not as it reports this error:  "Can’t get file "Macintosh HD:Users:scott:Dropbox:Downloads:AppleScriptFinderGuide.pdf"."  Any idea why the file command fails?  Thanks in advance, Scott  <answer140882> You are not referencing the file correctly.  Try  precodetell application "Finder" to set myFile to file "Macintosh HD:Users:scott:Dropbox:Downloads:AppleScriptFinderGuide.pdf" /code/pre  <answer141094> It's not an alias or file emcommand/em - these are emobject specifiers/em.  AppleScript proper does not recognize a standard file object, although many applications such as the Finder do.  You emcan/em create a file URL object (similar to a file object) outside of an application context that most apps will recognize:  precodeset myFile to "Macintosh HD:Users:scott:Dropbox:Downloads:AppleScriptFinderGuide.pdf" as «class furl»  tell application "Finder"   reveal myFile end tell /code/pre  But in general I use aliases everywhere or plain-text HFS path strings, because these can be coerced to anything necessary without having to worry about quoting spaces or special characters.  <comment166014> shouldn't file get the path with slashes / instead of semi colon : ? <comment166020> colons are used for Applescript paths.  I know its very old skool well so is Applescript.
