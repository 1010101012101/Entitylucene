After reboot, Safari and Microsoft Outlook hang when trying to access passwords <body> Have recently rebooted after not doing do for some time. I have forgotten my keychain password, or passwords had thought they were same as my log on password. I now cannot get MS outlook to work and Safari runs very slowly with coloured spinning wheel appearing. Is there any way I can bypass or ignore keychain passwords? I just need outlook and Safari to work properly. FileVault is not switched on.  Any help/advice greatly appreciated.
