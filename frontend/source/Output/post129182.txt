What Support Files, Programs, or Libraries does Burn Need to Support FLAC? <body> I used Burn on my previous iMac for years, starting with Snow Leopard (or maybe Leopard, it's been a while) up through Mavericks and never had a problem.  Now I've upgraded to a new iMac, running Mavericks (10.9.2) and I've installed Burn (2.5.1) and I've also installed ffmpeg (2.2.1).  (I know ffmpeg is more for MP3 than FLAC.)  I tried to burn a CD from FLAC files with Burn and it won't work.  When I'm trying to burn an audio CD (using the Audio CD mode), I drag and drop a FLAC file into Burn, the drop-down dialog shows up, but promptly slides back up into the title bar so I can't even see what message I'm getting.  (I think it's saying it's importing, but then nothing happens.)  The FLAC file never shows up on the list of files to burn.  I can't find any indication that Burn keeps any logs for me to check.  I've posted to the Burn help forum, but after three weeks I have not received any responses and I've emailed the developer and, after a week, I haven't received any response.  I see that Burn states, on the homepage, that it uses "ffmpeg, lame, liba52, movtoy4m, movtowav, vcdimager, dvdauthor, spumux, mkisofs and dvd-author."  However, when I look up those programs, not one specifies that it is used for FLAC conversion or reading.  I was able to add an MP3 file to the file list for an AudioCD, so the issue is getting Burn to handle a FLAC file.  What do I need to do to get Burn to work with FLAC?
