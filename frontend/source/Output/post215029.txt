How many GPUs my macbook pro has? <body> I am trying to find how many GPUs has my macbook pro and if I have some of them, what are their characteristics. I though I can find it from codeAbout this mac/code - codeSystem Report/code - codeHardware/code, but was not able to find anything.  <comment259676> The information is on Wikipedia if you lookup your Model Number. You either have a single dedicated (NVIDIA or Radeon) GPU, a single Intel GPU (built-in to your CPU), or both. <comment259677> @Dai thank you. Is there any command I can type in my shell to get this info? <comment259678> Run `system_profiler | grep "Model Identifier"`. <comment259679> Or just `sysctl hw.model`. <comment259692> But there is an information about graphics cards in "Hardware" section in "System Report" It's under "Graphics/Displays". There's a list of internal Graphics Cards. (on my 13" I only have one, but on 15" I see there are two Intel&nVidia )
