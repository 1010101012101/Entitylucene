Safari automatically appends .txt extension to .ino files <body> When I download an code.ino/code file in OS X, my files are automatically converted to code.ino.txt/code and opened by TextEdit app, even though, I have installed Arduino IDE. How can I close this feature?    <answer239319> It seems that this is a server issue. And one can't solve the issue by changing safari settings. The answers to the same question I found are in the below.  iMeowbot user in macrumors says that:     "This filename modification stuff isn't something that Apple made up,   it comes straight out of RFC 2183 (see "2.3 The Filename Parameter"   and "5. Security Considerations"). While that RFC talks about   "messages" and "mail" it applies equally to the Web, as HTTP employs   MIME.      OS X and Safari have no way to read the mind of the server operator,   and cannot tell if a mismatched media type and filename are accidental   or intentional. So, they follow the standard.      Recent Safari versions add additional checks, such as that annoying   prompt for when something appears to contain an executable file. It's   all part of the same healthy paranoia that helps ensure that the end   user knows exactly what a remote server is attempting to send."   http://forums.macrumors.com/threads/safari-adding-txt-to-a-m4v-download.167086/  TETENAL user in macnn says that:     "AFAIK the Apache server software comes with a preset of   extension-MIME-type assignments. If a file with an unknown extension   (like .dmg) is served with the MIME-type text as a fallback, Safari   adds a .txt extension. This behavior is arguably correct. The server   tells Safari it is serving a text-file, and a text file needs a .txt   extension on Mac to be opened with a text editor. So Safari adds one.   Other browsers ignore the server, which is a short term benefit for   the user, but in the long run a) makes the server admin not notice the   mistake and b) prevents the server admin to use this feature whenever   he intentionally wants to (as opposed to unintentionally doesn't care   as usually).      Anyway, to fix this you can create a file .htaccess to the respective   folder and correctly define the missing MIME-types by adding AddType   application/octet-stream .dmg or AddType application/x-stuffit .sit   and AddType application/x-stuffit .sitx etc."   http://forums.macnn.com/82/applications/339922/safari-apending-txt-file-extensions-how/  <comment275869> Seems like a safari problem, where it renames any possibly harmful files to `.txt`. <comment275870> This is not an Arduino specific question, and should be migrated to SE Ask Different. <comment275871> It's not happening to me. If I download http://gammon.com.au/Arduino/Temperature_Monitor.ino it appears as a .ino file. <comment275872> I don't how to migrate a question. I agree with you this is not completely an Arduino question , however I thought Arduino users may be more familiar with this issue. <comment275873> Moderators migrate questions. You could provide more information, such as the place you got this .ino file from (link). <comment275953> Any .ino file is downloaded as .ino.txt no matter from where I download it. <comment293699> Welcome to Ask Different!
