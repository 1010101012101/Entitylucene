Superdrive doesn't accept disks any more <body> I have two Superdrives. Since the upgrade to 10.11 (it might just coincide) they don't accept disks any more. I tried rebooting, sending eject commands to both drives etc.  They appear as "Unsupported" in drutil but look fine in "About This Mac" Storage.  precode   $ drutil list    Vendor   Product           Rev   Bus       SupportLevel 1  Apple    SuperDrive        2.00  USB       Unsupported 2  Apple    SuperDrive        2.00  USB       Unsupported /code/pre  I tried running drutil against both with all sorts of parameters (getconfig, info etc.).  I also tried rebooting the Mac and disconnnecting it from power for a minute. (It's a Late 2013 iMac.)  strongUpdate/strong  Found this Apple support community thread: Superdrive not loading discs after upgrading to El Capitan  And I did try the drives with my AirBook (also El Capitan) as well with the same result.  <answer255464> Never could find out what happened. I bought to new drives (not Apple-made) and they work.  <comment259323> I did try the thing with the mbasd=1 suggested in the thread linked to no avail.
