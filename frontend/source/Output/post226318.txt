Filevault makes my external HD inaccessible on OS X but still works on Ubuntu <body> I'm running OS X El Capitan 10.11.3  I have an external drive with 2 partitions. 1 partition is for Time Machine while the other is for storing my data (Volume name is Data).  So a few days ago I tried to encrypt my Data volume using Filevault. I did this by right clicking the volume and then select Encrypt. It then asked for the usual stuff like my password, passphrase, password hint, and so on. After I entered all the information, the drive immediately disconnected and then showed the following error a minute later:     The disk you inserted was not readable by this computer.   I figured that the OS might be in the process of encrypting the volume. I became curious after a few hours when the Activity Monitor is not showing any meaningful read/write activity. I remount the drive, it prompted me to enter my passphrase and the OS showed the same error (The disk you inserted was not readable)  Disk Utility shows this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZvFh1.png" alt="disk utility"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5tHoo.png" alt="enter image description here"  The Data volume is greyed out. Running First Aid on the volume returned the error:  precodeVerifying storage system Checking volume disk2s2: Scan for Volume Headers Invalid Volume Header @ 0:i/o error Invalid Volume Header @ 2000376299008: I/O error disk2s2 is not a CoreStorage volume Storage system check exit code is 1 Storage system verify or repair failed Operation failed /code/pre  I went to terminal and then executed the following command:  precodedisktutil cs list /code/pre  The result:  precodeLogical Volume Group 21DF7ED1-5903-4BDB-B61E-B0DAAD81D62D ========================================================= Name:         Data Status:       Online Size:         2000376299520 B (2.0 TB) Free Space:   19005440 B (19.0 MB) | +-&lt; Physical Volume 5AFAD9E1-6DFC-4CF4-B7DE-657753802193 |   ---------------------------------------------------- |   Index:    0 |   Disk:     disk2s2 |   Status:   Online |   Size:     2000376299520 B (2.0 TB) | +-&gt; Logical Volume Family C6DD2502-7581-44E1-96DD-C6CCA75CDC40     ----------------------------------------------------------     Encryption Type:         AES-XTS     Encryption Status:       Unlocked     Conversion Status:       Converting     High Level Queries:      Not Fully Secure     |                        Passphrase Required     |                        Accepts New Users     |                        Has Visible Users     |                        Has Volume Key     |     +-&gt; Logical Volume 6239E8ED-8CEC-471A-893E-37B0D61970D0         ---------------------------------------------------         Disk:                  disk3         Status:                Online         Size (Total):          2000004972544 B (2.0 TB)         Conversion Progress:   Paused         Revertible:            Yes (no decryption required)         LV Name:               Data         Content Hint:          Apple_HFS /code/pre  I then saw the progress as 'Paused'. I let this run for a few hours and the status still did not change. I figured maybe I can revert the encryption process so I ran the following command:  precodediskutil cs revert 6239E8ED-8CEC-471A-893E-37B0D61970D0 /code/pre  The OS returned the following error  precodeStarted CoreStorage operation on disk3 Error: -69854: A disk with a mount point is required /code/pre  The OS also now showed an alert that Time Machine (which is located on the other partition of the same drive) was not able to perform the latest backup.  At this point, the drive could not be unmounted at all. The OS will say the drive is still in use.  I then tried booting into recovery mode to repair permissions and run first aids,repair disk, etc but all failed.  As a last resort, I installed Ubuntu via VMWare Fusion to see if I can mount the drive there. To my surprise, Ubuntu managed to mount,read and access the files with the help of hfsprog. I guess this makes sense because OS X still has not started the conversion so none of the files are encrypted.  I'm at loss on what's happening. Any suggestion on what I can do to make the drive mountable again on OS X?
