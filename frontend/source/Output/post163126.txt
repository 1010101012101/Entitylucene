iTunes and iPhone disagree on memory usage <body> There is a large discrepancy between the memory usage as reported by my iPhone and that as reported by iTunes - as well as between iTunes' Settings pages for the iPhone and the iTunes memory bar at the bottom of the screen.  iTunes reports that the iPhone is set to sync my entire music library,  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Qt4tL.png" alt="iTunes main"  but also claims that only about one third of my songs are actually stored on the phone.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WxwrO.png" alt="iTunes memory bar"  (I'm old fashioned; I still buy and rip my own CDs, and I don't use any cloud services.)  Furthermore the phone itself reports that the amount of memory being used for music is three times as much as shown in iTunes.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HD0M5.png" alt="iPhone"  (I don't know how to get the phone to show a count of songs.)  Does anyone know what I need to do to get these numbers to agree?  <comment190929> When I run into similar issues in the past, a reboot of all devices involved (Mac and iPhone) usually fixed it. If you've already tried that, can you please add some screenshots showing the different usage reports so that people trying to answer your question see the same things as you do? <comment191369> You can find out the number of music titles on your phone via Settings - General - Info.
