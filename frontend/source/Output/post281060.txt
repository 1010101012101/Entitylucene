USB external hard drive starts up then disconnects <body> I have a Seagate External backup drive (2TB).  It was erratic showing up on my MacBook Pro, but I thought that was the compatibility bug we were having with the new operating system.  Now, when I turn on the drive, it spins up and briefly appears in diskUtil.  I can see it and if I'm quick enough, I can get it to mount, but it then disconnects almost instantly, before I can use it at all.  Any ideas?  <comment353630> Welcome to Ask Different.
