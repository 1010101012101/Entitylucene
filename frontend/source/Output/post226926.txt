Automate Safari form filling <body> I have a Numbers spreadsheet with lots of data (currently at 275 rows, 14 columns each).  I need to submit this data to a web form, one row per form submission, each column going into a text box on the webpage.  I foresee a day spent copy-pasting and am dreading it.  Is there some way to automate this process?    The webpage requires authentication (i.e. I have submitted a password on a previous page), just in case that complication is relevant to any answers.  <comment275651> How good are you with AppleScript?  Unless the website has an import function (not likely) then it could be automated with AppleScript.  (tell Safari do JavaScript etc..)  Setting it up is not trivial, but if this is something you plan on doing again and again, it may be worth the effort of scripting.
