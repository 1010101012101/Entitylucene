Historically, how long does it take for MBP/MBA to reach the refurbished store after release? <body> From the previous releases of the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro, how long is the gap between the devices being released and appearing on the Apple refurbished website?  <answer68333> It can happen any time after the first machine exits the initial 90 day phone warranty. As soon as Apple has a used machine returned to them, it will be reformatted, cleaned up, and repackaged. Once Apple has enough to sell again, they go on sale as refurbished models.
