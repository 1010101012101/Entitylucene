Keyboard App Shortcuts not working in Google Docs <body> I often use Google docs, and have to switch between Windows and OSX as well.  I setup App Shortcuts (All Applications) in the keyboard preferences so that kbdControl/kbd+kbdC/kbd is for copy,  kbdControl/kbd+kbdZ/kbd is for strongundo/strong etc. They work well on most applications, and copy pasting from normal HTML sites to say, the Notes application works with these applications.  On Google Docs however, the controls still remain triggered by kbd⌘/kbd. I.e. kbd⌘/kbd+kbdZ/kbd is what causes an Undo operation. When I use kbdControl/kbd+kbdZ/kbd, I can strongsee the Edit Menu flash blue for a second, but there is no effect/strong on the doc I am editing.  This is the case for both Chrome and Safari. How do I make kbdControl/kbd+kbdZ/kbd cause undo on docs?  I do not wish to swap the kbdControl/kbd and kbdCommand/kbd keys (many friends advised I do this via keyboard preferences), as it would create difficulties for other functions.
