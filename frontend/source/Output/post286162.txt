My iPhone is doing math wrong <body> See the images, it's an iPhone 6s, with iOS 10.3.2, does any one have the same issue ? It seems specific to any fraction with three digits after the comma on the denominator within spotlight:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5AIIc.png" width="375" height="667"/  Also, to add some information, it comes back to correct result when I add (or remove) a digit (see image)  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LiZjh.png" width="375" height="667"/  And I have a correct result when it is with coma on both numerator and denominator: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/iuSV5.png" width="375" height="667"/  <answer286166> I get different results based on whether 1,8/0.083 is used or 1.8/0.083 is used both in spotlight on iOS and macOS.  It would appear that the comma kbd,/kbd is ignored and the number is treated as non decimal.  Attached are the results.  One could verify if the region settings make a difference by changing them temporarily to UK or another region.  h2iOS:/h2  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/BkL46m.png" alt="1,8/0.083 iOS"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/P7lPvm.png" alt="1.8/0.083 iOS"  h2macOS:/h2  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5G7Qg.png" alt="1,8/0.083 macOS"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lrPW6.png" alt="1.8/0.083 macOS"  h2Compare Wolfram Alpha results:/h2  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/T2nDj.png" alt="wolfram alpha 1,8/0.083"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fYW4E.png" alt="Wolfram Alpha 1.8/0.083"  <comment360995> When I enter 1,8/0.83 on my phone running iOS 10 it returns: 216.8674698795   My Region is set to United States.  It appears you may be in Qu√©bec?  What are your region settings set to?  General  Language and Region <comment360996> Yes, it is french canadian. Your result is still wrong though.. <comment360998> Yes, results are correct with the calculator. They are also right with osx spotlight. <comment360999> macOS spotlight gives me the same result but only if I type exactly as you have it 1,8/0.083  if I type 1.8/0.083 I get 19.3548387097  comma or point seems to make a difference. <comment361000> I got the correct result if I use 1.8/0.083 or 1,8/0.083 with spotlight on macOS. And the correct result should be 21.68674... You got 19.35 with the exact same formula ? <comment361001> Interesting, your third capture shows 18/0.083 (in the results) even if you enter 1,8/0.083 <comment361002> I think because it ignores the , as it is not a valid decimal point.  The comma, at least on my devices, is for thousands separator. (even though it shows on the iOS spotlight version, it appears to be ignored) Answer edited
