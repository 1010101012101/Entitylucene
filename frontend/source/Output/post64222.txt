iPod Touch 4gen internet connection issues <body> Today I have a problem on my iPod Touch where there is a problem with internet connection using browsers (e.g. Google Chrome and Mobile Safari) but I also use Skype and it is working normally with no issues .  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GHe7p.png" alt="enter image description here"  I assume that it is not a problem with WiFi connection because Skype works on my device and I can send messages and receive messages and I don't understand why the browsers are not working.  <answer64317> I have made this solution:  ul liOpen Settings/li liOpen General/li liOpen Reset/li liReset Network Settings/li /ul  This process helped me.  <comment75371> Is it jailbroken?
