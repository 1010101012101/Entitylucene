Finder folders have no triangle to twirl <body> I am running 10.9.5 and some folders in list view have no triangles by the subfolders. I would love to know why this happening and how to fix.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Mkxro.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer171407> I think you have set the folder to be "Arranged By..." something e.g. name.  Go to the View menu; choose "Arrange By", then "None".  You can still sort the columns.  <answer171408> Make sure the Arrange By option is set to None.
