Are there any new hidden features in the latest iOS update 9.3? <body> I just updated my iPhone 5S to the latest version of iOS (9.3). On the official Apple website, they list some of the most important new features of this release. My question is: are there any other hidden features (even minor changes) that may haven't be listed there? Thanks in advance.
