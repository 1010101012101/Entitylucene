Obtaining a particular effect called "Lazy Mouse Smoothing" in a graphics application <body> I'm using Pixelmator and Autodesk Sketchbook for drawing and I'd really love to have "lazy mouse smoothing".  This is a feature found in an application called LazyNezumi, for Windows, that adds lag smoothing to the mouse.  Does anyone know of a solution for OS X?  <answer57922> I've had a look around and can't find any specific sites that show how to enable/use 'lazy mouse smoothing' on OSX.  EDIT: Unless this does the job (SmoothCursor): http://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/41736/smooth-cursor/ - emhave not used and am not affiliated with the app/company/em     SmoothCursor is a little utility that allows you to customize the acceleration settings of your mouse or trackpad separately. Totally recommended for drawing applications and FPS games*!    Developer's site: http://apps.leftbee.net/SmoothCursor  LazyNezumi itself states:     I’m sorry but there is no Mac support, and I don’t plan on ever providing any (this was already tricky enough to program for Windows, and I’ve never owned a Mac or programmed with them).   <answer240206> There's a new tool for Mac that is very similar:  http://www.hejbrush.com/apps  <comment295122> Welcome to Ask Different!
