Bluetooth mouse not found <body> I just received a Kensington Expert Wireless Trackball as a gift.  It is supposed to be able to use Bluetooth as well as the 2.4 GHz USB hookup.  I can't get my old OS X Yosemite (10.10.5) iMac to pick it up using normal bluetooth, but my MacBook Pro w/ El Capitan picks it up just fine.  It just doesn't show up in the list.  I have a bluetooth keyboard (standard Apple keyboard), and mouse (cheap-o Uhuru mouse) that work on the iMac.  I have tried:  ol liUnplugging USB and restarting/li liShutting off wifi/li liResetting SMB/li liDeleting com.apple.Bluetooth.plist/li /ol  How do I troubleshoot what's going on here?
