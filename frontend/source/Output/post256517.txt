How can i change the default screen output permanently on a Macbook air <body> The screen on my Mac is broken and I am using a external screen running on the MiniDisplay port. After starting up the computer, the screen is output through the MiniDisplay port and every thing works great.  However, when I try to use Startup Manager or the Single User mode my MacBook uses the default screen, which is broken. Is there a way (command line or script) to change the default screen output permanently?
