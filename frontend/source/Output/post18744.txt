Unsaved Files in OS X Lion <body> Where do unsaved files go in Lion?  I quit TextEdit without saving since I had no intention of saving, but with autosave the file still got save somewhere since when I reopen TextEdit the file I was working on is there (even tough I disabled resume .&lt;). So I was wondering were did that file get saved?  <answer18751> According to John Siracusa's review of Lion it is saved in /.DocumentRevisions-V100  <answer18798> According to Apple's developer documentation, any new documents that you haven't yet saved explicitly are autosaved in code~/Library/Autosave Information/code:     Automatic document saving is supported by the implementation of emautosaving in place/em. Autosaving in place and autosaving elsewhere both protect against the user losing work due to application crashes, kernel panics, and power failures. However, autosaving in place differs from autosaving elsewhere in that it overwrites the actual document file rather than writing a new file next to it containing the autosaved document contents. (Autosaving in place performs a safe save by writing to a new file first, then moving it into the place of the document file when done.)      The document architecture still uses autosaving elsewhere to save untitled documents that have content but have not been explicitly saved and named by the user. In this case, untitled documents are autosaved in code~/Library/Autosave Information/code. In addition, codeNSDocument/code saves earlier revisions of documents elsewhere, giving the user access to previous versions.   The part that says “In addition, codeNSDocument/code saves earlier revisions of documents elsewhere” refers to the hidden code.DocumentRevisions-V100/code folder I assume.  So if you've had the new document open sufficiently long for it to have been autosaved more than once, this all should imply that the latest version is stored in a file in code~/Library/Autosave Information/code while earlier versions have been stored in the code.DocumentRevisions-V100/code folder (at the root of the drive on which your home folder resides).  strongSide note:/strong this does leave me wondering whether the files in code~/Library/Autosave Information/code also get automatically deleted at some point, to avoid piling up these types of quick TextEdit documents you had no intention of saving. The Library is not a folder that inexperienced users should have to muck about in; and as far as I understood, Lion now even hides it by default. I presume its contents also don't show up in Spotlight. If the files don't get automatically deleted, the Desktop or the Documents folder would have seemed to be better destinations for autosaving.  <answer22100> h1~/Library/Containers/h1  This directory serves strongmultiple/strong purposes, some of which may be not yet documented by Apple.   h2Untitled, Unsaved documents for supporting applications/h2  Applications such as Preview and TextEdit.  h3Example/h3  Copy an image to your clipboard. Open Preview, close all windows, use the strongNew from Clipboard/strong command, quit.   Open TextEdit, close all windows, type something in a new window, quit.   In Terminal, run two commands:   codels -@l ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.Preview/Data/Library/Autosave\ Information/code  codels -@l ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.TextEdit/Data/Library/Autosave\ Information/code  emUnsaved…/em files will be listed.  h2System-saved versions of user-saved files, where the file system or volume does not support permanent version storage/h2  File systems such as MS-DOS (FAT); volumes mounted using AFP 3.3 or SMB; and so on.   h3Example/h3  Make an AFP or SMB connection to a file server. Use Preview to open an image on that server, edit that image, quit without saving a version, disconnect from the server.   In Terminal, run a command:   codels -lrt ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.Preview/Data/Library/Autosave\ Information/code  At the foot of the list will be a directory that contains the version automatically saved by the System.   In the same network environment: if you re-open Preview, the system may reconnect to the file server. Then in a version browser view of the emremote/em file, the timeline will include a emlocal/em file.   (I could go into greater detail, but it would be off-topic from the opening question.)  h2Other purposes/h2  Beyond the two purposes noted above, code~/Library/Containers/code may have other purposes.   h2Hint/h2  Allow the System to manage files in these areas.   Avoid dataloss; do strongnot/strong attempt unnecessary changes to code~/Library/code or its subdirectories.   <answer22115> The primary place to look for unsaved changes for TextEdit is code~/Library/Containers/com.apple.TextEdit/Data/Library/Autosave Information//code  It depends on the state of the document, and it is complicated (since unsaved changes could also exist once the file has been saved and named the first time).   hr  h3Unsaved documents/h3  The first type —  the "behind the scenes" starter files — start as temporary files in code/private/var/folders//code… and are eventually stored in code~/Library/Containers//code. They are named stronguntitled/strong and stronguntitled 2/strong and so on. Each app gets it's own directory, and for TextEdit - you'll look for a file like code~/Library/Containers/com.apple.TextEdit/Data/Library/Autosave Information/Unsaved TextEdit Document.rtf/code  These untitled documents do not get a proxy icon in the title bar — just the name chosen by TextEdit:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/50V1j.png" alt="screenshot of an untitled document in TextEdit"  You don't get any versions, locking or notification of changes other than the normal undo/redo buffer with these unsaved files.   kbd⌘/kbd+kbdS/kbd  The first strongSave/strong enables the versioned storage and all that goes along with it. This is when the file gets a more familiar location in the file system, a chance for a name other than stronguntitled X/strong. The proxy icon is the clue this is no longer an AutoSave document.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/XlvT0.png" alt="screenshot of a saved document, without edition, in TextEdit"  The file is no longer stored solely in code~/Library/Containers//code — the first edition is saved wherever the user chooses in the file open/save dialog.   h3Edition(s) to a saved document/h3  Any modification to a saved document will cause the word emEdited/em to appear in its title bar:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Svj3V.png" alt="screenshot of an edition in TextEdit"   The file above has:   ul lithe version that was explicitly saved by emyou/em /li liplus edition that is automatically saved by the emSystem/em./li /ul  At this point, you have the full range of tools to roll back changes with that file:  ul lithe undo buffer/li lithe auto save or versions data in code~/Library/Containers//code/li lithe last saved state in the filesystem/li lithe versions store from code/.DocumentRevisions-V100/code/li /ul  Saving a version will cause the word emEdited/em to disappear from the title bar. This is where a versions menu will be shown if you hover around the file name and an entire versions infrastructure takes over. I'll leave the mechanics of that for another answer - this is long enough.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/S08wR.png" alt="screenshot of the versions menu in TextEdit"  hr  Lots of other files get updated when TextEdit creates and modifies files:  ul lithe list of recent files/li lithe list of currently open files for when the app itself quits/li lithe state of the app to replay in case the Mac reboots (even unexpectedly)./li /ul  The System approaches to auto save and versions should ensure that:   ul lidata is never lost when TextEdit quits normally/li lino more than a few seconds of edition are lost if the application quits unexpectedly./li /ul  <answer23026> It seems the location for untitled, unsaved files varies from application to application. Use spotlight to find your unsaved temporary file, regardless of which autosave-enabled application you used to create it.  ol liStart the autosave-enabled application/li liNavigate to the window of the untitled document you want to locate in the file system/li liAdd a distinct string (e.g., zyzyx)/li liQuit the application/li liIn spotlight (command+space) type zyzyx/li liyour modified file should come up. Hover over it with the mouse to see a preview. Command click on the file to go to the enclosing folder in Finder./li /ol  <answer38675> I found my files in by doing a TM backup and was able to recover some of these unsaved edits (but not the one I was looking for). I found the files in the ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.TextEdit/Data/Library/Autosave Information/ folder.. So thanks and a TM back up might be of help for some..  <comment20517> the file is there (provided you have the hidden files), and you can access the file (provided you log in as the root user) there are a bunch of empty folders in the folder you mentioned, one of the few files there are is a plist file but it doesn't look like it hold unsaved files. <comment20520> You can also access that file through terminal but still no luck finding my unsaved file . <comment20523> @Samantha you should explore the SQLite database in it. From the review: *" … (`/.DocumentRevisions-V100/db-V1/db.sqlite`) containing tables for tracking files, the individual versions of those files (which Apple calls "generations"), and the storage location of the data."* <comment20525> My knowledge of SQL is a bit limited but I'll try my best XD <comment20528> Take a look at fseventer [http://fernlightning.com/doku.php?id=software:fseventer:start], it might be helpful to track it down! <comment21807> That page of the Ars Technica review is more focused on revisions to saved files; the question is about unsaved files. <comment24382> Interesting. In `~/Library/Autosave Information` I find nothing relating to TextEdit, but in that application I do have numerous *Untitled…* windows that resume. Maybe worth looking in/around answers under [Can I change how often Lion's "Versions" feature saves files?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/17936/8546). <comment24416> Can we stick to just how Text Edit works - it might not follow the general Lion idiom and there's clearly a lot of complexity already between temporary files, unsaved files and what happens once you actually save the file outside of the library and then have revisions to that same "file". <comment24422> Graham - the nub of my answer is an exact duplicate of yours, but forgive me if I write it up with a lot more words and in a very different manner of getting to the answer. The autosave information and alternate filesystems seemed to hurt my brain too much and I wanted a basic - this is all mac answer in addition to yours. <comment24451> I don't have a ~/Library/Contents/ folder PS My Library folders are not hidden <comment24470> @bmike no apology necessary but thank you :-) and I forgot about `/private/var/folders` et cetera, so [your answer](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/18744/unsaved-files-in-os-x-lion/22115#22115) has an up vote from me. This is definitely a question where a mixture of answers, short or long, add value. <comment24482> Fascinating for that to be missing. Have you [turned off autosave](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/19051/is-there-a-way-to-turn-off-autosave-feature-in-lion-os-x/19052#19052) or otherwise [locked folders in the **Saved Application State** folder](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/19051/is-there-a-way-to-turn-off-autosave-feature-in-lion-os-x/19052#19052) <comment24609> @Samantha I corrected `/Library/Contents` to read `/Library/Containers` … bmike, I made some other changes, hopefully not breaking the essence of your original. We have different writing styles so rollbacks etc. will cause no offence. Of particular interest (without giving examples): sometimes when *Edited* appears in the title bar, `~/Library/Containers` will contain at least one version explicitly saved by the user **but not** the edition automatically saved by the System. A movie as part of an answer (to a different but overlapping question) should help to make things clearer, but no rush. <comment24612> @Samantha showing `~/Library` temporarily is harmless (it's an alt/option key option in the Go menu of Finder). Showing it permanently is, I suggest cautiously, the thin end of a wedge. At other thicknesses in that wedge are notions such as preventing writes to certain areas ([example](http://blog.piefox.com/2011/07/lionsanity-removing-rough-edges-from-os.html)), some of which notions can certainly cause problems when least expected, so I encourage people to respect system behaviour at the thinnest end of the wedge … anything beyond that is generally at the users' risk. Hope that helps. <comment24614> I make the Library folder & all hidden files visible because as a developer I sometimes need to view the contents of those files but I definitely don't recommend messing with hidden files to the average user because if they mess something up they're going to find it hard to fix it . <comment24631> Found it!! ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.TextEdit/Data/Library/Autosave Information/Unsaved TextEdit Document.rtf <comment25711> Awesome use of spotlight! What locations other than `~/Library/Containers` have you uncovered? <comment26837> Keynote, Numbers, Pages : ~/Library/Autosave\ Information <comment82073> This was already mentioned in a comment 1 year ago. <comment93399> The important bit is what the tilde in `~/Library/Autosave Information` refers to. For regular apps, this is the user's home folder. But for sandboxed apps (e.g. TextEdit), this is actually `~/Library/Containers/com.company.AppIdentifier/Data`, giving an end result in TextEdit's case of: `~/Library/Containers/com.apple.TextEdit/Data/Library/Autosave Information`
