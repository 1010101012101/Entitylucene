iTunes output goes exclusively to Airport Express when it should not <body> My AirPlay setup is messed up since a few days : I have headsets plugged to an Airport Express (emAE/em) and it used to play music synchronously with my macmini, as expected.    One day, while I did not do anything special, the macmini stopped to play music as soon as I switched on the emAE/em headset, as if the music stream was redirected exclusively to the emAE/em.br Yet, iTunes is properly configured in multiple sources mode :  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Aa74w.png" alt="airplay sources"   If I uncheck the emFabrice's Airport/em source from iTunes and leave emComputer/em as the only source, the problem remains : music still played exclusively by the emAE/em ! Only switching off the emAE/em makes the macmini emits the music again.  I tried unplug/replug the emAE/em with no success. Next step would be to reinitialize it but I'm open to others suggestions.  <answer129834> By looking at the menu bar to see selected output device, I noticed that the Bluetooth icon was emON/em and thus interfering with Wifi Airplay.br By setting Bluetooth emOFF/em on the mac mini, it corrected the problem.  <comment151958> Hold ALT and click the music preferences on top of the menu bar. What output sources do you have selected?
