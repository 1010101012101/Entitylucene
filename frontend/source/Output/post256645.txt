Locale sensitive key stroke problem <body> I own a MBPro 2015, its physical keyboard layout is US-Q style. Since my primary language is Turkish, I use the keyboard with TR-Q layout.  In Turkish; we have these two characters:  precodeUppercase 'I', lowercase 'ı' Uppercase 'İ', lowercase 'i' /code/pre  where as English alphabet just has  precodeUppercase 'I', lowercase 'i' /code/pre  Now if I set my password as i1234567 in Turkish keyboard, I can't login when I switch to English keyboard (same applies for opposite scenario).   My question is; even though I write the same string with two different layout, why does it matter when it is used as a password ?  <comment320164> I wonder if there is locale dependent case changing going on somewhere in the password processing. <comment320165> It's like the keystrokes are compared instead of characters. BTW this does not happen in other services like GMail etc. <comment320206> Casing seems most likely, because i will uppercase to different characters in the US and Turkish locales. <comment320214> As I described in the question; I write the same string using lowercase i in Turkish instead of English. It's basically the same string. <comment320228> But if somewhere in the password processing the case is changed to uppercase, then the result will be different characters in the two different locales.  What happens if you use a password with uppercase I instead of i?
