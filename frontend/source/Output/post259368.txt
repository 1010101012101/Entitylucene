MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Early 2013) computer dies at 40+% <body> Within the last few months computer has been dying at 40+%  After dying the computer will show the low battery icon on the screen, but once charger is plugged in it shows the battery has well over the % at which the laptop should be shutting off.  This usually happens after a restart or opening the computer.  It will turn on, I sign in then it dies shortly thereafter.  Any thoughts?  From what I have read battery re-calibration should not be needed on this particular model.  Have read some bits about it being possible software issues but not sure the real cause.  <answer259370> Sure.  The battery has a bad cell.  Have it replaced.  <answer259380> Marc Wilson may be correct, but another thing to try since it's quick to do is to reset the SMC.   Since your MacBook Pro has a built-in battery, hereâ€™s what you do:  ol liShut down your computer/li liKeep the MagSafe adapter (or power cable) strongplugged in/strong./li liPress at the same time kbdshift/kbdkbdoption/kbdkbdcontrol/kbd (on the left side of the keyboard) strongemand/em/strong the kbdpower button/kbd/li liLet go/li liTurn your computer back on with the power button./li /ol  <comment324497> How many cycles does the battery have? (About this Mac - more information - battery) <comment324503> I flagged as a dupe because while there are very minor differences between the two models of MacBook Pro, the symptoms and answer are identical.
