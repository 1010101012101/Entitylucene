Turning off vibrate <body> This is about the standalone Messenger, not the main Facebook app.  Is there any way to disable vibration when receiving a message? Even if I'm already viewing the conversation it vibrates every time a message comes in. The main Facebook app doesn't so this, only the standalone Messenger.  The only way I've found to stop it is to turn off push notifications entirely, which I don't want to do.  <answer84043> You can change vibration settings by opening the Settings.app and selecting the "Sounds" option. The two first options are "Vibrate on Ring" and "Vibrate on Silent". Turn these off to disable all vibrations. strongHowever,/strong this will disable vibrations emsystem wide/em for all apps, not just Messages.  To get as close as possible to disabling vibrations for just the messages app:  ol liOpen Settings.app and navigate to "Sounds" - "Text Tone"./li liScroll to the top of the page and select "Vibration"/li liScroll to bottom of page (under "Custom") and select "Create New Vibration".  emNote: you can't create 0 vibration as you have to tap to start the "recording". However, you can tap it very lightly to start the "recording"./em/li liTap the screen strongvery lightly/strong and let the recording go until it stops. Like I mentioned, it is perfect, but very close - especially if you tap very lightly./li liSave the Recording (something like "Minimal Vibe") and assign that to you text tone vibration pattern./li /ol  Keep in mind, it is possible to override that vibration pattern when you set custom ringtones or vibration patterns on individual contacts, so if it isn't working quite right for you for certain contacts, be sure to check those settings. Or, the alternative would be to set the "Minimal Vibe" settings for just some particular contacts.  <answer97546> I solved this :)  ul liSettings App/li liNotice Center/li liScroll down to Facebook/li liRemove the "Sound" Checkbox/li /ul  Wolla, no sound nor vibration.  Good luck!  <comment120629> Thanks, but I don't want to turn off the vibrate feature system-wide. <comment120630> Not the notification vibrate. The vibration caused when you mute the phone and have the app open to that conversation (no notifications)
