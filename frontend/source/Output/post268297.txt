Old apple id keeps popping up on iphone <body> I recently changed the email address of my icloud account, and now I keep getting a popup asking me to sign in to icloud using my old email address (even though I'm currently signed in using the new one). Most things I've found have said that they only way to fix this is to sign out of icloud and sign back in, but I can't do that because my icloud backup is broken (and has been for TWO YEARS now, I took it to the genius bar and even they couldn't get it to work) so if I log out of icloud I will lose all of my photos/data. I also cannot backup to a computer (once again, took it to a genius bar and they couldn't get it to work), so if it deletes this data it is permanently gone.  Does anyone know of another way that I can get my old apple id to stop popping up on my phone? Or I guess even another way to backup all the content on my phone, so that it doesn't matter if apple deletes it? It's happening every 30 seconds or so so it's making my phone almost unusable. Seriously considering listening to my husband and just getting an android phone.  <comment336865> Did you actually [change the primary address](https://support.apple.com/HT202667), or did you set up a new ID with a new address?
