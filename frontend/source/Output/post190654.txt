iOS 8: Prevent Safari Mobile from reloading tabs by default <body> When switching between tabs in Safari Mobile -- Even within a few seconds -- Safari will automatically reload the tab.   This will happen more frequently between sessions: Switching between Safari Mobile to another app and back will cause every open page ("tab") to reload.   Not long ago, I found a tutorial explaining how to prevent Safari Mobile from reloading tabs while browsing that involved plugging in the iPhone, and making use of Safari Desktop's Development Web Inspector, similar to the method viewable in this tutorial: http://appletoolbox.com/2014/05/use-web-inspector-debug-mobile-safari/  To prevent the Mobile app from reloading tabs by default. However, the above tutorial is only for troubleshooting how a specific webpage appears on the iPhone, and I can no longer find the tutorial to prevent Safari from reloading all tabs each session.  Solutions tried have included:  Closing all other apps Clearing History and Website Data Restart Changing Settings  Safari  Open Links from "In Background" to "In New Tab" Resetting Network Settings Clearing available storage space  Reset All Settings Restore phone from backup  Tabs still reload. This is commonly attributed on the Apple Support and other threads I have read to "Memory Issues" or default behavior for "Memory Allocation":  http://forums.imore.com/ios-8/302019-safari-stop-reloading-my-pages.html  http://forums.macrumors.com/threads/sick-of-safari-reloading-pages.1807865/  http://www.reddit.com/r/ipad/comments/2gv2rb/does_ios_8_fix_the_constant_tab_reloads_in_safari/  Yet pages are visible and usable in the tab immediately after switching, but then reload anyway. Not good in poor coverage areas.   Is anyone aware of a true solution to prevent this automatic reloading behavior in Safari Mobile?   <comment226446> Excellent research! I know many people are irritated with this behavior. Hopefully someone has insight. <comment244776> The behaviour you describe is not systematic. The "normal" behaviour is to switch to the tab without reloading it. Safari does that. But, *sometimes*, Safari does reload the tab instead, and this is annoying. <comment318983> So did anyone found a solution to this problem ..? <comment341398> my intuition is that it relates to memory usage. if you are using "more" memory, then those tabs get closed, and need to be refreshed. if you are using "low" memory, then tabs stay loaded in the background
