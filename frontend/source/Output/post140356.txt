Tables across multiple pages in iWork <body> I am formatting a bi-lingual text for printing. For this I have decided to columnate the material however, due to the the limits of word-processors in general, I can't use the columns feature. What I decided to do is to use a chart in two columns, however I don't know how to make it spill over onto subsequent pages. How/can this be done?  P.S. If necessary, I'll attach a screencap of my Pages document.
