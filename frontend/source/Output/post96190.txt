Drag & Drop: How to prevent folders in my Dock to pop up as windows? <body> I have a folder in my dock where I want to drop files. When hovering over the icon, the folder always pops up as new Finder window. I want it to be a stack or a list. Is there a way to achieve this?  <answer101829> In Finder preferences (kbdâŒ˜ cmd/kbd + kbd,/kbd from Finder itself), unchecking "Spring-loaded folders and windows" will prevent a window from opening up when dragging files to a folder.  <comment112920> You can control-click on the folder and choose stack or list but that affects how it is shown when you click on it. I think you're talking about spring-loading and the control-click settings do not seem to affect this. <comment112930> Yes, I know and tried all three of these settings, they seem to have no effect for drag and drop. <comment112973> Might it, by any chance be a smart folder? If so then there is no way around this. <comment113155> No, it's not a smart folder, so I keep my hopes up. <comment119944> AFAIK this has no affect on **dock** folders, and the Finder window that appears when adding a file to such a folder. <comment120036> This prevents the folders in my Dock from popping up at all. So I could only copy/move into the parent folder. I need to drop files into the child folders.
