How to disable emoji I see sometimes while browsing? <body> Some time ago I saw emoji in my Google Plus and thought, that it is another crappy update, but seems like is it Mac OS who place them instead of text.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GRMeQ.png" alt="enter image description here"  How to turn them off?br Mac OS X 10.9.4  Or is it about Chrome 41.0?  <answer182979> Some sites automatically replace text smilies with emoji-style characters.  Stack Exchange doesn't &amp; the Mac doesn't by default [nor can I find any way to make it other than in specific apps like Skype &amp; Messages], so a simple test may be to look at this with both Chrome &amp; another browser &amp; see if one replaces  :') [colon apostrophe close bracket]   with    [emoji, unicode U+1F602 ]  If so, that's where to look.br If not, then that's what character was placed there by either the site in question, or the user who posted that message.  <comment217974> So it must be users who put this unicode into their messages (whether they want it or not) -- does it mean it is unlikely solvable? I doubt someone implement the unicode_emoji-ascii converter inside Mac OS or Chromium. <comment217983> If either a user has input emoji, or that site has auto-translated it to emoji - like with Messages,  then it is forever now emoji & can't really be auto-translated back. If, on the other hand, it was done client-side it could be turned off - like with Skype. From a single picture from a single site on a single browser it's impossible to tell which it is.
