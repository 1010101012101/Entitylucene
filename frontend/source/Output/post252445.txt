Macbook Pro 15" (mid-2015 El Capitan) Connection to 4K TV <body> I believe this sort of question has been asked aplenty, but even after some research, I'm having trouble determining how exactly to proceed because I am not getting 4k resolution at 60Hz.   strongemLaptop/em/strong: Macbook Pro 15" mid-2015, El Capitan, Intel Iris Pro graphics   strongemTV/em/strong: LG 4k TV (120Hz) that only has HDMI ports: http://www.bestbuy.com/site/lg-43-class-42-7-diag--led-2160p-smart-4k-ultra-hd-tv-black/4973347.p?id=bb4973347&amp;skuId=4973347  After connecting with a Thunderbolt-to-HDMI cord (please forgive me, I'm not sure the exact specs on this cord, but supposedly it's the "latest"), I'm unable to get the 4k resolution at 60Hz, and unfortunately can only get a much lower resolution at 60Hz:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3Tp1g.png" alt="display preferences on the TV"  I've read that a DisplayPort 1.2-compatible cable might be the solution, but doesn't the latest Thunderbolt cord "support" DisplayPort 1.2? Curious what recommendations anyone would have?   Thanks!
