Running ls -l on NFS mounted directory with a lot of files takes a long time <body> I have a directory on an Ubuntu 14.04 server with 30,000 files in it. When I NFS mount it on my MacBook Pro and run codels -l/code, there is a 90 second pause and then the files are listed. The same codels -l/code on an Ubuntu 16.04 server machine with the same NFS mount takes around one second.  Why is the codels -l/code on the MacBook Pro so slow? It takes the same amount of time, no matter how many times I run it.  <comment326235> What if you do it a second time?  Is it fast then?
