os x boot volume <body> was hoping someone might be able to help me figure this out  when i run the cmd "systemsetup -getstartupdisk" the output is "/Volumes/13/WINNT"  My hard drive setup is a gpt schema with three partitions  /dev/disk0s1 EFI.  /dev/disk0s2 Corestorage volume containing two logical volumes, one called "OS" which is jhfs+ encrypted and contains OS X Yosemite the second is called "13" and is jhfs+ case sensitive not encrypted with contains my itunes library.  /dev/disk0s3 Recovery HD.  What is the "WINNT" dir that is being shown by systemsetup, it does not exist?  The expected output should display /System/Library/CoreServices.  any insight would be grateful.  <comment222872> If I had to guess, it's possible that something doesn't expect two logical volumes, since that isn't a (strictly-speaking) normal setup. This may not be an issue, because the true volume that's booted in an encrypted Core Storage setup is actually the recovery disk (for the purposes of decryption). This fact is obfuscated for the user's benefit, but I'm guessing this feature may not be displaying the correct logical volume in a 2 logical volume setup. Assuming the Recovery partition doesn't have this issue, you should be able to boot with no problems. Again, this is mostly theory. <comment223022> Thanks for the reply, yes I have no problems booting everything works fine I was just curious, especially as it was showing a non existent folder with a name WINNT. Any ideas on how I could investigate this further, Ive been experimenting with bless and tried booting with different setups in fstab to no avail. Would anything about this be documented somewhere? <comment223023> Also what does the systemsetup cmd query to get this output? <comment223048> That is a good question. I'll do some digging as I'm curious myself as to where those results originate. It is somewhat to Apple's chagrin that the code used by `systemsetup` is obviously doing something different than the code in the recovery partition... Good code doesn't do that. <comment223052> Hi thanks for the reply. I ran a couple of dtrace scripts on the `systemsetup` and seen a couple of references to **/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/MachineSettings.framework/Versions/A/MachineSettings** and the `bless --getboot` cmd coming from systemsetup. When **I** run `bless --getboot` it shows the second lv 13 as the boot device but its strange that `systemsetup` is displaying WINNT which is directory that doesn't exist.
