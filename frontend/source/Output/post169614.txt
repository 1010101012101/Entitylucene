Missing hard disk space <body> I'm trying to figure out where my missing hard disk space is going.  I'm using codedu/code and codedf/code from the command line and there seems to be a clear discrepancy.  So here's the codedu/code output:  precode$ sudo du -h -d 1 /  59M    /.DocumentRevisions-V100 1.9M    /.fseventsd   0B    /.PKInstallSandboxManager 1.6G    /.Spotlight-V100   0B    /.Trashes   0B    /.vol  20G    /Applications 2.6M    /bin   0B    /cores 5.0K    /dev 1.0K    /home 4.6G    /Library 1.0K    /net   0B    /Network  78M    /opt 7.2G    /private 1020K   /sbin  11G    /System 264G    /Users 1.7G    /usr 4.0K    /Volumes 310G    / /code/pre  Now here's the codedf/code output:  precode$ df -h Filesystem      Size   Used  Avail Capacity   iused    ifree %iused  Mounted on /dev/disk1     465Gi  417Gi   48Gi    90% 109334564 12511744   90%   / devfs          213Ki  213Ki    0Bi   100%       737        0  100%   /dev map -hosts       0Bi    0Bi    0Bi   100%         0        0  100%   /net map auto_home    0Bi    0Bi    0Bi   100%         0        0  100%   /home /code/pre  codedf/code is showing me 417gb used and codedu/code is showing 310gb used.  How do I find the 100 missing gigabytes?  I'm running OS X 10.9.5 on a 2013 512gb MacBook Air.  <comment199276> If the system hasn't been rebooted for a while, I would do this first and run du/df again. <comment199281> 3 thoughts: Have you tried disk utility  verify and repair disk? Have you tried a GUI analyzer like disk inventory x (http://www.derlien.com/)? Have you tried including the -r flag ("Generate messages about directories that cannot be read"). See 'man du' <comment199298> the `-r` flag is the default according to my `man du`.  I've rebooted just a few hours ago.  I'll run the disk verification.
