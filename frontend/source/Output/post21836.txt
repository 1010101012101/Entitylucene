Installed GarageBand Jam Pack 2 Remix Tools but can't find it <body> The installer installed it to my hard drive but I don't see an icon that I'm supposed to click on to access it.  Can anyone help me understand this  <answer21849> The Jam Pack installs additional loops etc. which are accessible inside GarageBand only.  <answer21851> You access the instruments and loops from within the GarageBand application. Instruments will be added to the pane on the right, under the Software Instruments: Browse tab.  Loops will be in the Loop Browser. In GarageBand, pull down the Control menu and choose "Show Loop Browser".  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6S7NL.png" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5Sx4l.png" alt="enter link description here"
