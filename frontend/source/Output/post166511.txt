How to stream music from a Mac to an iOS device? <body> I have an MP3 file that I'd like to stream from my Mac to an iOS. I think VLC can be used to achieve this, but I couldn't find the right settings on the VLC app and in iOS.   If I pick RTP multicast, for instance, how can I listen to this stream in iOS?  Eventually, I'd like to be able to do this from a live audio from the microphone, but I think the MP3 stage should come first.  Any thoughts?  <answer166525> Airfoil from Rogue Amoeba can stream audio from the Mac to many other devices, including iOS. It will capture any audio running on your system, either from a specific input (e.g. Mic), application, or the entire system audio.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/OxCGm.png" alt="&quot;Select a source&quot; menu from Airfoil"     strongAirfoil Speakers Touch/strong       Airfoil Speakers Touch runs on iPhones, iPods   Touch, and iPads running iOS 4.0 or higher. Use it to send audio to   your iOS device when connected to your local network! Airfoil Speakers   Touch works exclusively with Airfoil for Mac and Airfoil for Windows.   <comment195170> if you want this to be from a microphone eventually, can you just skip ahead to this? skype can certainly stream audo from a mac to a phone.
