Slowness around Messages in iOS <body> I have a couple of different symptoms of extreme slowness in Messages which I think are related:  ul liOpening the Messages app itself sometimes takes 20+ seconds/li liOpening a conversation within Messages takes 10+ seconds, often loading just the most recent message instead of the whole history/li liOpening up Messages settings in the Settings app takes 10+ seconds/li liDeleting old messages doesn't appear to "take". I delete the conversations, then come back later and they are back/li liThe "Keep Messages for 30 Days" setting isn't working either - I have it turned on and still have conversations from 2 years ago hanging around. /li liEven after deleting everything and rebooting, my data usage for Messages in Settings  General  Usage  Manage Storage doesn't change (it's at 662 MB)/li /ul  This is on an iPhone 6, iOS 8.2  I've tried deleting (all) Messages conversations and also rebooting the device a number of times. My goal is to find a workaround or fix for this that doesn't include a factory reset, any ideas?  <comment212666> It's an iPhone 6 on iOS 8.2, edited into question body <comment212667> tbh, any weirdness like that & first thing I'd do if a simple reboot doesn't help is [to iTunes] Sync; Backup; Restore.
