Messages on OS X: control the default account for contacting a person? <body> For several contacts in my address book, I have both a Google Talk and an AIM handle. Messages on OS X (10.9.2) seems to always default to the AIM-based account for these people when they're signed into both, but I'd like to change that to use Google Talk by default. I can't find any way in the contact's Info window to change this.  <answer123562> Figured it out: under Messages' Preferences: Accounts options, the sort order of the accounts controls the ordering when sending a message. Dragging and dropping my Google Talk account above AIM fixed it (though this applies to all contacts, I can't find a way to change it on a per-person basis.)  Preferences:  Before:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ItosB.png" alt="Accounts before"  After:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nDC3R.png" alt="Accounts after"
