Dump a user's mailbox to a file (e.g., .mbox) from server for archival <body> My company has a policy that when an employee leaves, we need to dump their e-mail account and write it to a DVD to archive it.  How do you dump a particular user's e-mail into a .mbox or other archivable file format from the server (without access to the client-side of the user's e-mail account)?  I didn't see any options in the Server.app GUI, so is there a Terminal command I can use?
