All of my files in home directory have 0620 file permission <body> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WXN8L.png" alt="enter image description here"  I don't the the exact reason why, but all the files in my home directory have 0620 file permission. What I remember is that I setup file sharing in System Preference.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/aJLY2.png" alt="enter image description here"  Now, when I try to delete file in my home directory, this dialog box pops up to ask the password. I modified all the files back to permission 0774, but I still can't delete the file without answering the password.   What went wrong? How can I get the system back to normal? I use Mac OS X Lion 10.7.2.  h2ADDED/h2  Refer to this post also  <answer26650> You must set the permissions of the folder the files are in as well.  <comment30386> Which means going up to the /Users folder and setting 0774 'apply to enclosed items' <comment34686> 'apply to enclosed items' is dangerous, as it wipes out the existing permissions -- especially when the permissions you're applying are something weird like 774 (that's probably not what you want on *anything*, let alone everything). <comment34716> @Lyken No, this is not the idea. Changing the permissions on folder itself (without recursing down) should be enough for the problem described.
