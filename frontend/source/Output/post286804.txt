How can I control/see automatic converting RAW images to JPEG from iOS? <body> I want to use my iPad for photography tasks such as strongimporting pictures, using a third party App to modify them, and store them back to the Photos app./strong However, I never really know if Photos is converting my pictures after an import or not.      What indicates the format of a photo in iOS? How can I have control or   a detailed view over the progress of converting it to JPEG from RAW?   <comment362170> What makes you think it was ever stored in RAW... or are the originals not from the iPad/camera app? 'What indicates the format' is usually the original file name IMG = jpg; DSC_ = sRGB RAW;  _DSC = Adobe98 RAW [other manufacturers may use .DNG,  .NEF or .CR2 etc as file extensions for further identification]
