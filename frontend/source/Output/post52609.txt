No More Vocals Instruments in GarageBand '11? <body> I'm trying to change my voice on Skype using this tutorial http://www.erzsabet.com/mySLSound.html, which I got working with GarageBand '09. However, I just bought GarageBand '11, and there doesn't seem to be any vocals software instrument. Where can I find them, please?  <answer52611> There are Vocal Effects in Garageband. Open Garageband and create a voice project: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/SyMmQ.png" alt=""br Then go to the Info pane in the bottom right hand corner:br img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hFqSl.png" alt=""br Under Real InstrumentVocals, you will find all the effects you were looking for. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4ohfS.png" alt=""  <comment60160> Can you please tell me what version of GarageBand you're using? <comment60162> @hkcktk Garageband 6.0.5, which according to [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GarageBand#History), is Garageband '11 <comment60163> That's weird. Is Real Instruments the tab that shows up by default? Mine is Software Instruments, and doesn't have vocals. http://imageshack.us/f/221/19144606jd.png/ <comment60165> No. You need to change the track to a vocal track, then you'll get the Real Instruments tab. <comment60166> Oh, funny. I was certain I'd chosen "Voice" when I created my project, but it seems I hadn't. Anyway, problem solved. Thanks! <comment60202> No problem. Glad I could help!
