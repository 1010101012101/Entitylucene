What voltage readings should i get from my 60 watt magsafe <body> What voltage readings should i get from my 60 watt magsafe if I check the pins with a multimeter. My readings are all below 1 volt (I checked all combinations of pins), but I don't know if this is correct since there is no load. Also what pins should I check?  <answer237028> Mixing answers from @David Anderson and @Brandon :     strongThe inner large pins/strong are V+ (16.5 VDC). Measuring with no load will give 6.86 VDC; the full 16.5 V is provided to the proper load.      strongThe outer large pins/strong are Ground.      strongThe tiny center pin/strong is a Charge Control pin that assists with changing the LED color, and also assists with switching the adapter off. strongemNo power will be output from any of the other pins until contact is made with the center Charge Control pin/em/strong   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/eSGbm.png" alt="Magsafe"  (Source : ifixit forum)  <answer237029> A good description can be found at Teardown and exploration of Apple's Magsafe connector  Below is taken verbatim from the above link.  h2The charger startup process/h2  When the Magsafe connector is plugged into a Mac, a lot more happens than you might expect. I believe the following steps take place:   ol liThe charger provides a very low current (about 100 µA) 6 volt signal on the power pins (3 volts for Magsafe 2)./li liWhen the Magsafe connector is plugged into the Mac, the Mac applies a resistive load (e.g. 39.41KΩ), pulling the power input low to about 1.7 volts./li liThe charger detects the power input has been pulled low, but not too low. (A short or a significant load will not enable the charger.) After exactly one second, the charger switches to full voltage (14.85 to 20 volts depending on model and wattage). There's a 16-bit microprocessor inside the charger to control this and other charger functions./li liThe Mac detects the full voltage on the power input and reads the charger ID using the 1-Wire protocol./li /ol  If the Mac is happy with the charger ID, it switches the power input to the internal power conversion circuit and starts using the input power. The Mac switches on the appropriate LED on the connector using the 1-Wire protocol.  This process explains why there is a delay of a second after you connect the charger before the light turns on and the computer indicates the battery is charging. It also explains why if you measure the charger output with a voltmeter, you don't find much voltage.   <comment290166> Welcome on AskDifferent. Provide us some information on your MacBook, the model. You can find this on the Apple's menu - About this Mac <comment290173> macbook pro 2011 early model <comment290175> Have a look here....https://www.ifixit.com/Answers/View/81178/What+voltage+should+magsafe+dc+adapter+check+at <comment290177> what does the last sentence mean? that the readings below 1 volt could be ok, since there the control pin has not made any contact? Because from the first point i'd exprect 6.86V <comment290180> Look @David Anderson's aswer, he explains better how the connector works. <comment290188> Ah, so the charger may be ok. I can't test it on a macbook (yet) so I don't know if it will work. <comment362784> @Chris - it isn't clear there either. Does the sense pin need to be connected before the 6V (or 3V for MagSafe 2) initial voltage is present at the power pin? This answer indicates that the sense pin does need to be connected, but the other answer and teardown link isn't clean (and kind of implies "no").
