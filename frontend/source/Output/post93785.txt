How long does Apple provide support and updates for a specific iOS version? <body> Does Apple list any guidelines for how long a consumer might expect to be supported with the version of iOS that ships with Apple hardware at the time of purchase?  On computer OS there seems to be a n-2 support pattern. You can buy AppleCare for 3 years of software support (in most cases) and the previous 2 versions get routine and prompt security updates along with the latest shipping OS.   On iOS there seems to be an n-1 support pattern. You can buy AppleCare for 2 years of software support and security updates seem to be released for the two most recent versions.  Has anyone seen an Apple document or compelling evidence that there is a policy in place for this when considering iOS deployment planning?  <comment109995> Nope, it is not a policy it is a competitive business decision. <comment110006> @Buscarì›ƒ Is that something you can source or just a feeling / educated guess? <comment110012> It comes from personal experience in the similar business of product support.
