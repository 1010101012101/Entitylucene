Firefox/Services menu void <body> The items in Firefox/Services menu disappeared after I restart my iMac, but not in every browser tab. For example, they are there and working correctly if the browser display the Help/Troubleshooting page (I'm not sure the name is the correct one, I have a localized version in Italian: "Aiuto/Risoluzione dei problemi").  If I actuate Firefox's refresh function, Services work properly until I close and reopen Firefox.  I tried to run Firefox with the option "em-NSDebugServices com.apple.mail/em" getting the following messages:  precodeMail/New Email With Selection (com.apple.mail) is enabled in the services menu and disabled in the context menu, by the standard Services policy.

Now is 50.1.0 Firefox version, but the issue is the same. <comment332402> @Rob: yes, I call Apple Support and they confirm is a Firefox issue. Furthermore she said that her Mac was behaving in the same way. <comment333384> I no longer believe that it is a matter of Mozilla, but Apple's support and its user community *think different*, so I don't know how to resolve my question
