Use Mail app for mailto links but not receive? <body> I use the Outlook email app but because Apple doesn't allow changing associated apps for things like mailto links, whenever I click on "Send feedback" in an app or an email address on a website, I'm presented with "Please configure an email account".   Is there any way to configure the Mail app for send only? I don't want to have two copies of my inbox. (This is for a GMail account)  strongCLARIFICATION - This is on an iPhone not a Mac/strong  <answer216386> Use RCDefaultApp to configure your default Mailer.br It installs as a Control Panel.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ByvXW.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment261453> I wonder if you can configure mail, and then delete the imap server but keep the smtp server. Just a wild guess. <comment261454> As it stands, this is an [XY Problem](http://xyproblem.info) <comment261463> Sorry this is on an iPhone not a Mac. I've revised my initial question. <comment261464> @Vitalydotn I tried looking for that setting but couldn't see it.
