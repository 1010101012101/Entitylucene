How to change mouse speed of the login window? <body> I prefer a fast tracking speed for mouse on my MacBook.  ã€€ img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7uoD4.png" alt="enter image description here"  However, this setting is only good for the logged in user. When I logged out, the mouse is slow again.  How can I change the mouse tracking speed in the login window (i.e. when all users are logged out)?  <answer94622> If you are saying that you would like to set the mouse tracking speed for all users of the system I do not believe there is a way to do that.  Each will have his/her own preference.  If you are saying that when you set your preference and then log out/log in under the same user and unexpectedly find that your preferences are not retained then there should be a fix.  Likely cause ,either:  The the permissions on the preference file are set incorrectly --  This might be fixed in disk utility -- repair permissions. Logout and then login.  or  The permission file is corrupt.  You should move it to the desktop, logout, login and set the permissions. Should stick now.  I believe the preference is stored here: ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.driver.AppleHIDMouse.plist  <comment110930> The setting is stored in ~/Library/Preferences/.GlobalPreferences.plist, not com.apple.driver.AppleHIDMouse.plist. <comment123357> I'd like to change the mouse speed in the login window (i.e., when all users are logged out). <comment288218> This doesn't answer the OP's question. Even if all users' mouse speeds are set faster than default, it's still slow on the login screen. Very annoying :/
