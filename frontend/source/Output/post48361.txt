Detect single-user mode from the command line <body> Is there a way to detect single-user mode in OSX (Lion, specifically) from the command line?  I've tried codewho -r/code, which returns code3/code in either standard or single-user mode.  I've also tried codenvram boot-args/code, which does not work either.  Google isn't helping much with this...  <answer48362> Hmm. We don't have runlevel in OS X*, which would be the easy way. How about identifying something in the output of codelaunchctl list/code which is not present in single user mode but is present otherwise - codecom.apple.Finder/code might be a candidate.  *codeman who/code includes: code-r    Print the current runlevel.  This is meaningless on Mac OS X./code  <answer48368> In single user mode open directory is not available except by jumping through hoops. You can test the return value of dscl in that case.   <answer48424> precode$ sysctl -n kern.singleuser 0 /code/pre  It's strong1/strong when booted in single-user mode, strong0/strong when not.  <comment55418> Thanks, Adam - thought I'd try `who` anyway to confirm. As for `launchctl list`, it returns a `Socket is not connected` error when in Single User Mode...I wonder if that is enough of a hook? <comment55419> Finder isn't always running even in 'normal mode'. It can be quit or replaced with another launcher. <comment55420> If that's consistent Scot, it might be very convenient! <comment55482> Confirmed - thanks, Ingmar, just what I needed.
