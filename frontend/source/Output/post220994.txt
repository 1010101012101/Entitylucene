launchctl load daemon by multiple users? <body> In OS X 10.10.5, an admin user A launches a daemon:   precodesudo launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/org.user.script.plist  /code/pre  An admin user B also wants to load this daemon. But it is not found by "sudo launchctl list" command.  We want to load and unload the damon which is registered in one admin user for multiple admin users. Is there any way to do that?  Below command even works launched by user B though.   precodesudo launchctl load -w /Library/LaunchDaemons/org.user.script.plist  /code/pre  <comment267651> Yes, org.user.script.plist is same as* with xxx.xxxxx.xxxx.plist. The plist is original one. It just loads the shell script when PC is load.  Do you really need an actual script? it is not mine, so I will edit a little if it is really required to solve the issue. So please let me know. <comment267654> The script is important if it contains user dependent data like `...somthing ... $user ... something else`. Usually user related daemons are stored in *~/Library/LaunchAgents* and not in */Library/LaunchDaemons*. I would prefer to see the script, yes. You may remove/replace password related things or other sensitive commands or data.
