Change Dock Icons only? <body> I just want to change the dock icons instead of system wide.  It it possible to only change the icons in the dock, and not elsewhere?  <answer60193> Can you be more specific? If you mean add or remove new dock icons on Mac OS, this should work.  emTo Add icons:/em simply drag any icon from system onto the dock. This should add it automatically.  emTo Remove icons:/em just hold any icon which you want to remove and drag it onto the desktop and leave, this should remove them.  <answer60195> Use Candybar.
