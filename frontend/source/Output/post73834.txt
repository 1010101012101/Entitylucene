Are there any iPad accessories that vibrate, for silent alarms? <body> Are there any iPad accessories that vibrate, to permit the same kind of silent notification iPhones can?  <answer81532> Unfortunately not. The OS would have to have support for said accessories, and anyway, there are no accessories for vibration.  You can submit feedback to Apple on the iPad here, but they won't respond and it might take them some time to implement the feature (if they ever do).
