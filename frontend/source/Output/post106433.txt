iOS update changed cell phone carriers - how can I change it back? <body> My iPhone is an AT&amp;T iPhone but it is connected with StraightTalk. My carrier name used to be "HOME", as indicated in the upper right corner. However, last night my phone updated to iOS 7.03. After that it updated my carrier settings and now my carrier name is "TFW".   This obviously isn't correct as cellular data doesn't work. How can I change the carrier back to "HOME", or is there something else I should change to fix it?
