Problems with Apple's Security Update 2011-005 (Lion)? <body>    strongPossible Duplicate:/strongbr   Why folders keep shifting their positions?       Today I downloaded Apple Security Update 2011-005 for Lion (http://support.apple.com/kb/DL1447). However, I got some issues here. After the update I noticed that some of the folders on my Desktop was rearranged. Moreover, my Mac started slowing down.  Does anybody else have same problems?   <answer24627> The update replaces 3 files, all pertaining to your system's keychain. They are as follows:  precode/System/Library/Keychains/EVRoots.plist /System/Library/Keychains/SystemRootCertificates.keychain /System/Library/Keychains/SystemTrustSettings.plist /code/pre  It is impossible that the update has caused your problems. Look elsewhere.  <answer24630> The arrangement of icons on the desktop and in folders is controlled by the (usually hideen) file .DS_Store. If you deleted this file or it became corrupted, your icons may have shifted around. It should not affect the speed of your computer though.  <comment27643> Hmmmm... Any thoughts what could cause folder rearrangement? <comment27648> I did not delete or somehow change it :/ <comment27650> There is some discussion about this being a known bug with Lion  https://discussions.apple.com/thread/3216766?start=0&tstart=0 <comment27657> I'm with [cksum](http://apple.stackexchange.com/users/10355/cksum) - they are correlated in time only, but not caused by each other. <comment27676> My icons/folders moved around as well after this update.
