Start Apache httpd on boot <body> Since upgrading to Yosemite, Apache codehttpd/code is no longer started at boot time.  I've tried: codesudo launchctl load org.apache.httpd.plist/code but I'm getting a codeservice is disabled/code error.  I've modified the plist file and set codeDisabled/code key to codeNO/code but I still get the error. What am I missing here?  <answer153782> I found a solution to your problem here.  Using Terminal "How do I make Apache start automatically":  precodesudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/org.apache.httpd.plist /code/pre  You were close to the solution just needed the -w override.  the code-w/code      Overrides the Disabled key and sets it to false.  <comment180980> sudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/org.apache.httpd.plist  does that work for you <comment180981> @Buscarì›ƒ That did it! What does the -w switch do? Post an answer and I can mark it answered <comment180987> To elaborate on your answer, from https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/launchctl.1.html -w Overrides the Disabled key and sets it to false.
