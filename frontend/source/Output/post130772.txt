Installing ruby to specific directory/usb <body> I am trying to install ruby to a specific directory, a USB stick, so I can move the usb back and forth without having to install ruby on each machine I get to (I need ruby 2.0+). How can I do this?  I have been looking after stuff like setting RVM install directory and so forth, with no luck. The closest I found was this description telling me how to move the entire RVM install, which I don't want. I just want a simple ruby version on a usb stick.  On windows this was very easy: Run RubyInstaller, and point it to the USB. On OSx, well, that's another story.  How can I achieve this?  <answer130826> So I figured this out:  What you must do is download the ruby source, and extract it wherever. Then you have a folder named coderuby-2.1.2/code, or something reflecting your ruby version.  Then, in terminal, codecd/code to that directory. Then run:  precode./configure --prefix=/Volumes/USB_STICK_NAME/folder/to/install/into/osx_ruby make sudo make install /code/pre  emProtip: drag-n-drop the ubs-folder you want into the terminal to get the desired folder path. Much easier than writing it/em  That will install ruby into your usb-stick named "USB_STICK_NAME" under the folders codefolder/to/install/into/osx_ruby/code. Feel free to name it differently, but remember; The folder you select as install directory is where all the internal ruby stuff ends up,  like codebin/code, codelib/code. I would recommend naming that folder "osx_ruby" or something similar.  Hope someone finds this useful.  <comment153425> Actually, I might be able to install it from the source. I will look into this and post answer if I get it to work.
