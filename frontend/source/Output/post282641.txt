Google Calendar notification on iphone - possible? <body> I have an Android phone and my wife has a iphone. We'd like to put our schedule into a shared google calendar  So far I have it working and the calendar is on both are phones, so that when events are updated on either device or the computer, they are synced up as you would expect, but at the moment neither of us are getting notifications of changes.  Is is possible to get notifications working on the iphone so that when I update, Add or delete an entry, she gets a notification? An Email would be ok, but it would be nicer if it was a proper iOS notification
