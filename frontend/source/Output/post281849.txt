macOS weird logout issue <body> There is a weird logout issue on my MacBook Air (13", Early 2015), with macOS Sierra 10.12.4 installed. When I wake up my computer in the morning (it was neither turned off nor hibernated, but simply locked), I found that the system emwanted/em to log out automatically. Since an application wasn't closed (that's Oracle VM VirtualBox, if it helps; an instance of VM was operating) the previous night, I saw a dialog asking whether I would continue to log out (probably in order to let me deal with the unsaved VM state). Also, I saw a file called "logout", 0KB in size, resided in the Downloads folder, which was created in the midnight.  Please help me figure out why this happens. It feels really strange. Thank you.  <answer281907> strongCheck Energy Saver/strong  It may be worth checking your energy saver preferences:  ul liGo to Apple menu  System Preferences/li liClick on Energy Saver/li liClick on the kbdSchedule/kbd button at bottom right/li /ul  Now check to see whether your Mac was scheduled to shutdown etc.  strongBoot into Safe Mode/strong  Follow these steps to boot your MacBook Air into Safe Mode:  ol liFully shut down your MacBook Air/li liRestart your MacBook Air/li liImmediately press the kbdShift/kbd key and strongkeep it down/strong /li liLet go of the kbdShift/kbd key when you see the login window (NOTE: If you have FileVault enabled you may need to log in twice)./li liLeave your MacBook Air in Safe Mode until the next morning/li liWake your MacBook Air and see if the issue is still present/li liExit Safe Mode by restarting your Mac as normal/li /ol  Once you've booted into Safe Mode, let me know how you went and we'll go from there.  <comment355056> Thank you, but there isn't any scheduled shutdown. <comment355057> It'd be good to know if this issue persists when you're booted into Safe Mode? I'll edit my answer with instructions. <comment355059> Well the issue actually happened only once.
