iPhoto hates uppsala. Can't change the name of a collection <body> I feel like I am taking crazy pills, but I have the following problem on iPhoto '09. I have a collection with pictures I took in Uppsala. I noticed that the collection was called Uppsal, so I tried to change the name. I put Uppsala, and it reverted to Uppsal. I tried other variations like "Upp-sala", "Upsala" and so on, and they are all accepted, but when I put straight "Uppsala" it reverts to the previous name. I thought I had another collection with the same name, but this is not the case. I also have other collections named after a city, and I have no problems, so it's also not a bug-induced clash between "Places" keys and the collection name.  Any ideas why my iPhoto is against nordic cities?
