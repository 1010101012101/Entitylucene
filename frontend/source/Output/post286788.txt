Reconnect to network drive on connection to network <body> I have a NAS and I connect to it as a network drive, however when I leave the house with the MacBook Pro and come back I have to manually remember to reconnect to the network drive. Is there anyway to do this automatically?  ControlPlane is not a solution as it currently has problems with macOS Sierra.  System version: macOS Sierra 10.12.5  <comment361991> Several solutions exist depending on your proceeding: do you shut down your Mac leaving your home, do you boot/log-in coming back home or is your Mac suspended/sleeping/power napping? Please add your system version! <comment362005> @klanomath I don't do any shutdown or logout. I close the lid, go to wherever I'm going, open the MacBook and do whatever work there close the lid, return home, and open the MacBook again. I have the login items set for when I logout or shutdown. However I rarely turn it off as I usually have it running background tasks I don't want to interrupt. <comment362031> Possible duplicate of [App for changing between a work and private mode](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/187799/app-for-changing-between-a-work-and-private-mode) and similar q&a here. <comment362069> @klanomath I've updated the question with why ControlPlane is not suitable.
