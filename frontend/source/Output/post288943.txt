Enable all Safari extensions from Terminal <body> For various reasons that aren't important, whenever my MacBook reboots, Safari extensions are disabled. I can manually go into the codeDevelop/code menu, and uncheck codeDisable Extensions/code, and that work just fine, but its annoying and an extra step that I have to remember.  I wrote a simple script that checks the output of codedefaults read com.apple.Safari ExtensionsEnabled/code  and if it is 0, runs codedefaults write com.apple.safari ExtensionsEnabled 1/code  This all works and it does indeed set that parameter to 1, but Safari does not actually enable my extensions, codeDevelop/code - codeDisable Extensions/code remains checked, and my extension icons don't appear. Restarting Safari after running it does not help either.  So is there a cache I need to clear somewhere for Safari to re-read the plist and enable extensions?  I've also considered writing an applescript that would just simulate the human interaction, but the laptop is locked down and I can't add it to accessibilities due to no permissions, so that's a no-go.
