OSX 10.9 Mavericks VirtualBox unable to use Bridged Networking <body> Since upgrading to OSX 10.9 Mavericks VirtualBox machines that have a Bridged Network have been unable to start.  Installing VirtualBox again solves the problem temporarily, but this does not survive a reboot (or in my case kicking the power supply cable out!).  Has anyone come up with a permanent solution for this, or at least one that does not involve a fresh install?  <answer112569> I've found a temporary solution.  It appears that on reboot not all the kernel extensions are loaded correctly.  However a restart of the VirtualBox startup item seems to resolve this and I can then start the machines.  precodesudo  /Library/StartupItems/VirtualBox/VirtualBox restart /code/pre  Is the line that works for me, sometimes I have to run it twice.  <answer182404> Unless I am mistaken regarding the issue here, simply enabling IP forwarding on the OS X host will resolve the issue:  precodesudo sysctl -w net.inet.ip.forwarding=1 /code/pre
