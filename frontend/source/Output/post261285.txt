Cursor lags when controlling computers with Apple Remote Desktop <body> Ever since upgrading to MacOS Sierra (10.12.1) I've noticed ARD lags really badly when controlling computers, the cursor doesn't move around as quickly, any thoughts on this?   Encryption is turned off when copying items and installing packages so I'm wondering what the issue could be?    I'm on the latest version of ARD   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZeTNI.png" alt="enter image description here"
