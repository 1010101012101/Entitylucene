iCloud Photo Library - force upload <body> On my iMac I imported my old Aperture Library to the new Photos app and then enabled iCloud Photo Library.  The library has about 10000 photos and I expected that once I started the sync Photos app would upload all photos at once.  I've been watching this for a few days, and it looks like Photos uploads data for about 5 - 10 minutes, and after that pauses for anything from 30 to 90 minutes.  Does anybody know if and how I could tell Photos to just keep uploading without any waiting period?  <answer191230> You might run into the iCloud Photo sharing limits:     h1iCloud Photo Sharing limits/h1      These are the iCloud Photo Sharing hourly and daily limits:      ul   liMaximum combined number of photos and videos from all contributors per shared album, per hour: strong1,000/strong/li   liMaximum combined number of photos and videos from all contributors per shared album, per day: strong10,000/strong/li   /ul      These sharing limits are separate from the upload limits above. For example, in the same day you could upload 10,000 photos to My Photo Stream, then share those 10,000 photos or 10,000 other photos.      Some additional limits for shared albums:      ul   liMaximum shared albums an owner can share: 100/li   liMaximum shared albums a user can subscribe to: 100/li   liMaximum subscribers per shared album: 100 (the number of subscribers on each shared album)/li   liMaximum combined number of photos and videos from all contributors in any one shared album: 5000/li   liMaximum number of comments per photo or video in a shared album: 200 (a comment can be either a like or a text entry)/li   liMaximum characters per comment: 200/li   liMaximum number of invites a shared album owner may send per day: 200/li   /ul   <comment216938> I don't believe so, but leaving it alone is the best way to do it. I think it looks at system activity to try to remain unobtrusive. <comment280827> You're mixing up iCloud Photo Sharing and iCloud Photo Library. These are separate products.
