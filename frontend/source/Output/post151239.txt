Is it possible to update free apps from another account? <body> By what I've already read, I know that if you have ipurchased/i an app in the Mac App Store with the account bX/b, then you can update it only by logging into bX/b. Now the question that arises is: What if the downloaded app is ifree/i, does the same rule apply or not?  <answer151244> Yes, the same principle applies. For Apple, it is a purchased product, though in one case the price was $0. So it's not transferable from account to account. As a developer, I know one normal case that is: the app is free for one day. Then the app turns paid. If a user could transfer to another account, then it would be a problem for the dev since it may be transferred to anyone.
