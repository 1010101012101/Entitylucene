Lost contacts are showing in Messages <body> After upgrading to IOS 10 on my Iphone 6, most of my contacts disappeared. After some investigation, it turned out that my contacts were meant to sync with my hotmail account but this did not work, so many appear to be lost.  However, when I go into the Messages app, and type a name in, the name and the phone number of the contact shows up, despite that name not being in Contacts.    How do I restore my contacts?  <comment324577> Did you check on outlook.com? iCloud.com?
