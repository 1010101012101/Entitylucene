How to group table and caption in Word 2011? <body> I'm trying to create a load of tables with captions in Mac Word 2011, interspersed with figures, text, ect. With all the insertions, there's a lot of adjusting of where things go. But when I move the tables around, the captions stay put, and I don't see any way to group tables to keep their captions with them. Is there a way to make sure a table and its caption move together in Word 2011?  Just to be clear, I'm not asking how to make sure they stay together over a page break - I'd like to be able to move the table myself and have the caption come with it.
