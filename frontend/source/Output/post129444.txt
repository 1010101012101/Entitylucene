CCleaner free equivalent on OS X? <body> Do you know a free (as in freedom) CCleaner equivalent which works on Mac OS X Mavericks?  I've searched but found nothing.  <answer129542> If you are going to re-partition to install another O/S then a cleaner won't do much, it really depends on how much room you need to recover for your partition.  That said there are a number of cleaners out there. I have always used the free Onyx. I usually get it off of MacUpdate. Note that the latest version is always for the latest O/S if you don't have Mavericks look on the developer's website for earlier versions.  http://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/11582/onyx  Oddly enough CCCleaner is available for the Mac, and while I have used the PC version quite a bit I have never used it on the Mac, preferring to stick with the utility I know. So I can't speak to how good a job CCCleaner does on the Mac.  MacUpdate is a great place to look for software, pretty much everything you are looking for here can be found there.  <comment151489> What exact features of CCleaner are you looking for in an OS X equivalent? For instance, CCleaner's registry cleaner has no direct equivalent since there's no registry in OS X. <comment151490> The cleaning option. I want to install a new OS on my Mac. <comment151491> If you want to install a new OS, why clean the old one? Are you going to restore a TM backup to the new install? If so, many caches etc are cleaned anyway. <comment151494> i clean the old for have space on my hard drive. i install trisquel gnu/linux <comment151697> OnyX is proprietary. I search a free equivalent. <comment151803> Onyx is free, always has been. If you mean free as in open source I am not aware of anything that does this that is also open source
