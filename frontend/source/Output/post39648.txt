Choosing the default application does not stay as default after reboot <body> When I'm opening .avi files, I want to open them with VLC Media player, when right clicking the item, I see this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wZ1Sx.png" alt="enter image description here"  As you can see QuickTime is the default player, I want to change it to VLC, so I change it:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/RB9TH.png" alt="enter image description here"  After changing it, every .avi I open gets opened by VLC, however, when I reboot my Mac, the default goes back to QuickTime... how do I prevent this and keep VLC as the default.  <answer39650> There's a great preference pane RCDefaultApp. It should do what you want.     RCDefaultApp is a Mac OS X 10.2 or higher preference pane that allows a user to set the default application used for various URL schemes, file extensions, file types, MIME types, and Uniform Type Identifiers (or UTIs; MacOS 10.4 only). MacOS X uses the extension and file type settings to choose the application when opening a file in Finder, while Safari and other applications use the URL and MIME type settings at other times for content not related to a file (such as an unknown URL protocol, or a media stream).   <answer39656> I was doing it the wrong way like you try to for a long time and also have retreated to using RCDefaultApp in the past... but there's actually a way to do that natively which works.  Do the following:  precode1) right click your file  2) choose "Get Info" 3) in the popup find the "Open with" strip (this is by default closed) and open it 4) from the drop down choose the program you want to open that type of file 5) click "Change all..." /code/pre  And that's the correct way to do it  <comment44768> This preference pane looks good - thanks for that. <comment44782> Aha. Good find.
