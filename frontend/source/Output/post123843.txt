Glad it was something that simple....but sure stumped me for a while. the ringer button is the one above the volume buttons on the left side  <answer139036> Try this, hold on home and lock button for 10 second, Mine would vibrate for incoming calls but would not ring. This fixed mine right away.  <answer163311> Power volume flex cable is damaged, change it  <answer167535> There is a ring/silent switch on the left side of the iPhone 5s, (right side for iPhone 6), just above the sound up and down arrows.  Slide it up, and that should turn your ringer back on, you should be able to hear your phone ring.  <answer169213> I had the same problem - everything looked right in settings but my iphone5 still only vibrated.  The ring tone that I had it set to indeed had stopped working when I tested it, so I switched to another ring tone and it works.   <answer186713> I had the same problem with my iphone 6 plus Im on ios 8.3. My phone would only vibrate no ringtone. My fix: Toggle the ringer button on the left side of my phone OFF and ON.   Additional settings (if it would help you):  SettingsDo Not Disturb Manual (Off) Scheduled (Off) Allow Calls From (Everyone) Repeated Calls (On)  SILENCE  Only while iPhone is locked (check)  ****and****  Settings Sounds Vibrate on Ting (on) Vibrate on Silent (on)  RINGER AND ALERTS (set in the middle)  Change with Buttons (on)  SOUNDS AND VIBRATION PATTERNS Ringtone (summit) Text Tone (hello) New Voicemail (Tri-tone) New Mail (Ripples) Sent Mail (Popcorn) Tweet (keys) Facebook Post (swish) Calendar Alerts ( Hello) Reminder Alerts (Chord) AirDrop (pulse)  Lock sounds (off) Keyboard clicks (off)  Hope this helps anyone.  <answer195951> For iPhone 6plus: - locate volume control on left side of phone - find small silver switch just above that - use your fingernail to switch it in the direction of your screen.  - test to see if your phone ringer is working  <comment144669> I think you indirectly answered the question, but when you go to Settings.app - Sounds - Ringtone, does the ringtone you have selected play as expected when you tap it? <comment144675> Yes it does play the sounds when I tap the ringtone.  But it still does not ring when I call it. <comment145188> Sorry we couldn't help. I had a syncing issue that was cleared up by 7.1 <comment145189> And restarting the iPhone doesn't improve? <comment191170> The accepted answer indicates this isn't the case. Want to remove this? It's wrong and will attract down votes. <comment220512> I love the way we keep having to fix this again with every update. <comment234018> OP states that the switch is "on" on his phone and that they have an iPhone 5. Moreover, the switch hasn't changed in functionality or location on any iPhone. <comment244578> Thanks so much for this answer. This is what happened to me too. <comment244630> I feel stupid:-) Same here...
