How to disable captive.apple.com? <body> I used a crummy AT&amp;T (*coughAT&amp;Tsymbollookslikedeathstarcough*) router to build a private LAN.  It has no service/DSL connections, there for it detects no internet access (naturally) and will give me this pop-up on a Mac:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LwaGb.jpg" alt="Pop-up on Mac"  This, as you can see, seems to be a Safari window of sorts that is sourcing captive.apple.com.  Because I have no DSL connection, all DNS resolutions get translated to the router's web host.  This means that every 5 to 10 minutes I get this pop-up.  The WiFi connection does work, but I get this annoying pop-up that interrupts my work.  On an iPhone, I have a similarish problem, although it is more consequential.  In Settings -- Wireless it gives me this same page asking me to Log In.  I assume that's the function of captive.apple.com.  I know places like McDonalds or Starbucks will do this to make sure you come in and buy something before getting on their WiFi.  My Question is this:  How do I disable this on a Mac so that I don't have to worry with this pop-up anymore?  The iPhone is a secondary problem, but it would be nice to have a solution for it.  Would a /etc/hosts entry fix it, or is it more complicated than that?  OS X version 10.11 El Capitanbr 2011 Mac Mini  <answer211596> OS X is checking captive.apple.com and when it doesn't actually resolve to Apple's server, it "knows" that you've connected to a captive portal (like Starbucks or McDonalds). You could try a hosts entry redirecting to the actual captive.apple.com if you wanted, but the problem is the AT&amp;T router that is hijacking your DNS.   To work around: Manually specify all of your IP information (IP address, subnet mask, leave gateway blank, and specifying a DNS server like 8.8.8.8 or 8.8.4.4). If that works, you should be able to replicate the procedure on your iPhone (leaving Gateway blank and using a unique IP for your phone, of course).  <answer211604> There's 3 ways.  ol licodesudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/com.apple.captive.control Active -boolean false/code/li liJust delete (or rename) code/System/Library/CoreServices/Captive Network Assistant.app/code/li liAdd an entry in code/etc/hosts/code containing code127.0.0.1 captive.apple.com/code/li /ol  <comment255434> And it should actually be `127.0.0.1 captive.apple.com` <comment255435> And the /etc/hosts entry did not work <comment255436> The defaults write didn't work <comment255437> Error: `sudo mv "/System/Library/CoreServices/Captive Network Assistant.app" "/System/Library/CoreServices/.Captive Network Assistant.app" mv: rename /System/Library/CoreServices/Captive Network Assistant.app to /System/Library/CoreServices/.Captive Network Assistant.app: Operation not permitted` <comment255438> So none of these worked <comment255439> @Daniel Are you on El Capitan? If so, you'll need to [disable System Integrity Protection](http://osxdaily.com/2015/10/05/disable-rootless-system-integrity-protection-mac-os-x/) before messing with the System files. <comment255503> Yes I am.  I should have put that in the Q. <comment255504> I'll do that as soon as I finish classes for today (online high school classes for most of the day). <comment255521> Note that this will not address the iPhone at all.
