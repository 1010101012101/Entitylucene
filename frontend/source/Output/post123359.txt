ssh-add every time I want to use SSH to login to my remote server <body> I have SSH keys installed on OSX Mavericks installed at code~/.ssh//code  Everytime I want to SSH to a server from Terminal, I need to do the following:  precodeeval `ssh-agent -s` ssh-add ~/.ssh/example_rsa /code/pre  If I open a new Terminal window, and try typing codessh-add ~/.ssh/example_rsa/code it just fails. I need to use the codeeval 'ssh-agent -s'/code step every single time first, then I can add with codessh-add/code and then use that to SSH to my required destination.  Prior, when I had OS X Mountain Lion I did not have to do this more than once. I just added the SSH keys, and away I went.  When programs like GitHub do their magic, it always works, using it's own SSH keys. It also works if I use Git from the Terminal. Only when I want to SSH to a server using that specific key.  Granted, it does have a password on it.  This is the privileges on the folders:  precode700 ~/.ssh 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys 600 ~/.ssh/example_rsa 644 ~/.ssh/example_rsa.pub /code/pre  If any light could be shed on this, I would be extremely grateful. A number of my keys that I generated have got the passwords on them, and it's a pain to keep finding their respective passwords and type it in every time I want to SSH with them.  I use the exact same keys from CentOS, Debian, Ubuntu - all have no problems once I've added them once. Never need to do it again. Only since I moved to Mavericks (clean install).  <answer123376> I know it does not answer your question directly, but have you tried using a config file to map you keys to servers?  in .ssh create a file called config In the file put your server entries and map the key  precodeHost server1 HostName  10.10.10.1 User myUser IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa /code/pre  then you can just run ssh server1  <answer270884> You can add the private key file path to the '~/.ssh/config' file  Login will automatically match  precodeIdentityFile ~/.ssh/example1_rsa IdentityFile ~/.ssh/example2_rsa IdentityFile ~/.ssh/example3_rsa /code/pre
