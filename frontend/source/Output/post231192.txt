How to take backup of a partition from another partition <body> I have two partition one for emYosemite OS/em as emMacintosh HD/em  and another for emEl Capitan OS/em as emEl Capitan/em  Now emEl-capitan/em part is not embooting up/em and I have to take a data backup of El-Capitan from Yosemite so that I can reformat the El-Capitan partition and later restore from the back up.  I couldn't find any tools that does this.  Any pointers to achieve this is highly appreciated !  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/sdaNj.png" alt="screen shot of El-Capitan from Yosemite"  Thanks  <answer231200> I can think of several ways of making a back of your El Capitan partition, provided the El Capitan partition still mounts when you're booting up from Yosemite partition then you could use Time Machine to select the El Capitan Partition in System Pref/Time Machine.  Or copy the entire contents of the El Capitan partition onto an external hard drive when you boot from Yosemite.    <answer231205> If you need to back up or make an image of any partition on any drive you can use Apple's own Time Machine.  You could just copy the files you need to keep to another location manually and then re-install the operating system but you can't and should not just copy the contents of any other system folder for re-use later as there will be permissions issues and other problems galore.  You could use other backup programs like SuperDuper, Carbon Copy Cloner and the like which will make (among other things) a bootable image of any (already bootable) drive.  <comment282299> Copying is not allowed as it has red minus mark in the folders I guess <comment282300> SuperDuper and Carbon Copy Cloner are paid softwares <comment282302> Can't we make bootable drive using TimeMachine ? <comment282303> Why did the ElCap partition lose bootability? Maybe it's easier to solve this problem instead of copying GBs of data? Usually you can even simply reinstall ElCap using the latest installer version on a current system without losing any exisiting (user) data <comment282320> Yes they are. you will find that most "softwares" that do important things with your Mac will cost you money. I personally would never trust 3rd party backup software that *doesn't* cost something. And Time Machine can make a bootable backup. <comment282322> Yes but thats not going to stop you from copying the data. The red minus just means you don't have permissions to view the contents so all you need to do is give yourself permission. Start by using the "Get Info" on the folders and click the padlock at the bottom to unlock, then click + to add yourself to it.
