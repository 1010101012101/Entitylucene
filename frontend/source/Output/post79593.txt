Functionality like iOS's keyboard shortcut functionality <body> I'm not sure if this is a duplicate of another question because naming the functionality in iOS that enables the user to type in a shortcut (like "omy") and have it expand to a whole phrase (like "on my way") as "Shortcuts" was a bad idea, in my opinion.  I'd like to have a way to type in a shortcut and have it expand to a whole phrase, just as one can do so in iOS. Is there any native way to do that? Or would I have to write an Apple Script of some sort? I know of an application called, "Typinator" that does this, but I don't like the idea of spending money if I don't have to.  <answer79602> There are good apps that allow you to set up text expansion with a nice GUI. This is the one I have used and liked:  h2Dash Expander/h2  emMac App Store Link/em  Dash Expander handles text expansion very well. I have used it and it works well. The free version:     "...will nag and annoy you every now and then, in order to purchase."   I haven't found these to be that obtrusive. However, as of writing the full version is just $1.99. This also has the ability to set variables. For example, you can set up a boiler-plate thank you note, and just set variables in there that you quickly go through and change to personalize for the recipient.  <answer79701> In bSystem Preferences/b, go to bLanguage &amp; Text/b and hit the bText/b tab. The left column is essentially the same as what Shortcuts are in iOS' settings. This has the added advantage of being able to use Emoji. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/RXvru.png" alt="System Preferences &gt; Language &amp; Text &gt; Text"  <comment91983> It's interesting that I never found this app on my own; I actually use Dash (made by the people that make Dash Expander).
