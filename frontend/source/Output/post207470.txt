Softlink /bin/bash to a brew-installed bash <body> It is a question related to this other one, but I can't comment.  I've updated to use bash 4 from brew installation. But I don't know if changing all the header scripts from:  precode#!/bin/bash /code/pre  To  precode#!/usr/local/bin/bash /code/pre  Isn't a portable solution.  Moreover, some scripts check if the shell is a code/bin/bash/code shell (docker-toolbox in example)  Before writing, I was recommended to read this: https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/119179/77314 But the path solution is neither portable nor can apply on codedocker/code case (no direct source).   So I still doubt: is really a bad idea to softlink the codebash/code?  Obviously, targeting independent-version.  <answer207518> Create your own bash symbolic link. Then use that in your script. You can then change the symlink to point to whatever you want. That's the approach used with java-alternatives and other platforms (ruby, python, etc.). Thus, they change the symlinks, and you have a new version in your environment.   <answer208603> code#!/usr/bin/env bash/code is the 'most portable' approach but code#!/bin/bash/code is the standard convention on OS X and Linux. There are advantages to shebang with a stable system interpreter, and it's probably not worth using a newer Bash.  <comment250240> Upgrading the OS could overwrite it - why update bash for these scripts - I can understand for terminal sessions - what improvement do you get -the scripts are probably written for older bash anyway <comment250437> Yes, I know **how**, my question was about _good_ or _bad_ idea in the bash case. Thanks anyway. <comment250438> Upgrading: ok, it is true, so maybe someday I'll find myself in bash 3 without knowing ^^' ---- Scripts: when I write scripts, as I write code, I try to use latest software available, but most portable possible too. If I share my script with others and the bash line is not the `/bin/bash`, will complain anything? <comment250450> It depends of the other person has an interpreter at the path you give - if not then it will not run - if they do hope it is the correct version - note if I have to write a shell script I will write it as sh as that will be portable, if more complex I'll use python, perl etc <comment250474> Really nice comments! You have convinced me. Could you put them as answer? <comment251581> With SIP (the "rootless" feature of 10.11), the problem kind of solves itself as you are no longer able to modify `/bin`. <comment251583> Is bash 4 less stable than 3? It is still updated version 3? <comment251586> By stable I mean it's not likely to flip through versions, will survive OS upgrades and changes. You can still use Bash 4 as a shell but if your script doesn't use Bash 4 features I'd just stick with /bin/bash.
