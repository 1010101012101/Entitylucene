Unable to create a Service with a space in it's name <body> Hey there check this out,  Open Automator, create a New Service, save it as "Something With Spaces" and it won't appear on your Services menu. Save it as "SomethingWithoutSpaces" and it will work.  What you think? Is this a bug or am I doing something wrong?  Using OS X El Capitan but I'm sure that this doesn't work in any other version of OS X.  <comment260020> Spaces are perfectly acceptable in a service name. I was able to confirm that El Capitan doesn't appear to have any issues with this. Can you check the `Library/Services` subfolder in your home folder and confirm that the service appears there? <comment268257> I tried it and it doesn't work. Did you actually tried to do it and it worked?
