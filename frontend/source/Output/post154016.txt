NIDAQmx yosemite compatibility <body> I've installed osx 10.10 ( Yosemite ) and since then the device (NI-USB 6210) is not working anymore. The problem is obviously driver related. I called National Instruments and they confirmed the issue, and they also told me that the problem will be probably fixed in the next release of the nidaqmx, that will happen not so soon. So their suggestion is to downgrade to Mavericks, which kinda suck. They also told me to check the compatibility table  http://www.ni.com/labview/os-support/i/  in order to know when if will be supported, until then I have to struggle with downgrade or find a workaround which would be the best thing. anybody found a solution to this problem lately?  <comment181249> Please specify the device interface (USB/PCI/PCI-Express) <comment181250> it's a 6210 USB interface <comment181251> you might set up a Mavericks VM in VMware Fusion or Parallels and route the device to the VM <comment181252> yes, that's one of the suggestions that the tech support gave me, but it's not the case, it'd be too slow, considering what are the other things it has to do, plus I'm supposed to deliver a fully working software (based on the C nidaqmx libs) the can run on computer without the use of VM and stuff. <comment181253> then dual boot (Mavericks/Yosemite) <comment181259> or "disable kext signing" may help (depends on the NIDAQmx driver type). you have to ask NI about that <comment181264> I'll give a shot to that
