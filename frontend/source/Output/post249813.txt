Cannot ping localhost: "unknown host" on Mac OS X El Captain <body> I am trying to resolve localhost which right now is "not found"  if I ping localhost - I am getting   precodeping: cannot resolve localhost: Unknown host /code/pre  I have made sure that the /etc/hosts file has the below entries that are necessary to have the resolution for localhost -  precode127.0.0.1   localhost 255.255.255.255 broadcasthost ::1             localhost /code/pre  However, when I ping 127.0.0.1 it is successful -   precodePING 127.0.0.1 (127.0.0.1): 56 data bytes 64 bytes from 127.0.0.1: icmp_seq=0 ttl=64 time=0.052 ms 64 bytes from 127.0.0.1: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.066 ms 64 bytes from 127.0.0.1: icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=0.054 ms ^C --- 127.0.0.1 ping statistics --- 3 packets transmitted, 3 packets received, 0.0% packet loss round-trip min/avg/max/stddev = 0.052/0.057/0.066/0.006 ms /code/pre  In doubts of this getting blocked by my antivirus - I have also disabled my "web root secure anywhere" anti-virus... and it did not solve anything.  Also, I have noticed that when I restarted my machine - for the first few mins the ping localhost worked and stopped working after few mins. not sure how to track what stopped it from working.  Based on the answer at DNS not resolving on Mac OS X - tried "dig @8.8.8.8 localhost" only to find that there was no "answer" section at all.   precodelocalhost:~ $ dig @8.8.8.8 localhost  ; &lt;&lt;&gt;&gt; DiG 9.8.3-P1 &lt;&lt;&gt;&gt; @8.8.8.8 localhost ; (1 server found) ;; global options: +cmd ;; Got answer: ;; -&gt;&gt;HEADER&lt;&lt;- opcode: QUERY, status: NXDOMAIN, id: 3535 ;; flags: qr rd ra; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 0, AUTHORITY: 1, ADDITIONAL: 0  ;; QUESTION SECTION: ;localhost.

It's never resolved by a dns server. The only localhost the dns server @ 8.8.8.8 knows of is the server itself! The server @ 8.8.8.8 doesn't even know what the IP of *google* is because google is no proper host name. Check dns resolution by using a proper fqdn. Please add the output of `ls -le@ /etc/hosts`. <comment310008> Your hosts file has a size of 6kb. That's the ~ thirtyfold of the default size. Probably it contains (a) bogus line(s). Please either post the complete content of the hosts file (to pastebin) or back up your current file, reinstate the default one and try again to ping localhost. <comment310022> You may delete the gist and your comment. The hosts file seems fine. <comment310023> What kind of "antivir web root secure anywhere"-ware did you install? <comment310024> @klanomath, That's a good question. I just tried pinging localhost and 127.0.0.1, neither worked. I had my Firewall hardened in Stealth Mode. So I modified some settings and I could ping both, then reenabled Stealth Mode. :) <comment310028> the one I have installed (and disabled right now) is https://www.webroot.com/us/en/home/products/av <comment310053> From an entirely different context [something I do online support for] Webroot is "known bad" software, because of its lack of user configurability unless you have the business version. Our advice in that context is always simply "get rid of Webroot". <comment310094> @tetsujin it is business version.. I dont like it either way. But I have to be compliant with my work laptop  :)
