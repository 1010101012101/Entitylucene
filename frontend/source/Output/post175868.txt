iPad automatically deletes songs <body> I'm using an iPad3 with iOS 8.1.2 and it deletes songs. The iPad contains only songs that I bought on iTunes. However, it deletes songs that I installed, and I have to download them again.br The missing songs were definitely not deleted by me and they were stored on the iPad (not cloud streaming).  Today I downloaded them again. My free space was 2 GB. 6 hours later without using the iPad, I have 5.3 GB free space and many songs are lost.br Is it possible to download them again? They are not on my iPad but in the cloud.   How can I avoid the auto deletes?  <comment223730> Do you use iTunes Match ? <comment224114> No, iTunes Match is disabled.
