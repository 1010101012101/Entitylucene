How can I make Instagram photos shared to Facebook visible to my friends by default? <body> When I share photos from Instagram to Facebook (using the Instagram app on iOS), by default they get "Only Me" sharing visibility:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Zl9yz.png" alt="enter image description here"  That doesn't seem very useful to me - I'd rather my friends saw them. In fact, Instagram's help page says that is what is supposed to happen.  How can I fix this? How can I make these photos visible to my friends by default?  <answer186202> As strongAndrew Ferrier/strong stated in the comments to the question, this is indeed a part of Facebook's privacy settings. Here is how you set it to share to "Friends" by default:  ol liGo to your strongFacebook.com/strong./li liFind the page to edit your Instagram settings. ul lithis should be on strongYourLinkToTimelinePage/app_instapp/strong/li lior you should be able to find it at https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=applications/li lior in the timeline menu under your profile picture, find it in strongMore/strong/li /ul/li liChange your strongApp visibility and post audience/strong setting to strongFriends/strong  This setting controls who on Facebook can see that you use this app. It also allows you to choose the audience for posts the app makes on your behalf./li /ol  Hope this helps you.  <comment219787> As this is a question about an iOS app rather than a web app, this question would be better off at [apple.se]. <comment219790> I don't really agree; although the source of the share is from an iOS app, I suspect the answer lies in Facebook.com privacy settings. But it's obviously hard to tell without an answer... <comment219792> Perfect! Exactly what I needed.
