Why do two Chrome windows launch when I click an external link? <body> I've got the most recent version of Mountain Lion installed, as well as the most recent version of Chrome.  When I've got Chrome set as the default browser, and if I close out all the tabs before I quit Chrome itself, if I click on an external link (e.g., from within an e-mail, Tweetbot, etc.), two Chrome windows launchâ€”one with Google (my set homepage) and one with the target of the link.  Not closing out all the tabs before I quit Chrome does the trick, but what specifically could be causing this?  <answer74590> You've set the homepage to open on startup. Go to settings codecmd+,/code check the codeOn startup/code option there. You can disable it from there too.  <comment86617> Ah, yessir, that did indeed solve it!
