Unable to Install EOS Utility from Canon Solution Disc <body> I just got a mini DVD with some software which will probably help me downloading the photos from my Canon 600D using the interface cable but I have a mac and it does not have a DVD drive.  I tried to download solution-disk29.1a.dmg.zip from Canon website but it says you need to be Administrator to install this and not prompting any password.  Is this the correct software (EOS Utility) I am trying to install? Any workaround of this problem?  My account is already admin.
