Does an iOS virtual machine exist for Windows? <body> Does an iOS virtual machine for Windows exist? If it doesn't are there any reason why it couldn't?  <answer230694> Simple answer: No.   Apple does not allow iOS to run anywhere else but iOS devices (iPhone, iPad, iPod touch) and the Xcode simulator. You could simulate OS X on your Windows VM application and then use Xcode to simulate an iOS device, but this would be really taxing on your computer and really not worth the effort, but you cannot simulate iOS directly on Windows because of chipsets and Apple preventing it.  <comment281550> Is the iOS simulator packaged with Xcode not good enough for your needs? <comment281572> I don't have a mac <comment281577> Why do you need a VM? Since computers aren't powerful enough to emulate an iOS device, if you don't have a proper developer environment, you won't be able to do a lot.  What you can do is virtualize OS X and then use the simulator packaged with OS X. <comment281589> You can't have a VM for IOS on Windows or OSX as IOS runs on ARM CPUs and Windows and OSX on Intel x86 <comment291319> This isn't nearly an answer, but there is a solution. Google iEmu, worked with the original iPhone and iPad. The guy recently made another company (virtur.al) which was bought by Cisco. <comment350936> *Arrrrrrrrrrrrrrghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh this is why I hate Apple.* On a more sedate note - has anything changed over the past year?
