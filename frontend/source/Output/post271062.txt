How to Set, Use iOS 10.2 Parental Controls on iPhone 7 Plus <body> i want to be safe from my child use my iPhone, what i have to do? To restrict my device running on iOS 10.2?  <answer271074> What exactly do you want to restrict?  You can restrict apps:  Settings  General  Restrictions  Select app.  You can restrict websites, content:  Settings  General  Restrictions  Allowed content.  You can set a Password:  Settings  Touch ID &amp; Passcode.  Or you can use third part apps that block specific content and apps.  <answer271371> You can also use the learning mode to keep your child within a specific app, like a puzzle or game that you allow it to play.  Settings  General  Accesibility  Learning  Enable Guided access. Configure a passcode Optionally configure Time limits.  Now open the app your kid wants to use/play, triple-click the home button - select the area that may be clickable - select the hardware buttons that are allowed (volume is a good one :)) - click start.  You kid can now only use that specific app, without leaving it.  To exit this mode, just triple-click home and enter the configured passcode.  I use this all the time with my kids (also on iPad).
