How can I turn off a Mac's display without sleeping the Mac itself? <body>    strongPossible Duplicate:/strongbr   Is it possible to put the display to sleep without putting the whole computer to sleep?       I have an iMac, and sometimes I want to play some music over night, without the bright display. The display will be turned off automatically several minutes later, but I would like a button that turns the display off instantly and keeps the music playing.  How can I do this?  <answer30598> Use kbdctrl/kbd + kbdshift/kbd + kbdEject/kbd to turn off display.  You can also set a "hot-corner" to turn off display in a few seconds.  <answer30599> kbdCtrl/kbd+kbdShift/kbd+kbdEject/kbd will turn off the displays but leave the computer active.  kbdControl ⌃/kbd+kbdShift ⇧/kbd+kbdPower ⌽/kbd for some Macbook  <comment315447> Not sure why, but it does not work for me - instead of just switching off the screen - it puts computer to sleep. So after I move the mouse and the screen is back on - I need to enter my password again. Any idea why this might be happening?
