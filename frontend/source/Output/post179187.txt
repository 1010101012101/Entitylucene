Turn on Text Replacement, Chrome? <body> I know I'm supposed to enable text replacement via Edit  Substitutions  Text Replacement but… I cannot find that menu in Chrome at all. Help?  <answer179202> Enter in terminal to activate text replacement across all applications:  precodedefaults write -g WebAutomaticTextReplacementEnabled -bool true /code/pre  <answer179313> That feature appears to be specific to Safari on OS X; however, there are plenty of extensions for Chrome that imitate that functionality (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/auto-text-expander-for-go/iibninhmiggehlcdolcilmhacighjamp?hl=en for example).  It will not use the built-in OS X dictionary, unfortunately, but can sync dictionaries across Chrome browsers on the same account.  <answer236781> This is currently not possible because Chrome does few things its own way. Here is the bug that tracks this  https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=42434  Still if you dream about adding a comment there forget it, even if Chromium is Open-Source the team decided that they don't need external feedback and disabled the commenting.  There is also a thread on Google Forums about this bug. But again, Google closed the topic in order to avoid other comments.  https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!topic/chrome/CAv_4eUkhzk  I guess that your only option would be use Twitter to tween about this issue. Be use that you mention code@Google/code in your tweet. You will be surprised how reactive are big companies when their PR is affected by their poor experience.  <comment212379> Thanks. The command ran with no problem, I restarted Chrome, but still... no dice. Is this correct for Yosemite? <comment212382> Hmm, maybe this only automatically enables it for all supported application. Which chrome doesn't seem to be since it does not have the menu like you said. It seems to be a known issue, there are a few posts about it on the internet. <comment278794> Yes, it's only for apps that support the feature (ie. apps that already have the _Substitutions_ option in the _Edit_ menu. This terminal command just saves you the trouble of switching it on for all the apps that support it. <comment312787> These a NOT specific to Safari and they are supposed to work with any application on OS X. This is a OS level functionality which can be enabled or disabled for specific apps if you want. Still, Chrome is doing something very-different which is breaking this. Chrome is the only app where this feature does not work. <comment334459> Re-opening this issue so someone will finally fix it once and for all... Please reply and let Google know if you’ve also suffered from this problem. https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=677537 <comment334464> @JonathanA.Levi You can't reopen a question by posting a comment.

I'm thinking he just needs help and is looking for others to pressure Google into fixing this.  But I could be wrong... <comment364080> Awesome! Thanks for that Chrome extension!
