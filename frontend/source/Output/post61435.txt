How can I make the App Store use store credit for purchases instead of my credit card? <body> I just got my Mac and it came with a free $100 gift card and I'd like to buy "back to school" apps but whenever I got to buy them it attempts to charge my empty credit card instead of using the $100 gift card. I can't figure out how to fix it and it's frustrating me.  <comment70984> You did *redeem* the gift card, right? I'm asking because the app store should prefer gift card credit over credit cards by default. If you redeemed your card correctly your credit should show up on the main page of the app store.
