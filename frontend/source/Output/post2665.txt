alternative keyboards <body> I use the latest wireless keyboard for my iMac at home. Since I use it for programming most of the time, the little laptop style arrow keys are inadequate. Are there any GOOD alternative apple keyboards available?  EDIT:  Sorry Dori, I should have been more clear. I would specifically like a keyboard which is made for Apple, with the appropriate "command" and extra keys (like F13 - F15, and the volume keys).  <answer2666> Virtually all USB and Bluetooth keyboards work just fine with Macs.  There are about a zillion Mac-compatible keyboards, and just because one person loves a given model doesn't mean it will suit another (I still use my Apple Extended Keyboard, for instance). Some of the bigger makers in the field are Kensington, Logitech, Macally, Matiassup1/sup, and Adesso.  What in particular (besides bigger arrow keys) matters to you? What do you hate? What do you love? Do you want wireless, or is USB ok?

I would specifically like an apple specific keyboard. <comment2370> While any usb keyboard will _work_, the different meta-key placement is irritating. <comment2376> The wired apple keyboard has normal arrow keys is that OK or do you need a wireless keyboard? <comment2413> Preferably wireless, but you are right, the normal keyboard (full sized) is pretty good (I'm actually typing on one right now ... I use it at work for windows programming, yuck).
