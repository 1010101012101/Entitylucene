Diagram Software <body> I study computing on an advanced level and I need a program that will make it easier to create flowcharts and other diagrams efficiently. I don't need too many features; I just want something that works! I'm aware that there are many website that do exactly what I need but most of the times when I need to draw diagrams I don't have access to the internet  <answer26139> It isn't cheap, but OmniGraffle from OmniGroup is truly outstanding. Student pricing is available, and substantially less expensive than full retail price. ($60 vs $100)  <answer26140> Two that I know of:  ol liShapes - Cheap ($5) with a decent array of tools/li liOmniGraffle - Expensive, but it can do pretty much anything, including reading Vizio files (Pro version)/li /ol  <answer26148> Try Graphviz(http://www.graphviz.org/).  It is free, powerful, and easy to learn.  You don't need draw anything, just write a piece of code, and the program will generate a fig for you.    <answer26161> The OpenOffice.org office suite (and its forked cousin, LibreOffice) is completely free, and includes a drawing application that is actually fairly useable for creating diagrams and flowcharts at the simpler end of the scale.  <comment29809> an example of a site that does diagrams is http://www.diagram.ly/ <comment29856> OmniGraffle is by far the best option for the Mac today. I can highly recommend it as I use it to diagram complex systems daily. <comment30023> Decided to go with Shapes since I just need to do a couple of flowcharts for a project. Thx x x x
