How to Change default fallback font (for non-latin languages) <body> System: iMac running El Capitan 10.11.1.  strongMy question is:/strong How do I change the default fallback font for Thai (or any non-latin language for that matter) so that the terminal app shows the Thai font of my choice while keeping the English font.  My terminal font is set to Menlo at a font size that is comfortable to me. Menlo does not have any Thai characters, which I double-checked in codeFontbook &gt; View &gt; Repertoire/code and also via the codeMenu bar &gt; Show Emoji and Symbols/code. (But interestingly has Lao.) However, when I type Thai characters in the terminal, miraculously Thai appears. Apparently, there is a system wide default fallback font. However, one Thai character does not display properly. (Sara Am, สระ อำ) I can change the terminal font to CS Prajad and the Thai looks very good including the problem character. However the English font is hideously ugly and is useless as a programming font.   I disabled SIP (System Integrity Protection) in order to modify the xml file codeDefaultFontFallbacks.plist/code located in   code/System/Library/Frameworks/ApplicationServices.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/CoreText.framework/Versions/A/Resources/code then rebooted thinking that this would solve my problem. However, the original default Thai font is still showing in the terminal.  (Changes I made to codeDefaultFontFallbacks.plist/code.)  Substitute default string.  precode&lt;default&gt;...     ...     &lt;string&gt;Thonburi&lt;/string&gt; to &lt;string&gt;CSPrajad&lt;/string&gt; (no space)     ... &lt;/default&gt; /code/pre  add CS Prajad as monospace font as per Han Chinese and Korean xml strings.  precode&lt;monospace&gt;     ...     &lt;array&gt;         ...         &lt;array&gt;             &lt;string&gt;th&lt;/string&gt;             &lt;string&gt;CSPrajad-Regular&lt;/string&gt;         &lt;/array&gt;         ...     &lt;/array&gt;     ... &lt;/monospace&gt; /code/pre  strongRecap:/strong There are system default fallback fonts used by terminal when the selected application font does not have the character set being typed. However, the simple changes that I made to codeDefaultFontFallbacks.plist/code had no apparent effect on the Thai default fallback font after rebooting.  strongRepeat Question:/strong How do I change the default fallback font for Thai (or any non-latin language for that matter) so that the terminal app shows the Thai font of my choice while keeping the English font.  strongBonus points :)/strong How do I adjust the default size of my fall back font so that the Thai is not microscopic and the English is still at normal size.  <comment374115> Might it be a case sensitivity and spacing  problem? "CS Pra**J**ad"? <comment374220> Can you identify the font used for Thai in regular fallback mode? I also noticed that there are two .plist files: DefaultFontFallbacks.plist and CTPresetFallbacks.plist. Both don't contain special Thai rules.
