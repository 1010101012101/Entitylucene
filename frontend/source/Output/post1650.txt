Is there any way to suppress the "incompatible accessory" warning on the iPhone? <body> Every time I connect my iPhone to the dock in my vehicle, the following warning message is displayed:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NLbQU.jpg" alt=""  After dismissing the warning dialog, everything appears to works fine. Is there any way to suppress this dialog from being displayed strongevery/strong time I connect my iPhone to the dock?  (Enabling Airplane Mode does seem to do the trick, but that's not a realistic solution as I don't want to lose voice/data functionality when docking the iPhone.)  <answer1651> Gotta be jailbroken AFAIK. There's a package called Popup Blocker that suppresses alerts. This is probably the best option.  I recommend Spirit for jailbreaking 3.1.2 or 3.1.3. It's super easy and works well for everyday (non-hacker) use.
