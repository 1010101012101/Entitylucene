How to force a screen resolution on my MacBook Pro? <body> I have a MacBook Pro, bought 3 years ago, I'm not sure of the model, but the processor is a 2.66 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo, with 4 GB of RAM, nVidia 9400M 256M. I am using MacOS 10.6.6.  Next week I will do a presentation in a conference, and they suggest to use a code1280 x 720/code resolution, as the conference will be recorded using the code16:9/code format.  Unfortunately, when I want to change the resolution of my screen on my laptop (codeSystem preferences &gt; Displays &gt; Screen resolutions/code), it does not provide this resolution. I can use code1024 x 768/code which is the "backup" resolution for the conference, but not the suggested resolution.  So my question: is there a way to force such resolution on my MBP?  <answer48489> If you connect it to a display that offers 1280 x 720 as a resolution, then it should give you that as an option. You need to test it with the display that you will be using at the conference, which is always a good idea.  <answer86103> edit  /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/com.apple.Boot.plist add these lines, save &amp; reboot.  precode&lt;key&gt;Graphics Mode&lt;/key&gt; &lt;string&gt;1280x720x32&lt;/string&gt; /code/pre  to edit com.apple.boot.plist you may have to copy it to your desktop first, edit it and then put it back to where it was, overwriting the original file  <comment55546> Ok, so if I understand well, even if my MBP can't display (or at least does not provide) `1280x720` on the laptop screen, it will be able to *output* such resolution? <comment55548> Correct. As Mike says when you connect to another display or projector the computer will offer different resolutions for you to choose from when that display is chosen.
