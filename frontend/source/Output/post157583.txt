Access OS X Yosemite "Share Menu" extension through Apple Script <body> I'd like to make an Alfred workflow that would send a file as an attachment through Airmail. I noticed that Airmail has a "Share Menu" extension to do just that.   Is there a way to access this extension through Applescript? It doesn't even have to be Applescript, as long as it's an executable and can take arguments.   I appreciate any guidance you can provide!
