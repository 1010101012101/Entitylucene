How to troubleshoot Network Connect issues? <body> I have to use Juniper's Network Connect to use my company's VPN.  I haven't changed anything on my system in the past few days, but suddenly Network Connect fails to connect to the VPN with the following error message:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ongwx.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  The log shows the following:  precode2013-03-20 11:38:35.675 ncproxyd[p298.t1799] ipsec.info New tunnel being created (tunnel.cpp:52)  2013-03-20 11:38:35.681 ncproxyd[p298.t1799] routeutils.info Creating Desktop route table iterator (routeutils.cpp:289) /code/pre  I have tried to uninstall Network Connect, remove all of the files that NC leaves on my system (documented here), and reinstall.  I've removed my wifi connection, rebooted, and readded it.  I've mixed these.    I'm using OS X 10.8.2 and Network Connect 7.1.  I'm at a loss.  How can I get my VPN working again?  h2Edited on 2013-11-07 to add:/h2  I'm now on 10.9 and still experiencing this issue.  My company's IT reports that there are several other Mac users across various versions of OS X who are having the same issue.  They haven't been able to figure out what is going on.  My company has a backup VPN from another provider, and those of us impacted by this issue have been placed on it.  <answer151172> Have you tried using Junos Pulse instead? At the very least it seems to be better at reporting errors.    <comment99495> so what does the log viewer shows? <comment99497> Nothing terribly useful:  2013-03-20 11:38:35.675 ncproxyd[p298.t1799] ipsec.info New tunnel being created (tunnel.cpp:52) 2013-03-20 11:38:35.681 ncproxyd[p298.t1799] routeutils.info Creating Desktop route table iterator (routeutils.cpp:289) <comment99512> Have you confirmed if anything has changed on your work's firewall or network? <comment99520> I am sure you have read this; http://kb.juniper.net/InfoCenter/index?page=content&id=KB9216 <comment99546> Nothing has changed on my office's firewall or network.  I did find that KB article, but (a) I don't use a firewall on my machine, and (b) that KB article is for Network Connect on Windows.
