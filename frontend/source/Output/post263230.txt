Keyboard shortcut to select a specific Application Window from Mission Control <body> The codeMission Control | Application Windows/code shortcut permits viewing of all windows associated with a strongemsingle/em/strong application:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/U3TgY.png" alt="enter image description here"  Here is a portion of that feature in action for an app having three windows open:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nKGGe.png" alt="enter image description here"  My question regards what you might notice from that screenshot:  that strongemnone of the windows has focus/em/strong - i.e. none of them have a blue bordered frame.   If I select any of them with the emmouse/em then that particular app window will be properly selected.  However I do this operation many times every hour and am seeking a keyboard-only key sequence.    What I have tried:  ul liarrow keys/li litab/li lireturn/li linumbers/li licommand+number/li lioption+number/li /ul  None of those have any effect. So .. what is the magical key sequence to select one of the windows?   I am on codeEl Capitan/code .  <comment331770> It looks like it is not possible inside Mission Control. You know you can use `cmd + tab` to switch from windows quickly? Although that doesn't work on multiple windows in a single app.
