How do I use Lightning EarPods with MacBook Pro 2015? <body> The EarPods which come with iPhone 7 are Lightning EarPods, there isn't a Female Lightning to Male 3.5mm connector in the market AFAIK. The cable which Apple gives along with iPhone 7 is Male Lightning to Female 3.5mm connector.  Is there any way I can use the Lightning EarPods with my MacBook Pro?  <answer287313> strongYou can't./strong  Yes, it is a design flaw. You will need to buy regular earbuds that use the 3.5mm connector. If you want to use these headphones with your iphone, you will need to use the 3.5mm to lightning adapted that was on the back of your earpod case.   <comment362785> Being an Apple fan, I'm even ready to spend and buy adapters, but I hate it when there exists no solution to interconnect Apple products. AirPods is the only solution for this, suits both gadgets.
