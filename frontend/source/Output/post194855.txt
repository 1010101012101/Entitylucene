Connect to Wi-Fi via command line that requires username and password <body> I am trying to find the command to connect to a wireless access point that is WPA2, and requires both a username and password.  The command codenetworksetup -setairportnetwork &lt;iface&gt; &lt;ssid&gt; &lt;pwd&gt;/code only works if I don't need a user name.  <answer194877> It does sound like you are trying to connect to an enterprise network and you have 802.11x authentication.   If this is NOT the case and you need to enter a username/password in a web page, then you may need to create an AppleScript/Automator function to handle that.  In any event, to connect to an 802.11x network with authentication, you need a network profile.  To create one, you either need OS X Server or you can use Apple Configurator.  It's a free application available from Apple.  While it is geared toward iOS, you can create wi-fi profiles then export them.  Once you have the xml file, you import it with networksetup.  Or...  You can edit the xml file directly which is not something trivial.  <comment232527> are you trying to connect a enterprise wpa2?  Sounds like you need a system profile. <comment232539> Yes. How does one do that? I'm unfamiliar with system profiles. Thanks. <comment233019> I've downloaded Apple Configurator and I see no way of exporting a wi-fi profile.  I also don't know which xml file you are referring to when you say that I can edit them directly. I've googled and searched for them, but have had no luck.
