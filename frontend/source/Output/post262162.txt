How to use 3 monitors on MacBook Pro that does not have a graphics card <body> I'm currently using an early 2015 13 inch MacBook Pro with Intel Iris Graphics 6100. I'm trying to use 3 external monitors, but I can only get 2 to work. I've seen people suggest using an active cable, but all of their suggestions are for MacBooks with a dedicated graphics card.   Will an active cable be enough for my situation, or do I have to buy some other, more expensive piece of hardware?  <answer262177> Officially Apple only supports two external displays on this model.  More specifically, it supports an HDMI-compatible device, including 4K, while using one Thunderbolt display or it can support up to two Thunderbolt displays.  In terms of external resolution this model supports up to 3840 x 2160 pixels at 30Hz or 4096 x 2160 pixels at 24Hz via HDMI and up to 3840 x 2160 pixels at 60Hz via Thunderbolt.  You could investigate external graphics card options, but I would suggest living with the two displays instead.
