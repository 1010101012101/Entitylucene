Mac OS X Terminal - While True Do - Can you stop automatically under desired conditions? <body> Currently I am using a following command: while true; do python [file]; sleep X; done  I was wondering if I can stop the loop if the result prints a word that I'm looking for.   Plus is it possible to make a sound when it stops?  <answer186973> You can stop the execution by entering the command codebreak/code.  To make a sound, codetput bel/code should work on most shells.  Something like the following example should work:  precodewhile true do      commands...       if [[ "$YOUR_VARIABLE" == "value" ]]      then          tput bel          break      fi done /code/pre  <comment220904> That `if whatever` part is a big unknown though -- the OP wants to stop on finding a word in the output from `commands...`.
