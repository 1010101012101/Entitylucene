When is a folder not a folder? <body> I have a "folder" (as it appears from Finder), but I can't cd into it from the terminal. if I ls -la this is what it looks like.  precode-rw-r--r--@   1 christopher  admin   1317440 Oct 17 22:23 Tomcat /code/pre  What is it and how do I make it a folder or at least cd into it?  <answer154042> Usually this is an codeAlias/code of a folder. An alias is normally marked with a litte arrow a the left lower corner.  Example:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wRPwA.jpg" alt="example"  precode-rw-r--r--@  1 user  staff  1938832 31 Okt 16:54 Car drwxr-xr-x   3 user  staff      102 31 Okt 16:56 Car1 -rw-r--r--@  1 user  staff      178 31 Okt 16:56 Car2 /code/pre  Car is an Alias, Car1 a folder, emCar2 is a text file without suffix but with the icon of a folder though/em.  To enable cd'ing into an codeAlias/code I've found the following at Mac OS X Hints. Don't know if it still works.     Here is the bash function I include in .bashrc. Note that the second elif       requires double brackets for the test, because it include the logical operator     or (||):   precodefunction cd {   if [ ${#1} == 0 ]; then     builtin cd   elif [ -d "${1}" ]; then     builtin cd "${1}"   elif [[ -f "${1}" || -L "${1}" ]]; then     path=$(getTrueName "$1")     builtin cd "$path"   else     builtin cd "${1}"   fi } /code/pre     And here's the C source code for getTrueName.
