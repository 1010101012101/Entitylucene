How to copy-paste in Finder when there's no right-click space? <body> I'd be very surprised if this doesn't trouble anyone else.  Sometimes I want to paste a copied file in a Finder window, but there is just no "empty" space for me to right-click on and hit 'Paste item', as right-clicking anywhere on this window will open the right-click context menu for a file/folder.  Usually, I just resize the window till I can find some empty space below all the files/folders for me to right-click on, but sometimes (as in my screenshot below) there are way too many files/folders for to resize the finder window up to that point.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/SrGSL.png" alt="enter image description here"  Basically:  strongHow can I be able to right-click somewhere (to know exactly where I'm pasting) and hit 'Paste Item'?/strong  As you can tell, I am currently using the column view, and hope there is a solution in this view. I also do not just want to hit Cmd+V because it's hard to tell which is the target directory when I have a folder open in the column-view.  <answer226838> Well, if I use kbd⌘/kbd+kbdV/kbd keys to paste, it does not matter if a file or folder is highlighted. The file is pasted to the folder currently open in the Finder window.  If you want to just copy a file to a folder by emdrag and drop/em, hold down the kbdoption/kbd key before dragging the file.  <answer227076> It seems that the problem you're trying to solve is actually this:     it's hard to tell which is the target directory when I have a folder open in the column-view   If your preferred method is clicking, you can still be sure of your target directory by left-clicking. Either:  ul liClick on the name of the folder you want to paste into, or/li liClick on the name of a file that's already in the folder you want to paste into./li /ul  (In the crowded view you describe, you should still be able to do at least one of these two.) The just choose Edit  Paste or use kbd⌘/kbd+kbdV/kbd.  <answer227233> The settings-wheel ("Action") button on the Finder acts as a right-click on the current folder. If you left-click on it, you'll get all the options you would on right-clicking the current folder, including "Paste Item". I've indicated it with an arrow below:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Dvj2K.png" alt="A screenshot showing the location of the Action button"
