Workflow not showing in Safari > Services menu unless first display URL-with-path context menu <body> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rTQKi.png" alt="Copy All URLs.workflow image"  I created the above workflow ("Copy All URLs.workflow") * that functions 100% from the Safari contextual menu of a URL-with-path (ie, not merely a host), both with and without keyboard shortcut use.  For example, likely in this page's control elements above, you'll see a "Questions" element with the associated URL https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions; and the large "AskDifferent" element with the associate URL https://apple.stackexchange.com/ (ie, no path, only a host).  If I strongFIRST/strong right-click (or control-click) on Questions,  precode  Services &gt; Copy All URLs /code/pre  displays in the contextual menu every time.  strongTHEN/strong, if I right-click on a AskDifferent,  precode  Services &gt; Copy All URLs /code/pre  displays in the contextual menu every time;  —OR—  strongTHEN/strong, if I click on the Safari menu,  precode  Safari &gt; Services &gt; Copy All URLs /code/pre  displays in the Safari  Services menu every time.  strongON THE OTHER HAND/strong, if I strongFIRST/strong right-click upon a background or text page region, or on a host-only URL (ie, not a URL-with-path), the resulting contextual menu will not include Services at all, nor will a subsequent right-click on AskDifferent display Services, nor a subsequent Safari menu click display anything in the Services menu except Safari  Services  Services Preferences.  strongI would like to have the Copy All URLs workflow emalways/em appear in emboth/em the Safari  Services menu emand/em a host-only URL right-click when executed./strong  I think I've tried every combination of Options and app drop-down menu choices within Automator.  I've read far and wide.  (The only thing I haven't tried is disabling El Capitan /System directory security in order to move the workflow to /System/Library/Services )  [Environment: OS X El Capitan 10.11.6, Safari 10.1.1, 17" MBP 2TB SSD, 8GB RAM]
