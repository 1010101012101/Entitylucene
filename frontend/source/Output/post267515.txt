Have second user in window and not whole desktop <body> I have to use a different user on my mac for some tasks which include regular switching between users. I know about quick user switching, but this has two limitations for me:  ol liI have to enter the password each time I switch users/li liI would like to have the second user in a window and not the whole desktop (as in a virtual machine)/li /ol  I would prefer the solution 2.  Is there a way of logging in to the local machine as user2 while being logged in as user1 so that the desktop of user2 is shown in a window and I can easily switch? Do I have to use VNC or is there a build in option which I could (ab)use?  <answer269629> OK - I have found a solution using Real-vnc.   ol liInstall Real-vnc strongversion 5.3.2/strong from their download site. It is important to strongnot/strong install a newer version, as this seems to be the last version which supports User-mode for the server without a paid subscription!/li liAs the server stops when a fast user switch occurs it is important to change the following setting (from the real-vnc knowledge base):/li /ol     ... setting the option "StopUserModeOnSwitchOut" to "No" in the Expert tab   (VNC Server  Options  Expert tab).   ol start="3" liQuit codeVNC server/code (this is the service). We don't need the global codeVNC server/code service as we will use the codeUser Mode/code./li liNow switch to the other user and login/li liStart codeVNC server/code (user mode). If you want to, you can add it to the codeLogin Items/code to have it autostart upon login./li liSwitch back to your main user/li liuse codeScreen Sharing/code app or the codeVNC Viewer/code app to connect to codelocalhost/code. It is possible that you have to set a password in the VNC server, but I am not sure (the viewer will tell you)./li /ol  That's it - it works perfectly for me, even with multiple monitor setup.  What I didn't manage, was to setup that the viewer uses both monitors - but I can live with that.
