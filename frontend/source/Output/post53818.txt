Is there a way to completely reset / regenerate Quick Look preferences (system-wide)? <body> Quick Look fails to work on many file types that actually have Quick Look plugins and I fear that some file clobbering has occurred during my last two OS upgrades.    When Quick Look fails, the Quick Look preview is a blank page with:  codefoo&lt;TITLE&gt;&lt;/HEAD.../code.    Has anyone else run into this issue?  <answer53840> From the CLI  codeqlmanage -r/code will reset the Quick Look cache.  <comment224614> What if this commend doesn't do anything, and can be run for hours without it doing anything?
