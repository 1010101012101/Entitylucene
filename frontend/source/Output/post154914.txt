Using Automator CLI with passed file name <body> I'd like to apply a quartz filter (Reduce File Size) through Preview Export using the command line while passing in the input and output filenames through CLI. I'm thinking the best way to do this is through Automator since it seems there isn't a way to access Preview through CLI.  I'm thinking it would look something like this in the end:  precodeautomator -i input=input.pdf output=output.pdf PDF.workflow /code/pre  But I'm probably completely off.  Here's the basic workflow, which doesn't work as hoped:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wbL4j.png" alt="workflow"
