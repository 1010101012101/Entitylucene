Can I use multiple displays on a MacBook Pro using a TV connected by Thunderbolt/HDMI? <body> With a MacBook Pro, can I  watch a film on the TV connected externally to HDMI while browsing the web on the MacBook screen?  <answer105682> Yes - you can control what plays on multiple displays by dragging windows across the combined desktop or using Mission Control to direct a video player to the external connection while keeping your other windows on the internal display.  <comment124247> Does anyone know of a tutorial for this? I have just switched from PC to Mac so am new to all of this, thanks.
