Can I make a retina iPad display websites at full resolution? <body> In other words, can I make it appear to the web server as if the device is 2048x1536 pixels and codedevice-pixel-ratio/code 1?  I'm happy to pay for an app that does does this if there is oneâ€¦  <answer96519> I believe this could be a problem with how sites are interpreting the User-Agent string and are assuming that it's an older iPad / mobile device.  Try using the Google Chrome browser and it's "Request Desktop Version" feature.  https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/chrome/id535886823  <comment113306> I'll try that, but I should have mentioned I've already tried something similar with Atomic Browser to no avail
