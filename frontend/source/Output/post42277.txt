Utility to move windows as a group for Mac OS X? <body> Is there a utility for Mac OS X that will group windows (2 separate apps)? Similar to how objects are grouped in PowerPoint or other design apps. I would like both windows to move together.   <answer42283> There are 5 apps on the App Store that match the search term "arrange windows" and I have heard good things about three of them (in reverse aplhabetical order):  ul liWindowTiler/li liCinch/li liBetterSnapTool/li /ul  The one I use is also on the app store, but doesn't show in that search term but it's fabulous.  ul liDivvy/li /ul  <answer103958> X-Assist. However it seems to be an old app.  <comment48369> bmike, thanks but "arranging" windows is not what i need. i would like to "group" windows so they drag together. Divvy looks interesting nonetheless <comment48395> Yowsers - stacking them and moving them - or tiling them and moving them? I'll edit the beginning of my answer since it's clear none I've listed does grouping across apps. Let me know if you'd prefer I delete my answer so your question sits here unanswered... <comment48599> Tiling and moving them. I don't think you need to to delete it since the checkmark indicates a correct answer. <comment122443> Can you provide a link to the app or screenshots?
