Can't delete files from Trash <body> I'm trying to empty my trash, and it seems that I having some problem with encoding:  precodeMacKassner:501 kassner$ rm -Rf t/t/ rm: t/t//t: Directory not empty rm: t/t/: Directory not empty /code/pre  Ok then, let's see what's inside:  precodeMacKassner:t kassner$ pwd /Volumes/DATA/.Trashes/501/t/t/t MacKassner:t kassner$ ls -la ls: 07 The Kids (feat. Janelle Monáe).mp3: No such file or directory total 128 drwxrwxrwx  1 kassner  staff  32768 Jan  7 10:42 . drwxrwxrwx  1 kassner  staff  32768 Feb  4 18:12 .. /code/pre  It seems a problem with the special char on that file. I can't empty trash using Finder either (even securely).  EDIT: StackExchange changes a litte bit the exhibition of the special character. Here's a screenshot:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GYW3F.png" alt=""  <answer170517> On a terminal window, try the following:  precodefind /Volumes/DATA/.Trashes/501/t/t/t -type f -exec rm -f {} ';' /code/pre  <answer170547> The quick and dirty way to trash a folder is to move another folder with the same name into the existing folder. It looks like you have a folder codet/code which might be amenable to making a new folder on the data drive and name it identically to the folder you wish to nuke and then trashing the "new" codet/code folder.  If that doesn't work, you should be able to open a finder window and attempt to rename the problematic file. See http://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201583 for details.  Lastly, if nothing works, consider posting what format the /Volumes/DATA is via codediskutil list/code and codesudo ls -laOR /Volumes/DATA/.Trashes//code  <comment200454> If you hold option and command and then use the mouse to empty trash does that help? <comment200466> Thanks @jherran, but I got the same: `find: /Volumes/DATA/.Trashes/501/t/t/t/07 The Kids (feat. Janelle Monáe).mp3: No such file or directory ` <comment200498> @bmike Not really. Shift neither. <comment200830> none of that explained on the link worked. Trashing a new folder with the same name, OSX appends the time to the folder name when on Trash. I guess the only solution is to format the disk.
