Apple Directory / Profile Manager  - Restricting simultaneous same user logins on multiple  machines? <body> We are using Apple Directory for internal user authentication. We want to restrict a user to login from a single machine at any one time. I have been trying to find a way to do this in Apple Directory without any luck.  Is there a way to do something similar in Snow Leopard or Lion server?  <answer23941> I assume you mean Open Directory, not Apple Directory.  There is a check box in Workgroup Manager in the user's account.  Set it to not allow simultaneous logins.  This box is present in WGM on 10.3 - 10.6  I know that Lion deals with workgroups a little differently.   <answer38159> Yes, there is a checkbox in Workgroup Manager to restrict Lion users to not allow simultaneous login on managed computers.  ul liAuthenticate with diradmin or other LDAP administrator (the picture below shows the box dimmed as I was not authenticated at the time)/li liSelect the user in the left pane/li liSelect Advanced in the right pane/li lienable or disable the checkbox for simultaneous login as needed./li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6w4R8.png" alt="enter image description here"
