Safari slowdown issues <body> Safari is quite slow when I open new tabs. I get a busy cursor, and I cannot interact with other tabs.  Is there any way to make it faster?  I have a 2010 MacBook Pro, MacOS 10.6.6, Safari 5.0.3.  <answer8017> First thing to try is to clear the cache and history, and restart Safari (and even your MacBook).  <answer8019> Here are some good tips on reviews.cnet.com on speeding up Safari.  Some of the tips are detailed below:  ol liTry dragging the folder Icons -- where these icons are cached -- within the ~/Library/Safari folder to the trash and restarting Safari./li liTry deleting code~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.Safari.plist/code if you are experiencing slow launches, but note that you will lose some easily recoverable settings, such as whether or not tabbed browsing is enabled./li liA blanket approach to deleting many of the potentially problem-causing items is the Reset Safari... command, available under the Safari menu in Safari. Note, however, that this command also deletes your browser history, personal data -- such as stored login passwords, search entries, cookies and more -- that you may not want to clear. Still, it's a good initial cleansing step.  On recent versions of Safari you can select the kinds of data you want to delete/keep./li liTry temporarily disabling plugins to see if that's a potential cause.  Go to the Safari menu within Safari, and select Preferences.  Click on the Security tab and deselect 'Enable plug-ins'.  Restart Safari and see if the slowness has disappeared.  If it has then the problem is likely to be an errant plugin./li /ol  <answer8041> Install clicktoflash or some other flash blocking thing.  Also disable java and other plugins. These are particularly useful for Safari 4.  <comment8678> What versions of OS X and Safari are you running? <comment8747> I've updated the question. <comment70851> While this link may answer the question, it is better to include the essential parts of the answer here and provide the link for reference.  Link-only answers can become invalid if the linked page changes. <comment70880> True, I think I was new to the site when I answered that.  I've amended the answer with some of the more likely causes.  Thanks <comment70894> How much RAM does your mac have?
