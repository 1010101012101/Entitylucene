Cannot resize OS X startup parting (both diskutil and Disk Utility GUI freeze) <body> I'm trying to shrink my Yosemite partition and create a new one.  Trouble is that the Disk Utility gets stuck "Preparing to partition disk" (same thing when run in recovery), and diskutil in a recovery terminal freezes the moment I enter the diskutil command.   I've read the diskutil manual, done Google searches, and tried the various solutions (such as verify disk).  What should I do?  If you need more info, let me.  (I have a Boot Camp partition with Windows 10).  <comment278755> I've edited the tags - you might explain what OS is running to provide Disk Utility? If you start in Internet Recovery or Recovery HD, you will have better luck preventing open files from halting a resize operation. The downside is you won't have good logging if a hardware error is causing the delay / failure. <comment278758> Depending on your disk config your request will probably break Boot Camp. Please add the output of `diskutil list` and `diskutil cs list`.
