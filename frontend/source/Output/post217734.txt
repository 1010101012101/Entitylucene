Are there Free or Inexpensive Apps or tricks to make it fast?  Thanks!  <answer217748> You can make a clean install to El Capitan      Make your Mac run silent, cool and fast under OS X El Capitan   http://9to5mac.com/2015/10/16/how-to-make-your-mac-run-silent-cool-fast-os-x-el-capitan/   use CleanMyMac 3 to optimize &amp; clean your mac     Clean, optimize, and maintain your Mac with CleanMyMac 3.

Just get a good brand, my Intel hasn't had any problems  You could also upgrade the RAM. Other World Computing is a great place to buy RAM for your specific model of Mac.  My Mid-2009 MacBook Pro runs El Capitan pretty well, so you may as well update to it, as El Capitan is supposed to make Macs (even older models) run faster. That's my experience with El Capitan, but YMMV.  An SSD, RAM, and El Capitan is where I would start if I wanted to upgrade any Mac.  <comment263222> Welcome to Ask Different!  What is the current version of the OS on your MacBook Pro?  Go to the   About this Mac to see.  You should also be able to determine the model year from here. <comment263226> Thanks! I have Yosemite but, I will update soon. <comment263234> Thanks but, isn't cleanmymac bad from reviews? <comment263237> I'm using CMM for a while and I really like it... I have not heard about bad reviews before. But you can test it and make your own opinion ;) <comment263239> ok thank you!!! <comment263286> Empty RAM is wasted RAM. Mavericks wasn't so good at handling the new memory paradigm, but Yosemite & El Capitan have got a lot better - see http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/67031/isnt-inactive-memory-a-waste-of-resources/67048#67048 for a good explanation. <comment263334> Hmm I would do that if I had the money but, thanks for the suggestion.
