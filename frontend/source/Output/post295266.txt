Merging Itunes Libraries from two separate Apple ID's <body> apologies if this is already covered somewhere but I need some help My husband and I have just bought our first Mac and want to have all of our respective iTunes purchases consolidated to the library on this machine. This way we will both have access to everything and won't need to manage our purchases etc separately. Obviously we both have separate Apple ID's so I need a dummy's guide on how to bring them together? Do we need to set up the user on a completely different Apple ID as apposed to it being on my husbands ID?  <comment372768> Welcome to Ask Different! :) I've closed this question as a duplicate as I feel the other question already has a number of answers that provide you with the best options.
