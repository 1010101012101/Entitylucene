Generic TWAIN driver for OS x? <body> I am looking for a generic TWAIN driver for OS X, one that would not need additional hardware. I just want to use it for testing TWAIN.  <answer15236> In  OS X TWAIN is not "The Scanner Standard" as in windows. For OS X  several scanner manufacturers make TWAIN drivers and some others make plugins into various applications and emnot/em TWAIN, so IMHO you cannot rely (only) on TWAIN.  For the testing/developent TWAIN/SANE may help you - check this link:   http://www.ellert.se/twain-sane/  Access scanners via emSANE/em - and enable the TWAIN datasource.  <answer15239> I solved my problem by installing the demo version of VueScan. If someone else find a free tool that installs a driver that is visible in Photoshop, I will accept his answer :)  <comment16465> All I need is to install a driver that will enable me to open its window from an TWAIN enabled application.
