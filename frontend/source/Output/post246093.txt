iPhone 4 can't upgrade to iOS 8 to play newer games <body> I am using an iPhone 4 with iOS 7 and trying to download games that require iOS 8.0 or higher, however I can't upgrade the iOS. Why can't I upgrade to iOS 8?  <answer246095> You can't update to iOS 8 with iPhone 4. You need at least an iPhone 4S to install iOS 8 to play the games.  <answer246097> iPhone 4 can only go up to iOS 7.1.2, where iPhone 4S can go the latest (currently 9.3.2).
