How to fix ssh login that starts asking for password and `ls .ssh` is permission denied? <body> I use my Mac to login to remote hosts via Terminal.app using codessh/code and local stored keys a.k.a. passwordless login a.k.a authentication key login.  All of a sudden the new codessh/code login attempts are:  ol liasking for the password, where before the logins were passwordless/li lireturn codeThe authenticity of host XYZ can't be established./code/li liyes answering codeAre you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?/codebr results in codeFailed to add the host to the list of known hosts (/Users/user/.ssh/known_hosts)/code./li /ol  Also codels ~/.ssh/code results in all "Permission denied":  precodels: authorized_keys: Permission denied ls: config: Permission denied ls: id_rsa: Permission denied ls: id_rsa.pub: Permission denied ls: known_hosts: Permission denied /code/pre  How to fix this?  <answer262766> h2Wrong file permissions/h2  Wrong permissions are set on some files inside the .ssh folder. Have a look at it from Terminal.app:  precode$ sudo ls -l ~/.ssh -rw-r--r--+ 1 user  staff    393 27 nov 19:08 authorized_keys -rw-r--r--+ 1 user  staff     16 26 apr  2016 config -rw-------@ 1 user  staff   1743 16 sep  2008 id_rsa -rw-r--r--@ 1 user  staff    400 16 sep  2008 id_rsa.pub -rw-r--r--@ 1 user  staff  36654 26 nov 17:02 known_hosts /code/pre  The first column (code-rw-r--r--/code) displays the assigned unix file permissions for owner, group and others.  h3Read permissions for group and others are not allowed/h3  The real issue here is not the first coder/code on columns position 2, but the coder/code's on position 5 and 8. This tells that group and others has read permissions for these files. And that read permission for others else then the file owner, is not permitted.  h3Fix/h3  It can be fixed by removing all rights from group and everybody using the command codechmod 600 filename/code. For this specific case a command that would work is:  precode$ sudo chmod 600 ~/.ssh/{authorized_keys,config,id_rsa.pub,known_hosts} /code/pre  h3Result/h3  After running this command the new permissons look like this:  precode$ ls -l ~/.ssh total 104 -rw-------+ 1 user  staff   393B 27 nov 19:08 authorized_keys -rw-------+ 1 user  staff    16B 26 apr  2016 config -rw-------+ 1 user  staff   1,7K 16 sep  2008 id_rsa -rw-------+ 1 user  staff   400B 16 sep  2008 id_rsa.pub -rw-------+ 1 user  staff    36K 26 nov 17:02 known_hosts  /code/pre  Note: the codels/code command now runs without codesudo/code.  <comment329171> TL;DR: version: **Question:** *The permissions are wrong.* **Answer:** *Fix the permissions.* <comment329172> @Jakuje What does "TL;DR" mean? <comment329173> [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Too_long;_didn't_read]((abbreviated tl;dr and tldr;)) <comment329267> You should have read access on your public keys.
