Export local contacts from iPhone <body> My primary means of handling contacts on my iPhone is gmail sync, but somehow it appears I have added a number of contacts to my phone locally. I want just these local contacts to sync back to gmail.  I'm fine with exporting and then importing to gmail, and then deleting the local contacts off my phone. However, I can't seem to find any good way of doing this.  <answer119744> You can do this with My Contacts Backup. This will allow you to export all your local contacts as vCard which can be imported into Gmail.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7ALgn.png" width="200" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8hUAp.png" width="200" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/E5Fpa.png" width="200"  Remove your Gmail account from your device (so that only the local contacts are backed up), then backup your contacts. You can then import the .vcf into your Gmail.  <comment139681> Can you make use if a computer and iTunes to do a one time move? That is free and easy. <comment139741> @bmike If you have a good way to do it, definitely throw an answer in. My Google Fu is weak on this one it seems. <comment139761> This worked for me, was free, and was pretty easy. CHOSEN.
