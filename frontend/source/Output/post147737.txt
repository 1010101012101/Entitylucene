Apple 2015 fiscal year accounting calendar <body> I was wondering if anyone know where I can acquire Apple's 2015 fiscal year accounting calendar?  I have tried a few varieties of search term and nothing is showing up.  <answer187180> You can find a link to the fiscal calendar in iTunes Connect at the bottom of the "Payments and Financial Reports" page.  I'd post a link here, but it might change in the future.
