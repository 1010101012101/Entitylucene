set position {0,0} of element accessibillityTitle via Applescript <body> I have a UI element called codeaccessibillityTitle/code with value codeLayers/code and I want to position this element in the top right corner, but I don't know how to acces it via Applescript. I have found the element using codeAccessibility Inspector/code and here is what the rest looks like.    precodeAXApplication     AXWindow:AXDialog Attributes     isAccessibilityFocused  NO     accessibilityTitle  Layers     accessibilityGrowArea   &lt;nil&gt;     accessibilityMinimizeButton &lt;nil&gt;     accessibilityDocument   &lt;nil&gt;     accessibilityCloseButton    &lt;nil&gt;     isAccessibilityMain NO     accessibilityFullScreenButton   &lt;nil&gt;     accessibilityProxy  &lt;nil&gt;     accessibilityDefaultButton  &lt;nil&gt;     isAccessibilityMinimized    NO     accessibilityChildren   10 items     accessibilityRole   AXWindow     accessibilityParent &lt;AXApplication&gt;     accessibilityTitleUIElement &lt;nil&gt;     accessibilityCancelButton   &lt;nil&gt;     isAccessibilityModal    NO     accessibilitySubrole    AXDialog     accessibilityZoomButton &lt;nil&gt;     accessibilityRoleDescription    dialog     accessibilityToolbarButton  &lt;nil&gt;     accessibilityFrame  x=1038.00 y=23.00 w=240.00 h=773.00     accessibilityIdentifier com.pixelmatorteam.pixelmator.layers.palette Actions     accessibilityPerformRaise /code/pre  How can I use codeset position to {1280, 0}/code to this element?  <answer219887> Actually I dealt with a similar case, when I wanted to move a previously generated dialog to the top-right corner of my screen.br I only succeeded in doing so strongemthru a 2nd script/em/strong that was launched emsimultaneously/em, but had a "repeat nothing until" loop built in to await the dialog's pop-up. In my experience, no matter what I tried, the dialog would hinder an "in-script moving" while its window stayed open ...br em(I attached both to a folder: I just had to add #2 to its list.)/em     In script #1 the final command reads:  precodetell application "Finder" to display dialog DL_display as string with Â¬   title "Recent downloads" buttons {"Close"} default button 1 /code/pre  The 2nd one:  precodetell application "Finder"     set screenRgt to bounds of the window of desktop  --&gt; independent of     set rightEdge to (item 3 of screenRgt) - 425      --&gt; screen resolution end tell tell application "System Events" to tell process "Finder"     repeat while not (exists window "Recent downloads")     end repeat     delay 0.1     set position of window "Recent downloads" to {rightEdge, 61} end tell /code/pre  You can see there's a (minute) delay after "repeat-nothing". Even waiting 0.1s sometimes my MacMini's so busy that the delay's too short, and the dialog remains centered ...br (To make sure set a higher value, say: 0.5.)br My "Recent downloads" Workaround #2 for Safari can be found strongemHERE/em/strong.
