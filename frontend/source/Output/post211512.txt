I uninstalled Dropbox but still have .dropbox listed when I do ls -a. Why? <body> I have uninstalled Dropbox from my Applications on OS X but it is still showing as .dropbox in my home directory.  Why is that please?  <answer211516> Removing Dropbox doesn't delete its preferences/cache/etc, which is stored in ~/.dropbox. You can delete this yourself.  <comment255324> Since this is a question about the Dropbox sync client rather than the web interface, this question belongs on [su] or, since it's about OS X, on [apple.se].
