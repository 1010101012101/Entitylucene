Extracting copy from screen without printing screen <body> In preparing academic articles that require quotations from reputable Journals and books I am faced with a round-about retrieval process. First I take a screenshot then print that then scan it and then OCR it into my article document.   Is there a simpler way?  I have an iMac, MS Office and a Canon scanner with My Image Garden.   <answer125614> Press kbd⌘/kbd + kbdshift/kbd + kbd3/kbd to make a screenshot.  Press kbd⌘/kbd + kbdshift/kbd +  kbd4/kbd to drag a specific selection.  The screenshot will be saved as image file on your desktop.  <answer134619> You may be interested in checking out Aristocrat, a simple app that performs OCR on a selected region of your screen. It's currently free on the App Store.  Disclaimer: I'm the developer :)  <comment146987> Do you have to have it in OCR or just as image? <comment147000> Why are you printing and scanning? Can you not use the screenshot in lieu of the scanned image? <comment159350> Thanks for self-disclosing. Welcome to Ask Different!
