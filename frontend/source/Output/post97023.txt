Making an app window smaller on a mac <body> When I open some apps, the window for the app is huge.  I know I can resize the window by going to bottom right and corner and using mouse. I was just wondering is there some quicker way using keys etc?  <answer97032> Well, there are some tricks in OS X Lion and above.   Since OS X Lion you can use any window edge for resizing.  If you hold down the option key, you can also resize a window by expanding or decreasing opposite sides of a window at the same time.  If you hold down the shift key while you expand or contract a window, the window will maintain its original aspect ratio.  Also you can combine option and shift.  If you want keyboard shortcuts (not built-in there) you can use 3rd party software like http://www.macupdate.com/info.php/id/26411/mercurymover.  <answer97101> If you don't mind using an add-on, take a look at ShiftIt.  It allows you to use keys to move the window to left side, right side, top, bottom, lower left, upper right, etc.  https://github.com/fikovnik/ShiftIt  From the dev's website:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/UnHWn.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment113853> No the mouse is quicker and if well written the app will store that size to ope the next new window <comment114122> Let's decide if you are looking for third party software solutions to window management or if you want to know if the OS itself has some built in features for this.
