Why is my host name wrong at the Terminal prompt when connected to a public WiFi network? <body> For three days straight, I have connected to the public WiFi network at my local library. Each day, I have seen a different prompt in Terminal. Here are some of the prompts I've seen:  precodezp-pc:~ russell$ mary-pc:~ russell$ normob05:~ russell$ /code/pre  I have check under System Preferences - Sharing, and my computer name is "Russell's Mac". Also, I set the DHCP Client ID to "RUSSMAC" under System Preferences - Network - Advanced - TCP/IP, but I still see the random host names at the Terminal prompt.  Why is my computer name changing every day?  <answer40735> Found the answer here, though there is some discussion about the details.  In short, the Mac will pick up a host name from the DHCP server. This does not affect your computer's name as you have assigned it. This will only affect what you see at the command prompt.  <answer127405> Type in Terminal:  precodescutil --get HostName /code/pre  If there's no HostName available, what you see is probably coming from the DNS or DHCP server.    Set your HostName with:  precodesudo scutil --set HostName 'yourHostName' /code/pre  That should do it.  <answer135323> This is very late, but hopefully this helps those in the future who run into this problem. After a lot of research the somewhat long but most simple answer I found was to:  ol liOpen System Preferences  Network /li liClick the location dropdown menu/li liSelect "Edit Locations..."/li liClick the plus button to add a new location/li liAdd a new location by giving it a name/li liClick Done/li liClick Apply (instructing it to use the new location)/li liOpen new Terminal window/li /ol  That should do it.  <answer267678> I noticed my hostname listed in the terminal prompt had changed.  I found the same name configured in my network settings in the WINS tab.  Seemed to be associated with a workgroup from my office (perhaps from connecting to my corporate VPN).  Anyhow, I left it alone and simply used the sudo scutil command listed above to set my hostname and it resolved the issue. Closed terminal and opened a new one; all is good.  <answer288531> Very simple easy solution ...  ol listrongsudo hostname [name-of-host]/strong/li liEnter stronghostname/strong and see your new hostname set/li /ol  e.g.  strongdoolally:~ sjohnson$ sudo hostname AllTheRage/strong  strongdoolally:~ sjohnson$ hostname/strong  strongAllTheRage/strong  Login backin or restart terminal to refresh ...  Also, check usage of hostname in manual strongman hostname/strong  <comment188971> It's a short discussion of this exact issue. The conclusion is that you're seeing a name that was given to you by the computer that assigned you an ip address. In other words, the library's wifi gave me a random name that it picked up from some other computer that previously connected to their wifi. <comment189005> what was the "answer" mentioned then? Just that it's benign to go ahead and ignore? <comment189768> Correct. BTW, the link is working now. It looks like klanomath fixed it. <comment190271> See also http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/30552/os-x-computer-name-not-matching-what-shows-on-terminal <comment225674> should do what? <comment285967> Thanks! This fixes an annoyance with my company's VPN, and unlike [Pulse Secure's KB article](https://kb.pulsesecure.net/articles/Pulse_Secure_Article/KB22274) your solution works on OS X 10.11. <comment323986> Works on 10.12 too! I still wonder, why the value returned by \h in my PS1 string changed though.
