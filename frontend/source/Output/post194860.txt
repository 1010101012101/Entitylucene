Daily FTP backup script for external hard drive <body> I need to set a daily backup of a specific external hard drive in iMac to a FTP server. In Windows I use a batch file but with OS X I'm a little lost.  <answer195447> You may write this script and it will work for not big number of files, but entire external hard drive backup to ftp server only using bash is a hard task. Because of possible connection problem, because of namespace problem. (Some file names on Mac ) may be impossible to store on your ftp server. If you backup small number of files ~100mb just zip them and upload with sh ftp command. But if the amount of data is large 1gb it is better to use third party software like "immortal files" or "goodsync".  <comment232555> In OS X you would use a shell script. If you have a batch file you would use on Windows, paste it into your question and perhaps someone can translate the functionality  <comment232559> Thanks @forquare but i will use software, will try gbcopy or ffort do you know any of these?
