How can I define CLASSPATH variable <body> For a school assignment I need to add a folder to my classpath. It says that I should do this by adding a line to the file code.bashrc/code. However, this file doesn't appear to exist in my computer. I also read something about a file called code.profile/code which doesn't appear either. I found code/etc/profile/code, but it says I have no permission to open it.  Could you please help me? I simply need to add a folder to the classpath.  <answer139042> Yes, this file doesn't exist by default. The difference between codebash_profile/code or code.bashrc/code versus code.profile/code is that the latter will be read by shells other than bash. For your purposes, you can simply name it code.bashrc/code. Open up codeTerminal/code and enter the following command:  precodecd ~/; touch .bashrc; open -a TextEdit .bashrc /code/pre  Now you have a created a profile, which the bash shell will read from everytime you log into it.   Next, simply enter the variable as plain text in the document:  precodeexport CLASSPATH=/path/to/folder /code/pre  Or, if your have a current code$CLASSPATH/code that needs to be added to, append the folder to it in your profile:  precodeexport CLASSPATH=$CLASSPATH:/path/to/folder /code/pre  Save the code.bashrc/code file. Exit Terminal and open Terminal back up (or run code. ~/.bashrc/code in Terminal without exit/reopen).   To test, enter:  precodeecho $CLASSPATH /code/pre  <comment164005> nice, very nice, teacher :) <comment164486> Thanks for the help. Worked as expected. :)
