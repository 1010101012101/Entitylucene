AppleScript keystroke ignoring numbers <body> A very simple AppleScript like this:  precodetell application "System Events"     keystroke "abc 123" end tell /code/pre  results in just “abc” being typed. Online resources suggest this should not be the case. Adding a delay between keystrokes didn't help.  What might be causing this or how can I determine what might be causing this?  Small side question: in AppleScript terminology, what is keystroke? A function, command, something else?  <answer142988> Have a look at https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18136567/applescript-keystroke-not-behaving-as-expected  &amp; the list of ANSI codes at  How do I automate a key press in AppleScript?  It appears you're not the only one with the issue. One solution on there was to use the key code instead...  precodetell application "System Events"     key code {18} using {command down} /code/pre  It may depend on what app you're trying to send the keystrokes to - I just tested with an already-open blank document in Text Edit using   precodetell application "TextEdit" to activate tell application "System Events"     keystroke "abc 123" end tell /code/pre  &amp; it worked as expected.  A keystroke is the scripted equivalent of actually pressing that/those keys[s]  How about...  precodetell application "TextEdit" to activate tell application "System Events"     keystroke "abc"     keystroke space     keystroke "123" end tell /code/pre  <answer227940> Some more info about this issue that I've discovered is that when using codekeystroke/code with numbers, the System Events always sends them as codeANSI_Keypad#/code characters (code 82-92) instead of what you might expect as codeANSI_#/code characters (code 18-29).  For most Mac applications, this does not matter as OS X itself does not care about (use, support, etc) the codeNUMLOCK/code function on a Keypad, therefore the Keypad numbers are seen the same as keyboard numbers.  However, it will pass the codeNUMLOCK/code keypress to the application if you have a keyboard/keypad that has this key.  There are a few applications that do monitor the codeNUMLOCK/code key (for example, VMware Fusion application when running a Windows VM) and will change the behavior based on the codeNUMLOCK/code state.  So for example, if the AppleScript sends codekeystroke "456"/code to a codeNUMLOCK/code aware application.  ul liIf the codeNUMLOCK/code state is codeON/code, the numbers "456" will appear./li liIf the codeNUMLOCK/code state is codeOFF/code, the equivalent keys received are codeLeft Arrow/code code5/code codeRight Arrow/code/li /ul  In the original question, the AppleScript sent codeabc 123/code but most likely his application (which was not mentioned) was aware of the codeNUMLOCK/code state, which was currently codeOFF/code, and therefore executed the keys as codeabc/code code[space]/code codeEnd/code codeDown Arrow/code codePage Down/code  I put together a little AppleScript function that loops through the given string sending codekey code/code commands for any numbers and codekeystroke/code commands for any other characters.  precodeon numberAsKeycode(theString)   tell application "System Events"     repeat with currentChar in (every character of theString)       set cID to id of currentChar       if ((cID ≥ 48) and (cID ≤ 57)) then         key code {item (cID - 47) of {29, 18, 19, 20, 21, 23, 22, 26, 28, 25}}       else         keystroke currentChar       end if     end repeat   end tell end numberAsKeycode  set myString to "abc 123" numberAsKeycode(myString) /code/pre  Which executes the following  precodetell application "System Events"   keystroke "a"   keystroke "b"   keystroke "c"   keystroke " "   key code {18}   key code {19}   key code {20} end tell /code/pre  Hope this helps :)  <comment168440> Good catch on that question, it does sound related. I can get key code to send numbers but even the exact AppleScript you posted doesn't type the numbers. <comment168470> what sort of keyboard do you have. The only thing I can think of is something like a numbers lock (although I would be surprised if even if you did have it on it would affect the keystroke command) <comment168485> I'm on a MacBook Pro, no numlock. Also, I forgot to mention that for quite a while I had an AppleScript that was 'keystroke'ing numbers. <comment186610> what about if you send 'key code {83}' 'key code {84}' 'key code {85}' which are the num-pad keys, or 18 19 20, which are the numbers above the letters. <comment186611> I think that's what I had done after reading your answer and the links but honestly at this point I forget. It was a bit awkward but it worked. <comment186612> tbh, I quite enjoyed the research - & I now have a nice little app that will tell me the key codes ;-)
