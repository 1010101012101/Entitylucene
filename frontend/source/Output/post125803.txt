Macbook pro does not connect wifi <body> I have mac book pro late 2013 with os x 10.9.2. When i clicked on the wifi network i want to connect, it doesn't connect. It doesn't even give any response. There is only an animation in wifi: on option in upper right side with loading circle and becomes  wifi: looking for networks . And it goes back to normal repeatedly  I tried to fix it by looking into settings, i even re-installed os x but it still doesn't connect. The network i want to connect is fine, there are 2 more devices connected to that network and they work just fine. How can i fix this problem?  <answer125808> before we go on fixing lets find out it is working at all.  In Terminal type (to turn it on)  precodenetworksetup -setairportpower en0 on /code/pre  Next type (to scan)  precode/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/Versions/A/Resources/airport scan /code/pre  Finally type (to connect)  precodenetworksetup -setairportnetwork en0 WIFI_SSID_I_WANT_TO_JOIN WIFI_PASSWORD /code/pre  Also:  While holding the kbdalt/kbd key click on the wifi icon  In the pop up window select Open Wireless Diagnostics...follow the instructions.  <comment147248> It might be just your Airport Express user Interface. Lets find out if the network is working at all. <comment147253> Hello, It works perfectly.
