Sold MacBook; FileVault enabled <body> I sold my MacBook earlier and I want to reinstall Yosemite.  However, I have FileVault enabled and I want to essentially "throw away the key" and "reinstall Yosemite" so none of the data is recoverable.  Could someone please clarify what I should do? Many thanks.  <comment191653> What version of OS X do you have installed now? <comment207048> Have you already sold the MacBook - or are you in the process of preparing it to sell? Your question doesn't make much sense if you have already sold the macbook, i.e. you don't have it anymore.
