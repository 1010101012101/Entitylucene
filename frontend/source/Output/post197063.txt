Jailbreak: Need Top Option + Restore + Choose ipsw Anymore? <body> Before a device was to be jailbreaked, all the tutorials recommended connecting said device to iTunes and then clicking kbdoption/kbd + codeRestore &gt; Choose ipsw/code.  Recent tutorials don't include these steps any more. Rather they just mention restoring through iTunes and not over wifi.  Is the kbdoption/kbd + codeRestore &gt; Choose ipsw/code Necessary Still For Jailbreaking?  <answer197135> The basic restore through codeiTunes/code will download the latest software image and restore it. This is equivalent to downloading the latest ipsw and using the kbdOption/kbd + codeRestore/code method.   The kbdOption/kbd + coderestore/code method has typically been useful for situations where you need to restore to an older or modified ipsw file, which was more useful in the earlier days of jailbreaking.  <comment235654> It's not necessary if you're jailbreaking on the latest iOS version. However for older versions, apple has stopped signing them, which makes it harder to jailbreak on an older iOS version.
