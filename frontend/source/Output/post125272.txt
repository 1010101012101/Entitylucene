At every launch Mail.app welcomes me and downloads my messages <body> Every time I launch Mail.app it shows the (first launch) Welcome dialog and tells me that to use new feature sin Mail it has to download my messages. I have many many messages in there and I know that it is not redownloading them so what gives?  OSX current and fully patched.  I checked disk perms and found plenty of issues with iBook.app and some with java but nothing with mail - none the less it's about time for a RepairPerms so I'm running it and bounce Mail.app to see if that fixes it. Nope.  Console.app reports a slew of errors for Mail.app (only showing the ones since emafter/em I ran RepairPerms and bounced Mail.app twice).     3/24/14 2:40:50.226 PM com.apple.launchd.peruser.510[182]: (com.apple.mail.28720[992]) Exited: Terminated: 15   3/24/14 2:41:01.033 PM Mail[2590]: Upgrading Library from 4.167 to 4.167   3/24/14 2:41:01.043 PM Mail[2590]: Plugin compatibility check failed for GrowlMail.mailbundle.

You could:  ol licheck the 'console.app' for info-/error-entries and post them here for further analysis/li lirun 'disk utility.app' and check the permissions on your HD and post the Infos here for further analysis/li liQuit Apple Mail and move the Folder 'V3' in code~Library/Mail//code to another place, like the Desktop, and start Apple Mail again. Your Mailbox will be downloaded again and the V3 Folder will be recreated, but should be simply updated the next time you start Apple Mail again./li /ol  <comment146765> Thanks J.C. I added answers in the main Q <comment146920> You should really try #3 next. If you just move the V3 Folder somewhere and it still dosen't work, you can just move it back. <comment146942> I dont' have a V3 folder - I have a V2 folder. Insight? <comment146957> Typo on my part - my folder is called V2 too, so move that. <comment147327> That sort of worked. Now my pop-account email has zero emails in it b/c they were popped already so are no longer on the server. Also my local mailfolders that had stuff in them are gone too. OTOH mail does not Welcome me each time. <comment147351> ok, since you are using POP-Accounts you can copy back the contents of the folder beginning with 'pop-' into the newly created V2-Folder at '~/Library/Mail/'. You have to be careful and move the content of each 'POP'-Folder, so that you don't overwrite the new E-Mails you got by simply copying the POP-Folders. In any case a Backup is advised. After copying restart Mail and all the old Mails should be    restored. <comment147417> Other things are gone too - smart folders saved to my tool bar is greyed-out / non-non functional. <comment147418> My local folders are gone too <comment147425> Did you move the Items back? <comment147512> I moved the POP-Account-folder contents back - which one is the local folders and the smart searches? <comment147514> local folders are stored in '~/Library/Mail/V2/Mailboxes'. Smart Mailboxes are stored in "SmartMailboxes.plist", "SyncedSmartMailboxes.plist" and "SmartMailboxesLocalProperties.plist" in '~/Library/Mail/V2/MailData'
