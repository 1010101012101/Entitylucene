Getting the "quality" option for photos in iPhone photo stream when emailing it to myself? <body> I've got some jpg photos in my iPhone 4's Photostream.  When I select the photo in the Photostream to email it to myself, clicking the button codeSend/code (top-right) will show a popup where I get to choose the image quality:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DG79Z.png" alt="enter image description here"  However, some photos do not have such an option. It automatically emailed me the low-quality photos.  What is causing this problem?  How do I email myself the high-quality photo?  sup&bull; I see the quality option for some photos that are not in camera roll (but in photostream). So deleting it off from camera roll shouldn't be the reason. br&bull; It's not a date problem either, as some photos taken on 2015-12-31 have the quality option, yet others taken on the same day don't have it. br &nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly some photos taken on 2016-03-10 have the quality option, yet others taken on 2016-03-08 don't have it./sup
