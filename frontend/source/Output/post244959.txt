outlook: apply rule to past messages <body> I use outlook as client for an exchange server.  I created several rules that are local to the mac (as opposed to server side rules), and I want to apply them for past messages.  I can't find a way. - Even when I create the rule, I don't see any option to apply it to past messages.  It would be fine also to be able to move several selected messages to a folder, but when I create a filter it seems also difficult!!!  If I select all messages in the filter, upon right click on one of them, the selection goes away (because of the message preview I think)  If I select multiple messages in Inbox, right click is working and I could move all of them, but I must perform multiple selection manually...  Is it that difficult on Outlook 2011 overs 14.3 ?  <answer252551> I just figured this out because I was having such a hard time too! Its easier than you think. Go to your inbox, click on one of your emails then under the Edit menu click Select All. Then in the home group click on apply rule. Yay! (it will take a while if you have a ton of emails -I had over 11,000 so it took a couple mins).  <comment301928> Welcome to Ask Different.  Perhaps your specific version of outlook doesn't have that option? Or is might be as a simple as making the rule on your computer instead of on the server which only applies rules when messages arrive? https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Create-a-rule-in-Outlook-2016-for-Mac-c8fde328-de0d-4579-abc4-564cc8922f71 <comment301938> Outlook 2011 vs 14.3. If it's a version related issue, I'll update it...but I couldn't find any confirmation of that <comment301939> I'm creating the rule on local machine <comment302062> @bmike thanks to your remark I've checked and I found some other rules on the server, now Apply Rule work on local folder also for past emails. I was probably applying the wrong one, now it seems clear
