Why does Safari display the letter combination 'fi' as 'if'? <body> I just came across a curious display error and was wondering what may cause it.  In Safari the following webpage Cross-Country Skating: shows a strange behaviour.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/BLq1V.png" alt="enter image description here"     img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/W7RnI.png" alt="enter image description here"  But the source code does not show this error:  precode...

It has something to do with ligature I suppose.

It seems to be solely happening with Merriweather Sans.   Maybe someone at Apple or on the east coast decided to protest the name of the font? ;)  Seriously, an update is in the works, and someone here suggests a work-around.  https://github.com/google/fonts/issues/184  <comment272617> I thought so too. The error occurs throughout the article ligatures might be the combining factor. But do you have an idea what causes this ligature misrepresentation? <comment272619> Note that Firefox displays it like Safari does too.
