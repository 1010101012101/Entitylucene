How to make MacPorts reinstall requested ports from a different boot drive? <body> I recently changed workstations and went from OSx 10.7.5 to OSX 10.11! strongemYay!/em/strong   I have a lot of installation to do. strongemNuts..../strong (But worth it!)/em  I have temporarily mounted my old workstation's hard drive to copy over important files. Since I have a different OS, a different version of XCode (and command line tools), and a different version of MacPorts, I'd rather do a fresh install of all my requested ports rather than semi-blindly copy stuff over from the old drive.   MacPorts has a great Migration guide (link) that shows how to create a list of all installed ports, then reinstall them once software has been upgraded â€” but that's for upgrading on the same boot drive. My new drive has no installed ports because I just installed MacPorts.   strongIs there a way to list requested ports on the old hard drive in order to upgrade them on my new drive?/strong   <answer285097> Actually, I think you want the results of codeport -qv installed/code to restore your installation but I'll show you how to produce both files.  Mount the old hard drive and copy this file into a folder in your home folder- code/opt/local/var/macports/registry/registry.db/code. Now navigate to that folder.  To produce the coderequested.txt/code file:  precodesqlite3 registry.db 'select name, requested from ports' | awk -F '|' '{ if ( $2 == 1 ) print $1 }' &gt;requested.txt /code/pre  To produce the codemyports.txt/code file:  precodesqlite3 registry.db \ 'select name,  version, revision, state, os_platform, os_major, archs, date from ports' | sort | awk -F'|' '{ if ( $4 == "installed") {act="(active)"} else {act=""} }  { cmd = "date -r" $8 " +%Y-%m-%dT%T%z"; cmd | getline mydate; close(cmd) } { printf ("%s @%s_%s %s platform='%s %s' archs='%s' date='%s'\n",     $1, $2, $3, act,$5, $6, $7, mydate) }' &gt;myports.txt /code/pre  <comment356410> Perhaps the old workstation's MacPorts left a file on the old hard drive that tells what ports were installed and/or requested? <comment356475> As explained in the migration guide, the installed ports list should be made from the starting version of MacOS X and MacPorts. <comment356478> @danielAzuelos: Is there a way to run that version of MacPorts, then, from a different boot drive? (I don't even know where that executable would be.) <comment359186> Does your old installation have this file - `/opt/local/var/macports/registry/registry.db`? You could build a requested list from this `sqlite3` database?
