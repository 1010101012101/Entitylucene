Is there any way I can set up a Brother HL2030 to print on MacOS Sierra? <body> The brother supported Apple printers site shows the HL2030 model as unsupported on MacOS Sierra. I have tried Gutenprint which says it supports the HL2030, but it doesn't work, I think due to this bug. Is there anything else I can do?  <answer281649> In the end I found that the official driver from the Brother site for the next model up - the HL2130 - worked fine. I don't know why they say they don't support the HL2030, but it seems to print OK so far.
