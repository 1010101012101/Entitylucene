Need to automate an SMB path into a UNC path before sending to Win10 clients <body> New here, but I'm having difficulty putting together an AppleScript that will basically take an SMB link and turn it into a UNC link before I send it over to a couple of Win10 clients.   All same network, we're all using a SNS NAS and it's for Adobe Premiere links. We can do this all manually, but the editors don't have time/patience to convert each link. We're looking for an automated script that we could integrate as a service that will convert selected text.  I found the article below, but it's the reverse to what we're looking for. I tried reversing all of the functions in it but wasn't able to get it to run properly.  https://gist.github.com/anonymous/2211017  It'd also be awesome if the 'service' that is created simple copies the entry into the clipboard so that the end-user can paste it into a couple of different things like email and Slack messenger.  Hopefully someone can help or steer me in the right direction. I've been scouring Google for this for about a week.  EDIT** Examples below  Old path 'smb://server/folder'  New path '\\server\folder'  <answer281204> NOTE: This answer is intended only as an example when the SMB Path, aside from the colon, slashes and backslashes and without spaces, only contains alphanumeric characters in the name! If you need to account for anything else, i.e. read the comments to this answer, you'll need to modify the code according to your needs. That said, in all of my years as a Network Systems Administrator and Network Systems Engineer I never created shares containing spaces or other then the need for colons, slashes, backslashes and alphanumeric characters and therefore this simple example is all that I'd need to translate any, e.g. codesmb://server/folder/code to code\\server\folder/code, SMB Path I ever used to a UNC Path. YMMV!  hr  In strongAutomator/strong, create a new strongService/strong emworkflow/em, then add a strongRun AppleScript/strong emaction/em to it while replacing the default strongAppleScript/strong emcode/em with the emcode/em below:  precodeon searchReplace(theText, SearchString, ReplaceString)     set OldDelims to AppleScript's text item delimiters     set AppleScript's text item delimiters to SearchString     set newText to text items of theText     set AppleScript's text item delimiters to ReplaceString     set newText to newText as text     set AppleScript's text item delimiters to OldDelims     return newText end searchReplace  on run {input, parameters}     set selectedText to item 1 of input as string     set convertedText to searchReplace(selectedText, "smb://", "\\\\")     set convertedText to searchReplace(convertedText, "/", "\\")     set the clipboard to convertedText as string     return convertedText end run /code/pre  Then save the strongService/strong as: strongConvert SMB Path to UNC Path/strong  Now strongConvert SMB Path to UNC Path/strong will appear on the strongServices/strong emmenu/em or strongServices/strong emcontext menu/em when emtext/em is emselected/em and when the strongService/strong is used, the strongUNC Path/strong is placed on the strongClipboard/strong. (This of course assumes the emselected text/em was actually an strongSMB Path/strong, otherwise what's placed there is just whatever emtext/em was emselected/em when the strongService/strong was run which will include any substitutions made.)  Example strongSMB Path/strong codesmb://server/folder/code will be converted to strongUNC Path/strong code\\server\folder/code and placed on the strongClipboard/strong.  strongNote:/strong Note the settings of the strongService/strong in the image below. The strongOutput replaces selected text/strong emcheckbox/em is unchecked. You may check it, if that's what you want, however, if the emselected text/em is not actually replaceable then the strongService/strong will not appear on the strongServices/strong emmenu/em or strongServices/strong emcontext menu/em.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/aMdLS.png" alt="Convert SMB Path to UNC Path Automator Service"  <comment353819> What happens when the SMB path contains spaces or `\ `  escaped spaces? <comment353826> @klanomath, Hadn't though about that! I guess the first substitution could be `set convertedText to searchReplace(selectedText, "\\", "")` which will remove any backslashes and thus I assume handle an escaped space. Can UNC Paths have spaces? If yes, should a UNC Path having space be quoted? <comment353827> AFAIK UNC paths containing spaces should be quoted **in Windows**. Escaping them or a %20 probably won't work <comment353831> @klanomath, So then, I should add the suggested code of my first comment and then have the `convertedText`, which will be the UNC Path placed on the Clipboard and have it quoted whether of not it has spaces would still be okay quoted? I'm not able to test at the moment and why I'm asking for your input. Thanks. <comment353832> Hmm it's OK but ugly. I also recommend to post a warning when the POSIX path contains `|?*"`. <comment353929> I deleted my original answer after some comments by klanomath because at the time it was late and needed to sleep. I've added a caveat, the note at the top of my answer, and undeleted it. Hopefully as an example it covers your needs however if you need more than that, then undated your question accordingly and if you need additional help with the coding I'll see what I can do for you. <comment354129> You guys rock, we're going to play around with this today and tomorrow! Thanks!!
