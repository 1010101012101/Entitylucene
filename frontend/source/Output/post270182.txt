macOS Sierra / Copy Disc via Disc Utility not working <body> I'm trying to copy a DVD as an image via the Disc Utility - yesterday it worked (same DVD), but now I get the error message on all discs:     Could not finished (com.apple.diskutility-Error 3)      Stopped with Error 13 (translated).   Does anyone have the same issue? IÂ´m really suprised that it worked yesterday, but not today. I already did a couple of restarts without any luck.
