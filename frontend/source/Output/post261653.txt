Is there an easier way to change color profiles than through System Preferences? <body> I'm looking for an easier way to switch between color profiles, to check colors when working with either print, digital or web.  Currently I have go to System Pref  Displays  Color and I'd like an easier way to check and change it.  A menu bar app would be great, but I'm open to other solutions as well.  Note: I am aware of the app ProfileMenu, but the developer has taken down his site so I can't test if it would work on El Capitan.  <comment327634> i'm really struggling to see how the 'wrong' profile for your monitor is going to help you get your graphics right. It's going to be neither your monitor or any other that you will be viewing as, but some kind of weird hybrid. I can understand doing it for proofing in Photoshop etc where it is compensating for the internal vs view profile, but not just swapping blindly to a profile from another device.
