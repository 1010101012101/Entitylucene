Do YouTube videos buffer for offline playback on Google's iOS app? <body> I want to preload a 58 minute youtube video on my free home wireless and listen to it later while i'm jogging (so that i can listen without streaming on my limited data plan). Can this be done?  Will the youtube app let you prebuffer an entire video and let you watch it offline?  <answer76123> Yes, assuming you don't quit the YouTube app after it loads. You can also do this with the YouTube website; play a video, it starts loading the video with a QuickTime-like player, and you will see it buffer. If you start playing the video in the Safari and exit Safari (while it's still in the background), you can double-tap the home button to bring up the audio controller and hit Play.
