Contacts.app - list all groups a contact is in <body> Is there a possibility to list all the groups, a contact is in, on the card. This would make the organisation of my contacts much easier  <answer235040> Welcome to AskDifferent!  Unfortunately, the answer to your question is no.  The default Contacts app does not allow you to do this.  I believe there's some third-party apps that will do this but you'll have to search the App Store to find one.  <answer254674> My solution doesn't list the groups emon the contact card/em itself, but it may still solve your situation:  By holding down the "Option" key when you have a contact selected and the "Groups" pane showing, the groups which contain the selected contact are highlighted.

You might also be interested in [my related question](http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/254601/151730) as to how this highlighting can be turned on permanently.  I know it's possible because I've done it accidentally, but I don't know how.  (Hopefully I'll get an answer.)
