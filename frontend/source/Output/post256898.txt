SSL error with mbsync <body> I installed isync[1] on my personal Macbook, which runs OSX 10.11. I used the exact same code.mbsyncrc/code file I wrote for my Macbook at work.  The setup works fine on my work machine. However when using the mbsync command on the personal machine, I get the following output:     SSL error connecting imap.gmail.com (74.125.133.109:993):   error:00000014:lib(0):func(0):SSL lib   The work macbook runs a fresh install of OSX 10.11 and Homebrew. The personal one also runs OSX 10.11 and Homebrew, but has known several upgrades since 2013 (it was mountain lion at the time).  Are you aware of any difference between fresh installs and upgrades, that could lead to this kind of error?  strongLinks/strong  ol lihttp://isync.sourceforge.net//li /ol  <answer264064> This is a certificate issue. In my code.mbsyncrc/code, I included as codeCertificateFile/code the entire certificate chain (Gmail - Google, Google - GeoTrust, GeoTrust - Equifax). This started intermittently throwing the error you're describing around the time I fixed the curl SSL issue.  To fix it, stronguse only the Gmail certificate in your code.mbsyncrc/code./strong If you're unsure which of the certificates is the Gmail one, run:   precodeopenssl s_client -connect imap.gmail.com:993 -showcerts 2&gt;&amp;1 &lt; /dev/null | sed -ne '/-BEGIN CERTIFICATE-/,/-END CERTIFICATE-/p' | head -n 27 &gt; gmail.crt /code/pre  and use the resulting codegmail.crt/code file.
