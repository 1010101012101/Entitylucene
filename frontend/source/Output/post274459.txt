Callers say they can hardly hear me when talking on my iPhone 7 <body> When I am on the phone with a caller, they say they can hardly hear me. My volume is high and I don't know what I'm doing wrong.  <answer274473> I assume you're not having problems with recording videos etc, and this is only happening during a normal phone call (that is, not on speakerphone).  If so, one test you can do is to open the Voice Memos app and record yourself speaking into it. I would record maybe 10 seconds of yourself speaking and then play it back. You should be able to hear yourself clearly.   If not, this could indicate a hardware problem, but before jumping to that conclusion there are other things to try:  ul lirestart your iPhone/li liRemove any case and/or screen protector you're using/li liUnplug any accessories you have connected to the headphone jack /li liRemove any dirt/dust that could be blocking the microphone /li /ul  If none of these help, I would contact Apple.  <comment345108> Is it in a case? Try taking it out.
