Way for new Mac touch bar to behave the same as the Old keyboard <body> The new touch bar is not very good for people good at keyboard shortcuts and development.  I used to be able to press kbdShift/kbd kbdF8/kbd to get iTunes to play without giving it focus.  How can I get the kbdF10/kbd,kbdF11/kbd etc. keys to always display on Chrome without pressing kbdFn/kbd, on touch bar Mac?  This makes debugging annoying.
