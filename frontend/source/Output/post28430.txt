Using SSH on an iMac running Lion <body> I am trying to get SSH/SFTP working on my iMac running Lion so that one of my friends can connect to me remotely. I have managed to get it working using my local user account, but I need to understand how I can add an additional account that my friend could use to SSH into my machine. This is probably really simple, but if someone could point me in the right direction in would be appreciated.  <answer28432> Easiest way in this case is to just  ul licreate another user using the Preferences panel/li lilog into this user locally/li ligenerate the appropriate SSH key pair/li litransfer the public key to your friend over a secure channel/li /ul  In addition you may want to tighten up your system a bit by preventing SSH logins without keys. Open code/etc/sshd_config/code in any text editor and set  precodePasswordAuthentication no PermitEmptyPasswords no /code/pre  Afterwards restart SSH by disabling and enabling remote login in Preferences.  <comment32681> Can't you create a guest account with SSH enabled on it? Or create a new user account and allow SSH/FTP on it. If your friend is outside the local network, you'll also need to enable port forwarding. <comment32868> Superb - thanks very much for your help. That worked. :)
