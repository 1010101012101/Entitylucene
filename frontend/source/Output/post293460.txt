Lost iPad Air 2 <body> I lost my iPad Air 2 wifi and couldn’t get access to my iCloud account because I forgot my password. Therefore I put my account on recovery mode and after awhile I regained access to my account.  About a month after I lost the iPad I trace it via find my iPad but the battery was at 2 percent. I set the device on lost and locked it with a passcode. Went to the last known location but couldn’t get it. Now  the device is offline. My question is: can the device connect to an open wifi while in lost mode?  Can the thief have access to the device or use it?  Do I have any chance to get it back?
