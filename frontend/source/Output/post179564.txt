My iPhone won't delete all of my emails on my phone <body> I have tried using the instructions by selecting one and holding down move then unselect the one and send to trash. I then go onto trash, edit and delete all.  But then when I go back to my all mail box the emails are still there and they haven't been deleted.  What do I do?   <comment212899> wait longer before checking - it's the only thing I've found that works <comment213095> It depends on the type of email account in use.   In most cases your email is stored on the server with a synched copy on the phone.  As @Tetsujin mentions wait longer to allow the instructions you gave the phone to be synched with the server, which may not be as instant as you think it should be.
