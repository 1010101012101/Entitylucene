Mac Mini Works With Keyboard Only for Brief Amount of Time <body> Just got a NEW mac mini (MGEM2LL/A) with a Insignia wired keyboard mouse. I've noticed the keyboard works for the most part until the Mac went to sleep or it stopped working after 5-10 minutes. What's really odd is if the Mac is sleeping, I can wake it up with the keyboard, but I can't type my password or anything.  At first I thought it was a bug with the OS, and let the machine do it's thing and install software patches. After the patches to the most recent OS ver I'm still running into these issues. I'm not sure if this is a Mac issue since I have noticed some Apple brand keyboards doing the same or if I simply bought a faulty keyboard. (Would be surprised since I usually never had any issues with Insignia brand.)  I'll try swapping the Insignia with my Logitech since I know that works for sure on Windows/Linux, and post back here if the issue continues. Just wondering if anyone else has ran into this.
