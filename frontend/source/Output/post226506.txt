Enabled DARK menu bar and Dock hides icons <body> If I enable Dark Dock mode some icons become invisible:  Normal Mode -   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/al6zg.png" alt="enter image description here"  Dark Mode -   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/m1Ajd.png" alt="enter image description here"  The icon is still there (there is slight shadow of it on the picture) and I still can click it etc.  If the issue relates to Icon itself - is there a way to extract it from the package - edit/replace with non problematic?  Any suggestions will be highly appreciated...  <answer226512> To see an OS X app's resources, you should:  ol liLocate the app in your Applications folder/li liRight click on its icon and click "Show Package Contents"/li liClick Contents  Resources/li /ol  As seen below, you should find your app's resources and the menu bar icon for it. You can replace it with whichever icon you like.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/km6Oe.png" alt="enter image description here"
