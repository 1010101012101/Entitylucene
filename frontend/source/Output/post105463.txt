Assign Application Windows to Different Spaces/Desktops <body> I have two Spaces configured and I keep some Safari windows in one space and some in another. However, Mission Control only allows you to assign an application to a Space, but not different windows within an Application.  As a workaround I created an AppleScript shortcut that executes a new Safari instance:     open -n /Applications/Safari.app   This successfully creates multiple Safari instances, but the instances are still somehow intertwined in Mission Control. When I select an instance from the Dock and choose Options  Assign To  This Desktop or None, that setting in the other instance is updated to be the same.  Is there any way to launch multiple instances of an Application that are each assignable to different Spaces? (Running Mountain Lion 10.8.5.)  <answer105474> You might make a copy of Safari's application bundle and change the bundle identifier:  precodecp -R /Applications/Safari.app /Applications/Safari2.app defaults write /Applications/Safari2.app/Contents/Info.plist CFBundleIdentifier my.safari2 cp ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.Safari.plist ~/Library/Preferences/my.safari2.plist /code/pre  Assignments to spaces are per bundle identifier:  precode$ defaults read ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.spaces.plist app-bindings {     "my.safari2" = "FC886111-EE78-4844-A5E5-A11BECA713CF"; } /code/pre  In this case, you might also use Webkit.app or create a site-specific browser with Fluid.  <comment124009> Great OSX-ninja solution, Lauri!
