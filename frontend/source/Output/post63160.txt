Is there an iPhone app that acts as a radio signal strength sensor? <body> I would like to find an iPhone app that is able to show the GSM or WiFi signal strength. Does it exist?  <answer63165> Apple does not provide any public APIs for interacting with any of the device radios, and would not approve any app that did so with a private API.   <comment72937> I don't think that Apple provides any public APIs for interacting with any of the device radios, and would not approve any app that did so with a private API. <comment72939> @Jason That is correct - you should post it as an answer. <comment285161> Does this still apply? I'm looking for a tool that can monitor/report/assess Bluetooth/WiFi connection status (connected status, strength and possibly any other useful information).
