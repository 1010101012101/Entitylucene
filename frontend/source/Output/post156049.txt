Why won't my Safari open? <body> When I try to open safari it says:      The procedure entry point sqlite3_wal_checkpoint could not be located in the dynamic link library SQLite3dll.   then it says:     Your copy of safari is missing important software resources. Please re-install safari.   <answer156071> You appear to be having the same issue discussed in this Stack Exchange answer from a few years ago.  Re-download Safari using the link in this support article, and try re-installing it. Note that Apple appears to be winding down Safari for Windows.
