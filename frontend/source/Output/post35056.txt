How can I change subtitle color, background or font used by iTunes? <body> In iTunes subtitles background is black and font Courier New (and rather big). How can I change this preferences?  <answer35057> A quick googling of iTunes skin's yields quite a few results on changing the look and feel of iTunes. I don't know personally how to change individual aspects of iTunes though.  <comment40024> Thank you for response but i am searching for only subtitle preferences.
