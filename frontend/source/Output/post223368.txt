El Capitan Fat32 partition problem <body> I have a strange problem in El Capitan.  I have a second internal drive which is divided into two partitions: one Fat32 and one HFS+ Journaled.  I do not see this drive in console when I type codediskutil list //code, but I can see the HFS+ partition in the system and I can use it. I do not see Fat32 partition.  May it be a permission problem? If yes, how can it be fixed right now? Disk Utility is not supporting this option anymore. I do not have Windows installed.  <answer223370> If you enter codediskutil list //code in Terminal only partitions of the boot device are visible.  The proper command to enter is just codediskutil list/code.  With the disk identifier diskX found above try to verify the disk and the volume:  precodediskutil verifyDisk /dev/diskX diskutil verifyVolume /dev/diskXsY /code/pre  If verification was successful try to make a mountpoint:  precodesudo mkdir /Volumes/EXT_HD_FAT32 /code/pre  and try to mount the partition there:  precodesudo mount -t msdos /dev/diskXsY /Volumes/EXT_HD_FAT32/ /code/pre  <comment270812> FAT32 disks do not support permissions and Disk Utility never offered Verify Disk Permissions on them anyway. <comment270825> Could you edit the question to show what `diskutil list` shows for the disk in question? if it's the boot disk, use `diskutil list disk0` - but since it's the second you might need 1 or 2 added to show us the overall idea of what's happening / won't show you anything helpful as your question initially reads...
