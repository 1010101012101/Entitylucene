How do I see the location path of an application? <body> I need to check the path to a program -- I want to point to the binary, not to the ".app" which is a directory. How do I do this?  <answer139950> Navigate to your codeApplications/code folder, right click on any app, choose strongShow Package Contents/strong and navigate to codeContents/MacOS//code. Most of the times, the binary is named after the app so, if using the path on a script, you'll be mostly safe by using code/Applications/(appname).app/Contents/MacOS/(appname)/code, where code(appname)/code is, well, the name of the app. If the app name has a whitespace in it, eg. strongSublime Text/strong, don't forget to put the path between double quotes (or escape it), in your script.  <answer140292> As @megadroid posted, Applications have executable in codeContents/MacOS/code directory. However executable name not necessarily is the same as app name. To get exact executable name, You can read it from strongInfo.plist/strong file (under codeCFBundleExecutable/code key) or do it from strongTerminal.app/strong with for example:  precodeAPP_PATH="/Applications/Mail.app" echo "$APP_PATH"/Contents/MacOS/$(defaults read "$APP_PATH/Contents/Info.plist" CFBundleExecutable) /code/pre  Just change codeAPP_PATH/code variable. Result: code/Applications/Mail.app/Contents/MacOS/Mail/code  <comment164761> Almost every .app foder on OSX has it's binary inside Contents/MacOS folder. For example: `/Applications/Mail.app/Contents/MacOS/Mail`. To see the .app in Finder simply âŒ˜+Click it's icon in the Dock. <comment164763> Most of the times the binary is named after the app but to double check, just right click on the app, choose **Show Package Contents** and navigate to the path mentioned by Mateusz. <comment164781> What are you exactly trying to do? <comment164820> @MateuszSzlosek - put it as Answer :) completely correct <comment164821> @megadroid same for you ;) <comment164927> Applications don't have to be in /Applications, they can be anywhere <comment164941> True but `/Applications` always has applications in it, even if just OS X stock applications. I just provided `Applications` as a base folder example so I could construct the full path to the binary.
