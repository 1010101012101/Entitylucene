Can a keyboard shortcut force TextEdit windows to close and discard all changes? <body> Is there any way I could configure TextEdit to close the window (through keyboard shortcut) without asking me if I want to save an unsaved file?  Can be another script/program configure globally when triggered with a certain shortcut or just a script for TextEdit.   The reason for doing it is that I have a lot of temporary notes in TextEdit's window and I want to close them as fast as possible.   <answer62997> codetell application "TextEdit" to close (windows where name of its document is "Untitled") saving no/code would close all untitled documents without saving them.  You could close the current window with codetell application (path to frontmost application as text) to close window 1 saving no/code. It would close all tabs in some applications that use tabs though.  It's easier to just press ⌘W⌫ in my opinion. You can disable the animation for showing the sheets with codedefaults write -g NSWindowResizeTime -float 0.001/code.  <answer95863> If you hit cmd+option+q to quit the app (or hold down Option while quitting from the main menu), it will give you the option to discard changes in emall/em unsaved windows at once, rather than having to tell it to discard changes in each window individually.  This will work with all Apple apps, not just TextEdit.  <comment72698> If you have *a lot* of temporary files, you can try to force quit the application. It will save your open files, but won't ask you to save them.
