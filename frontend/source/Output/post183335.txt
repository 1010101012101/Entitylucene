What the “Other” Storage Space is in Mac OS X? <body> What exactly is included in the strongOther/strong (emblue one/em) part of the Storage space on my Mac? What could take 31.2 GB?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hvuRR.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer183337> Essentially it’s anything that OS X does not allocate to the listed specified storage types of applications, backups, audio, movies, backups, and photos. That means a very broad list of items will be considered as Other, including things like the following:  ul liDocuments and file types, including PDF, doc, PSD, etc/li liArchives and disk images, including zips, dmg, iso, etc/li liVarious types of personal and user data/li liAnything in the system folders of OS X, ranging from temporary files, swap, voices, etc/li liUser library items like Application Support, iCloud files, screen savers, etc/li liUser caches and system caches, including things like browser caches and locally stored message media files/li liFonts, app accessories, application plugins, and app extensions/li liVarious file and file types not recognized by Spotlight, for example a virtual machine hard drive, Windows Boot Camp partitions, etc/li /ul  As you can see, this is not unnecessary junk or clutter. Basically, anything that is not one of the media types that the Storage tab specifies will be shown as “Other”.
