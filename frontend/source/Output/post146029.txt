Gif player in iPad <body> So I import gifs files from my PC to my iPad but it just frozen like a pic not moving, so what app can I use to play gifs in iPad I've tried some but they can't detect gifs from my iPad, the album shows 0 gifs meanwhile I have abt 200 gifs I've imported.  <answer146031> If your iPad is jailbroken, you can install strongGIFViewer/strong which will let you play GIFs in the iOS Photos app.  <comment172061> Oh But iTunes or iTools don't show it's jailbroken and I don't have any cyldia something I forgot the name of the application that show it's jailbroken, and when I try to delete apps they're all moving/shaking, would you pls tell me how to know it's already jailbroken? <comment172062> @user If you don't know your device is jailbroken, it probably isn't. For the record, I believe the app you are referring to is *Cydia*. <comment172063> Yes cydia, I don't have that kind of stuffs, so is there any other than gifviewer? The free one?
