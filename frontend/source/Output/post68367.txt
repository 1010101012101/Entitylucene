DNS Changer on my iPad <body> I've jailbroken my iPad. First time I checked with dns-changer.eu it stated mine was manipulated, then I checked again it stated that mine is clean. Getting confused &amp; curious, I checked again several times. Most of those stated mine is clean, but once manipulated again then clean while I rechecked around 1 minute later.  I've 2 laptops at home, 1 is fine &amp; 1 is affected while the site stated that both of those are clean. The affected laptop gets limited access through wi fi. Connection is pretty normal using LAN but yahoo.com is still firewalled. I've scanned the affected use HitmanPro btw.  Please help, is there anything I can do or I just reset my ipad? Thanks a lot..  <answer68371> The easiest way for you to confirm whether or not you are infected if you're getting inconsistent results from tools is to manually check your DNS settings against the rogue servers.  These are the servers that were used in the attack:  85.255.112.0 through 85.255.127.255br 67.210.0.0 through 67.210.15.255br 93.188.160.0 through 93.188.167.255br 77.67.83.0 through 77.67.83.255br 213.109.64.0 through 213.109.79.255br 64.28.176.0 through 64.28.191.255    To check your DNS settings on osx, follow these instructions to open your network settings, choose a connection, and then check the DNS tab.

Whether you got infected by a DNS changing virus or why you can't access yahoo.com? <comment80339> @Mint Please let me know if there's anything you'd like me to explain further.
