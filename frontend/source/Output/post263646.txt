Why is 'Open with:' disabled on the Get Info sheet in Finder? <body> Since upgrading to Sierra, changing default app for opening specific file types is disabled.  Can anyone explain how to fix this?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vpqEX.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment330306> Could you give a few examples of the file types affected? (I had a quick look and couldn't replicate this on my (Sierra) Mac, but I only tested fairly standard file types). <comment330320> Is there a little locked padlock symbol at the bottom of the "Sharing & Permissions" part of the sheet? If it is locked, try unlocking it. Are you able to change the "Open with:" option then? <comment330335> Hi, To [John N](http://apple.stackexchange.com/users/212526/john-n): those are *.webloc which open various GoogleDrive files. To [Alistair McMillan](http://apple.stackexchange.com/users/4007/alistair-mcmillan): That is the weirdest thing -- I do not see that at all, and I know about it and was thinking that would be the problem. Maybe this is because the files are on the cloud?
