With Latest MacBook Pro and Radeon 460 Graphics, How To Tell How Much Memory in Use? <body> I've got the latest MacBook Pro with the touch bar.  4GB Graphics memory and I'm trying to figure out how much graphics memory is in use when I run certain apps.  I also run Parallels which dedicates part of that memory to itself so I want to make sure I don't starve it for my normal mac use.  I can see in Activity monitor that what I'm running requires High Perf GPU but I can't tell how much memory is being used.  Where can I see that memory usage?  <answer278776> I would recommend using iStat Menus.  Here's a direct quote from their website:     CPU &amp; GPU      Realtime CPU graphs and a list of the top 5 CPU resource hogs. CPU   usage can be tracked by individual cores or with all cores combined,   to save menubar space.      Plus, GPU memory and processor usage on supported Macs, and the active   GPU can be shown in the menubar.   In addition to the above, iStat Menus monitors a whole range of things that you may find useful.   You can download it for a 14 day trial to test it out prior to purchase.  strongNOTE:/strong I have no affiliation whatsoever with iStat Menus.  <comment350980> I use iStat Menus and it is a fantastic program.
