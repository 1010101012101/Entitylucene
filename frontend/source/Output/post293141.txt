iPad Kiosk Mode <body> Is there any way that we can set up an iPad to run as a Kiosk for a web application and not be able to access the browser toolbar? I understand Guided Access will help lock down the app but it was more the browser toolbar access i was looking at locking down.  The browser that we are using is Chrome.  Thank you in advance for all your help!  <answer293157> According to the documentation and user reviews, iCab Mobile has a kiosk mode. I used iCab for many years on several card-catalog macOS kiosks in our Library. Worked like a charm.  Disclaimer: I'm a past extremely satisfied user of iCab and have no financial ties to iCab.
