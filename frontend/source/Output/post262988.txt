iPad Air won't play videos anymore <body> I have tried a soft reset and a hard reset (erasing all data and starting as if freshly out of box) but I still cannot play videos. I have tried playing a video from sources including YouTube, Netflix, Crackle and Amazon Prime. This happened before I upgraded to newest iOS version, and even the upgrade to 10.1.1 didn't fix it. What can I do to get my iPad to play videos again?  <comment329473> Is your iPad jailbroken?
