With one village on two devices, can I start over with one device? <body> I connected my clash of clans village on both my iPod and iPhone.  Is there anyway I can unlink my iPod and start from the beginning there?  <answer128781> Doesn't Cash of Clans use Game Center for its integration?  So if you sign in on one device with a new Game Center ID, it should start with a new village.
