Large copied folders. Byte sizes same, but file counts different <body> I have a few very large folders copied that have the exact same byte size as their originals, but different file counts (off by 1-10 items) than what they should have.  No errors were reported during the copying process. I'm guessing and hoping that these are merely some .DS_Store files that didn't copy over?  NOTE: These folders did require admin approval, which, to my knowledge proceeded without fail.  On small project folders using Git repos, a diff would not be difficult. Worst case scenario, I can download, install, and run a third party diff tool, but don't want to if I don't have to.  ol listrongCan anyone say to some degree of certainty that these nominal file count differences are just negligible hidden OS files?/strong/li listrongWhat are some common reasons these byte counts would be identical, but file counts be off? Is this an indexing issue?/strong/li /ol  h2UPDATE:/h2  I ran a third party diff tool (Kaleidoscope) which found no differences between the original folders and the destination folders. Still a mystery as to why the file counts would still be different.  <comment102449> Try an rsync -n which does not do anything to the target - and give us a link to Kaleidoscope so we can see what it does, <comment102450> Also note .DS_Stores do take up space - one I looked at was 25k <comment102452> Did you enable to view hidden files? http://tourkick.com/2012/mac-os-x-force-finder-to-show-hidden-files/ This may help you find hidden files. <comment102620> In order of their respective comments: 1. I always leave hidden files viewable. 2. www.kaleidoscopeapp.com 3. Thanks. I knew they take up disk space, but wasn't sure if/how the OS counted it in the folder info panels.
