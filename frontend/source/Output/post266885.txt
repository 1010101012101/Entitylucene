When I tap on edit and try to tap on the items to delete them, nothing happens. I have tried rebooting my iPad but the problem remains.  <comment334746> I think what you meant is that you have some songs haven't still downloaded to your iPad. Right? I need some answer for clarification. Are those grayed out? They aren't playing right? And how did you get them to your ipad ( Using Apple music library or did you add them manually through iTunes? ) Do you have iCloud music library turned on?
