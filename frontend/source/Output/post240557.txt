Forcing `open` command to open unsigned app? <body> I've got my Security preferences set to allow apps downloaded from "Mac App Store and identified developers."  When I try to open an unsigned app:  precodeopen xyz.app /code/pre  I see the following:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dmlYS.png" alt="App can&#39;t be opened"  Usually, I right-click on the app and click "Open".  This brings up a similar dialogue, but this one includes an "open anyway"-type button:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/W40tW.png" alt="App can&#39;t be opened, with open button"  Is there a way to do this only using the codeopen/code command -- something like:  precodeopen --even-if-unsigned xyz.app /code/pre  <answer240560> ol liCreate and add a Gatekeeper label to the app. (‘Approved’ is an arbitrary string.)  precodespctl --add --label "Approved" /path/to/xyz.app /code/pre/li liApprove all apps with the label.  precodespctl --enable --label "Approved" /code/pre  This only needs to be done once and adding the same named label to apps in the future automatically enables their access./li liOpen the app as usual.  precodeopen xyz.app /code/pre/li /ol  For more information about spctl (SecAssessment system policy security), see the man page.  <answer240610> You could strip the quarantine from the app:  precodexattr -r -d com.apple.quarantine /path/to/xyz.app /code/pre  You may want/need to use codesudo/code for that command, depending on permissions.  Then Gatekeeper isn't involved, at all. Of course, that also means that the signature isn't verified, which removes an important safety feature.  <comment295732> Ah, a new addition to the list of things that I formerly only knew how to do GUI-ly, and now can do on the command line!  Thanks! <comment296969> I love this answer, too.  It's a pity I can only pick one!
