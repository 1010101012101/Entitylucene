Opening a file with command-line bin through Finder <body> I wish to use codemp3blaster/code (installed through codeMacPorts/code) via Finder. I want to double-click an mp3 file and get it opened in codemp3blaster/code. But I haven't been able to do so. I created an app and, in another try, a service in Automator, using the following script:  precode/opt/local/bin/mp3blaster $1 /code/pre  Any ideas?  <answer72067> You should be able to get info on your .mp3 file and change the associated app.  Go to codecmd-i/code of your app, click the drop-down of "Open with:" .. Select codeother/code and navigate to your directory. You will have to select codeEnable : All Applications/code to be able to click on the mp3blaster app.  <answer72116> Use $@ to refer to a file being passed to a shell script in Automator:  precode/opt/local/bin/mp3blaster $@ /code/pre  or   precode/opt/local/bin/mp3blaster "$@" /code/pre  <answer72123> Start Automator, create a workflow with a emRun AppleScript/em action and save it as an application.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gEwHp.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Then select any mp3 file, type kbdCmd-I/kbd and change the default application to the application saved before.  <answer72299> Finally managed how to do it using codeAppleScript/code instead of codebash/code. (I followed this example: Firing up Terminal from an Automator Workflow?)  precodeon run {input, parameters}     tell application "Terminal"         activate         if (the (count of the window) = 0) or ¬             (the busy of window 1 = true) then             tell application "System Events"                 keystroke "n" using command down             end tell         end if         do script "/opt/local/bin/mp3blaster \"" &amp; (POSIX path of ¬             (input as string)) &amp; "\"" in window 1     end tell     return input end run /code/pre  <comment83671> The problem is that `mp3blaster` is not an app but a bin. So I cannot do what you suggest. <comment83673> I think you might have to create an apple script and then have the files associated to the apple script. <comment83720> Thanks. I tried to, unsuccessfully. Could you please tip me on that? <comment83725> I get the error, "The action “Run Shell Script” encountered an error." <comment83759> Thanks, @patrix. But it doesn't work. Same error message. (Of course, if I run `/opt/local/bin/mp3blaster` from a bash shell it works.) <comment83775> What happens if you run it inside Automator and look at "Results" afterwards? <comment83785> See here: http://i49.tinypic.com/2rxgmf6.jpg <comment83825> Ah, of course, you can't run interactive commands with a "Run Shell Script" action. <comment83957> However, this only works for single files taken as input. How could I alter the script to parse multiple files?
