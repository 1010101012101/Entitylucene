Is there a way in Numbers to flip columns with rows? <body> Is there a way in Numbers to flip columns with rows ?  I have several tables in my sheet and I need to swap columns with rows for each table.  e.g.  precodeA1  A2  A3 B1  B2  B3 C1  C2  C3 /code/pre  should become:  precodeA1  B1  C1 A2  B2  C2 A3  B3  C3 /code/pre  thanks  <answer15501> You have a one-year old question in Super User about this.br It links to an Apple forum page where you will be told to how to use INDEX and TRANSPOSE functions to achieve what you're looking for.br The Past Special of Excel is way easier but this function is not widely used so apparently dropped from Numbers.  <answer212428> With the table selected, simply choose Table  Transpose Rows and Columns.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/JT8g3.png" width="288"/  <comment228000> This is called 'transpose' <comment274532> how do you select the table though? <comment274533> @tubbo Click it. <comment338546> Remark: Feature not available in Apple Numbers 2.x (from iWork '09 suite).
