library not found for -lstdc++-static <body> I'm trying to build wxFormBuilder_v3.5.0-beta-source on Mac OS X 10.9.4 and yes I have XCode installed and have successfully built/installed C++ projects on this machine before. It comes with a shell file for creating the build files, but it keeps getting stuck with the following error:  precode==== Building Premake4 ==== Linking Premake4 ld: library not found for -lstdc++-static clang: error: linker command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation) make[1]: *** [bin/release/premake4] Error 1 make: *** [Premake4] Error 2 ./create_build_files4.sh: line 91: ./premake/macosx/bin/release/premake4: No such file or directory ./create_build_files4.sh: line 92: ./premake/macosx/bin/release/premake4: No such file or directory ./create_build_files4.sh: line 93: ./premake/macosx/bin/release/premake4: No such file or directory ./create_build_files4.sh: line 95: ./premake/macosx/bin/release/premake4: No such file or directory /code/pre  I am aware that I must first install wxWidgets for this to work, and I have already successfully built/compiled/installed wxWidgets.  Here are lines 87-96 of the shell file (I prefixed the line numbers for your reference):  precode[87] # Build premake [88] cd build [89] make CONFIG=Release -C./premake/$platform [90] [91] ./premake/$platform/bin/release/premake4 --file=./premake/solution.lua $wxunicode $wxroot $wxversion $mediactrl $shared $arch codeblocks [92] ./premake/$platform/bin/release/premake4 --file=./premake/solution.lua $wxunicode $wxroot $wxversion $mediactrl $shared $arch $rpath codelite [93] ./premake/$platform/bin/release/premake4 --file=./premake/solution.lua $wxunicode $wxroot $wxversion $mediactrl $shared $arch $rpath gmake [94] if [ "$platform" = "macosx" ]; then [95]    ./premake/$platform/bin/release/premake4 --file=./premake/solution.lua $wxunicode $wxroot $wxversion $mediactrl $shared $arch xcode3 [96] fi /code/pre  I'm not as worried about the file paths missing. I tried to run codemake/code directly from the correct directory and still got this error:  precode==== Building Premake4 ==== Linking Premake4 ld: library not found for -lstdc++-static clang: error: linker command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation) make[1]: *** [bin/release/premake4] Error 1 make: *** [Premake4] Error 2 /code/pre  What I'm primarily concerned with is finding the code-lstdc++-static/code library and installing it, but I can't find it online. The only thing I can find related to it is to change settings in XCode when compiling iOS apps, which is not the case here. Any changes needing to be made will need to be made in a text editor.  hr  emCross-posted on SO./em  <comment167142> Thanks for the note about cross-posting.
