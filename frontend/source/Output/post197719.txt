Is there a way to make the Function keys act as standard keys with a Logitech K811 keyboard? <body> I changed the kbdFn/kbd key on my Macbook Pro to actually work in the reverse way (so, just hitting the kbdF1/kbd key actually sends the "Function 1" signal, rather than the brightness decrease signal when the kbdFn/kbd key is not pressed, and the brightness decrease signal if the kbdFn/kbd key is pressed). I did this because, as a developer, it's much more useful to me to be able to utilize the function keys than the other (what I consider auxiliary) functions.  However, when I'm at home, I use an external keyboard (a Logitech K811). It's a great keyboard, but it doesn't seem to sense the preference change I made with the kbdFn/kbd key. That is, on my macbook keyboard, I don't have to hold kbdFn/kbd to activate the function keys, but on my Logitech keyboard, I do.  Is there a way to make the Logitech keyboard also act the way I have it setup in my System Preferences?   <answer197733> According to Logitech you need they Preferences Manger download and installed.  Make sure you pick the right OS X and follow the instructions.  <comment236411> Did you check the settings in Logitech ? and did you try all 3 BT connections ? <comment236412> Do you have the Logitech Preferences Manger installed ? <comment236418> @Buscarì›ƒSD I now have the Logitech Preferences Manager installed. If you post this as an answer, I will accept it.
