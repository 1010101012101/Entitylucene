Weird Mac installer <body> Recently I downloaded a few thing via torrent and I have this problem with Mac installer:  When I double tap to open it, it says that the image disc is damaged. So I tried to allow install applications from wherever. Then when I opened the app installer it tried to install iTunes (via very weird installation app -oldish graphic etc.) and then some app called 7zip. First I thought it's maybe a virus so I didn't allowed to install it and deleted the file. But then the same thing happened with 3 completely different files and programs.  Do you have any idea what it could be? Have you ever seen something like that? Thank you very much for your help.  <answer224607> First, anything off torrent is suspect.  Just EXPECT that it's coming with a virus attached.  you did do virus scans didn't you?
