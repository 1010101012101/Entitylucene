Bring up new Finder window on current desktop <body> I've been using the kbd⌥/kbdkbd⌘/kbdkbdSpace/kbd shortcut to open a new "Search my Mac" Finder window. However, the problem with this is that I recently turned on Sierra's new "prefer tabs when opening windows" option on. That means that if I have a Finder window open in Desktop #4 but am currently in Desktop #1, the "Search my Mac" window will open emin the Finder window in Desktop #4./em What's even more confusing is that the Finder window isn't brought to the front. It stays in Desktop #4 and no matter how many times you press the kbd⌥/kbdkbd⌘/kbdkbdSpace/kbd shortcut, you'll be opening new tabs in that window with no visual cues whatsoever.  So is there any way to (force) open a new Finder window on the current desktop, almost like pressing kbd⊞/kbdkbdE/kbd on Windows? I do this so often, that having to switch to the desktop with Finder open becomes burdensome.  <comment344889> Well, you can always drag the tab off of the tab bar… <comment344890> Yeah, but that makes me have to go to that desktop, drag it out, and then go back to my original desktop. Really defeats the purpose of having a shortcut for that anyway! :-o <comment344891> Try Command-Alt-N. <comment344896> Funny, when the Finder isn't onscreen, it's Command-N, but when it is, it's Command-Alt-N. Thanks for the suggestion, but I wanted something slightly different (and I've updated my post to reflect that!)
