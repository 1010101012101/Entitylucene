ln -s symbolic link command error <body> I tried to use the codeln -s/code command to create a symbolic link to offload storage onto a separate volume and get the following error:  precodeln -s/Volumes/NONAME/POP-emailaccount@provider.net/ ~/Library/Mail/V2/POP-emailacount@provider.net ln: illegal option -- / usage: ln [-Ffhinsv] source_file [target_file]        ln [-Ffhinsv] source_file ... target_dir        link source_file target_file /code/pre  Can't interpret what was illegal about what I did. Can anyone walk me through it.  <answer173897> You need to separate the arguments on the command line. Try  precodeln -s /Volumes/NONAME/POP-emailaccount@provider.net/ ~/Library/Mail/V2/POP-emailacount@provider.net /code/pre  (note the space character after code-s/code)  <comment205014> thanks, i had the space in there but orginally my disc/volume name was "NO NAME" and so that threw a no such volume error because of the extra space in the syntax. when i changed the name of the disc and took that space out and retyped the command line I missed putting the space in after the -s command.  thanks so much for sharp eyes and to next answerer who also saw the error.  works like a charm now and my emails are stored on external drive. why that should require a metahporical act of congress is beyond me, but that's apple for you.
