Why does my Volume mount point get renamed after reboot? <body> I create a mount in Finder by pressing command+K, and typing this in the emServer Address/em field: smb://mydept.mycompany.com/dfs/somefolder/xyz  The mount point is /Volumes/xyz.  I go to System Preferences  Users &amp; Groups  Login Items  +. This lets me "Add an item to the Login Items list." In the file chooser dialog that appears, I select the strongxyz/strong volume. The volume is listed right under the top level ComputerName in the hierarchy.  Back in Users &amp; Groups Login Items, if I hover the cursor over that entry it shows the path as /Volumes/xyz.  All is well!  When I reboot, the volume is mounted automatically, but the mount point is /Volumes/dfs and not /Volumes/xyz.  This is a problem because I have scripts that are looking for /Volumes/xyz.  How can I get this path to the mount point to be consistent? I'd prefer to have it be /Volumes/xyz.
