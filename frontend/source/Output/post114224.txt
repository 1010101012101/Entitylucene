Macbook, Mavericks, Calendar <body> Calendar 'Alerts' me that I have 4 events for which I have not responded with either an 'Accept' or 'Decline'. I am reminded of this with the number '4' embedded in the Calendar icon. These are past events which I wish to delete from Calendar without sending a response.   However, the 'Delete' function does not work. If I click 'Edit' and then 'Delete', a popup appears asking for confirmation that I wish to DECLINE the event and notify the sender.   Is there another way to delete events, or at least remove them from the list of alerts of events for which I have not provided a response?
