My facebook update does not show "Sent via iPhone". How can I fix it? <body> Whenever I update my status or post anything from my iPhone 5 it does not show "Sent via iPhone" whereas my friend's iPhone does that. I even contacted Apple but they said it's related to Facebook and not the device. Please let me know the settings to fix this problem.  <comment82854> Are you using the Facebook app ? <comment92921> that is, related to Facebook, have you tried both the app and notification center?
