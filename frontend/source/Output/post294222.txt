Slow motion camera feature on iPod? <body> I am thinking of obtaining an iPod (any generation) for recording slow-motion videos, like the ones that can be shot on an iPhone 5s and above.  Is there an iPod that can do slo-mo, or is an iPhone the only option?  <answer294225> The iPod touch 6 has a camera equivalent to that in the iPhone 6.  As such it is the first (and as of August 2017, the only) iPod that can record slo-mo video, at 120 frames per second in 720p resolution.     The iPod touch features an 8MP rear iSight camera with video which can record in 1080p at 30fps, or strong120fps in slow-motion mode that records at 720p/strong.    <comment371355> Thanks, and do you know about iPod 5? It makes sense, judging by your suggestion that it has same slo mo feature as iPhone 5s? <comment371364> Unfortunately the iPod touch 5 is the equivalent of an iPhone 5, and therefore does not support slo-mo video.
