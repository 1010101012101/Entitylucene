Can OS X Lion Server automatically set up Mail using Open Directory information? <body> This is my first experience with OS X Server, I setted Open Directory up and added some accounts through Workgroup Manager.  When I login in on one of the remote Apple computers with one of the network accounts it mounts the file sharepoints nicely. But it doesn't automatically configure the Mail.app.  I searched on the internet but Lion differs a lot from (Snow) Leopard at this point. Is there anyone who can help me find the right setting to configure this?  <answer34138> you need to use profile manager, your users can setup their entire mac enviroment with installing just one tiny profile  <answer53051> Log into profile manager as an administrator using Safari and set up a profile for a user to change mail settings.  ul lihttps://server.local/profilemanager//li /ul  You will want to spend time making sure DNS and SSL are correctly installed - starting with making a self-signed certificate if you don't want to pay for a real SSL cert for your server.  Here's what to look for when you want to test setting IMAP settings for users.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MGou6.png" alt="Profile Manager - email settings"  As you might be able to see - pick a user, then edit their settings and finally choose email.  <comment38987> Can you please elaborate on that so that other users can get more details about the steps they have to take? <comment80961> @patrix I added an answer since "use profile manager" is a bit terse, even for me :) <comment126123> Do you know how far back this works for machines on the client side?  Is it only 10.8 and newer, or does it go farther back? <comment126125> @Kent OS X Lion was the first client that could accept profiles from profile manager. <comment137318> Prior to 10.8 you used Open Directory to do this stuff so you need an older version of Server to handle older clients but the principles are the same.
