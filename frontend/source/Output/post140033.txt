Empty space in the place of icons in Finder <body> I see empty spaces in Finder on OS X 10.9.4, exactly as on the picture. What does it mean? The spaces are in between the other icons, not at the end of the listing.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5f7nk.png" width="354"  <answer140034> This means there was an icon there, but it's been deleted/moved/etc and your current view doesn't do automatic sorting. Go to strongView/strong → strongClean Up By/strong → strongName/strong to fix it just once now or press ⌘J to open View Options and set strongSort By/strong to strongName/strong to fix this now and in the future.
