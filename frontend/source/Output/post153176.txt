Changing sublime text 3 icon in dock on Yosemite <body> I tried to change the Sublime Text 3 icon on the dock changing the Sublime Text.icns file in path code/Applications/Sublime\/code   Now in the dock appears the default  app icon (the one for apps that doesn't have an icon). How can I resolve it? Also restoring the original Sublime Text 3 icon, and after restarting dock (with codekillall -KILL Dock/code) nothing happens.  <answer153179> Here is a easy way to change the icon.  Remove codeSublime Text/code from your dock.  Open two finder windows. One with Applications and one in the folder with the new icon. Like so:   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Y72Ev.png" alt="Folders"  Then click on Sublime Text and press codeCMD + i/code, this will bring up the emInfo Window/em for the App (Sublime Text). Like so:   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uzyZS.png" alt="Sublime Text Info Window"  Now, it's as easy as this: Drag and drop the strongnew icon/strong onto the small icon to the left of the emApp name/em (Sublime Text) in the top left hand corner of the emInfo Window/em. You should see the icon for both the app and the preview change to the new icon you just dragged.   Then drag Sublime Text from the Applications window over to the dock, and it will appear with the emnew icon/em.  Like so:   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/k6i0E.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment180311> it worked, thanks! <comment180557> Glad I could help! <comment195365> I just wanted to mention that I changed the .icns file in Resources, and although it did take a while to refresh, eventually it loaded the new icon without having to do the accepted method. I think either works, but just wanted to inform whoever looks at this post.
