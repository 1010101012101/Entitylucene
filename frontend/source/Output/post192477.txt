Install Monokai Theme on Terminal with prompt colors, etc.? <body> I already have a Monokai theme installed in Terminal, as so:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/f7Q2S.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  I was wondering how I could get the rest of the Monokai (as Sublime uses) into Terminal? Like, making the prompt (Gamma@~) colored, etc.  Here is my current .bash_profile file:  precodeexport PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH export CLICOLOR=1 export LSCOLORS=gxBxhxDxfxhxhxhxhxcxcx export PS1="\u@\w $ " alias ls='ls -G' /code/pre  Thank you very much! I know this question is rather vague, but I cannot seem to find a PS1 color scheme that matches Monokai.  <answer192484> See this answer on the Unix &amp; Linux SE. There are a number of additional colors that can be used in a 256 color terminal.  You can view the colors in Terminal, and see their codes, by running this bash script. (There is a also a color chart in the above linked post, or IMO a more readable chart here.)  precode#!/bin/bash  color=16;  while [ $color -lt 245 ]; do     echo -e "$color: \\033[38;5;${color}mhello\\033[48;5;${color}mworld\\033[0m"     ((color++)); done /code/pre  Once you determine the colors you want, and have the color codes, you can use them in a PS1 prompt like shown below.  code48;5;#/code where # is the color number you want, sets the background color.  code38;5;#/code again # replaced with the color number, sets the foreground color.  In my case I wanted the default background that Terminal set when it was launched, and I use code0/code to note this. (You can also see that toward the end of the sequence code\[\e[0m\]/code - same idea, using 0 to reset everything to the default.)  precodeexport PS1='\[\e[0;38;5;166m\]\u@\H\[\e[0m\] \w $ ' /code/pre  The below screenshot shows my original, default prompt, and then how it looks when I sourced code.bash_profile/code after defining codePS1/code:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/K39pv.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer192491> Not a direct answer to your question, but have you looked at iTerm? It comes with several additional features on top of Terminal, and you can download and install a whole bunch of sweet themes on top of it. Apart from iTerm, I can also recommend zsh, which is just an additional layer on top of the bash shell, and if you use the oh-my-zsh plugin, again, you get a whole bunch of pre-cooked themes and prompts.  <comment293388> I've started using iTerm2 and zsh, but this is still relevant. Thanks! <comment293389> Been doing just that, thanks for the answer.
