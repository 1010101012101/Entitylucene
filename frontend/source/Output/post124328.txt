How to restore the MBR partition table of MacBook Pro? <body> I am using a MacBook Pro running OS X 10.9.2. While trying to triple boot my mac, I updated my MBR partition tables using rEFIt. Things didn't go as planned and now I want to start afresh. How can I reset my MBR partition table. I can handle partitioning disk on my own.  <comment145389> What did you try yet? Disk Utility? <comment145391> I'm afraid the last time I tried disk utility I lost the ability to boot into Mac. Can't do that now.
