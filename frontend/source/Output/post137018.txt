Refresh podcast in desktop iTunes <body> I spend a lot of time hearing podcast. On the desktop computer, last weeks there were an increasing number of podcast that have a kbd!/kbd symbol inside a circle.   In the past when this happened, I did not hear a podcast for a time. I used kbdctrl/kbd click and selected update podcast and the circle with kbd!/kbd went away.   But now it happens a lot on many podcasts that I hear very frequently and it does not goes away when I select Refresh podcast.   Is it just me, or it is a general problem of iTunes?
