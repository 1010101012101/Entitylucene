Find application associated files <body> I'm in the process of cleaning up my Mac files and want to uninstall some applications.  Some applications come with an uninstaller, others I can simply drag and drop to the trash. I'm aware that when you trash some applications, files are left behind via the library folder.   Is there a way to find all files associated to a particular application? I'd rather not install any third party software.  <comment253501> Have you already deleted the applications of which you speak? If no, wait until you get a good answer. You never know if you might need them. For example, if the application is running, you can use Activity Monitor  Sample Process to get the app's identifier which can help find support folders. <comment253506> I know you said _"I'd rather not install any third party software."_ however I'm going to suggest this anyway because it's free and it works. [AppCleaner](http://www.freemacsoft.net/appcleaner/) is the easiest way to go. <comment253607> I haven't started deleting apps yet. I'll give Activity Monitor a go, thank you.
