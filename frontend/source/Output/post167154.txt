Now when Chrome is 64-bits, how do I install the Java plugin? <body> As long as Chrome just was 32 bit, the Java plugin was not supported since Java for Mac OS X is 64 bit but now when Chrome (since version 39) is 64 bit, how do I install/enable the Java plugin?  Googling just returns old results such as  https://java.com/en/download/faq/chrome.xml (that refers to this blog post http://blog.chromium.org/2014/08/mac-chrome-when-im-sixty-four-bits.html)  https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/2429779?hl=en (talking about Java 7, I have Java 8).  <answer167155> You can download the latest version of Java, install, and reboot, and it should be listed in codechrome://plugins/code. Make sure that it's enabled (there should be a button saying codeDisable/code): img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5xyti.png" alt="Java Plugin"  Note: You probably want to check codeAlways allowed/code because Java always pops up and asks you if you want  it to run.  Once you finish this, you can test java.  <comment195977> Thanks for you answer. I have downloaded and installed the latest version of Java but I didn't reboot (and really don't have time for that now) since I saw no suggestion that I should reboot while installing. <comment196242> Did this work? If it did, please click the check mark on this answer so it turns green and people can see that you have found a solution. <comment196280> I will as soon as I have restarted, which I guess will be next time there is an update that requires reboot. <comment217318> Yesterday I rebooted and it worked.
