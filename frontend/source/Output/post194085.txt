SMART disabled on new MacBook Pro 13 Retina (ForceTouch) <body> I just wanted to see some of the SSD parameters on my freshly purchased MacBook Pro retina and found out that SMART support is obviously disabled by default.  Is this intended and if so, why? I'm using smartmontools to read out the information…  precode&gt; $ smartctl -a /dev/disk0                                                      smartctl 6.4 2015-06-04 r4109 [x86_64-apple-darwin14.3.0] (local build) Copyright (C) 2002-15, Bruce Allen, Christian Franke, www.smartmontools.org  === START OF INFORMATION SECTION === Device Model:     APPLE SSD SM0256G Serial Number:    *censored* LU WWN Device Id: *censored* Firmware Version: BXW1JA0Q User Capacity:    251,000,193,024 bytes [251 GB] Sector Sizes:     512 bytes logical, 4096 bytes physical Rotation Rate:    Solid State Device Device is:        Not in smartctl database [for details use: -P showall] ATA Version is:   ATA8-ACS T13/1699-D revision 4c SATA Version is:  SATA 3.0, 6.0 Gb/s (current: 6.0 Gb/s) Local Time is:    Thu Jul  2 08:58:52 2015 CEST SMART support is: Available - device has SMART capability.

You simply have to install strongsmartmontools/strong via strongbrew/strong.  precodebrew install smartmontools /code/pre  and then check the status via  precodesmartctl -a /dev/disk0  /code/pre  strongUPDATE:/strong  Without changing anything, I noticed today that it apparently switched itself to codeenable/code. I'm not sure when this happened but I installed several Mac OS X updates, so probably this was fixed by (at least) one of them.

The question is, why is it disabled by default? There must be a reason… <comment236132> Anyone confirm this is the case for multiple MacBooks? <comment236297> @agentroadkill my MacBook Air (11") has SMART Enabled. <comment236556> @DDPWNAGE, that's from the factory? We'd need to know your exact model as well as septi's model number to confirm. <comment236723> @agentroadkill Here's the raw output from running `smartctl -a /dev/disk0`: [http://pastebin.com/hSLVJTJz](http://pastebin.com/hSLVJTJz) <comment326720> MacBook Pro 13" Retina Late 2012 (A1425): Disabled from factory.
