"Laptop Notebook Memory for Apple Mac Mini"? Does this sound right? <body> I am shopping for memory for a MacBook Pro (mid-2009) and I found this. Supposedly, it is "Laptop Notebook Memory for Apple Mac Mini". Can such memory be used in a Mac Mini? Can it be used in the MBP I mentioned?  <answer98581> Despite this answer from a reviewer on the product that you mentioned:     My 2011 Macbook Pro came with 4GB of memory. I usually run several   (~10) apps simultaneously and need more memory. Even with fewer apps,   I noticed that Safari's Web Process always increases in size and   eventually leaves no free memory available. I looked at the choices   for 2x4GB of PC3-10600 and Komputerbay's price was enticing. I   installed them over two weeks ago and have not had a problem.   I would strongnot/strong trust buying this for a MBP. For a Mac Mini, that may be fine. But, it is always a good idea to stick with memory designed for your specific Apple computer.  Why don't you get this? It is from the same seller (Kcomputerbay) and it is around the same price. It also is for the MBP.
