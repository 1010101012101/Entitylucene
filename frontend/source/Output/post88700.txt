What's the Numbers equivalent to Excel's "A1:A10-B1" <body> I'm switching from Microsoft Excel to Number.app, in Excel you can do   precode=SUMPRODUCT((A1:A5-A1)^2,B1:B5) /code/pre  the codea1:a10-b1/code bit will return a cell range equivalent to codea1:a10/code but with all the cells decremented by codeb1/code. What's the proper syntax in Numbers for that?   If I try to import an Excel workbook using that syntax into Numbers, that formula will be imported verbatim and Numbers will complain.   <answer88705> In numbers, SUMPRODUCT (range, range…) takes the following arguments:     range:   A range of cells. range is a reference to a single range of   cells containing values of any type. If string or Boolean values are   included in range, they are ignored.       range…:   Optionally include one   or more additional ranges of cells. The ranges must all have the same   dimensions.   So you'll need to set up a range to perform the initial calculation (and squaring) and then sumproduct two simple ranges.  <comment103950> Also, Excel on the Mac was originally awesome, and although some of the last 8 years of versions were poor - the latest version is quite excellent as a Mac app as well as in implementing most of what a Windows user might expect like pivot tables and super complicated flexibility. <comment104198> well, I already know how to do it by having "extra" cell ranges with the intermediate results. I was wondering if there was something similar to the excel "shortcut" notation for it. <comment104211> There isn't but I wanted to at least explain why. The site doesn't work well when someone answers a question as "No."  I suppose I could have commented and asked why you thought that this was something numbers could do, but that's also not so constructive.
