iMovie with Audio USB Interface <body> I am using iMovie for recording audio during a Lecture (I nees to see video during recording) with a M-Audio M-Track interface (two XLR microphone).  The thing is that I can only record first microhone, because I can-t select the interface BUS on iMovie (or I didn't see it).  I also tested record with a XENYX UFX1204 (12 inputs), but I can only record from first input to.  Can anybody please help me?
