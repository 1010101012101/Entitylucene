Remove iterm from cmd+tab apps <body> I was using TotalTerminal to get visor like terminal on a shortcut. But TotalTerminal is abandoned so I have switched to the iTerm2. My problem is that when I use a shortcut to trigger iTerms visor behavior and profile it also gets activated like a normal app and gets into kbdCmd/kbd+kbdTab/kbd list of apps and I do not want that. Is there a way to prevent such behavior for visor profile of iTerm2?  <answer209253> There are a few applications that can "switch hit" in that they run either as a windowed/traditional app where it shows in the application switcher screen and as a background app or menu bar app.  For examples of this, look at Dash, Take Five and Skitch. Each has a preference to run in the "foreground" or the "background" and when you make a change to that preference, you have to quit and re-launch the app for the system to know how to handle the dock, windows and menu bar as well as the application switcher.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/PMVPX.png" alt="enter image description here"  I see no sign that iTerm 2 has this functionality, so at best you will need to modify the application or recompile it if it's ready to go and just lacks the preference toggle in the application. My suspicion is the application will need more programming added to handle both cases and you'll need to live with that app in the switcher or choose a different terminal emulation tool.  Basically, the OS can accommodate an app designed to opt out of the dock and the app switcher, but it's not as simple as setting one preference on any app you want to change.  <answer211103> There are some good modifications on GitHub.  The easiest I found is here: brhttps://gist.github.com/CrazyApi/5377685  Ensure you have a Hot Key set to toggle iTerm. Once you disable the dock icon, there's no way to launch a window otherwise.  To get the TotalTerminal visor style, you'll want to set your iTerm window preferences style drop-down to "Top of Screen"  Place the code from the GitHub post in your bash_profile:  ol liOpen iTerm (make sure iTerm is in your applications folder or modify the code to point to the correct path)/li liEnter codenano .bash_profile/code/li liPaste this code:  precode# toggle iTerm Dock icon # add this to your .bash_profile or .zshrc function toggleiTerm() {     pb='/usr/libexec/PlistBuddy'     iTerm='/Applications/iTerm.app/Contents/Info.plist'      echo "Do you wish to hide iTerm in Dock?"     select ync in "Hide" "Show" "Cancel"; do         case $ync in             'Hide' )                 $pb -c "Add :LSUIElement bool true" $iTerm                 echo "relaunch iTerm to take effectives"                 break                 ;;             'Show' )                 $pb -c "Delete :LSUIElement" $iTerm                 echo "run killall 'iTerm' to exit, and then relaunch it"                 break                 ;;         'Cancel' )             break             ;;         esac     done } /code/pre/li liControl + X to exit nano/li liY and Enter to save/li liLaunch iTerm and type codetoggleiTerm/code/li liType code1/code and Enter/li liRelaunch application./li /ol  Profit.  <answer233962> The "launch service key" codeLSUIElement/code in the code.plist/code file for iTerm2 is your friend.   To hide iTerm2 from the switcher, open Terminal and enter:  precode/usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c "Add :LSUIElement bool true" /Applications/iTerm.app/Contents/Info.plist /code/pre  You will need to relaunch iTerm2 for the setting to have an effect.  If you wish to show iTerm again, use the following command:  precode /usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c "Delete :LSUIElement" /Applications/iTerm.app/Contents/Info.plist /code/pre  Explanation from Apple:     codeLSUIElement/code    “Application is agent (UIElement)”.   Specifies whether the   app is an agent app, that is, an app that should not appear in the   Dock or Force Quit window. See LSUIElement for details.   <answer255950> Currently as of October 2016 iTerm2 has enabled this functionality.  Go to Preferences - Advanced - General - codeHide iTerm2 from the dock and from the ⌘-Tab app switcher/code.  <comment252372> In general, the program needs to present itself to the OS as a menu / faceless app with no icon in the dock. Have you checked the iTerm settings or contacted the developer? <comment252373> I have checked iTerm preferences but could not get the desired behavior. I have not contacted the developers yet. <comment287942> This settings doesn't work for MAMP :( <comment288033> @Alisso, could you provide a little more detail? <comment288411> I solved it through keyboard maestro :) (I found the "exclude" tab inside Keyboard Maestro - though that wasn't obvious at first either.) <comment291810> This answer didn't work for me (while the accepted one worked). That's strange as they basically do the same. <comment291988> @bumbu, any error message? <comment292187> no errors, nothing <comment295641> Worked fine on another machine <comment297186> Doesn't seem to work after upgrading to 3.0.0. Anyone else have this issue or figure out a new way of handling it? <comment302073> This works as expected. The only issue is that it also hides the menu bar permanently. But since the behavior can be toggled with a command, I think it suffices. Preferences can still be accessed by [cmd + ,] <comment306155> This worked as expected using iTerm 3.0.5 on a Mac 10.11.6. <comment311640> This is first hit in Google with keywords "osx remove cmd tab iterm". The gist link is dead, but based on the edit history the code needed is provided in the answer. <comment311641> `File Doesn't Exist, Will Create: /Applications/iTerm.app/Contents/Info.plist` if you get this error message, check the name of the folder. Mine is `iTerm 2.app` with a space.
