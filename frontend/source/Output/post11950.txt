MySQL - installation from source failed on ./configure <body> I'm following this How-to on installing MySQL on Snow Leopard but instead of using MySQL 5.1 I'm downloading the source for MySQL 5.5.11  so when I go into the source directory and run:  precode./configure --prefix=/usr/local/mysql --with-extra-charsets=complex \ --enable-thread-safe-client --enable-local-infile --enable-shared \ --with-plugins=innobase /code/pre  I get:  precode-bash: ./configure: No such file or directory /code/pre  What am I missing? what am I doing wrong?  <answer12021> Why don't you install MySQL from the DMG image - it works.  BUT - I'm not able to start v5.5.11 after the install, so I'm back on v5.1.56. It should only be a problem when installed on Snow Leopard.  <answer99496> You've downloaded the binary version, not the source.  This is the reason that you're getting the config error.  :)  <comment12497> I imagine you're not in the actual source directory for MySQL when running that command. <comment12503> It was because the new source packages require some `cmake` compiler... so i installed that compiler or whatever it is and then did `cmake .` - `make` - `sudo make install` what i don't know now is how to get the extra parameters to `cmake . ` <comment12504> Seems MySQL needs to update their install docs :D. <comment12509> This sort of issue requiring several programs is often eased by using a ports system e.g. Macports, fink, homebrew - where someone else has dealt with getting all the correct command lines <comment117049> This contradicts the statement in the question...
