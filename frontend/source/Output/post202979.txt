Transfer Photos From Mac to iPhone <body> How could I transfer photos from a Mac to an iPhone? I don't want to use iCloud Photo Library or Photo Stream. I think there is some way to do it using iTunes.  I would like it if the photos were stored on the iPhone so that they would be available offline through the Photos app on the iPhone. Is there any way to do this?  <answer202980> Create a folder on your Mac and copy photos you want to have on your iPhone to that folder. Open iTunes with your iPhone connected to it (using cable or via Wi-Fi). Click on iPhone icon at the top of iTunes and then click on Photos (left side of iTunes). Chose the folder you have created on Mac and select options you want (All folders or selected folders) if the folder contains video - you might want to select "include videos" checkbox. Click in Sync at the bottom/right of the iTunes window and wait until synchronisation finishes. Check Photos app on your iPhone for the folder that has the same name as the one you have created on your Mac.  <answer202982> I have been using iMazing (on the Mac) and FileApp (on the iPhone) which make it very simple, and you can just drag and drop your files back and forth.  <answer203014> You could download a Dropbox app on both devices and you'll be able to share photos without a usb cable but internet is required.  <answer203033> If you have OS X Yosemite you can easily (wifi must be on on both devices) share files from your Mac to you iOS device by using AirDrop.

If you do not have iTunes (why not?) , you cannot follow those instructions.  With that said, there are Apps in the App store that allow you to transfer files outside of iTunes. But it depends on the App in question.  Some let you upload files to them via a browser (over Wifi), other's make the iPhone act as a USB drive.   Many use iTunes File Sharing ability.  Depending on the App is what you need to do.  File Manager allows you to do this over Wifi via a Browser for example, without having iTunes at all: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/7435735  <comment244858> Answers on Ask Different need to be more than just a link. It's okay to include a link, but please summarize or excerpt it in the answer. The idea is to make the answer stand alone. <comment245159> Thanks! I have a few questions about this: 1) Will these photos be available offline on the iPhone; 2) Will I be able to access the photos on the Photos app on the iPhone by doing this; and 3) If I delete the folder I made on the Mac and sync the iPhone to iTunes on the Mac later, will the photos get deleted? <comment245162> Would I need to install both iMazing and FileApp? Or could I just install iMazing on the Mac to transfer the photos? <comment245163> It's best to install both. From what I understand, you could use iMazing to modify the OS folders (such as the photo folder) and drag them directly, but I don't recommend doing so as it could crash your Photo roll and / or your iPhone. <comment245175> Thanks! So let me just get this straight: I would make an album on my iPhone and I would install iMazing and FileApp. Then, from the computer, I would use iMazing to transfer the photos from the computer to the new album on the iPhone. Could I then view the photos through the iPhone's Photos app? Or would I have to use FileApp? <comment246176> You got it! File App has a file viewer, that you can use to see photos / PDF / movies / etc; and you can swipe between photos and zoom in photos right from FileApp. So, FileApp is great for a portfolio, for example (that's how I use it). You can also check each photo and decide to move it to your Camera Roll if you so desire, and then they will behave like any other photo you take (for example, this is good for putting SLR photos or videos into Instagram for example).
