Weird LCD / Boot problems on my MacBook Pro Late 2011 <body> My Mac is a strongMacBook Pro Late 2011/strong model with the 15 inch screen.  It began all with me, connecting my strongNexus 5/strong to the Macbook. I imported some videos with iTunes (yes, iTunes popped up automatically and I though I just give it a try). In the import process, the mac suddenly hung up and gave me a gray screen! I then restarted the mac and since then, I have these strange LCD problems on the boot up and crashes as well in normal operation. emI never had any problems with my mac so far, so it must have something to do with me connecting my nexus to my mac!/em.  strongThe Problem/strong  It's not reproducible for me but sometimes when I boot my mac, some strange lines appear on the LCD and after that, the mac hangs up (all I can see is a gray screen with no content). The mac also gets very loud at that moment. I have to restart and try it over and over again until I can finally login.  Picture of the boot-screen (I zoomed intentionally so you can see the lines):  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mpS5D.jpg" alt=""  Then, sometimes in normal operation, my mac freezes and the lcd displays the same lines as shown above (but with other colors: sometimes just blue, sometimes red and blue etc.). I also can provoke a crash when I connect my strongThunderbolt Display/strong to the thunderbolt port. But this does not cause a crash everytime strongAND/strong sometimes it just crashes with no monitor connected to it.  What I tried so far:  ul liMake the apple hardware test (normal and extended) -- no failures were detected./li liMake a clean install of OSX 10.10.3./li liRestetted NVRAM and SMC. (both before and after clean installation)/li liChanged the internal storage from an SSD to the original HDD from apple./li /ul  None of it solved the issue.

Do a search on Google for Late 2011 MacBook GPU problems and you will find loads of information about this. Apple finally recognized the manufacturing error and has a program in place to replace the logic board under warranty.  I had mine replaced a couple months ago with no costs at all.  <comment235950> Im sorry what did you meant? <comment235951> Run the Apple Hardware Test to check your hardware. <comment235952> I did (normal and extended) no failures were detected. <comment235953> OK, then run this system profile check that might tell us more: http://www.etresoft.com/etrecheck <comment235954> OK, here are the results: http://pastie.org/private/jvogbqnurymvffvzbslxsq <comment235955> Instead of single user mode try the Verbose mode to see where it gets stuck. I would also do the disk permissions repair and disk check. Since you have kernel panics without 3d party app installed it could be your hardware ...com.apple.driver.AppleIntelCPUPowerManagement ? and com.apple.driver.AppleHWSensor ? <comment235957> OK, disk check and repair succeeded (no failures in the disk), now trying the verbose mode! <comment235959> Thanks, maybe this solved the issue. I will do the verbose boot if it happens again and then post the log. <comment235971> Nope, didnt work. Sadly, the verbose mode does not show where the mac gets stuck ;( <comment236893> I noticed you reset the NVRAM but did you try a PRAM reset? [Instructions here.](https://support.apple.com/kb/PH18761?locale=en_US) <comment237435> scary, but it looks like the logic bard failures based on log: com.apple.driver.AppleIntelCPUPowerManagement  and com.apple.driver.AppleHWSensor <comment241156> Yep, did go to an apple store and they replaced it. <comment241456> Nice!! Glad to be of help!! <comment241539> Did you have any problems after replacing the logic board? Heard you should make a gpu stress test to verify the replacement. <comment241951> No, i didn't do a GPU test. I just use the MBP as i did before and it behaves as it did before. I guess they replaced the logic board with an identical one. So i suspect we will have the same issue again in a couple of years. These GPUs just get way too hot. <comment242142> Yikes, thanks anyway
