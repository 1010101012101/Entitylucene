Selecting text in textarea form <body> I am running on an iPad Air 2 with iOS 8.3. I do some JavaScript coding on it from time to time, and one of the things that I do with it is when ready to release, I pack it several times so no one can steal/modify it. I am trying to use a few obfuscators like this and this.  On the Dean Edwards link, I can select the first box and paste my code in without a problem. But when I go to copy the result, it won't let me. It might select a part of it, but it won't give me the "select all" option. I don't have this issue with the second link, and the source code looks like the forms are set up very similar, so I'm not sure what is causing it. I have this problem with Chrome and Safari.   Is there a workaround for this? Or is there a way I could make a bookmarklet to change the page in a way that it would work?  <comment218559> I found a bookmarklet called reEnable that would enable the text area for me, and running the packer afterwards would let me select the text:      `javascript:for%20(i=0;i%3Cdocument.forms.length;++i)%20%7Bfor(j=0;j%3Cdocument.forms%5Bi%5D.elements.length;++j)%7Bdocument.forms%5Bi%5D.elements%5Bj%5D.removeAttribute(%22readonly%22);document.forms%5Bi%5D.elements%5Bj%5D.removeAttribute(%22disabled%22);%7D%7D`  Found at this address: http://yaisb.blogspot.com/2006/10/defeating-dean-edwards-javascript.html But this only helped on the Dean Edwards obfuscator, not anything else. <comment218929> If what you posted addresses your problem, post it as an answer! <comment219767> It does not completely address the problem for every form box, just the one. I am looking for a solution that will work on other sites like jshint.com that i can't select all text <comment219768> jshint.com does not use a textarea. The code shows they are using a series of `div` tags to emulate a text editor. <comment219776> Ok so i needed to clarify my question. I was looking for a way to allow me to select text where i should be able to, Divs or text areas. <comment219781> It looks like jshint.com overtakes the cursor in JavaScript, which in turn would affect the ability of the pop up menu to run.
