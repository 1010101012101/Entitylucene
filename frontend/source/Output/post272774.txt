Request for Help with Java on Mac Sierra 10.12.3 <body> To make a long story short, I signed up for a Windows VPS service which required 32-bit Java for Firefox.  I already had 64-bit Java installed, and followed some online guides for terminal commands that would delete the 64-bit and allow me to install the 32-bit package.    Unfortunately, I messed up somewhere along the way, and now neither 64-bit nor 32-bit are working (whenever I test it, I get a missing plugin message).  Also, when I open System Preferences, I can still see the Java icon, but now it looks different - it has the appearance of the Settings icon.  When I click it, I get the message "'Java' can't be opened because it isn't available."  Could anyone guide me in solving this problem?  At this point, I would prefer to go back to the 64-bit version, and have the system back to how it was in the beginning.  <comment342823> Download [Java](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html) and reinstall it. Also: "followed some online guides for terminal commands..." - add links to the guides and/or the Terminal commands from the bash history.
