How do I enable X-forwarding on OSX Lion? <body> codessh/code works fine when when I log-in from OSX Lion to Lion or Lion to Ubuntu.  codessh -X/code (X-forwarding) works fine when I log-in from Lion to Ubuntu.  However, I can't seem to get codessh -X/code to work from Lion to Lion.  strongHow do I enable X forwarding on OSX Lion so I can run x applications from a remote machine?/strong  <answer35507> X11 forwarding is disabled per default for OS X SSH servers. Do the following on the strongremote/strong machine:  precodesudo vi /etc/sshd_config /code/pre  Search for the following line and remove the code#/code sign at the beginning, change the codeno/code to codeyes/code, so that you end up with this:  precodeX11Forwarding yes /code/pre  Then write the file and quit codevim/code by hitting codeESC/code and typing code:wq/code and hitting return.  Now restart the sshd process by typing:  precodekillall -SIGHUP sshd /code/pre  This will kill your ssh session, but after that you should be able to use codessh -X/code as usual. You may get warnings because of missing X authority files.  <comment40428> works great - tyvm
