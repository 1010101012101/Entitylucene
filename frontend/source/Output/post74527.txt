Can I create/edit contact groups in iOS? <body> I have been successful in managing contact groups with OS X's Contacts.app and iCloud.com, but haven't found a way to do this as of iOS 9.  strongIs there a way to manage contact groups on iOS em(iPhone, iPad, or iPod Touch)/em ?/strong  <answer74534> The answer is simple and yet dissatisfactioning: NO (with standard apps).  EDIT: There are some apps on the AppStore which enable this feature. One of them is "Groups Free". At least it adds groups to my iCloud account.  <answer74538> No, there is no way to create or edit contact groups on iOS. I share your frustration! The best workaround is to use iCloud.com (or your primary Mac, if you have it with you).  Also, there emis/em a way to add contacts to a specific group on iOS, though it's not obvious:  ol liIn Contacts, tap the Groups button in the top left/li liTap "Hide All Contacts"/li liTap the group that you want to add the contact to (making it the only visible group)/li liTap Done in the top right/li liTap the Add button (code+/code) in the top right/li /ol  Now when you create and save the contact, it'll save it in that specific group. You can then go back to the Groups list and reenable all your groups.
