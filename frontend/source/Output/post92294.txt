How to make a particular app the default viewer / editor for ALL its supported file types at once? <body> I want to make an application, say VLC, the default player for strongall/strong the file types it supports, without going through all of them individually.  I might not even know what all the supported formats are (as VLC can read 100s of formats) and still want to set it as the default player for all of them.  I was able to do this using the terminal, with the procedure posted below.  Is there an easier way to do it that doesn't require the user to be a developer?  <answer92295> ol liFind the application's codeInfo.plist/code file and convert it to xml format if needed.br VLC's plist file is already in xml format, otherwise you'd have to do:br codeplutil -convert xml1 /Applications/VLC.app/Contents/Info.plist/code/li liPerform the necessary dark magic to extract the list of supported file extensions, with your preferred wand (here is awk, but sed, perl, and others would work just as well):br codeawk '/CFBundleTypeExtensions/{t=1} /&lt;\/array&gt;/{t=0} t&amp;&amp;/&lt;string&gt;/{gsub(/\t*&lt;\/?string&gt;/,"");print}' /Applications/VLC.app/Contents/Info.plist/code/li liCheck the output to make sure you really got the list of extensions and that you really want to associate all those types with the app./li liRecall the last command kbd▲/kbd and edit it in order to create an empty file in your current directory for every file extension in the list:br codefor i in $( ≪awk command as before≫ ); do touch dummy.$i; done/code  /li liOpen your home folder in the Finder, select all the "dummy" files and open a collective inspector for all of them: kbdoption/kbd+kbdcommand/kbd+kbdi/kbd/li liSet the application in Open With and use the Change All button./li liTrash the dummy files./li /ol  <answer92307> While RCDefaultApp is a bit old, it still works  This gives you a decent GUI interface to control default apps  <answer92321> I wouldn't want to associate VLC with all types it supports (like mp3, iso, or utf), but I have added this to a duti configuration file:  precodeorg.videolan.vlc .avi all org.videolan.vlc .flac all org.videolan.vlc .flv all org.videolan.vlc .mkv all org.videolan.vlc .mov all org.videolan.vlc .mp4 all org.videolan.vlc .mpg all org.videolan.vlc .wmv all /code/pre  duti converts extensions that are listed in UTI declarations to UTIs automatically, so you can specify the types like code.jpg/code instead of codepublic.jpeg/code. See com.apple.LaunchServices.plist. The UTIs of some extensions like .mkv depend on what applications were installed first.  Many applications only list UTIs (LSItemContentTypes) and not extensions (CFBundleTypeExtensions) in the Info.plist. This would list the UTIs and print extensions associated with them:  codedump=$(/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Versions/A/Support/lsregister -dump); plutil -convert xml1 /Applications/TextEdit.app/Contents/Info.plist -o - | sed -n '/LSItemContentTypes/,/\/array/p' | sed -En 's|.*string&gt;(.*)&lt;/string.*|\1|p' | while read u; do awk "/uti: *$u/,/tags:/" &lt;&lt;&lt; "$dump"; done | sed -En 's/[[:space:]]*tags: *(.+)/\1/p' | sed $'s/, /\\\n/g' | grep '^\.' | sort -u/code  <comment108266> Are you asking specifically for the case where you have a list of file types, rather than the files themselves? For individual file types, you can select a file of that type, type command-i (get info), and in the file's info window, you can select the application to be used on all files of that type. <comment108269> Let me get that? you want to set the VLC as default player! <comment108284> This question may be a duplicate of one or more of the following: [How can I manually change default applications in OS X?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/28893/8546) (2011-10-23); [How to Change File Type Associations?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/45491/8546) (2012-03-23); [Setting “open with” default app forever](http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/87973/8546) (20-13-04-06) <comment108292> @TimB The title says it really, I don't want to do it for each file type individually. I might not even know what all the supported types are. I just added "all" to the title to make it more clear. <comment108293> @GrahamPerrin No, it's not a duplicate of any of them. <comment108295> This is nice, but it would still makes me go through 100+ clicks to set VLC as the default player for all media files. <comment108297> No it doesn't? System Pref - RCDefaultApp - Apps - VLC. Then click on the check box for the whole 'Extension' section and click 'set as default'. <comment108345> The Original question from you was how to make VLC default player for your parents for easy use to play common formats with one click. When you change your question as significantly as you did, it is better to make it a new question to avoid confusion in answers. <comment108359> @Buscar웃 I simplified the wording, but the original question had the same meaning. Even my self-answer below was unchanged.
