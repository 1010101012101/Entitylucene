Dual boot Yosemite + Sierra on a server? <body> I have a server (really a repurposed Mac Pro) running OS X Yosemite.  (I skipped El Capitan on the server because it lacks native RAID support.)  Recently, I've been interested in trying macOS Sierra, but I don't want to put it on my production MacBook Air for obvious reasons.  Is there a way to dual-boot Yosemite and Sierra on the server in such a way that I can access Sierra on the server from the MacBook?  I saw a post here on Ask Different regarding dual booting Mavericks and El Capitan, but I'm not sure whether that method is the same one I should use to get Sierra working the way I need it to.  Thanks!  <comment309446> What year/model is your Mac Pro? If it's pre 2010, macOS Sierra is not officially supported on it. Regardless though, I'd run it in a virtual machine until the GM release. <comment309447> I'm going to have to check, but I'm pretty sure it's a mid-2010 model.  As far as VMs go, I didn't think I could run any version of macOS in a VM at all.  How would I go about doing that? <comment309667> Update: I checked and it is a mid 2010.  I'm still interested in a potential Sierra VM and I still don't know how to do it.  (The only reason I double posted is that I can't seem to edit my original comment.)
