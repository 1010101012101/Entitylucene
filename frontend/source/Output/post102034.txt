Recording on iPhone from stereo line-in <body> I'm looking for a way to perform relatively high quality stereo line-in recording on iPhone. Unusual and third-party hardware is acceptable, but jailbreak is not. I am aware of the following options:  Griffin iMic paired with Apple's Lightning to USB Camera Adapter  ul liPros: Well-reviewed, USB interface./li liCons: Lightning to USB Camera Adapter is not supported on iPhone./li /ul  Blue Mikey Digital  ul liPros: Works with iPhone./li liCons: Requires Lightning adapter, line-in quality reportedly poor./li /ul  Neither of those satisfies my requirements. Is there some workaround I'm missing?  <answer102037> Check out some of the electric-guitar-interfaces.  For example, the Line 6 Sonic Port Channel Audio Interface has a stereo 1/8" input jack available. On the pricier side though.  <comment120210> A colleague referred me to the same device. I agree that it solves my need. I'll delete my my answer and accept yours, but please consider editing it to include the product name as a reference for others. <comment120211> @Justin Good idea, I edited it.
