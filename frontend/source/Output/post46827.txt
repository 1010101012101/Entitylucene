Is it possible to hook up macbook build in keyboard to Ubuntu PC? <body> I need to work on both: Mac Pro and Ubuntu PC.  I would like to use one keyboard. It is more less simple to do with external Mac keyboard, but how to do it with build-in one?  External is not convenient, because I use 3 or 4 screens (including laptop one) and the whole 'work env' gets either too wide or too deep.    <answer46838> Have you tried Synergy? They say that it  lets you easily share your mouse and strongkeyboard/strong between multiple computers on your desktop.  There are some videos on Youtube which show how it works.  <comment53658> I tried as you suggested. Synergy would be the answer if it worked :( Tried two configurations (to pick server) and at least two versions. Mouse works, keyboard doesn't. <comment53696> it was a fight, but it worked eventually!
