Restoring trackpad to original <body> I messed up with my trackpad settings. I am also using bettertouchtool.  The problem is three finger drag has completely stopped working. None of trackpad settings in system preferences or options under accessibility are helping.   Is there any way I can reset trackpad settings to original, the way it came with factory. I tried resetting PRAM, not helped. Any way to get back the default trackpad settings.  <answer220663> First disable/quit BetterTouchTool. Then go to ~/Library/Preferences and rename/move/delete emcom.hegenberg.BetterTouchTool.plist/em and emcom.apple.driver.AppleBluetoothMultitouch.trackpad.plist/em.   Since you didn't specify the version of your operating system the name of the trackpad preferences may vary. I got mine by sorting the items in the Preferences folder by modification date in list view and changing some settings of the trackpad prefs. Then quit emSystem Preferences/em. Look for an emcom.apple..../em containing trackpad or HUD. Don't throw away emcom.apple.systempreferences.plist/em.  <answer220671> this is what I did:  ul liuninstalled BTT/li lientered in Terminal codemdfind -name bettertouchtool/code/li lientered in Terminal codesudo rm -rf /whatever/code/li /ul  went to /Library/Preferences  ul liremoved em.GlobalPreferences.plist/em/li /ul  went to ~/Library/Preferences   ul liremoved em.GlobalPreferences.plist/em/li liremoved emcom.apple.AppleMultitouchTrackpad.plist/em/li liremoved emcom.apple.driver.AppleBluetoothMultitouch.trackpad.plist/em/li /ul  Finally I did a PRAM reset (Reboot, immediately hold kbdalt/opt/kbd+kbdcmd/kbd+kbdP/kbd+kbdR/kbd and hold these keys until the computer restarts and you hear the startup sound for a second time]  Frankly I got this by hit &amp; trial, I didn't knew what to do, so I did all at once.  After it restarted my trackpad was back like again. Maybe someone can edit this answer to make it perfect. Thanks :)
