Not able to install Netbeans IDE (PHP bundle) on OS X El Capitan <body> I am trying to install Netbeans IDE (PHP bundle) on OS X El Capitan.  I am getting following error     NetBeans IDE cannot be installed. This software can be installed with   Java 7 update 10 or newer. Please download and install the latest   update of Java 7 from   http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html and   restart NetBeans installation.   Following is error screenshot  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Xo4pE.png" alt="enter image description here"  PHP and some other bundles (HTML, C/C++) don't need separate java as they include JRE as mentioned on Netbeans downloads page - https://netbeans.org/downloads/     HTML/JS, PHP and C/C++ NetBeans bundles include Java Runtime   Environment and do not require a separate Java installation.   am I missing out something here?  <answer222232> Make sure that you have downloaded and are using the correct installer. Like your note says, it evidently should not require a separate Java installation.  Otherwise, just install the JDK separately.  <answer222258> The page you show for download does strongNOT/strong include the JDK      JDK 7 and later versions are required for installing and running the Java SE, Java EE and All NetBeans Bundles. You can download standalone JDK or download the latest JDK with NetBeans IDE Java SE bundle.   So try the combined download from Oracle Java's page or I think better the JDK  <answer229327> I did it for the C++ Bundle, but it should also work with other versions without Java support.  ul liAfter mounting the disk image, copy the Netbeans 8.1.pkg to a local folder./li liunpack it using Terminal with this command codepkgutil --expand NetBeans\ 8.1.pkg ./out//code/li liopen the code./out/Distribution/code file with a text editor/li liremove from the checkSystem function the part with the java check.

Still, problem persists. <comment269240> Just install the JDK then try again. <comment279734> Didn't get the point. For what do I need the JDK if I don't want to develop for Java? If the JRE is included it's enough to run it. <comment279737> Oracle has made this not true - on OS X The Oracle JRE is just the stuff needed to run web apps - the old JRE does not exist i.e. /usr/bin/java is only affected by JDK
