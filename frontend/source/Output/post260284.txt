Creating a USB bootable of Win 7 on an unsupported mac <body> I have a MacBookPro early 2011 (8,2) and I want to install Windows 7 using bootcamp.  At first, I just followed the Bootcamp assistant instructions. Partionning my hard drive (a fusion drive, because I replaced my DVD drive that did not work anymore by a SSD) succeeded, but when booting on the Windows 7 DVD (using an external DVD player), I just got a black screen.  So I'm trying a new solution: creating a bootable USB drive from Windows 7 ISO.  As my Mac is too old, Bootcamp does not propose the option of creating a USB drive. So I followed this tutorial. Everything went smoothly, but then Mac OS X 10.11.6 did not show the drive in the boot disks list (in system preferences).  I just checked with Disk utilities and it says the USB key is not bootable... What went wrong? How can I do this?
