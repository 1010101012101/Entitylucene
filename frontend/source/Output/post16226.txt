What software is available (preferably free) to edit PDF files on Mac OS X? <body> What free software/app is there to edit pdf files on Mac OS X?  Specifically I am looking to edit an existing PDF file and re-save it in PDF format.  <answer16227> PDF creation is built into Mac OS X.  Open the app you want to create a PDF from and choose "File  Print" or "Cmd+P" and choose "PDF  Save as PDF..." from the dropdown in the bottom left of the panel.  You can then use the Preview app to rotate, crop, combine files, and more.  <answer16230> I can't recommend any free solution since I don't use them, but want to second PDFPen as the best in class at any price. It looks like SamucoPDF is the least expensive app in the app store currently, but it has mixed reviews on the text editing.  If you really have more time than money, you might check out Stanza Desktop or Calibre both of which offer to accept PDF as input into file formats that are easier to edit with TextEdit or another editor you may have accessible. Once you've edited, you can print to pdf since the OS provides that to any app that can print.  <answer16231> The best solution is indeed, Preview... It's built into Mac OSX and is the easiest to use if you want to create/edit/view PDF files.  Thanks Apple for thinking this through! :)  <answer91124> You can just use Apple's Preview application, built-in in Mac OS X.  If you need more advanced features, I recommend Skim.  <answer112325> There's also strongPDF Buddy/strong, an online PDF editor that's really easy to use. It's a great alternative if you're not happy with Preview- especially on Snow Leopard where the Preview app is very limited.  (Disclosure: I'm a co-founder of PDF Buddy)  <answer112330> Have you had a look at Inkscape? It's a free, open source drawing tool. It allows importing of .PDF files and can save to .PDF as well.  <answer129974> PDF Studio does allow to edit text content and will work for minor text edits such as changing a few words or lines, changing font, size, color... The PDF format was not designed for Word processing and content editing is very tricky. It is usually recommended to go back to the original file (Word, Excel, etc..), to work with it and save it back to PDF. If you don't have access to the original file and need to do a lot of editing, including text reflow, wrapping, etc... you should probably bite the bullet and pay for Adobe Acrobat.   <answer158116> For simple tasks like fixing typos, OpenOffice or LibreOffice do the job  <answer193228> Apple's built-in Preview application (free) alone sufficient to make small changes in PDF documents. When you double click on any PDF file, it opens, by default, in Preview. You can use Preview app to merge, split, mark up, annotate, and sign PDF files. Preview is the easiest solution to view, create and edit PDF documents on Mac.   With long documents or for complex editing tasks, third-party PDF editors like PDFPen or this one (cheap alternative to PDFPen) are the best bet.  <comment17730> Are you aware that you can create a PDF file from any document you can print in OS X? If that's not sufficient, what additional features do you need in your PDF files? <comment17732> I have one pdf file I want to edit it and save it back in pdf. <comment17733> While this will create basic PDFs, you can't employ advanced PDF features like layers (to name but one) if you do it this way, hence my comment on the original question. <comment17734> Hmm, okay... I'm not aware of any free software for OS X that will allow you to directly edit PDFs. http://www.smilesoftware.com/PDFpen/ is probably the cheapest/best-known option, but that costs $60. If you don't need to maintain the resolution independence of the original document, you could edit it in a free graphics application like GIMP and save it back out as a PDF bitmap, but I guess that's not what you want... <comment17735> @Umesh Kacha I recognize English may not be your first language, but this is not "creating" pdfs. This is editing pdfs. You may want to edit your question. <comment17736> +1 for PDFpen. Besides that, there's only Acrobat Pro. <comment17737> What do you mean? Convert another file into pdf or actually build a pdf file? The first one is built-in into mac os (`printPDFSave as PDF...`), for the latter I'd use Latex (pdflatex). It's a bit hard to learn but it's a very powerful tool! <comment80914> Why don't you use the built-in PDF Creation? Does the PDFPen offer something more? In iPad, I use Readdle product called PDF Expert that I like very much, it has a search over all documents and all kind of note-taking/modification/etc but no idea about Mac -products. PDFPen is also for iPad but odd that never heard about it. <comment80915> The specifics here are to edit existing PDF and I feel PDFpen is one of the best solutions for that use case. Preview doesn't edit files in a meaningful manner. You can mark up things, draw on them, add a signature, but not really edit, merge or change things like a word processor can. Clearly print to PDF is the best option if you just want to make a PDF, and Preview can merge two or more documents into one, but editing requires additional software. <comment80917> Roger +1, thank you for the info. <comment361852> I had no idea LibreOffice could edit PDFs - just tried and it worked, awesome!
