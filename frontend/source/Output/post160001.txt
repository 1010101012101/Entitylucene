Binding multiple items to clipboard? <body> Is it possible to bind more than one items to the clipboard on osx? Which would possibly get evoked by different shortcuts? If it is how can I set it up?  I simply need to have a string always available at my disposal, but would like to keep my clipboard free for other uses.  <answer160007> One of the best third-party apps is the excellent CopyPaste Pro http://plumamazing.com/mac/copypaste  <answer160083> For one simple string, or as many as you like - why not use the built-in text replacer - System Prefs  Keyboard  Text.  As many as you like, as complex as you like, simple memorable triggers.  And, what's moreâ€¦ it's free ;)  <answer160084> There is a second clipboard in OS X, called the kill-ring. Press kbdControl ^/kbd+kbdK/kbd to "kill" (cut) the rest of the current line to the kill-ring, and kbdControl ^/kbd+kbdY/kbd to "yank" (paste) it.   <comment188085> You need a thirty part application like [Alfred](http://www.alfredapp.com), [Keyboard Maestro](http://www.keyboardmaestro.com)... and much more. <comment188088> A free tool is ClipMenu www.clipmenu.com <comment188092> Just for fun, there's a ClipboardViewer program available as source code in the Mac Developer Library: https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/samplecode/ClipboardViewer/Introduction/Intro.html <comment188294> Brilliant, that is just what I was looking for... easy and inbuilt.
