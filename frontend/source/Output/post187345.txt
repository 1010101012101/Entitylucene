Windows-Logo-Key + Left/Right Arrow -- Keyboard shortcut equivalent on Mac <body> I have both a mac and a PC. One simple extremely useful feature on PCs that I can't find on a mac is the shortcut codeWindows+RightArrow/code to maximize the active window, but only take up exactly the right half of the screen (and vice versa with codeWindows+LeftArrow/code).   It's extremely useful to be able to quickly do side-by-side comparisons without having to manually resize the windows, but I haven't found a similar shortcut on a mac. Does this exist for mac? Or is there a utility that allows this?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6GhM6.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer187374> BetterTouchTool lets you set up custom keyboard shortcuts to snap windows to the left/right/top/bottom (among other things). You can also create custom gestures, and per-app gestures/shortcuts.  <answer261294> If you hold down the green fullscreen button, it gives you the option to split/share the screen with a second window  <comment221901> Thanks @keepcalm I'll check it out.
