passwordLastSetTime value returned from dscl format <body> In 10.10 (Yosemite) the directory service return the "passwordLastSetTime" value in epoch time, but adding to the epoch time there is also another value..  For example using dscl command to read the directory service values :  precodedscl . read /Users/&lt;username&gt; /code/pre  Return (together with other values) the LastSetTime value like :  1430981725.strong8602591/strong  The first part is the epoch time when the pwd was set, but what is the second part ??
