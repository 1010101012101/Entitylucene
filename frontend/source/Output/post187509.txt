How to find all images in folder <body> I'd like to list all images in a folder (and subfolders), but I get no results in Finder for any search unless I search 'This Mac'.  I select the folder I wish to search, select 'images' as the 'kind' in the search box, top right, but although it says 'Searching "foldername"' nothing ever gets returned, unless I select 'This Mac',  what am I doing wrong?  <answer187667> I get frustrated using the Finder application to find anything. I guess I don't have a mind that works like the authors of the Finder application. If you are used to using commands you can try the following.   ol liOpen a Terminal application window./li liUse the codecd/code command to change to the base folder where the files are. The command codepwd/code will give your current folder./li liEnter to the command  precodefind . -name "filesToFind" -print /code/pre  and the current base folder and all subfolders will be searched./li /ol  For example to find all files ending the code.txt/code on your desktop, open a Terminal window and type:  precodecd desktop find . -name "*.txt" -print /code/pre  Note: The instructions for the codefind/code command can be found by typing the command codeman find/code or at this link.  <answer276859> To find (jpg,png,svg) you can type:  precodefind . -name "*.**g" -print /code/pre  <comment221639> What you say works for me.  Perhaps mention what OS you are using?  Do searches work with other selections or 'kind'?  What kinds of images are in that folder that should be found? <comment221641> What kind of images *format* (jpg, png, tiff, cr2, raw, …) are you looking for? <comment221645> Yosemite, 'kind' doesn't seem to work with anything other than This Mac <comment221646> I'd like to find all images in a folder and sub folders <comment221652> Just tried it here.  Works flawlessly on Yosemite.  Here's what I did (so that you can compare): Navigated to Pictures, typed in "a" into the search box to initiate the search, added a criteria (auto-set to "Kind" is "Any"), removed the "a" by hitting backspace to not limit the search to files containing "a", chose "Image" from the drop-down showing "Any".  Voilá!  Shows all supported image types. in the subfolders of Pictures. <comment221654> I followed your description exactly, nothing is displayed. Should I have to wait? Maybe they are getting indexed, or something? <comment221762> Have you possibly selected Search This Mac = in Finder Preferences, Advanced -  when what you really want is Search Current Folder? <comment221847> No, it's set to 'Search The Current Folder', I think you're on the right track though, I'm new to Macs ('really'!) and have probably got a setting wrong, somewhere
