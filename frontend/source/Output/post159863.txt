Speed up moving mails in Mail with AppleScript <body> Moving or deleting mails in Mail with AppleScript is dog slow. One of my scripts is:  precodetell application "Mail"     set SelectedMails to selection      repeat with currentMail in SelectedMails         set isRead to get read status of currentMail         if isRead then             move currentMail to mailbox "xxx" of mailbox "yyy"         end if     end repeat end tell /code/pre  The speed per mail is longer than a second. Deleting mails is similar in lack of speed. Does anyone have an idea how to speed this up?  <comment188172> On my aging macbook, running Snow Leopard, it was very fast when I moved 6 msgs from Inbox to Trash. I only changed your code to remove `of mailbox "yyy"` since it was not necessary for me. Are your mailboxes local or on the network?
