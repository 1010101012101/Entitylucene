Cannot set a different compiler as default <body> I have two version of clang installed: one provided by Apple, and a new one installed by myself:  precode/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain/usr/bin/c++ /opt/llvm/clang+llvm-4.0.0-x86_64-apple-darwin/bin/clang++ /code/pre  Now, building the same project, with the same codeCMakeLists.txt/code file, from the IDE (QtCreator) runs the new compiler. Building it from the command line, the old one is launched.  In QtCreator I explicitly specified I want the new compiler to be used.br From the command line, I updated the PATH, which now starts with:    precode/opt/llvm/clang+llvm-4.0.0-x86_64-apple-darwin/bin:/opt/local/bin:... /code/pre  From codetype clang++/code I get:  precodeclang++ is /opt/llvm/clang+llvm-4.0.0-x86_64-apple-darwin/bin/clang++ /code/pre  What else should I do to use the new compiler by default?
