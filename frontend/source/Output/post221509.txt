Is there an upate to Apple Hardware Test? It locks up while testing <body> Apple Hardware Test 3.3.1 -3A152 comes with my MacBook Pro 17", 2008 on the included OSX 10.6.3 DVD/CD. When I use it on my not-booting Mac, AHT locks up and never finishes tests and therefore there is no result list.  Wished AHT would list tested hardware and show results as it goes - step-by-step. Instead of listing results at the very end, when AHT might have locked up - with no results at all...  <answer221550> There have been many updates…br unfortunately your machine is too old to use them.  It can only use a DVD-based version, not the latest internet-based test.  There is a blog post about how to boot to AHT from a downloaded AHT file, loaded to a USB key, but you will need a working Mac to be able to construct it.  From : Riven by Five - Download and run Apple Hardware Test (AHT) from a USB drive.  emMy additions in italics/em     1) Download the AHT for your computer (see downloads below for specific models).      1b) My copy had me convert the downloaded .dmg from some “old” type using Disk Utility. (Just open the .dmg in Disk Utility and “Convert” to a new target, then mount the target.)      2) Mount and completely wipe a USB stick.br   emFormat it GUID/Mac OS Extended (Journaled)/embr   emMost USB sticks will be MBR/FAT by default, so just formatting to Mac OS without changing the underlying structure to GUID will not work/em      3) From the AHT image, copy /System to the root folder of your USB stick:br   emby typing the following in Terminal [Applications/Utilities]/em      codecd /Volumes/USB_STICK/ &amp;&amp; cp -r ~/AHT_ARCHIVE/System/code       4) Now, from the USB drive, copy the /System/Library/CoreServices/.diagnostics/diags.efi to the root directory:      codecd /Volumes/USB_STICK/ &amp;&amp; cp ./System/Library/CoreServices/.diagnostics/diags.efi/code      5) Shutdown all applications, emexcept Terminal./em      em6) the original 6) below assumes you are booting to the same machine you are trying to test/embr   emto attempt to use this on a different machine omit the code&amp;&amp; sudo reboot/code &amp; instead eject the USB after that command, then move to your target machine/em        6) “bless” the USB drive in mount-mode, with the EFI file, and immediately reboot:      codecd /Volumes/USB_STICK/ &amp;&amp; sudo bless --mount /Volumes/USB_STICK --setBoot --file diags.efi &amp;&amp; sudo reboot/code      em7) Cold boot your target machine/embr    You should now be booting into AHT -- don’t hold down any keys.       8) Run the tests, and yank the USB key after AHT reboots you.
