Change default mail application without configuring mail.app <body> I'd like to change my default application for handling mailto: links to be the gmail browser-based client. I'd like to do this emwithout/em configuring the default mail.app. That means I cannot get to the mail.app preferences panel. Does anyone know how?  <answer111174> strongRCDefaultApp/strong allows you to pipe mailto: links to an app different to the app you have set as the default mail app.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mJVYY.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment308677> I just desperately need to vent my frustration about this. I mean really, who puts a default app config behind a mandatory account setup!?
