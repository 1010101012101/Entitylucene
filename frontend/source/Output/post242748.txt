How to schedule airplane mode? <body> I want to schedule Airplane Mode during the night (10PMâ€“6AM) on my iPhone.  How can I do that?  I used to turn off my previous phone (a non-smartphone). I do that especially to save some battery life.  <answer242750> It's not possible to schedule emAirplane Mode/em unless you have a jailbroken device.  If you want to jailbreak your iPhone, there's a few apps that do this exact thing.  This sounds like it would be a good idea so I recommend you let Apple know you want this on their iPhone Feedback page.  <comment298736> I also would like this feature. I do schedule do not disturb, and usually enter airplane mode before bed.
