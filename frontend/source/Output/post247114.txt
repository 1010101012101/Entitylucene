Can I move the Google Drive folder to a different volume? <body> Is there a way to put the Google Drive folder on a different volume on my Mac (where I have more free space)?  I tried Googling the question, and just got tips about doing it on Windows.  <answer247220> I figured it out.    ol liQuit Google Drive and remove the Google Drive folder./li liRestart Google Drive./li liError message saying that it can't find the folder will pop up./li liClick the error message text to open a dialog in which one can specify a new folder./li liSpecify your new folder location./li /ol  <answer255924> Method 1:  ol liEnter codePreferences/code: menu bar - Google Drive icon - 3-dot icon/li liChoose codeDisconnect account/code in the Account tab.

Then quit the Google drive. The next start of google drive app you give you some error notification. After that you should have the error message. On click on this I've got nothing, but since you close it and clock on the gDrive - you'll see a grey folder icon and at the bottom a link that say find/specify google drive folder. This is the think you need.     <comment325109> Worked for me on El Capitan, and latest version of Google Drive. IMO this is better than disconnecting and re-installing/re-configuring, as it avoids re-downloading everything. Some files may need resyncing though, for me: out of 31K files only 94 needed resyncing. <comment341611> the answers do not appear in the same order every time. Can you write out the entire process from beginning to end as a complete answer?
