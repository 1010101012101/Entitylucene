My computer will not recognize that python exists <body> I have opened python on my somewhat outdated Mac OS X in Snow Leopard 10.6.8 and although it was working fine earlier, my computer will not recognize that I am using python.  When I click on the python window, instead of saying python in the upper left of the screen it will just say the last application I have been using, also, it will not let me type or do anything.  Also it will not quit unless I force quit it.  Python will work fine when I open it, the bug only starts when I open a new window.br If it helps when I open the shell it gives me this message:  precodePython 2.6.1 (r261:67515, Jun 24 2010, 21:47:49)  [GCC 4.2.1 (Apple Inc. build 5646)] on darwin Type "copyright", "credits" or "license()" for more information.  **************************************************************** Personal firewall software may warn about the connection IDLE makes to its subprocess using this computer's internal loopback interface.

They basically recommend installing and using a newer version of python. Depending on whats using python you might want to get a newer version 2 release and not go all the way to the newest version 3 release.  <comment175013> You also need an up to date Tcl/Tk https://www.python.org/download/mac/tcltk/ <comment175178> I will upvote your answer as soon as I get enough reputation!
