To show videos in some CHM viewer <body> CHM is an extension for the Compiled HTML file format.  There are many viewers with different quality.  xCHM has been my choice because of robust search, here their homepage.  I however just noticed that some files are incorporated with videos but my viewer cannot show them.   strongHow can you view CHM videos in OSX?/strong Any good option for this.   <answer234442> Since I cannot comment your question for lack of rep, I'd suggest you try iChm 1.4.3 or 1.5.0. Latter was recently released, so if video doesn't work (a feature I didn't know about in CHM, by the way), I'd suggest you open an issue in the tracker.  <comment286635> I voted you up so you can comment soon. I think your proposals are completely valid as an answer. I would like to get any reviews about those viewers. The thing is now that I cannot remember which file was embedded with video so I cannot test it. <comment286637> I only use 1.4.3 with [QuickChm 1.1](http://sourceforge.net/projects/quickchm/files/quickchm/quickchm1.1/), but lack a Spotlight importer. 1.5 added an importer but seems to break QL. I'll head to the tracker for both issues. <comment286644> Please, add tickets IDs here too so we can follow them. <comment286645> I opened a thread about generating .chm document with LaTeX here http://tex.stackexchange.com/q/303549/13173 so we can get test inputs. <comment286784> @Masi, you can check [#1](https://github.com/NSGod/ichm/issues/1) and [#2](https://github.com/NSGod/ichm/issues/2).
