How do change focus from the address bar back to the document after CMD+L? <body> CMD-L brings focus to the Address Bar.  Is there are shortcut key for toggling back to the document of the current tab?  How else might I achieve this other than a keyboard shortcut built in to Safari?  Context: Safari 7 OSX Mavericks  <answer132620> You can ⇥ back, or alternatively ⇧⇥ which is usually faster.  It takes me two presses of ⇧⇥ to get back from the address bar to the page: one to move to the Add to Reading List button and one to get back to the page. This may be higher if you have the back/forward buttons on the toolbar, and lower if you have Full Keyboard Access disabled in System Preferences.  You can use Keyboard Maestro to create a macro which lets you get back to the page with a single keyboard shortcut.  <comment157233> In my safari, with 1password installed, it takes 6 shift tabs to get back to the page.  Tabbing forward, I have to press tab 5+(the number of tabs I have open). :/  I have seen Keyboard Maestro, but would rather just tab it, or click on the page then spend the money to enable one action.
