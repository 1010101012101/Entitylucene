Can I make Chrome the default web browser in iOS? <body> With Google Chrome available for iOS now I'd like to know if it's possible to make Chrome the default browser? I find "open in browser" type options from other iOS apps still take me to Safari.  Not interested in jailbreaking. Looking for a solution that works without having to do that.  <answer55269> No, this is not possible unless Apple allows this in a future iOS update.  <comment63421> Are you suggesting that they will? <comment63422> @user1090389 There's no reason to believe that they will, but there's no reason to rule out the possibility. <comment64251> JailBreaking is the only way right now, sorry. <comment64252> @AndrewLarsson I'm actually thinking it's time to try the JB route... <comment64258> If you do plan on going down that path, I've [answered a question](http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/46044/18387) that explains what JailBreaking does and what reversing it does. Feel free to ask me any questions here on AskDifferent or on chat if you run into any problems or concerns.
