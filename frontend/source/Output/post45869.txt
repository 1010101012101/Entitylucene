CD digital audio ripping tool for OS X that has accurate extraction, error detection, and verbose reporting? <body> I'm almost ready to say I have found a good OS X replacement for every piece of software I use on Windows (excluding some Windows development tools), but there's still this gap to fill:  For CD digital audio ripping / extraction, I use a tool on Windows called EAC - Exact Audio Copy.  I like EAC because:  ul liit supports a very strongreliable/strong extraction mode by default,/li liit takes advantage of drive features like strongC2 error correction/strongbr (and will tell you if your CD-ROM drive doesn't have it)/li liit strongvalidates tracks/strong were ripped accurately by consulting an online database, and/li liit strongreports verbose details/strong about potential issues, when they arise, and I can then listen to the track to see if the issues are perceptible or not./li /ul  In a nutshell, I can be confident whether a track was reliably ripped or not when using EAC.  I don't get this sense of confidence from iTunes.  iTunes has an option under emImport Settings/em to emUse error correction when reading Audio CDs/em, but that seems to be the extent of reliability-oriented settings in iTunes. Currently, I'll use iTunes if the disc I'm ripping appears pristine and without scratches &ndash; otherwise I turn to EAC.  Is there an application for OS X that, like EAC above, focuses on emreliable/em CD digital audio extraction and provides detailed information?  Thank you.  <answer45878> h1XLD/h1  It started out as decoder/encoder/transcoder tool but it's branched out in to ripping in recent years (version 20080812 and above have ripping features) and it supports most of your criteria:  ul liUses the AccurateRip technology, comparing MD5 sums against known-good library of rips to ensure the rip was done correctly./li liUses cdparanoia 10.2 as the ripping and error correction library. Can be used on drives that don't have Accurate Stream and utilize C2 error pointers./li /ul  (Source for above)  I can't comment on the "verbose details when errors arise" request because I've never encountered an error ripping with it.  It's free. It will multi-thread to speed up encoding of albums. And it's pretty fast. It's been my encoder/transcoder of choice for years now.  <comment52336> I miss EAC too, great, great app.
