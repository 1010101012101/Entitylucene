The iPhone couldn't be restored. An unknown error occurred (3194) <body> I have an iPhone 6 iOS 8.0. And I want to restore it. So I downloaded the iOS 8 firmware for iPhone 6 from this link then I opened itunes and pressed codeshift+click on restore button/code and then chose my downloaded ios 8.0 firmware, but I get the below error message:  precodeThe iPhone couldn't be restored. An unknown error occurred (3194) /code/pre  I searched the internet and some people suggested modifying the hosts file found in this location codeC:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc/code by removing or commenting the codeapple.gs/code lines. But I still get the error. So if anyone could please advise how to restore to the currently installed iOS 8.0 without updating.

Apple is no longer signing iOS v8.0.0 installations. You will need to restore to (as of this writing) 8.1.3 which is the latest version available. The HOSTS file settings are to ensure that iTunes can talk to the update server, which isn't the issue in your case.  You are basically attempting to downgrade the software on your iPhone (since the restore process installs the newest version, and you want to restore but then go back to iOS 8.0). You cannot downgrade iOS unless Apple is still signing the previous version, which usually only occurs for a very small window after a new update is released.  <comment206821> Apple is no longer signing iOS v8.0.0 installations.

The restore process downloads the latest version of iOS and installs it with factory settings. <comment206830> @tubedogg that's ridiculous (talking to apple not you :) ), I don't want to update to the latest as my brother already did and he is not happy, there should be a way to restore and have the same current iOS. <comment206831> Ridiculous or not, that is the way it is. Without Apple signing the update, your iPhone will not install it. See [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHSH_blob): "SHSH blobs are created by a hashing formula that has multiple keys, including the device type, the iOS version being signed, and the device's ECID (a unique identification number embedded in its hardware).[6] When Apple wishes to restrict users' ability to restore their devices to a particular iOS version, Apple can refuse to generate this hash during the restore attempt..." <comment206832> You are basically attempting to downgrade the software on your iPhone (since the restore process installs the newest version, and you want to restore but then go back to iOS 8.0).
