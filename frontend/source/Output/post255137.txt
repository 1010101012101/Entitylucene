Windows 10 does not boot up after BootCamp installation <body> I have installed Windows  10 via BootCamp on Mac OS Sierra on Air Early 2014 but the Windows just does not boot up. I have checked the presence of Windows data on a partition and they are there.  The option showed up as Windows disk but it just simply blinks the DOS - sign and does nothing.  Also, I would love to know how can I install Windows 7, more precisely how can I make the touchpad and internal keyboard work during the installation / os usage.  I have removed the Windows 10 installation but I will try to reinstall it again once I will know how.  Also I think I should mention that even when I saw the partition on Finders left panel, it was not listed in a Startup disk as a option.  <comment317711> Did u use bootcamp to install Windows? I still didn't try a new install on Sierra, but it should be straightforward as it was on El Capitan or Yosemite. Can u give more details so we could help u <comment317718> yes I did. It has created an usb from iso, added some support drivers as well. Then I have booted into usb, installed windows, restarted and... nothing <comment317793> You probably made some simple mistake during your attempt to install both Windows 7 and Windows 10 on your Mac. Although Windows 10 may not install if you are using the version released last August. Also, installing Windows 10 depends on whether you used a legacy BIOS/MBR install or the newer EFI/GPT install. You say the keyboard and touch pad both do not work during a Windows 7 install. Is there any way you can connect a mouse to a USB port? This is just for the installation of Windows 7. I assume after the Boot Camp Support Software is installed you can remove the USB mouse.
