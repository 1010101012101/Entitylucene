Unibody Macbook Stuck on Apple Logo <body> My White, Unibody Macbook running OS X 10.8 started to freeze, so I shut it down.   When I went to restart it, it got stuck on the Apple Logo for some five minutes before I just turned it back off.  So far, I have:  ul liChecked &amp; Repaired Disk/li liChecked &amp; Repaired Permissions/li liReset the NVRAM/li liReset the SMC/li liTried Safe Boot/li /ul  For Safe Boot, the loading bar appeared and it started to load. Then, it disappeared and I got stuck with the progress indicator (again) for some eight minutes before I just turned it off.  I need my Macbook for school and all, it has all my work and projects...  Any thoughts? Any input is welcome.  emNote: My Apple Care subscription expired &lt; 1 month ago, so... :(/em  strongEdit/strong  In response to a comment below, I booted up using kbdCMD + V/kbd. Here are the results:  precode... ** /dev/rdisk0s2 (NO WRITE) ** Root file system     Executing fsck_hfs (version diskdev_cmds-557~393) FIPS USER Space POST: Integrity test success!

I have gotten a motherboard replacement about 2 weeks after my 3 year Apple Care plan expired. If you go to the store and are honest you could get lucky. I haven't heard of anybody getting service after a month. At the least the genius can tell you for sure what the problem is.  So make a genius bar appointment and see what they say. With Apple it really doesn't hurt to ask.  <answer79610> Checked and repaired disk how?   Start up in single-user mode, Command-S, and run FSCK -Y at the prompt, or FSCK -F if journalled, and if results say, File System Modifed, run it again until that message goes away, then reboot.  Single User Startup info: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1492  This is a good example of why a disk clone comes in handy, now that we don't have Install Disks ... not only to have a copy of everything on your machine, but also as a Startup Disk, from which can be run Disk Utility and, if you have it, the one utility worth buying, Disk Warrior. See CarbonCopyCloner or SuperDuper.  <answer85970> precode** /dev/rdisk0s2 (NO WRITE) ** Root file system     Executing fsck_hfs (version diskdev_cmds-557~393) FIPS USER Space POST: Integrity test success!

This will show you all the messages during startup and eventually show you where the MacBook hangs. Post back with result so people can help you with a more specific question. <comment91876> @BartArondson updated. <comment91975> I checked and repaired the disk via the Recovery Partition (CMD + R). I'll try `FSCK` when I get home. <comment91977> I would second this sentiment. The main thing a genius appointment will do is cut through all the things you need to accomplish: 1) backup data 2) rule out software issues 3) diagnose the hardware and it's all for free if you can get into a store - AppleCare current or not.
