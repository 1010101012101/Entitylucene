Are There Any Text Browsers for iOS? <body> I want a text-only browser on my iPod. It is not jailbroken (nor do I wish to do so), and it is running iOS 4.2.1. Does anyone know of a way to install any text browser on iOS without jailbreaking? Any of these text browsers would be awesome;  Lynx, Edbrowse, w3m, Elinks, Links, Emacs/W3, Net-Tamer, WebbIE, etc  <answer8345> You could use Atomic Web Browser and turn on Web Compression (uses Google mobilizer). This should leave you with a minimum of graphics on the page.  <answer8420> You could go on your iPod to a website like http://pizzaseo.com/tool-lynx.php to emulate the behavior.  <comment8973> ...or Opera Mini and turn off image loading. <comment8996> Have you tried to search these names one by one on iTunes app store? Particularly, if you do not want to jailbreak the iPad, there's no other source for apps. <comment9020> I didn't find any of those apps by name in the app store, but I didn't know if there were any other text only browsers in the app store, or if there was a way to install one of those listed from something like iDos without jailbreaking. <comment9021> Thanks, but I want a text-only browser. <comment9039> That's kinda cool. Not quite going to do what I need, but definitely interesting. Thanks. <comment9046> What's the difference between "browsing with no images or video" and "text-only browsing"? <comment9504> I want a browser that isn't able to load images or video. I'm going for simplicity. Just text and hyperlinks, ignores everything else, including CSS.
