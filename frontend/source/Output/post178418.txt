How can I open a Google Maps URL in Apple Maps? <body> Is there a way for me to convert a Google Maps URL to an Apple Maps-friendly format so it opens in the correct place?  I might be in the minority, but where I am, Apple Maps offers vastly superior driving directions.  <answer178482> Not sure how you can do it in iOS, I can't find the equivalent command, but you can do it on the Google Maps web site in a browser then copy/paste the info to Apple Maps…  ul ligo to Google maps in a browser/li lisearch your desired location/li lionce that's found, right click the pin &amp; select "What's here?"br img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/aT8nx.png" alt="enter image description here"  /li liThe latitude/longitude will then be shown in the info bar, top leftbr img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/E6AJh.png" alt="enter image description here"br This can be copy/pasted to Apple Mapsbr img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lZ1oQ.png" alt="enter image description here"/li /ul  <answer288941> I have been searching and there is no easy way to extract the coordinates or anything other than the a Google map URL from the iOS Google Maps app.  I have to think that it is on purpose.   The “easiest way” so far is to type by hand the coordinates (viewable but not copyable from the Google Maps app)  <answer295158> Apparently, Google doesn't want you to switch apps. There seems not to be any easy way to export a location in a format that Apple Maps can read it. I also have been fiddling with it and I even tried to make a Workflow, but without success. In the end, I found two moderately easy ways to do it:  h11. Without any third-party apps/h1  Tap the "code+" to copy it to the clipboard.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ccXp9.jpg" alt="copying code+ in Google maps"  Then go to Safari and paste that code to search it in Google. You should get a Google search results with a map at the top. Tap the map to open a full version of it and then you get normally formatted coordinates, that you can copy and paste into Apple Maps.  h12. Using a third-party app as a quick bridge/h1  An easier way to do it, but that's requires the eventual purchase of a third-party app, consists in using Opener. It's a small utility that allows us to choose which app will open a given URL. Having the app Opener installed, all you need to do is share in Google maps and select Opener.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LSY8S.jpg" alt="sharing a location from google maps "  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ajEu8.png" alt="Choosing Opener"  It will give you an option to open that location in Apple Maps, or in other supported apps that you may have installed in your iPhone or iPad.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/TzvFP.png" alt="Choosing any supported app"  It's the easier easiest and quickest way I managed to do it in iOS.  <comment211308> it is not clear why you need to use Google maps in first place. <comment211370> @Buscar웃 Most likely the links are from third-parties. <comment211455> Converting the URL link is not possible since it points to Google maps. As explained by @Tetsujin you need the geo location coordinates from Google map.
