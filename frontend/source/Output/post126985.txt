Can a mac do a bitwise copy of a USB disk with proprietary disk format? <body> I have a USB disk with a propietary format that I want to bitwise clone to a new identical drive.    I have CCC but the disk doesn't show up in Finder.  It does appear in Disk Utility.    I tried Terminal command of "mount" and do not see a device that might be it, so the dd command probably isn't an option.  Any ideas?  Can it be done on a Windows or Linux machine?  Thanks for any help, -deac  :-)  <comment148739> `dd` seems like the way to go, here. Try to run  `df` before and after plugging you USB drive. Is there a new line that appears? <comment148748> Since it shows in Disk Utility, check if it is Hidden drive. <comment148781> As it shows up in Disk Utility, you should be able to find it using `diskutil list` in the Terminal. That should provide you with a name to use for `dd`.
