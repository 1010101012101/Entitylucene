What is wrong in this command about grepping and pandocing? <body> I am thinking this answer which returns a broken PDF document in OSX 10.10.3.   The file test_dummy.tex is here.  precodepandoc test_dummy.tex -f markdown -t html | grep -E '(^&lt;|^$|^ *$)' \ | grep -v "^&lt;p" | pandoc -f html -o tables.pdf /code/pre  where pandoc 1.13.2.1 and grep codegrep (BSD grep) 2.5.1-FreeBSD/code.  h11 Mistake in test_dummy.tex -file (different than you having real LaTeX)/h1  I installed Pandoc by codebrew install pandoc/code.  Something is wrong in the very beginning command  precodepandoc test_dummy.tex -f markdown -t html /code/pre  returns a blank line, likewise codepandoc test_dummy.tex -f markdown/code.  [fixed by the answer]   h12 Connecting the full command still challenge/h1  The command (with cabal Pandoc)  precodepandoc test_dummy.tex -f markdown -t html | grep -E '(^&lt;|^$|^ *$)' | grep -v "^&lt;p" | pandoc -f html -o tables.pdf /code/pre  returns   precode!

My guess is you've got several `pandoc or the tex file is encoded oddly or throwing some error that the version I downloaded from dropbox isn't the same as the one you are using.  precode$ pandoc test_dummy.tex -f markdown -t html | wc       311    1349   11676 $ pandoc test_dummy.tex -f markdown -t html | head  &lt;p&gt;everything - etiology, symptoms, diagnostic tests, grades of aortic valve stenosis&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Aortic regurgitation.

Then break apart the chain of commands and inspect the beginnings of each output file using things like codewc/code, codehead/code or codemore/code so you can make sure each link in the chain is working. The post you linked to is an exceptional answer by Kurt in that it explains exactly what the command line tools are doing with grep and why.  <comment223563> I've tested this command on OSX Mavericks 10.9.5. My Pandoc is `v1.13.2.1`, installed via `cabal-install pandoc` (but usually I install the MacPorts stuff,not the HomeBrew-ed one). <comment223588> The command you listed doesn't work with just pandoc installed. You've not documented the minimum tools needed to reproduce this issue. Also, if you can specify what is broken about the pdf if you in fact don't get an empty line from the first half of the command. On 10.10 - I get everything to work except the missing `pdflatex` part that fails at the second invocation of `pandoc` <comment223594> The command `pandoc test_dummy.tex -f markdown -t html | wc` gives me now the same as `311    1349   11676`. Output of `pandoc test_dummy.tex -f markdown -t html | head` is the same now as with you. Same test_dummy.tex file too. My pandoc is now the variant of $HOME/.cabal/bin/pandoc. Do you get the correct PDF output? Please, see my edit in the question body about the error which I get when I run the full command. <comment223596> Everything solved now! XeLaTeX must be set as a tool to compile things.
