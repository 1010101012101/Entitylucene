How to enable "Click-to-play" in Google Chrome Version 43.0.2357.124 (64-bit)? <body> I run Google Chrome Version 43.0.2357.124 (64-bit) on OS X Yosemite.  I want to enable strongClick to play/strong option, mainly because I would like to lower the power usage of Google Chrome and Google Chrome Helper processes.  However, I cannot find it under strongSettings/strong  strongContent settings/strong  strongPlugins/strong and it should be there according to Why does Google Chrome Helper spike my CPU? and many other webpages.  strongQuestion:/strong  Has Google decided to removed this particular strongClick to play/strong feature from Chrome or for e.g. it has moved to some other section of the Settings?  One way or another, is it possible to enable strongClick to play/strong option for plugins?  <answer190803> h3Google Chrome Version 55.0.2883.95 (64-bit) on macOS Sierra 10.12.2/h3  It looks like the solution for Chrome 43 doesn't work any longer as the strongLet me choose choose when to run plugin content/strong option is no longer present in the settings.   At the moment you can:  ol liOpen strongSettings/strong (you can do it by clicking strongimg src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KV5vd.png" alt="More"/strong and then strongSettings/strong or by clicking kbd⌘/kbd+kbd,/kbd)./li liClick strong+ Show advanced settings/strong./li liEnter the strongContent settings/strong in the emPrivacy/em section./li liGo to the emFlash/em section and choose strongBlock sites from running Flash/strong./li /ol  More information here: https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/142064?hl=en  hr  h3Google Chrome Version 43.0.2357.124 (64-bit) on OS X Yosemite/h3  Ok, so I've found it. It is not presented as strongClick to play/strong any longer (it used to be in previous versions of Chrome and is still presented like this in Chromium).  If you want to turn this option on you've got to:  ol liOpen strongSettings/strong (you can do it by clicking strong☰/strong and then strongSettings/strong or by clicking kbd⌘/kbd+kbd,/kbd)./li liClick strongShow advanced settings.../strong./li liEnter the strongContent settings/strong in the strongPrivacy/strong section./li liEnable strongLet me choose choose when to run plugin content/strong in the strongPlugins/strong section./li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ufgR7.png" alt="enter image description here"  It seems quite obvious now, but I've been trying to find this for a few weeks by now, because it was called strongClick to play/strong before.  <comment284497> Thanks for tracking this down.  It looks as though when `Click to Play` was replaced my setting defaulted back to `Detect & run important plugin content`.  Under this setting though, I haven't experienced the awful spikes I used to have.  FWIW. <comment336609> I don't have this Plugins section. Chrome version  55.0.2883.95 on OS X. <comment336661> @shrx I updated the answer. However, I'm a little bit confused now whether it still works the way it used to.
