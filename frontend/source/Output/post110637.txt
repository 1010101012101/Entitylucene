change terminal language os x <body> I have a Mountain Lion macbook and it's default locale is english, it's keyboard is english (US) as well. I need to change the language that the terminal replies to Swedish.  For example,  Instead of replying "Connection Refused" for a failed telnet, it should say "Forbindelse Vagras" (which is the Swedish translation)  EDIT:  I have tried setting LANG=sv_SE.UTF-8 and same with LC_ALL, to no effect  Have also tried changing system-wide settings, which changes the language in the entire system but not the terminal  Also, I'm running ZSH.  <answer110638> I imagine you'll want to set the codeLANG/code environment variable.  <comment130302> I don't think command-line tools like `telnet` are localized. <comment130303> so i'll have to get extra language packs? <comment130304> I don't think there are any extra language packs :) Everything is already shipped with OS X; these tools simply were never localized. The only command-line tool that ships some locale info is `/usr/bin/cal`; if you type `LANG=sv_SE cal` in Terminal you will get weekday names in Swedish. That's as far as you get. <comment130305> Bah! Any ideas about other OSs? Windows, Ubuntu... I can install a VM and test what I need to. <comment130306> Windows is definitely the best at this, all standard components should be perfectly localized, but it's command-line environment is not POSIX and lacking features to the degree of pathetic. Try also FreeBSD, RedHat/Fedora (you may need to install additional packages having "nls" in their name). <comment130307> tried that... it shows LANG="sv_SE.UTF-8" LC_COLLATE="sv_SE.UTF-8" LC_CTYPE="sv_SE.UTF-8" LC_MESSAGES="sv_SE.UTF-8" LC_MONETARY="sv_SE.UTF-8" LC_NUMERIC="sv_SE.UTF-8" LC_TIME="sv_SE.UTF-8" LC_ALL="sv_SE.UTF-8" but the language remains stubbornly english
