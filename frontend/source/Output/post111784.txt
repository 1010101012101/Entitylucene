Change the keys for changing windows gone in Mavericks <body> When I got my Mac-Mini, I've changed the cycle-through windows key from kbd⌘`/kbd to kbd⌘0/kbd (since on the Hungarian keyboard layout I should press kbd⌘⌥ű/kbd, and never could remember which one is it from 5 other key.)  In Mountain Lion this option was still present, but now it is missing from Mavericks. I can't find it in the Keyboard &amp; Input section anywhere. The entry for kbd⌘⇥/kbd is also missing. This became problematic only now, because I only noticed now, that it clashes with a key combination in Microsoft Outlook. (I don't know if this problem come with the update, or had it before.)  Can anybody help how can I change this option or how to restore it? I would like to set it to kbd⌥⌘⇥/kbd and kbd⇧⌥⌘⇥/kbd as I did it once before. (Or kbd⌃⌘⇥/kbd should be more comfortable.)  <answer111860> On my installation of 10.9 the shortcut can still be changed from System Preferences  Keyboard  Shortcuts  Keyboard  Move focus to next window:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8tJTb.png" alt=""  I don't think it was ever possible to change command-tab to another shortcut though.  <comment131517> I am an idiot. Or my Mac is trolling me. Either way it is still there. However I clearly remember that it was possible to change cmd-tab, and that is what I was looking for, and that is why I didn't find it. Although a human memory is too fragile to base it only my memories, so a confirmation on that is needed. <comment142381> @AdamL.S.: you can switch the functions of modifier keys (control, command, alt and caps lock) with each other, in System Preferences  Keyboard  Modifier Keys (https://www.dropbox.com/s/bm8pq0g99sp4stx/modifier_keys.png). This is a way to change command-tab to e.g. alt-tab or control-tab. Of course, it changes every other command-* shortcut to e.g. alt-* too, so it might not be what you’re looking for. <comment142641> @pauld.waite thank You, but that wasn't what I was looking for. As I remember, I believe it was possible to change cmd+ tab keys explicitly. Besides, I was concerned about switching the windows of an app, not the apps them self, as I changed that key once, which was not suitable any more. <comment142642> @AdamL.S.: gotcha. I think VMWare lets you use cmd-tab in place of alt-tab in Windows guest VMs. I mention it in case you’re remembering that and confusing it with re-mapping cmd-tab on Mac OS X (although I doubt that’s the case).
