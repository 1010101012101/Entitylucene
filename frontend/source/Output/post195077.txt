OSX Stuck - Window manager is responsive, but can't create any process <body> Shortly (seconds) after booting, the OS (10.6.8) becomes unresponsive. Not a single process can be created, but the window manager is responsive - I can switch focus between existing windows and some already loaded programs - e.g. Terminal, Finder, etc but I cannot run any new processes - opening a browser, or even executing "ls" from command prompt yields no results.   There are no obvious CPU hogs - I managed to quickly run "top -u" with no high CPU util at the point it gets stuck (at one point the top utility stops refreshing, I suspect it spawns a new process for each refresh).  Any clues appreciated.  <answer195108> I have a theory and it is pretty easy to test...  I think the permissions on your Admin account are corrputed, not allowing you to spawn new processes.  How it happened, I don't know.  However, you can create emanother/em admin account by booting into emSingle User Mode/em  ol liReboot/Power On/li liPress and Hold Command-S/li liWhen you boot, you will be in a Terminal window at the root (#) prompt/li liType the following:  precoderm /var/db/.applesetupdone /code/pre/li liReboot by typing:  precodereboot /code/pre/li /ol  When your Mac boots, you will be presented with the Welcome screen.  Follow the prompts to create a new Admin account.  The problem should go away.  <answer197551> After trial and error, the correct answer proved to be such: disable IPv6. The OSX machine started to freeze when I switched internet connection and WiFi router.
