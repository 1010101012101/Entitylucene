How do I restrict Internet access while still being able to make calls/receive messages? <body> Is there any way I can restrict my iphone from using the internet? Basically all apps should be blocked from using the internet, in one go, but I should still have the provision to make/receive phonecalls/messages.  <answer50917> strongTurn off Wi-Fi/strong (in Settings  Wi-Fi), and strongturn off Mobile Data/strong (in Settings  General  Network).  This will keep the phone off the internet, but still allow phone calls and texts. (iMessage and MMS won't work, however).
