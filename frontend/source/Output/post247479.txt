Can connect to router but not internet <body> My MacBook (El Capitan 10.11.2) one day cannot connect to the internet via wifi. It work solidly beforehand.  My router setting has not changed. Nor have any device white/black-listing. Other devices can connect to the router and internet fine.  ul licodeping 192.168.1.1/code works /li licodenslookup stackexchange.com/code works /li licodenslookup stackexchange.com 8.8.8.8/code fails /li licodeping stackexchange.com/code times out/li /ul  Interestingly if I connect to the Router's wifi guest, it works fine.  <answer247480> So a desktop that's connecting to the router via ethernet cable experience the same exact problem! Many other devices operated fine. This allow me to pinpoint the router is messed up somehow.   A power down restart on the router fixed everything.  <comment305402> Possible duplicate of [Wifi Keeps Dropping Macbook Pro 13in Retina Early 2015](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/195359/wifi-keeps-dropping-macbook-pro-13in-retina-early-2015) <comment305474> Nice! When in doubt...turn it off and back on again.
