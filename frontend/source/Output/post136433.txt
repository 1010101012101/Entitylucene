How to uninstall wget <body> I recently installed wget on my Mac using the instructions listed here: http://osxdaily.com/2012/05/22/install-wget-mac-os-x/ and lorcan's instructions here: How do I get &quot;wget&quot; for Snow Leopard?  However, I realized that I installed an outdated version of wget.  Is there an easy way to uninstall wget from my system?  <answer136438> In a terminal, type codesudo rm -f /usr/local/bin/wget/code  <comment161861> If you install wget with Homebrew, it should replace the old version.
