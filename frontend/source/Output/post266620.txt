What is the /bin/[ '[' file in OS X? <body> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qfKwg.png" alt="Enter image description here"  See the screen shot.  There is the '[' file at code/bin/code.  What is the '[' file? What does it do?  <answer266623> This command is for comparing values, checking file types etc.  Here's a codeman/code page:  precodeNAME  test, [ -- condition evaluation utility  SYNOPSIS  test expression  [ expression ] /code/pre  It's usually used like this:  precodeif [ -f /etc/passwd ]  then    echo "Yes" else    echo "No"   fi /code/pre  For more info, please read the man page ( codeman [/code ).  <comment334353> It's worth noting that the default shell likely has its own builtin version of the [ command that will run instead of the one in /bin. The one in /bin is likely only for compatibility and for particularly minimalist shells.
