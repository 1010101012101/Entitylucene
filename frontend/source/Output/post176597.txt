Why retina mac book pro won't output signal to second monitor via mini display, but detect it? <body> I have 2 monitors, a retina, 15-inch, mid 2014 mac book pro. I plugged the hdmit output to one monitor, and a mini-display to dvi to the second monitor.  On mac book preference system perferences-displays- arrangement tab I can see all three screens, however the one connected via mini display port - dvi isn't getting any signal.   Can I used two monitors with a mac book pro, without having to buy some fancy extra device?   <answer176601> Your model should support 2 external monitors at max resolution of 2560x1600.  Dual display and video mirroring: strongSimultaneously/strong supports full native resolution on the built-in display and up to strong2560 by 1600/strong pixels on up to two external displays, both at millions of colors.  Check your resolution settings, if the cables are working.  https://support.apple.com/kb/SP704?locale=en_US  <comment208580> depends on model/year - please edit your question to provide full model details. <comment208582> If you unplug the HDMI cable, does the mini-DP-DVI-connected monitor get signal, using either Thunderbolt port? This will help isolate where in the chain the problem is occurring. <comment208595> Must've been a bad cable, found another one that was dvi to hdmi as oppose to dvi to dvi Works now
