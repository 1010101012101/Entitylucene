Disable iMessage without access to iPad <body> Is there a way to disable imessages being received on an ipad without physically accessing the ipad?  My family shares an apple account. I disabled imessage while I was back home, but it looks like it was reactivated on my mothers ipad. I go to university and she is tech illiterate, so I can't follow the normal instructions of just disabling imessage on the iPad's settings.   Is there a way I can make sure imessages are sent to my iphone, and my iphone only without access to the ipad?  EDIT: I logged onto appleid.apple.com and took a screenshot of the numbers and emails registered.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QyrxS.png" alt="enter image description here"  The +90 number is my mother. The +1 213 number is me.   aydin_... is my email. kolo... should be on one ipad.  maria... is my mothers email, likely active on ipad and perhaps her iphone.  On my iphone: I only send and receive imessages from the +1 213 number and the aydin... email. I start new conversations from the +1 213 number.   It appears the ipads are receiving messages sent to the +1 213 and/or aydin... email.
