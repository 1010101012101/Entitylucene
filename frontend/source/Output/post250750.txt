Setup my new Mac <body> I just bought a MacBook Pro and it's a beauty. I haven't opened it yet. I expect it to ask my about the language and for an account. That's cool, however I was wondering if there is something I could do, so that istrongt won't ask me for a password/strong every fOcking time I the laptop goes to sleep automatically (because e.g. I was on the phone).  Any ideas?  <answer250808> If you go into system preferences (click on the apple icon in the top left corner of your screen) and go into "Security &amp; Privacy", there is an option to disable the password after sleep.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/RLQQL.png" alt="Security and Privacy"  <comment311518> There are settings for that inside System Preferences. <comment311519> So I should not do something the 1st time I open my Mac? Sorry, but it's my first time manipulating a brand new one @IronCraftMan! Also are you sure, I asked my colleague if I can do it via settings later and he said no.. :/
