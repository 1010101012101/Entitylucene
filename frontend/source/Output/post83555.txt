Can Macintosh HD partition be resized while a BOOTCAMP partition resides on the same physical volume? <body> I have a HFS-partiion, a bootcamp partition and 100GB free unpartitioned space "in between". How can I resize my Mac partition to use it? All resizing controls seem to be disabled, here's the screenshot:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1kVSj.png" alt="disk utility with partition selected"  Guess I need some more advanced tool than the built-in Disk Utility?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0QSVp.png" alt="diskutil list results"  This is under OSX 10.7.5. With Paragon NTFS driver installed, if this matters...  <answer83563> Disk Utility won't touch things once you have a BOOTCAMP partition.  Look for third party utilities like CampTune for on the fly adjustments (or at least ones after a reboot in some cases). You'll discover the same company Paragon that made the NTFS drivers, also makes CampTune  <comment96179> Does `diskutil list` show two or three partitions larger than a GB? You might be stuck backing up and restoring BOOTCAMP if the resize is more important than that partition. <comment96181> Don't you need to select a partition to be able to resize it <comment96184> I did select it, of course. Still nothing: http://d.pr/i/hA5F <comment96185> @bmike `diskutil list` shows this: http://d.pr/i/JAIe <comment96187> Could you add a screenshot of this dialog when the middle partition is selected? <comment96198> @Rabskatran I did, added it to the question
