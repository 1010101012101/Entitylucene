OS X: is it possible to open a window on top with AppleScript? <body> So I have this little script that, when launched does a screenshot of the current screen and then fires up an image editor to edit the image. However, I noticed that every time the editor is being fired up, it just hangs in the background â€” as in, it doesn't pop up on my screen so sometimes I just sit there wondering what the hell when I suddenly realize I need to do the edits for script to go on and that the image editor is already waiting on me to find it in Dock. Is there a way to make it start on top of other windows?  <answer248218> Use codetell application "name" to activate/code, where codename/code is the emname/em of the application you want brought to the front. If you already have a codetell/code emstatement/em block for the target application you can use codeactivate/code by itself within the codetell/code emstatement/em block.  Examples:  precodetell application "name" to activate /code/pre  Or:  precodetell application "name"     activate     # Other commands to follow... end tell /code/pre  Also, if the target app is being opened from within a emshell/em script, whether executed manually in Terminal or within AppleScript e.g. codedo shell script "name.sh ..."/code you can add an AppleScript emcommand/em within the emshell/em script using codeosascript/code as in the following:  Syntax:  precodeosascript -e 'tell application "name" to activate' /code/pre  Example:  precodeosascript -e 'tell application "Safari" to activate' /code/pre  Note: In Terminal, type codeman osascript/code and press ementer/em, to display the BSD General Commands Manual entry for codeosascript/code.  hr  From the AppleScript Language Guide:     strongactivate/strong      hr      Brings an application to the front, launching it if necessary.   hr  As a good reference, have a look at Introduction to AppleScript Language Guide and the following document is handy to have on your system, AppleScript Language Guide (2013) PDF.  <comment306466> what if an app starts as an argument inside another script? i.e. my script goes 'do shell script smth.sh -i editor' <comment306467> @Arthmost, If the target app is already running, regardless of how it was opened, before the different _script_ tells it to _activate_, then the _frontmost_ window of the target app should be brought  _frontmost_ of all other windows except for a _modal_ window. <comment306468> it's not running. what the script inside my script does is launches an editor app to edit the screenshot and it always launches in the background <comment306469> @Arthmost, I'd suggest adding the _code_ for your _script(s)_ related to this question within the body of your question so it can be evaluated to accommodate the situation. <comment306482> @Arthmost, I've updated my answer adding the use of the `activate` _command_ from within a _shell_ script.  It may be of interest to you. <comment306487> my script is as simple as `do shell script "script.sh -i editor"` where `script.sh` take a screenshot and fires up `editor` to edit it. It's not my script, I found it on GitHub. <comment306491> @Arthmost, I've updated my answer with additional information and cannot comment further on your particular use case without seeing the _code_!
