Time Capsule. Drive is ok, cannot connect through wifi <body> I am having a problem with my 2TB (I think Gen 2) TC.   It was connected directly to a cable modem and was working fine for over a year. A few days ago, I started to get connection errors (no IP) on both the Ethernet and wifi ports. The wired computers are connected to the TC through a hub.  I changed the connection to link to the net through a spare router, and changed the TC to "Bridge Mode".  All the connected (Ethernet) ports work ok. I have no WiFi mode though (from the TC).  I can see the TC and even do a Time Machine backup to it.  Before I plonk $300 on a new device, I would appreciate any troubleshooting tips..  <answer65566> Are you running the latest firmware and have you already tried resetting the TC to factory defaults?  <answer65613> For others who are having this issue, the hardware is ok. The problem is with the current version of firmware - 7.6.1.  I finally found this site that allowed me to use Airport Utility 5.6 with Mountain Lion. Using Frank's patch (see the site link above), I was able to roll back the firmware version to 7.6.  To do this, open AU 5.6 and select Manual Setup img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FIkZt.png" alt="enter image description here"  Hover over the Version, and you'll see the little arrow.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/J2l2O.png" alt="enter image description here"  Then click Version and select the software version. (7.6 seems ok). Ignore calls to update after this.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MvfLP.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment77086> I do have the latest firmware (7.6.1). I've tried to reset it by unplugging, holding the switch in the back for 5- 10 seconds, but somehow, I'm not sure that really got the device back to factory settings. Is there a more robust method? <comment77087> I thought you could reset ir from the GUI itself. Anyway, this should help you out: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3728 <comment79653> +1. Was having some issues with Time Machine backing up to the Time Capsule drive on 7.6.1. Used this tip and backups are working fine all around once more. Thank you!
