exec format error: ifconfig <body> I tried to execute  precode$ ifconfig zsh: exec format error: ifconfig /code/pre  After looking for the binary file:  precode$ whereis ifconfig /sbin/ifconfig /code/pre  At this moment, I read that this error can occur when binary does not have permission to execute, I went check it:  precode$ ll /sbin  (...) -r-xr-xr-x@ 1 root  wheel     0B Sep 19  2014 ifconfig (...) /code/pre  I have execute permissions for everyone, I even tried to execute as coderoot/code and still does not work.  And then I looked that file as a size of 0 (zero) bytes. This must be related to my problem.  I does not know what can be the reason for this. I have used the command a lot of times in the past. The only things that occurs me, is that in recent days I have upgraded codeDocker/code from Homebrew (boot2docker to native beta) and then executed codebrew upgraded/code.  strongI'm wondering if anyone knows how to reinstall or recover codeifconfig/code binary?file?/strong  <comment301828> I wouldn't expect to see extended attributes on a command line tool. I'm guessing that there may be and issue with hfs compression. Can you post the results of this command- `xattr -l /sbin/ifconfig`? Also, I would make a current back up and check the file system. <comment301834> With `xattr /sbin/ifconfig` I have `com.apple.ResourceFork` and `com.apple.decmpfs`.  As you said, I did not expected either I have cleaned both and nothing changes unless date column.  How do you suggest to check de file system? `DiskUtil` maybe? This is the disk encryption fault (`file vault`)?
