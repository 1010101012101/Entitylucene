How do you select multiple specific files? <body> Say I've got 5 files, and I'd like to select just two of them. In Windows I would select file 1, then press kbdControl/kbd, and then click file 5.  How could this be done in Mac Os X?   <answer82781> You'll do the same thing by doing kbdCommand/kbd+Click.  <answer82789> Use emkbdcmd/kbd + click/em if you are using a Mac keyboard or use the emWindows-key + click/em if you are using a PC keyboard.
