Facetime help, I want to facetime with my friend, don't know if I can <body> I want to facetime with my friend from Hawaii, but I have an iPod and he has an iPhone, would it work? Without any problem?  <answer88193> It should work assuming you're both on Wifi (or the iPhone has a compatible cellular plan/provider), both are compatible models (iPhone 4/4S/5, iPod Touch 4th gen or later), and you are attempting to send a Facetime request to his correct account.  On your iPod Touch you would open either the Contacts or FaceTime app and tap on his name/email.  On his iPhone he would open either the Contacts or Phone app, find your contact entry and tap on the FaceTime button.  Hope that helps!  <comment103208> As written this is a trivial question based on guessing and opinion. The answer could be yes or no and we have no way of knowing if you need help learning how to set things up or if your devices even support FaceTime. If you have done some research and have a more detailed situation that you can't solve - feel free to edit that detail into this question and flag it for re-opening.
