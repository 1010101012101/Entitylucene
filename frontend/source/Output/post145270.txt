How do I forcibly shut down a specific application at a pre-determined time? <body> I don't know if there's an available app or perhaps a terminal command, but I'd like to forcibly shut down a specific application at a specific time, without the option to cancel.  I'd like it so I can choose the time.  To make a long story short, there's a game that's incredibly addicting and if I don't force quit it, I can totally see myself getting lost in it for extra hours.  I'd rather just have the application quit, regardless of where I am in the game, so I make sure to follow through on my allotted time period for playing.  There's something similar, but not entirely applicable here (The info here could help in forming an answer): How can I forcibly shut down my Mac at an appointed time?  <answer145274> You can quit apps with AppleScript, such as:  precodeosascript -e "tell application 'Safari' to quit" /code/pre  Therefore, you can add the following to your crontab (codeenv EDITOR=nano crontab -e/code) to quit an app without saving at 17:30 every day:  precode30 17 * * * /usr/bin/osascript -e "tell application 'Safari' to quit saving no" /code/pre  If you want to quit without saving, you can remove the codesaving no/code.br Alternatively, you can kill the process with code/usr/bin/killall Safari/code.  <comment171184> nice, what is missing is the "Force Quit" as per OP. <comment171186> @Buscar OP did not refer to the specific action of Force Quit and therefore I interpreted it as the equivalent of 'shutdown' for the answer to the linked question. Regardless, I've edited my answer to include a force quit. <comment171455> Thanks for the response !  So, lets say its 3:00 PM and I want the application to force quit, without saving, at 5:30 PM.  Then, I go into the AppleScript editor and type: env EDITOR=nano crontab -e  And press enter.  Then, type:  17 30 * * * /usr/bin/osascript -e "tell application 'App Store' to quit" saving no  Is that correct? Thanks again ! <comment171459> @Jacob I've edited my answer to clarify. `saving no` is part of AppleScript not osascript
