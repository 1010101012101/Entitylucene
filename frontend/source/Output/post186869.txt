Yosemite: ssh slow to connect when using DNS alias <body> Since updating to Yosemite, ssh from my Mac to a DNS alias takes about 7-8 seconds.  I've observed the following on multiple Macs running Yosemite. Assume I have a host name strongalpha/strong, and a DNS alias to it named strongaa/strong. The OS of the target doesn't matter.  1) ssh to an unqualified host name alias (CNAME record in DNS), e.g. emssh aa/em, takes about 7-8 seconds to connectbr 2) immediately repeating the same ssh command, emssh aa/em, connects in the "normal" amount of time (&lt; 1s)br 3) ssh to a fully qualified host name alias, e.g. emssh aa.example.com/em, connects in the normal amount of timebr 4) ssh to a regular host name (A record in DNS), e.g. emssh alpha.example.com/em, whether qualified or unqualified, connects in the normal amount of time.    When using emssh -vvv/em, the total delay is in one place:  precode$ ssh -vv aa OpenSSH_6.2p2, OSSLShim 0.9.8r 8 Dec 2011 debug1: Reading configuration data /etc/ssh_config debug1: /etc/ssh_config line 20: Applying options for * debug2: ssh_connect: needpriv 0     *delay of 7-8 seconds* debug1: Connecting to aa [10.10.1.2] port 22. debug1: Connection established. ... /code/pre  There is no difference in output between any of the 4 scenarios, except for the host name displayed.  This has happened on every release of Yosemite to the current version 10.10.3.  I have searched the web many times, and not found a single reference to this problem. Ideas?  <answer189169> I found a “fix” for this, though it still doesn't explain anything.  In our organization, we have “standard” DNS arranged hierarchically for different sites, just as you would expect. We emalso/em have an Active Directory structure that is largely flat. The resolv.conf (actually defined in Network Settings) had my local DNS domain listed as a search domain. I discovered quite by accident that adding the AD domain as a search domain fixes the problem!  So now I have something like:  precodesearch mysite.example.com ad.example.com /code/pre  Now ssh’ing to an unqualified alias takes no more time than any other form of the host name.  Really bizarre, and I have no idea why this fixes it.
