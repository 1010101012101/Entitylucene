Find app or songs purchased with another account <body> When I restore a backup to my iPhone or iPad I get asked to insert the password not only for my apple ID, but also for another account I own and for my sister's account (for which I don't know the password).   I assume that the reason is that in the backup there are applications or songs that have been bought with these other accounts. Is there a way of detecting what applications/songs are causing this problem and removing them from my device so that I will not have this problem again the next time I have to restore a backup?   <comment333760> I too have a similar issue, but in our case we keep getting interrupted on the iPad asking for the password. I've attempted to find out the account through iTunes on OS X, but it doesn't even show the apps. Using IOS 10.2, iTunes on OS X Sierra.
