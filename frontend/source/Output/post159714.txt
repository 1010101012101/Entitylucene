Is there a way to recover a word document password? <body> I have several password protected word docs that I have forgotten the password for. Is there a way to recover them? I am using Word 2011.  <answer159738> There is good software for this (not free though): http://elcomsoft.com/aopr.html You can also google for some online services in addition to what Tyson said.  <answer223589> Similar to Ranklord's answer, iSeePassword claims to be able to unlock these files and/or recover the password.br Beware that it is a commercial product, but it does have a "Free Trial".  <comment187688> would would be the purpose of a password if it can be recovered? <comment187697> While I agree with Buscar, you should google `recover word document password` and/or `recover word document password mac`.  There is more than one way to break that password.
