iTunes incorrently splitting the songs in an album. Metadata problem? <body> I have these albums and songs in my iTunes Library. They should appear grouped, but for some reason, iTunes splits them up and shows them as separate albums with the same name and details:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/b4g8r.png" alt="iTunes splits the songs on this album."  I check the metadata and everything seems to be in order. Here are screen shots of the first two songs:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MNjBq.png" alt="Metadata for song that&#39;s been separated."  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vG8xa.png" alt="Metadata for another song in the same album."  Why is iTunes doing this? Thanks for your help!  <answer41073> I've only ever seen this happen when the metadata absolutely differs in some way between tracks. There are two ideas that come to mind:  ol liHighlight each individual character and make sure 3 dots ( ... ) haven't been transformed into a single character elipses ( â€¦ ). Highlight each of the dots above and you should understand the difference./li liCheck the 'Sorting' section too and make sure all of that data is identical, notably in the 'Grouping' fields./li /ol  <answer41075> I would suggest selecting all four songs and doing the following:  ol liDelete metadata from the tracks: at least Grouping, Album, Artist, Sort Album, and Sort Artist, but more wouldn't hurt./li liSave the absence of the data by selecting "Done."/li liWhile they continue to be selected, Get Info again and fill in the relevant information./li /ol  I've found that no matter how much some fields may look identical, resetting them to be identical together often solves the problem.  <answer74207> For all the tracks, selecting "Part of a Compilation" - "Yes" solved this one for me (though it was not part of a compilation, it was the only way I could get it to cooperate).  This works, due to the way iTunes organizes compilations.  The likely problem is that some of the files incorrectly have a compilation tag in the metadata and iTunes is looking for the same tag in the rest of the files and - not finding it - is placing the files in separate albums.  Use a metadata editor to open up the files and clear the tag from the offending files and re-add them to your iTunes library and it should be all grouped under one album.  I tested this by adding a compilation tag to two files out of an album and importing to iTunes and did indeed get the files split into two separate albums.  Removing the tag fixed the problem and iTunes imported correctly.  <answer88097> I've had the same problem before, even with identical info, artwork, etc. What helped me was that I right clicked one of the songs of the identical albums and clicked "Create AAC Version." This created a double of that one song, and automatically grouped the two identical albums, and then I just deleted the AAC version.   <comment46523> I suffer from this problem too, it's intensely annoying.  I took out the comment about not showing a thumbnail as it's a completely different issue - the thumbnail will only show if there are sufficient tracks in an album to make sufficient vertical space to show one.  It's not the same thing.  However the pointless splitting is common, and I have usually fixed it by setting Album Artists, and then by sorting against the album artist column. <comment46524> Editing the Sorting fields for the whole group of songs worked for me! I hadn't bother before, cause they seemed to be correct at plain sight. I couldn't find any 3 dots/elipses discrepancies, though. Really strange! Thank you Jason.
