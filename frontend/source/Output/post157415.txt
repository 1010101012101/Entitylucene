After Yosemite 10.10.1, Time Machine will not recognize cifs://goflexhome.local <body> I cannot get my iMac to see goflexhome.local as a shared device in finder, so Time Machine will not offer it as a drive I can use to backup my machine. I can mount it and talk to it, even create folders and save to them in finder, through my wifi router using  AfP, SMB, and the IP address, but Seagate says it has to see "goflexhome.local" in order to work.. and apparently, cifs:// should be used as well. I think Apple stopped this functionality.  Spent hours with Apple and Seagate and neither one can understand why it won't show up as a backup drive.
