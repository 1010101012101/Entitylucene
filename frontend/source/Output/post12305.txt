Split a single page PDF into multiple pages <body> Is there an easy way (in Preview or whatever) to scale up and split a PDF file with a single page into multiple pages? What I would like is to split say an A3 paper document into two A4 pages, to print separately and then put together with tape.  How can I do such a thing in OS X?  <answer12309> Preview cannot do this unfortunately, but an $5 application called Tiler does this with ease.  http://www.mindcad.com/tiler.html  Hope this helps.  <answer12315> If you in Preview select the half of the A3 em(e.g. use the Inspector kbd⌘/kbd+kbdI/kbd so you get the exact size)/em - then choose Crop kbd⌘/kbd+kbdK/kbd, and print this "new" page e.g. as a PDF - after that you Undo the Crop with kbd⌘/kbd+kbdZ/kbd, and do the same with the other half of the A3.  <answer32137> After googling, I found that "Preview.app" and "Automator.app" can handle this job.  ol liOpen the pdf file in Preview.app/li liShow Thumbnail/li liSelect all pages/li liFrom Menu, choose "Tools" - "Select Tool"/li liSelect right side of a page to crop/li liFrom Menu, choose "Tools" - "Show Inspector" 7, On the "Inspector" window, choose "Crop and rotate inspector"/li liPush "Crop" button (in "Selected Pages" group)/li liFrom Menu, choose "File" - "Print", and choose "PDF" - "Save as PDF...", and save as "right.pdf"/li liDo same thing(4-7) for left side and save as "leftside.pdf" /li liStart Automator.app and make workflow with following actions. a. "Get Specified Finder Items" (choose "leftside.pdf" and "rightside.pdf") b. "Combine PDF Pages" c. "Move Finder Items"/li liRun the Automator workflow./li /ol  <answer121886> Adobe Reader can do this, too: It includes a Poster Print option in its custom print dialog.   It’s the first time I missed a feature from Preview (or the native OS X print dialog) that Adobe Reader has.   Adobe Reader is free (as in beer) software, it used to be called Acrobat Reader. (Do not confuse it with full-blown Acrobat or any other expensive Adobe product, which can probably do that, too.)  <answer214225> A small JAVA program called Briss will do exactly this job.  http://sourceforge.net/projects/briss/?source=typ_redirect  <answer235380> Briss is wonderful, exactly what we needed to divide each sheet from a pdf file into two parts. To create the selection for the second half of the page, draw a border on the uncovered portion of the first selection on the pdf page. To display sizes right click on the every selection, and select "Select / Deselect rectangle". Also, you can read the help :). Thanks!  <answer240195> See pdfposter (you can install it with macports):  http://kernel-panik.blogspot.fr/2011/09/printing-god-damin-a0-poster-as-set-of.html  <answer265484> If you have Illustrator you can simply create a document with several letter size artboards and place the PDF.  <answer270570> I have been searching for a free solution for this and I stumbled a java app called 'briss' which does what it promised perfectly.  http://briss.sourceforge.net  <answer272309> You print to PDF with the following setting: - change page setup to A4 size (if the original document was in A3) - then print..  for the other side of page, you need to rotate the original file and do the same as above..  <answer290549> Select option to print - Poster  This will split your page into your default page size(for letter size 8 x 11) you can select tile scale to zoom within this split page. You can also select overlap. You can select labels so you know which page goes where.  <comment13601> Good enough poor man solution. I like it. <comment13850> Thank you - this has answered my problem, too. I have a PDF in which the pages are somehow double-height A4, so to print normal size I have to split each page into two. I used your suggestion and cropped each page, printed, used undo and then cropped each one again the other way and printed again. Takes a little time but it's simple and easy, thank you again! <comment129938> It made the job perfectly! <comment142193> Amazing, indeed perhaps the easiest solution to get the desired result! <comment220691> At least on the last Preview.app, crop does not remove the remaining, but just hides it. So the Automator produces a pdf with repeated double pages <comment262996> Truly nice ! I used this to print Evernote Annotations. If you use Evernote and create annotations, when you attempt to print it, all the annotations tend to get printed in a 1X1 page scaled to ~ 1/50th the size (which means they are barely readable). The annotations could have spanned 100 pages, but they will all attempt to get printed in 1 page ! Using Adobe Poster Print option, I was able to split the annotation printing across multiple pages in normal readable format. Thanks! <comment342001> Downvoters should explain their reason for downvoting. Otherwise how can we know what they found wrong about this answer. <comment342280> Can you provide more precise step-by-step instructions? Pictures would be nice too. <comment369450> This is especially useful since you can save any image to PDF in the OS X print dialog.
