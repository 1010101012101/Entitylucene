VirtualBox: Mac OS host autostart guest OS when computer starts <body> Situation today:  ul liMac auto logs in admin user/li liVirtualBox starts at login/li liI have to select the guest OS/li liclick on Start (green arrow) in order to launch the guest OS/li /ul  What I would like is:  ul liMac auto logs in admin user/li liVirtualBox starts at login or not (if not necessary)/li liChosen (in advance) guest OS launches automatically in full screen mode/li /ul  I followed the instructions found on this web page, but it does not work. Perhaps because the versions of Mac OS X are not the same and/or VirtualBox versions are different.  Thanks in advance for any help.  Some technical data:  ul liMac OS version: El Capitan 10.11.6/li li8 GB RAM/li liVirtualBox version: 5.1.14 r112924 (Qt5.6.2)/li liVirtualBox 5.1.14 Oracle VM VirtualBox Extension Pack already applied/li /ul  <comment342155> How should a booting system detect if it's necessary to start a VirtualBox VM or not? If the necessity is a user decision I recommend to start your VM manually! A reliable direct brain-macOS interface still doesn't exist... <comment342163> BTW: the linked how-to works perfectly (10.11.6 & latest VBox). You have to use a proper osxusername and vmname though! My El Cap VM (preinstall) started headless. <comment342496> @klanomath thanks for your comments. However I encounter a few issues with the instructions. First one is that /Library/LaunchDaemons does not exist. Has it been replaced by /Library/LaunchAgents ? Or rather shall I create /Library/LaunchDaemons and then carry on? <comment342504> I tried again and you seem to be right @klanomath: when I launch VirtualBox it says that the OS is "Running" however it is nowhere to be seen. I have to launch VirtualBox and the click the green arrow (that now reads "Show" instead of "Start", and when I click mentioned button the guest OS appears. But that's a bit useless for me: I need the guest OS to show up. Any ideas on how to do that? <comment342512> /Library/LaunchDaemons exists for sure! That's an OS X standard folder. The folder /Users/your_username/Library/LaunchDaemons doesn't exist though and it (this folder) wouldn't work. I have to test the non-headless launch myself first. The plist probably has to be moved to /Users/your_username/Library/LaunchAgents. <comment342513> @klanomath, yes you're probably right. I must have confused the folder with the one in the /User/â€¦  Ok, perhaps you'll let me know how this works in a non-headless mode (not sure what the headless mode is for anyway).  Anyway, thanks for your comments. <comment342515> headless mode is intended for non-GUI systems or physical systems without monitor, but may also be used for GUI-systems. A good example is docker.
