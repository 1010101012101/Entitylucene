Remote access to a time capsule in Yosemite <body> Just bought the time capsule: http://store.apple.com/us/product/ME177LL/A/airport-time-capsule-2tb  It's working as a main router (DHCP, NAT)  ol liI have turned on "Back to my Mac" option with file sharing./li liI have added my apple ID via AirportUtility to a Time Capsule./li liI have turned on "Share disks over WAN"./li /ol  Now if i go to the Finder i can see my time capsule but it's being stuck with the following text - "Connecting"  From my local home network i can access my time capsule without any issues.
