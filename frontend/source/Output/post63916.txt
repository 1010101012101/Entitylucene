Does the iPhone 5 support simultaneous voice and data on CDMA <body>    strongPossible Duplicate:/strongbr   Will the Verizon iPhone 5 be capable of accessing cellular data while on an active phone call?       I asked this question for the iPhone 4S. Now that the iPhone 5 is announced, will it do simultaneous voice and data on CDMA (not data on WiFi)?  <comment73940> Unsure, so I don't want to make this an answer, but I think the limitation is in the CDMA protocol - my BlackBerry terminates Data when a voice call comes. I think it can **not** do simultaneous voice/data due to CDMA. <comment73958> @Rich Homolka, As mentioned by Jannemans' answer to the previous question, the CDMA x standard does allow this now. I don't know if any phones support this, however. <comment73997> http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/63938/115 <comment74067> Was asked before 63938. That is a duplicate of this.
