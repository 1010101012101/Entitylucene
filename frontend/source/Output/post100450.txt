Download Xcode with developer account and then change account <body> I have a developer account now, and I can download Xcode 5. But soon I won't need this account anymore, and I may get a emnew/em (organization type) account. My question is, will I be able to use my new organization account to write programs with Xcode 5 I downloaded previously? And also submit possibly with this new account? Thanks.  <answer100452> h1Yes./h1  If you submit the app to the App Store using your first account, then you can use iTunes Connect App Transfer to transfer it to a new account.  If you work on the app emwithout/em submitting it to the App Store, you can change account and there will be no problems (you will have to change the App ID &amp; provisioning profiles if you obtained these with the old account).  hr  strongA downloaded copy of Xcode is not linked to an account/strong, so you can use Xcode with any account, or no account.  The limitations come with the documentation - pre-release documentation will not be available in Xcode if you don't link an account, however Xcode will still work fine without the documentation. Once you add a new account, the documentation will download and be accessible. Documentation downloaded with your current developer account will not need to be re-downloaded if you switch account.  <comment118234> grgarside, thanks, I just means something slightly different, I will explain what now. Say I have developer account X now. I download Xcode 5 and start working on some application now (I am not sure if I must supply my account name). Then afterwards, I **change** developer account. Will I be able to continue working on this same application with the new account? Thanks. <comment118238> yes, so the idea is I will have Xcode 5 with some developer account  (say X) that I won't need in future. So my question is basically should I start working on my new application now, with **this old (X)** account? (with the possibility to change it later to new account. I won't submit the app with the old account). <comment118239> @user2568508 Yes, you can. When I was developing my first iOS app, I developed with a free account, then when the time came to submit to the App Store, I purchased a developer account and updated my bundle identifier, and everything worked fine. <comment118240> I see, thanks   .
