Found iclouddnsbypass.com pop-up when connected to personal hotspot <body> Today I'm trying to connect to my personal hotspot but a iclouddnsbypass.com pop-up appeared, the device is connected to WiFi but no internet connection.  My question is what is iclouddnsbypass.com and how it can be appeared on my mac even though I never install their apps. Could be someone trying to gain access to my WiFi using this tool?  Found similar situation https://discussions.apple.com/thread/7694703 but no answers.  <comment331755> Your personal hotspot is your own or from somebody else? <comment331759> It was my personal hotspot. It always on and never power it off even I'm not at home. <comment331761> it has something todo with your DNS settings. Try to reset your hotspot.. They don't have apps. They want you to edit DNS settings on your phone.
