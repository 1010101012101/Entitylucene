Can I change the default trash sounds? <body> I'd love to change the default empty trash / move to trash sounds. I found this on Github, which is a script to change a bunch of defaults. The default alert is mentioned, but nothing about the trash.    Alternately, this other AskDifferent question discusses how to add a custom alert sound. Does anyone know the path to where the trash sounds are stored? Could I just replace the sound file as in the linked SO thread?  <answer146932> You would need to change code*.aif/code sounds in:  precode /System/Library/Components/CoreAudio.component/Contents/SharedSupport/SystemSounds/finder /code/pre  There are: codeempty trash.aif/code and codemove to trash.aif/code (self explanatory). I recomend to make backup of those files before swap.
