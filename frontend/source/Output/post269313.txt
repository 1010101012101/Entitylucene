Automator stopped working automatically <body> I have an Automator task that is set to move all files to the trash when new files are added to the specified folder like this:    The type of document is strongFolder Action/strong so when I add a folder it should do the task, then I choose my specified folder called strongCustomerAppDebug/strong.  I do the action strongGet Specified Finder Items/strong, choose the same folder then I selected strongGet Folder Contents/strong (as well as strongRepeat for each subfolder found/strong) and then the last one is strongMove Finder Items to Trash/strong.   This was working automatically but then stopped when I was trying to make additional changes.  I have tried it as an application and a workflow but neither worked.  Where am I going wrong. This is working manually, so its not a problem with the tasks.
