How can you access Apple Mail from Apple script? <body> I want to archive old emails ( say, older then 7 days ) from my inbox  automatically with an applescript scheduled via cron.  To be honest, I am open to other Apple-friendly languages such as Swift or Coco , though the learning curve might be prohibitive for me.   Ideas, Examples, and links relevant to the topic are welcome.  <answer225797> To start with, you can try this Applescript:   precodeset interval to 7 set target to (current date) - interval set oldCount to 0 tell application "Mail"     set box to mailbox named "INBOX" of account named "Your_mailbox_here"     set maxMessages to count of messages in box     repeat with index from 1 to maxMessages         set currentMessage to message index in box         set msgDate to date received of currentMessage         if msgDate is greater than target then             set oldCount to oldCount + 1             # do something here         end if     end repeat end tell /code/pre  Enter the above script in Script Editor, play with it till it does what you want, then save it as a script file (.scpt). run it with osascript(1).  Look at Applescript Resources and the Applescript Language Guide for more useful info. Also look at the scripting dictionary of Mail.app using the "Open Dictionary..." command in Script Editor to see what sort of things you can script in mail.  <comment272683> Welcome to Ask Different.
