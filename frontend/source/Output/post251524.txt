2013 rMBP 650M: Installed Bootcamp, Windows 10, Nvidia 650M driver, Now black screen permanently <body> I installed W10 via Boot Camp and then (foolishly?) tried to install Nvidia's 650M driver. I gamed with it for a while, but as soon as I unplugged my power connector the screen went black and now the display will not turn on again.  strongPromising things/strong I can hear the 'waaaaaaa' sound when it starts, the cap locks key will light up if I wait a few seconds. The fans all turn on and it seems like it's trying to do something but nothing ever comes on the Display. The apple logo is dark at all times (seems like the LED back light won't turn on).  strongWhat I've tried/strong  ul liresetting the SMC/li liresetting the VRAM/li lipowering the system down for a while and then doing shift + power button/li liconnecting to an external display (didn't see anything)/li /ul  Does anyone know how to debug this? There's a week and a day wait to see the people at the apple store (also, I find that they always want to replace the motherboard...).
