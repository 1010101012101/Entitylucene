Archiving/Zipping Software <body> What compression application would allow you to also encrypt a file?  <answer193428> The only free (albeit not open source) Mac OS GUI compression utility I'm aware of is B1. It does support password protecting archives, although not encrypting them.  Two commercial applications that do support encrypted archives are:  ul liWinzip/li liStuffIt/li /ul  That said, if you're happy using the command line, the zip utility provided with Mac OS can do password-based encryption (look at the code-P/code option).  <comment230556> That's off-topic there. <comment230558> Please clarify what "best" means to you here. <comment230560> Great thanks! I will check out stuff it, and the command line option. <comment230565> I see the zip command and also tar command. How can you encrypt using tar? <comment230566> `tar` doesn't support password protection/encryption out of the box. You'd need to use additional software to provide that functionality - for example, GnuPG. You create the tar file and then use GnuPG to encrypt - this can be done for any file really, including ZIP files. <comment230568> I think editing the question to remove the subject aspects could still make it useful. Something like "What compression application would allow you to..."
