Not sure if I have a problem on my Fusion iMac <body> Decided to put a partition on my new 21.5 Fuasion iMac to install a Beta. Somewhere along the way we had a power blip, the lights flashed and the computer went off. I rebooted and the iMac started without problem, went to Disk Utility to see if i had a partition and I seem to have lost nearly 200gb on my volume disk from the Fusion drive of 1.03tb. I can create a partion still on the volume disk but I'm curious to know where my nearly 200gb has gone. Is this normal or did something happen when I lost power and how do I get my 200gb babk if indeed it is lost.  <comment372076> Welcome to Ask Different.
