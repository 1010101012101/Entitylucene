Mac OS X El Capitan BootCamp doesn't target Windows 10 ISO <body> I was trying to install Windows 10 besides my Mac OS X El Capitan.  I followed the normal steps I found on the Internet, but when I started to apply I got this and no idea what I should do in order to install Windows.  After I click continue, I choose which USB to save the downloaded file on, and then nothing changed; I still can't finish the process of pointing to an ISO image of Windows 10 that I want to install.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nJU42.png" alt="Problem "  Note: my MacBook Pro is manufactured I think in 2010/2011. It's a Core i5, 4GB RAM.  Windows 7 was installed on it besides my El Capitan OS X a month ago, and BootCamp was deleted by my son.  <answer286594> Unfortunately your particular Mac does not seem to support Windows 10. You can check the link here to verify. The last supported version of Windows on your Mac is 8.1.  Some people have had success installing 8.1 and then upgrading to 10, but you will not get Apple supported drivers and installation might be problematic. Unless you have particular reasons for strongneeding/strong Windows 10 you may want to stick with Windows 7.  <comment361633> He should be able to install Win7/8/8.1 then *upgrade* to Win10.  However a clean Win10 is out of the question. <comment361634> I'm not a Bootcamp fan.  Personally, I would max out your RAM (8GB for 2010 and 16GB for 2011) install an SSD and run [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) and install Win10 there.  If you haven't put in an SSD, I would do that too.  See this [answer](https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/229377/119271) for specifics <comment361668> Many thanks to you, Steve my problem that it(BootCamp) doesn't let me to point to the Windows ISO Image in the first place <comment361739> Is the Windows ISO WIndows 10? If so that is the problem. Try pointing it to a Windows 7 or 8/8.1 ISO.
