Apple Thunderbolt Ethernet slow speed (macOS Sierra) <body> I've just noticed that my network speed when copying data to NAS is only around ~ strong13 MB/s/strong (iStat Menus) and ~ 15 MB/s in Activity Monitor  I have strongGbit router/strong, the NAS has also Gbit and the strongThunderbolt Ethernet/strong is also Gbit   I tried to copy some files to the NAS from other computer using same cable and settings and it was around ~ 45 MB/s, so this is a problem of the Thunderbolt or the macOS.  I'm currently running strongGM release of macOS Sierra/strong (but this happened on public betas as well)  The interface shows this   codemedia: autoselect (1000baseT &lt;full-duplex,flow-control,energy-efficient-ethernet&gt;)/code  I tried manually change it to codefull-duplex/code only, but with no change.   I'm using the iStats Menu for   Is possible that the OS is limiting the bandwidth, do you have any idea how to find out what's actually the problem. I'm thinking about buying another thunderbolt ethernet, but I'm not sure if it's causing the slowdown.   Any advice?  <comment314281> Have you tried disabling wifi when performing a transfer? Sometimes, is wifi is prioritised, even with TB Ethernet, connections still go through wifi. <comment314339> Hi, yes, I had WiFi disabled and also even when it was on I saw in istats that traffic went through the ethernet. But still keeps at 13 MB/s limit for some reason. <comment314511> If you have one or more TB Ethernet adapters, try swapping them out for different ports. Alternatively check Activity Monitor for processors that might be consuming bandwidth like a time machine backup. <comment314516> I'm on macOS Sierra too and my TBe runs quite stable at 125 MB/s. Network speeds are dependent on the receiving computer (your NAS) as well. Has your NAS recently got a firmware update or is the CPU/network bandwidth being consumed by another process? <comment314656> Thanks for you reply, from other computer (Windows 10 machine) on my network using the same cable it copied at 45 MB/s speed. I tried both thunderbolt ports, result is same. There is no other significant network activity in Activity Monitor, so I guess it's the hardware issue, I'll try to get a new one tomorrow and test it with it. <comment314827> So today I tried another new thunderbolt ethernet and that's not the issue. So it's the software or thunderbolt ports. <comment314929> Perhaps other troubleshooting methods such as switching cables/Ethernet ports on the back of your router or switching your Mac's position with that of your Windows 10 machine might shed some light on the issue.
