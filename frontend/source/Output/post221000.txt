Decrypt an external hardrive FileVault <body> Recently, I had an accident with my Macbook Pro. I dropped water on it and the motherboard is now dead, which means my Macbook Pro is also dead. Hopefully, the hard drive isn't damaged. When I plugged the hard drive of my Macbook Pro into another computer (a Windows PC) with a USB, I realized that it couldn't be opened because my hard drive was encrypted with FileVault 2 (Core Storage). I now have several questions.  ol liCan I decrypt the external hard drive FileVault directly on a Windows PC ? I found some programs like Passware Kit Forensic which claims they can do it ! Is there any other program?/li liIf I plug the external hard drive into another Mac with a USB, can I decrypt the FileVault directly on it so I can open it later on a Windows PC? I have some friends with a Mac, but I want to be sure I can disable FileVault on their Mac before asking them!/li /ol  <answer221005> There is no need to strongdecrypt/strong the FileVault password with a 3rd-party tool like emPassware Kit Forensic/em. You just have to strongunlock/strong it with the hopefully known password/passphrase.  You may either:  ul liPlug the external case containing the hard drive into another Mac and try to boot from it. Then revert the encryption in System Preferences  Security./li liPlug the external case containing the hard drive into another Mac and try to revert the encryption by entering the following Terminal commands:  precodediskutil corestorage list diskutil cs unlockVolume lvUUID #UUID of the encrypted logical volume diskutil cs revert lvUUID #UUID of the encrypted logical volume /code/pre  Consider that the Mac may also have a CoreStorage Volume Group./li /ul  Requirements:  The Mac has to be bootable with the "FileVaulted" system (i.e you can't use a PowerBook or an old iMac).  If you want to further process the data of the now decrypted drive with a PC, you have to install a software/driver in Windows capable of at least reading HFS+ volumes.  <comment267575> If you specify your and your friends' Macs and the installed OS Xs I specify my answer.
