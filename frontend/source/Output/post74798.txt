How to invoke navigation on Google maps using Siri? <body> At the risk of getting a big NO,   Is there a way to use SIRI to invoke navigation on Google maps as opposed to the default Apple maps?   I have tried "Navigate to Chicago using Google maps", but Siri just treated "Chicago using Google maps" as the location itself.   <answer74799> Unfortunately, 3rd party Siri integration is something that hasn't been available to developers (yet). For example, it would be really nice to say, "Start a running activity with RunKeeper," and have it start a running activity.  The closest thing to this is to simply say "Open Google Maps." I know it may seem a little lacking, but that is all we get right now.  <answer75198> Here is the closest and best bet I happened to find on Google:   Append "via transit" to the end of the voice command and Siri brings up a bunch of transport apps. You can click route on Google Maps and you should be on your way.   http://jailbreak-untethered.com/how-to-use-siri-and-google-maps-for-directions-without-jailbreaking-video/  Pretty Slick!!!  <answer75200> I believe it strongis/strong possible to invoke Google maps using Siri if you're running iOS 5 on your iPhone 4S. Sadly, one can't easily downgrade, so if you're already using iOS 6, you're out of luck for now.  <answer75284> h2Yes you can/h2  Simply append "via transit" to your Siri query. Ie: Directions to Miami Beach, Florida via Transit.  Siri will determine your target location, and will give you a choice of transit apps. Tap Google Maps and you'll be on your way.  It appears these words also work:  ul liby transit/li liusing transit/li livia transit /li /ul  <answer169976> Update: if you're using iOS 8 you can now just tell siri " driving directions to,,, using Google maps". Works most of time.  <comment86908> Ha Thanks! Guess I just needed to hear a NO. Anyways here is something I found on Google.   http://www.macstories.net/tutorials/open-google-maps-directions-with-siri-or-launch-center-pro/  Well its not really what I was looking for but just thought it relavant to the thread. <comment86910> Pretty neat. Looks very creative. I am really hoping Apple releases an API for Siri soon. I know there is a lot to it, but I also know developers would use it. <comment86916> I wouldn't expect an API for quite some time. There of course is a private API - but the best [analysis on why it won't be open any time soon comes from Kontra](http://counternotions.com/2012/11/12/siri-future/). <comment86918> Thanks for sharing the article - good read. <comment87540> Ooh - good edge case - some might still be on iOS 5. <comment87541> I've revived an old iPhone running iOS 5, but it's not a 4S so no Siri. <comment87542> However, this is tagged iPhone-5, so... <comment87550> Information needed to answer a question should be contained in the question, not in tags. Tags are for filtering. Period. <comment88096> Yes. This works very well! <comment102569> I created a 3rd party app ("Drive Mode") that supports this without needing Siri (no need to jailbreak).
