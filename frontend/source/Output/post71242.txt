Can I partition an iPod (nano, classic, shuffle) for use as a flash drive? <body> I have made an iPod nano appear as a flash drive by going to iTunes and checking "Enable disk use." However, I am short of a large enough USB key to hold a bootable Windows 8 installer for use by Boot Camp. Because Boot Camp needs to wipe the drive used, can I create a partition in Disk Utility of the iPod and install to that?   Does iPod still work after  creating a new partition for use as a flash disk?  <answer71294> It can be done, but truthfully i would just spend the $15 on an 8gb USB drive.   Anyway, one way of doing it:  ul liReboot ipod by pressing menu and center button for 5 secs./li liBefore apple logo appears (ie: do it fast) press play/pause and center for 2 secs/li lia green checkmark should appear on the screen. It is now in flash disk mode. Connect it to the mac /li liGo to disk utility and format it for Fat-32 (or ntfs) /li liUse it to install windows./li liafter you are done, start up itunes and Restore it. /li /ul  OBVIOUSLY you will lose everything in the ipod. So after restore copy all the music back.  You might be able to skip the first 3 steps and format it straight away, depending on your h/w version it might work, so check that first.   <comment82786> Yeah, I have a flash drive. Installing now, but out of curiosity, I wanted to know if this could be done with only a partition of iPod. Thanks, though! <comment82911> No problem :) how did the installation go?
