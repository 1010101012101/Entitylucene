MacBook Pro OSX 10.6.8 - iPhone SE <body> I just bought an iPhone SE and I want to synchronize it with my iTunes library but when I connect the iPhone to my Mac I get a message saying that the iPhone can't be used because it requires a later iTunes version. I have iTunes 11.4 and when I check for updates it says it is the latest. I have O.S. 10.6.8 and would like strongnot/strong to upgrade to the next generation as some programs are not compatible any more. Do I have an option? Thank you  <answer249442> If you really want to sync your iTunes library, you emwill/em have to update it. If you still don't want to do that, you can either borrow a friends' computer or just go to an Apple Store directly and let them do it for you.  <answer249443> According to the Apple Support Site:     The SE requires iTunes 12.3.3 and in order to get it you will have to   update OS X to El Capitan. This is how Apple designed it for better or   worse, sorry.   Your iTunes IS in fact the latest version on THAT OS but not the latest overall.  <comment309401> I meant OSX 10.6.5 and NOT 10.6.8 !! <comment309403> The reason I am postponing upgrading to El Capitan or later is because Filemaker 7 is incompatible with that OS. Is it possible to transfer data from FM 7 to a later version compatible with the later OS? <comment309415> According to [this](http://help.filemaker.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/10571/~/converting-older-filemaker-pro-files-to-the-.fmp12-file-format), it should be no problem.    If your current version of FileMaker Pro is 15, 14, 13, 12 (.fmp 12), or FileMaker Pro 11, 10, 9, 8 or 7 (.fp7), files will convert directly to FileMaker Pro (.fmp12) and there is no additional conversion necessary. <comment309418> The version I use of Filemaker Pro is 7.(0v3) and in (help.filemaker.com) only 7.(fp7) is mentioned. Is this relevant? <comment309420> as far as I can tell, "fp7" is just the format of the files, whereas 7.0v3 is apparently the version of the programm you're using â€” I don't use File Maker but it would make sense that all files created with Version 7 use the format "fp7". <comment309430> so you should edit the question and not add a comment + why not upgrade to 10,6.8 <comment309431> Simple answer is you need a newer iTunes which only runs on a  newer OS.
