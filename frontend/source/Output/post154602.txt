Prevent Open/Save dialog from solliciting external hard drives <body> I have several external drives, which I don't use constantly, and so they spin down, and rest.  Unfortunately for me, every time I have the "Open..." or "Save..." dialogs, Mac OS X spins these hard drives back up, even if the currently displayed folder does not belong to those drives, and even though nothing of those drives appears anywhere (no treeview on the side, no folder from those drives in the sidebar). I don't have Spotlight enabled.  Obviously a solution would be to disconnect/reconnect those drives, but that is something I would like to avoid.  Is there a way to tell Mac OS X not to eagerly/preemptively fire up the drives?  <comment181891> If there is, that would be awesome. Waiting for the Open/Save sheets to come up while my five externals spin up is seriously annoying.
