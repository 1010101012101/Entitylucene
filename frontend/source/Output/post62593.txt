Startup Items keep getting reset after a period of time? <body> On my MacBook running OS X Lion 10.7.4, after a few days the startup items automatically get removed. I find this really annoying, as then I have to add them all back again.  What are the possible causes of this?  <comment72315> WHere did you put the Startup Items? <comment72384> @Mark just in the login items panel in system preferences.
