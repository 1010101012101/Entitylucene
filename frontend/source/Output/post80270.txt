Shutting down 2009 MBP with new install of 10.7.5, results in MBP restarting? <body> Can anyone help me with a problem I've just encountered with a 2009 MBP, I've just installed a new 500gb hard drive in the MBP and then cloned a clean install of os x 10.7 on to the new drive.  I then updated the 10.7 to 10.7.5, and have just realised that when I shut the MBP down the machine just restarts.  Any solutions anyone?  <answer80273> Based off the replies in the comments, this is what I suggest doing:  In terminal, type the following command:     cd /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/      sudo rm com.apple.PowerManagement.plist      sudo rm com.apple.AutoWake.plist   (Do the "rm" commands separately). Note: com.apple.AutoWake.plist might not exist. Then, shut down your mac, if it re-starts, just shut it down again and emhopefully/em everything will be ok.   I hope this works.   Source Details
