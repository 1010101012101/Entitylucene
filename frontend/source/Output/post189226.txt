How do I find the root cause of launchd crashing? <body> strongUPDATED/strong:  Added crash log.  It's not clear (to me) why launchd is dying:  precodeAnonymous UUID:       B3C59CC3-5B1B-3BDD-F35F-BB6973D6679B  Thu Jul 30 07:55:30 2015  *** Panic Report *** panic(cpu 0 caller 0xffffff800afc1eae): "launchd died\nState at Last Exception:\n\n"@/SourceCache/xnu/xnu-2782.30.5/bsd/kern/kern_exit.c:363  uuid info:  0x7fff6fae1000 uuid = &lt;72a99d0f-0b56-3938-abc5-67a0f33757c4&gt;  0x104496000    uuid = &lt;099ddb51-875f-39f0-a880-93b7128e4687&gt;  0x1044ea000    uuid = &lt;4396b358-725e-3ec0-bcbb-e4bf75fe1fb0&gt;  RAX: 0x0000000002000001, RBX: 0x0000000000000006, RCX: 0x00000001056800e8, RDX: 0x0000000000000000 RSP: 0x00000001056800e8, RBP: 0x0000000105680190, RSI: 0x000000010567ff40, RDI: 0x0000000000000001 R8:  0x0000000000000000, R9:  0x00000001044d59f0, R10: 0x00007fff90d99b02, R11: 0x0000000000000206 R12: 0x0000000000000000, R13: 0x00007fff8ced77e0, R14: 0x00000001056805d0, R15: 0x0000000105680790 RFL: 0x0000000000000206, RIP: 0x00007fff90d9795a, CS:  0x0000000000000007, SS:  0x0000000000000023  Thread  0xffffff8028daf5c0     0x00007fff8fa33f4b     0x00007fff8fa34068     0x00007fff8fa2d554     0x00007fff8ce86a6c     0x00000001044c48f7     0x00007fff89b35c13     0x00007fff89b3888f     0x00007fff89b46fe4     0x00007fff94fdc637     0x00007fff94fda40d     0x0000000000000000  Thread  0xffffff8028dae2e0     0x00007fff89b38a6a     0x0000000000000000  Thread  0xffffff8028dd2e28     0x00000001044adc81     0x00007fff89b35c13     0x00007fff89b39365     0x00007fff89b3aecc     0x00007fff89b386b7     0x00007fff89b46fe4     0x00007fff94fdc637     0x00007fff94fda40d     0x0000000000000000  Thread  0xffffff8029033e28     0x00007fff89b463ad     0x0000000000000000  Thread  0xffffff8029f794b8     0x00007fff89b4087e     0x00007fff89b3962b     0x00007fff89b39154     0x00007fff89b3aecc     0x00007fff89b386b7     0x00007fff89b38453     0x00007fff94fdc268     0x00007fff94fdc1e5     0x00007fff94fda41d     0x0000000000000000  Thread  0xffffff80307a8e28     0x00007fff86e95f1a     0x0000000000000000     0x00007fff6faed455     0x00007fff919367b5     0x00007fff8fa027e8     0x00007fff8ced77e0     0x00007fff8ced9ddf     0x00007fff89b35c13     0x00007fff89b36e5e     0x00007fff8ced80a7     0x00000001044c1383     0x00007fff89b35c13     0x00007fff89b39365     0x00007fff89b3aecc     0x00007fff89b39154     0x00007fff89b3aecc     0x00007fff89b386b7     0x00007fff89b46fe4     0x00007fff94fdc637     0x00007fff94fda40d     0x0000000000000000  Thread  0xffffff802ba6c2e0     0x00007fff94fda40d     0x0000000000000000  Thread  0xffffff802eb442e0     0x00007fff94fda40d     0x0000000000000000  Thread  0xffffff802ef214b8     0x00007fff94fda40d     0x0000000000000000  Thread  0xffffff802ad69798     0x00007fff94fda40d     0x0000000000000000  Mac OS version: 14E46 Kernel version: Darwin Kernel Version 14.4.0: Thu May 28 11:35:04 PDT 2015; root:xnu-2782.30.5~1/RELEASE_X86_64 Kernel UUID: E3C26B2F-8B97-3F1D-B193-690F7E34F830 System model name: Macmini6,2 (Mac-F65AE981FFA204ED) /code/pre  I've got Mavericks running on a headless Mac Mini that I remote into via ARD.  It does not have an monitor attached.  At seemingly random intervals, I will no longer be able to connect via ARD (I can't ping or ssh either) and after rebooting and searching the logs and crash reports I see that launchd died.  Sometimes it can be several times per week.  Sometimes it won't happen for months.  I've cleared out my code/Library/StartupItems/code, code/Library/LaunchDaemons/code, code/Library/LaunchAgents/code, and code~/Library/LaunchAgents/code directories disabling the items w/ codelaunchctl unload -w/code but every so often, it will still happen.  Oracle's Java updater was one, nasty culprit and removing/disabling that one made the system stable for a long time but now it's happening again and driving me nuts.  Anyone have any other clues as to what might be going on or what else I might look at?  <answer198158> Start by increasing the log level of launchd. Maybe the logs can tell you more about what happens right before launchd crashes.  precodesudo launchctl log level info /code/pre  The available log levels are: debug, info, notice, warning, error, critical, alert and emergency. I believe the default level is error.  <comment224333> Can you post a crash report? <comment237035> Sorry this took so long.  I had to wait for it to crash again to get a log.  I've updated the question with the most recent crash.  Nothing is jumping out at me.  Is there a way to dereference the UUID's to discover the application or process responsible? <comment237180> So you can't set the log level in Yosemite via that command because the `log` option is not available:  http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/169404/set-launchd-log-level  Nor do I have the DEVELOPER variant so I can't use examine.  I've subscribed to the launchd mailing list.  Let's see where that leads.
