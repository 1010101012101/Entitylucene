Yosemite won't boot in safe mode with Shift held down <body> I'm investigating some slowness with my late '13 rMBP which I upgraded to Yosemite on Sunday. Problem is, I can't boot into safe mode by holding the Shift when restarting or powering up.  I tried everything: Pressing and holding it right after I power up, right after I hear the chime, after restarting, after total shut down. Just doesn't work.  Should I be worried?  <answer152627> Ok, I managed to boot to Safe mode using this:      Access the command line by either opening Terminal remotely, or by logging into the computer using SSH.      Use the following Terminal command:      sudo nvram boot-args="-x"      If you want to start in Verbose mode as well, use sudo nvram boot-args="-x -v" instead.      After using Safe Mode, use this Terminal command to return to a normal startup:      sudo nvram boot-args=""   Yosemite is looking more worrisome by the hour though.  <answer177373> It's probably due your firmware password. It prevents Mac from booting using options keys.
