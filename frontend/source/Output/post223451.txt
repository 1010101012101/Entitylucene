bootcamp - stuck at "Partitioning Disk" <body> I tried to quit bootcamp, open recovery mode then verify &amp; repair disk and both run smoothly without any problem.  But when I run bootcamp, the process always stuck at this same point img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3AniF.png" alt="Always stuck at this point"  I have waited for 1 hour. Check Activity Monitor and there is no any activity in disk, R/W is 0.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gqyMa.png" alt="enter image description here"
