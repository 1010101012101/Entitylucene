Applications Folder on Macintosh HD Shows Empty <body> Before attempting to migrate data from my Time Machine, I looked in to see if my Adobe applications and others were there to transfer.  The folder is empty.  Is this normal?  Thanks.  <answer196463> There are two codeApplication/code folders. One is under the root directory and should contain all of your Applications. This is code/Applications/code  The other folder is in the User directory, so code~/Applications/code. code~//code is a shorthand for code/Users/&lt;UserName&gt;/code. That folder is usually empty or has one or two stray Apps in there.  <comment234667> Is this the `/Applications` folder in your _user account_, or the  `Macintosh HD/Applications folder`? <comment234692> Also, is this the empty folder in the Macintosh HD volume, or on the TM backup volume?
