How to Stop Showing OS X Beta Software Updates in iOS <body> I would like to stop installing beta versions on my iPhone. Without rolling back to an old version (as described by Apple) but something similar to http://osxdaily.com/2014/12/05/stop-os-x-beta-software-updates-showing-app-store/  In this particular case I would like to wait for iOS 9 and do not try the 9.1 beta.  <answer205215> You can simply hide those beta updates notifications through Apple's developers console.  Also if your iPhone is currently on a beta version you may not be able to hide them unless you upgrade via iTunes to a public release of iOS ( i.e. IOS 9 GM ).  <answer254974> This should do it (it did for me) https://beta.apple.com/sp/betaprogram/unenroll#ios Restart your iPhone and Bata Update is gone  <comment247464> I am using a public beta so the developers console is most likely not an option. If I install the final iOS 9 with iTunes will it remove the beta profile on the phone? (i.e. hide the next beta updates)? <comment247600> @Matteo Yes, doing so *should* do it & you won't be notified again about next beta releases. <comment317520> Welcome to Ask Different!
