Execute simple script <body> I wrote the following very simple script:     route -n add 192.168.0.0/20 192.168.224.1br   route -n delete 0.0.0.0br   route -n add 0.0.0.0 172.20.10.1   And would like to just double click it and you know... run it... on windows 8 i would just have to save as a code.bat/code and right click it- run as admin... How can i achieve similar behavior in mac osx (latest version)?  Extra points if i can just double click it (cut the run under elevated mode)  <answer139197> strongInstead of .bat, save it as code.command/code./strong  A .command file will run the contents of the file in Terminal upon double-click, just like a .bat would do on Windows.  If you can't run the file because you don't have permission to execute the command file, you need to set 'execute' on the file for it to allow you to run it:  precodechmod u+x /path/to/file.command /code/pre  supcodeu/code is the owner of the file, code+x/code adds 'execute', so codeu+x/code gives the owner of the file the ability to execute it/sup  And to the the commands as admin, OS X always requires you to put in the admin password. For your script, the easiest way to do this, is to run the script as an admin user and change the script to the following:  precodesudo route -n add 192.168.0.0/20 192.168.224.1 sudo route -n delete 0.0.0.0 sudo route -n add 0.0.0.0 172.20.10.1 /code/pre  supcodesudo/code stands for Substitute User DO and runs as root by default. It is likely codesudo/code will ask for your password./sup  <comment164156> Almost there! permission issue blocking now! any ideas? and yes i'm in the admin group <comment164157> @Leonardo Make sure you have permission to execute; see [this question](http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/113974) <comment164160> The permission problems are likely on the `route` command -- it needs sudo permissions to run. Try prefixing each line with `sudo -A` to get an interactive prompt for your password. <comment164163> @ian-c, when I do a $ `sudo -A date` it returns: `sudo: no askpass program specified, try setting SUDO_ASKPASS` <comment164166> Drop the `-A` then -- I thought OS X had a built-in asker application.
