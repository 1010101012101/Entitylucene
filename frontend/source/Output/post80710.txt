How can I sort by phone number type or length in Contacts in OS X? <body> I use Contacts on my work Mac to manage my phone numbers. I want the internal phone extension to display first. This is currently stored as one of three "work" phone numbers for most of my contacts.   Is there some way to make Contacts display phone numbers in a certain order? Can phone numbers be sorted by length (the internal is 4 digits, the others are 10)?  <comment125334> Yeah, it's crazy. If I delete and then re-add the old number back at the end - it reappears at the top :(
