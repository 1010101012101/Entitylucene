Outlook 2011 Keyboard Shortcut for going to Inbox <body> Is there a keyboard shortcut in Outlook for Mac 2011 that allows me to jump back to the main emInbox/em folder? Under my Inbox, I have a long list of folders that spans more than a full screen. If I'm at one of the folders close to the bottom of the list, let's say emSent Items/em and want to quickly go back to the emInbox/em folder, I have to use the mouse to scroll up in the folder list and then click on emInbox/em.  Is there a way to go there faster? I remember there being a shortcut for this on Windows if I'm not mistaken.  <answer54009> I dont think there is any shortcut available for it. But still here is a list of shortcuts for your reference.  <answer82102> I wrote a little AppleScript to do this. If you copy it to your "~/Library/Application Support/Microsoft/Office/Outlook Script Menu Items" folder you can assign a shortcut key to it using System Preferences/Keyboard.  Works like a charm.  The script is:  precodeon run {}        tell application "Microsoft Outlook"             set selected folder to inbox     end tell end run /code/pre  <answer113750> I modified the post from thatdamncat a little so that it will change to the mail view if the window is not on there. although if you have multiple main windows this may mess with your flow.    precodeon run {}     tell application "Microsoft Outlook"         tell the first main window             set view to mail view         end tell         set selected folder to inbox     end tell end run  /code/pre  <answer120371> I've been trying to emulate Outlook for Windows' SHIFT-CTRL-I (Go to Inbox) command and came across this script.  I modified the post from @greenwar because it was throwing errors if the main windows was not mail view AND the Inbox was not selected.  Here goes:  precodeon run {}     tell application "Microsoft Outlook"         if view of the first main window is not equal to "mail view" then             set view of the first main window to mail view             if selected folder is not equal to inbox then                 set selected folder to inbox             end if         end if         -- end tell     end tell end run /code/pre  I'm still looking for a way to make this a keyboard shortcut bONLY/b when Outlook is running.  I found bthis article/b on Apple.com but it requires you know the keyboard entry for the script menu.  How the heck do you find that?  <answer131038> kbd⌘ Command/kbd + kbd1/kbd takes you to the inboxbr kbd⌘ Command/kbd + kbd2/kbd takes you to the calendarbr kbd⌘ Command/kbd + kbd3/kbd takes you to the address book  <comment61789> Mh, that's too bad. I had a look at the list, but didn't find anything that does what I need. A brief look at the MS forums confirms this, there's more people looking for something similar, but no answers. <comment94679> Perfect, exactly what I was looking for! Thanks a ton! <comment167104> To select folders other than the built-ins, you can do: `set selected folder to the folder named "Keep"` <comment256294> Command-1 takes you to your mail, but only to the last-viewed box, not to the inbox. <comment256296> Can something like this be done for Outlook version 15 (year 2015)?
