Can a Mac act as Bluetooth receiver for sound? <body> This is my setup to play music:  ul liMac with iTunes/li li2 Airport Express' connected to two pair of active B&amp;O speakers/li /ul  I also have a turntable/record player that I want to use wirelessly with this setup. I therefore just ordered a Bluetooth transmitter. Now the question is if my Mac can receive A2DP (low latency AptX) from this device with its built in Bluetooth support or do I need to buy a separate receiver for the computer?  My plan is to use Rogue Amoeba's Line In app and redirect the sound from my turntable/Bluetooth combo to my Airport Express' but while waiting for my transmitter to arrive I have googled and it looks like a Mac can't act as a Bluetooth A2DP server. However, I also have a small portable Bluetooth speaker and that can act as a speaker phone and in Line In I can select this speaker both as output destination and input source, which seems to indicate that my Mac actually can receive sound from a Bluetooth source.
