What is the shortcut for confirming dialogs on Mac? <body> I have a MacBook Pro 2015 with macOS Sierra 10.12.4 installed. I have a question about confirming dialogs.  I use WebStorm from JetBrains to write code. After some actions I can open Commit dialog. By the way the commit dialog opens with kbdCommand/kbd + kbdK/kbd shortcut.

It is not only with this dialog, it also doesn't work in other applications either.

In the screenshot, Space selects the button on the left.  hr  However, specifically for this question you are referring to IntelliJ. They have a history of not following Apple HIG and there does not appear to be a keyboard shortcut to press the Commit button on that window.
