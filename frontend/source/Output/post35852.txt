List of (activated) fonts with shell command in os x <body> Is here any shell command for getting the list of activated fonts? Mean something like:  precode some_font_util -activated -format 'file: name' /code/pre  for getting a list of activated fonts in a form:  precode/Library/Fonts/CourNI.ttf: Courier New Italic /code/pre  or anything like...  Ps: for lion. If you know something from macports, or applescript (for run with osascript command) is welcomed too...  <answer35870> code$ fc-list : file family |grep \/Library/code  grepping /Library filters out a bunch of fonts in /usr/X11*, which are only used by X11. Considering your example, I assume you would prefer the OS X specific ones. If I'm incorrect in this assumption, simply take out everything after family.  That command returns many many lines on it's own, here is a handful of interesting ones I saw in the list:     /System/Library/Fonts/AppleGothic.ttf: AppleGothicbr   /Library/Fonts/Apple LiGothic Medium.ttf: Apple LiGothicbr   /System/Library/Fonts/Apple Braille Pinpoint 8 Dot.ttf: Apple Braillebr   /System/Library/Fonts/Apple Braille Outline 6 Dot.ttf: Apple Braillebr   /System/Library/Fonts/Apple Symbols.ttf: Apple Symbolsbr   /System/Library/Fonts/Apple Braille Pinpoint 6 Dot.ttf: Apple Braillebr   /System/Library/Fonts/Apple Braille.ttf: Apple Braillebr   /Library/Fonts/AppleMyungjo.ttf: AppleMyungjobr   /System/Library/Fonts/Apple Braille Outline 8 Dot.ttf: Apple Braillebr   /Library/Fonts/Apple LiSung Light.ttf: Apple LiSungbr   /Library/Fonts/Apple Chancery.ttf: Apple Chancerybr   /System/Library/Fonts/Apple Color Emoji.ttf: Apple Color Emoji,Apple 彩色表情 符號,Apple farve-emoji,Apple Farben-Emoji,Applen väri-emoji,Apple Emoji couleur,Colore Emoji Apple,Apple カラー絵文字,Apple 컬러 이모티콘,Apple Kleur-Emoji,Apple farge-emoji,Apple Emoji em Cores,Цветные эмодзи Apple,Apple färg-emoji,Apple 彩色表情符号,لون,Apple Emoji colorbr   /Library/Fonts/Comic Sans MS.ttf: Comic Sans MSbr   /Library/Fonts/Microsoft/MS Gothic.ttf: MS Gothic,ＭＳ ゴシックbr   /Library/Fonts/Microsoft/Stencil: Stencilbr   /Library/Fonts/Microsoft/Verdana: Verdanabr   /Library/Fonts/Microsoft/Georgia: Georgiabr   /Library/Fonts/Microsoft/Onyx: Onyx   <answer243746> I know that this is quite an old post, but I just stumbled upon it from Google while searching for something similar (mostly just wanting to list active fonts via Terminal.) I ended up remembering that activated fonts are listed in System Information which can be pulled from the system_profiler command. That being said here's the command to pull font information from system_profiler:  precodesystem_profiler SPFontsDataType /code/pre  That's it. It should return a huge list of font data in the format of:  precodeFonts:  Arial Narrow.ttf:    Kind: TrueType   Valid: Yes   Enabled: Yes   Location: /Library/Fonts/Arial Narrow.ttf   Typefaces:     ArialNarrow:       Full Name: Arial Narrow       Family: Arial Narrow       Style: Regular       Version: Version 2.38.1x       Vendor: The Monotype Corporation       Unique Name: Arial Narrow Regular : 2007       Designer: Robin Nicholas, Patricia Saunders       Copyright: © 2007 The Monotype Corporation. All Rights Reserved.       Trademark: Arial is a trademark of The Monotype Corporation in the United States and/or other countries.       Description: Monotype Drawing Office 1982. A contemporary sans serif design, Arial contains more humanist characteristics than many of its predecessors and as such is more in tune with the mood of the last decades of the twentieth century. The overall treatment of curves is softer and fuller than in most industrial-style sans serif faces. Terminal strokes are cut on the diagonal which helps to give the face a less mechanical appearance. Arial is an extremely versatile family of typefaces which can be used with equal success for text setting in reports, presentations, magazines etc, and for display use in newspapers, advertising and promotions.       Outline: Yes       Valid: Yes       Enabled: Yes       Duplicate: No       Copy Protected: No       Embeddable: Yes /code/pre  which you should be able to grep and manipulate as you'd like.  <comment40907> Our of my own morbid curiosity, can I ask why you need it (1) programmatically, and (2) in such a specific format? <comment40943> Need install fonconfig macport. Excellent! Thanx. <comment40944> simple want print fontdemo (some text with all my fonts) with textutil command, so really need only "fontname" but the file helps filter out the correct font-directory (as you do it in your example). :) like: echo 'demo text' | textutil -stdin -convert rtf -font $FONTNAME ... etc <comment106193> Since OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion, X11 is no longer included in the OS, and even if the `fc-list` binary is still available in `/usr/X11/bin/fc-list`, it wont run without a proper X11 install. <comment106230> X11 has never been included, it's always been an optional install. <comment112231> @JasonSalaz ["The XQuartz project was originally based on the version of **X11 included in Mac OS X v10.5**"](http://support.apple.com/kb/ht5293) <comment300332> YES! This is the correct way. Changed the accepted answer. Moreover, using it as `system_profiler -xml SPFontsDataType` produces an XML output which is precisely parseable using some XML tool. Thank you.
