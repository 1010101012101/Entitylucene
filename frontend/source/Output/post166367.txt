Battery percentage on iPod touch 5G iOS 8 <body> How do I get the battery percentage on the top right of my screen please help I tried many other things but didn't work   <answer166384> The iPod Touch does not allow you to view battery percentage. Only the iPhone and iPad.  strong"You can see what percent the battery is at on your iPhone or iPad, but not your iPod touch."/strong -- http://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201102  <answer189695> To enable it you will need to use a 3rd party application (no jailbreak required!).  Steps:  ul liBackup your device to iTunes (don't think encrypted backup will work)/li liDownload iBackupBot/li liOpen iBackupBot/li liSelect your most recent backup/li liDouble click on the file called codeLibrary/Preferences/com.apple.springboard.plist/code/li liAdd this under the first code&lt;dict&gt;/code/li /ul   precode&lt;key&gt;SBShowBatteryLevel&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;true/&gt; &lt;key&gt;SBShowBatteryPercentage&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;true/&gt; /code/pre   ul liSave the file/li liRestore via codeiBackupBot/code/li /ul  To undo it just take the code out.brNote: the code may be later on in the file due to how plist files are saved.  I would recommend making 2 backups just incase you mess up the edit (you shouldn't mess it up though)
