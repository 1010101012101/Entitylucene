2x iPhones unresponsive/freezing with 1 Apple-ID <body> I am using 2x iPhones with 2 different SIM Card Carriers. Both iPhones sharing the same Apple-ID. Since I have upgraded to iOS10 the Phone list is totally unresponsive. As soon as I shutdown one iPhone, the 2nd iPhone is working again.   It looks like an Apple-ID issue. What can I do?  <comment330486> Try disabling iCloud Drive from the iCloud settings on both phones. That should stop it from syncing the call list between devices. If that works and helps the problem, you have something to go on to try and really solve it. <comment331057> Thank. Unfortunately this didn't work out. Both phones are still freezing. Anything else can I try?
