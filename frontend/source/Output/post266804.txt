-bash process suddenly taking 75% CPU in htop <body> When I open a terminal and run htop I am seeing a code-bash/code process that is taking up 75% of my CPU. I am not running any scripts or anything like that. I constantly have 3-4 terminals open and I have never seen this happen before. I tried to kill the process but it doesn't go away.   What should I try next?  <answer266808> Most run-away processes can be killed with codekill -9 PID/code. Any unsaved data kept by the process will be lost.  <comment334590> How did you try to kill it? Does `ps -p pid` give any clues about where the process might come from? Does quitting/restarting Terminal help? <comment334594> quitting restarting terminal does not help, no idea where it came from I did an `F9` sigterm. `ps -p` gives this `9032 ttys001  381:06.57 -bash` <comment334595> If `kill -9 9032` doesn't help, it's probably time for a reboot <comment334599> that seems to have worked, I always end up thinking that htop kills are as powerfull as the kill command...Any idea "in theory" what this is? Is this a zombie process? <comment334600> strangely enough I started seeing this error sometimes when I open a new bash terminal...`-bash: .launchctl_auto_complete.bash: No such file or directory` <comment334604> Maybe something gets "stuck" by that.
