Unable to format pendrive, diskutil error <body> When I insert my USB Pendrive in my iMac i see this message: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fVtRC.png" alt="enter image description here"  I tried to format it both with DiskUtility and with diskutil command in terminal but I get this error:  precodeiMac:~ User$ diskutil eraseVolume HFS+ PenDrive disk2 Started erase on disk2 Unmounting disk Erasing newfs_hfs: WriteBuffer:Â  pwrite(3, 0x108551000, 131072, 0): Device not configured newfs_hfs: write (sector 0): Invalid argument Mounting disk Could not mount disk2 with name (null) after erase Error: -69832: File system formatter failed /code/pre  How can I solve it?  <answer113449> You could try booting into any free Linux livecd with Gparted on it, or this one called Parted Magic which is designed for disk maintenance tasks like this. (it costs a tiny $5 though.)  Do note that you may not be able to format as HFS+ using linux, however if you choose a compatible file system like FAT32 you'd be able to read/write to the drive in most OS's.  <answer148008> Click on "Initialize..."  or if the useer your login with can adminastrat the computer then try adding "sudo " and entering your password when prompted.  So:  precodesudo diskutil eraseVolume HFS+ PenDrive disk2 /code/pre  <comment132164> Have you tried formatting the drive on another OS? <comment133513> As a test to see if the drive memory is good, try formatting it FAT32 instead of HFS+ and see if that works.
