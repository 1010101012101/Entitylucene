Preventing applications from creating folders in your documents folder <body> I have two applications (Microsoft RDP Client and Parallels Desktop) that insist on creating their own folders in my Documents folder. They use those to store user-specific files, settings, profiles and such.  My Documents folder is neatly organized and I don't want applications creating their folders in it. Parallels Desktop has a setting allowing me to change the path for its folder, but the Microsoft RDP client doesn't seem to.   Is there a straightforward way to prevent an application from automatically creating folders in codeDocuments/code?  In my specific case, I'd be happy with a solution that prevents RDP Client from creating the directory altogether, e.g. by creating a hidden locked entry with the same name as the folder it wants to create.   <answer49272> I understand your frustration, but I suggest you just hide the offending folders from Finder, you can easily do that with the following terminal command:  precodechflags hidden ~/Documents/HideMe /code/pre  Preventing those folders to be created is likely going to cause problems running those applications.  <answer275391> ol liRight click on folder you wish to have scrubbed from existence.  /li liClick "Properties"./li liClick "Hidden"./li liClick "Apply"./li /ol  Unfortunately this only hides it and does not remove it.  You will have to repeat this process for any folders created, but it seems to be a way to at least keep your documents folder organized to your liking.
