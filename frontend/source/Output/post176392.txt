Open selected text in an iOS app? <body> I just got an iPod Touch 5G (iOS 8.2) and I would like to open text in an installed apps, e.g.; TextCrafter. Is that possible? Images can be opened in a number of apps but how to do it for text?   <answer176397> Text is handled by default with copy/paste. While it would be possible to create an app that allows text to be sent to TextCrafter (or similar), and a new document to be automatically created from that text, it is not default in iOS.   As a result, the only option is to copy the text (which is available system wide) and paste it into TextCrafter.   <comment208230> Meaning, select some text - open in TextCrafter? Or open a text document in TextCrafter? <comment208236> I mean -select some text - open in TextCrafter - is that possible?
