How to use iPad as iPhone dialler? <body> I often have the following problem: I'll be listening to music on my iPhone, browsing things on my iPad, when I want to make a phone call. This can be either a number in my contacts or on a web page or something.  I can already use the iPad to make the call (using the iPhone for the communication), but what I want is to still use the iPhone's earphones/mic, and only have the iPad do the dialing for me.  Is this possible?
