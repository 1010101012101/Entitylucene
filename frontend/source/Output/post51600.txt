How to move hosting from mobile.me to iCloud? <body> A client of mine had a website hosted on strongmobile.me/strong account.  I received credentials and was prompted to upgrade to strongiCloud/strong.  I asked her to do it on her own machine (there might be some issues with iTunes, sync, etc).  Right now, upon logging to strongiCloud/strong I see only mail / calendar / contacts but NO files / websites... strongAny idea is it possible to access previous "WWW" directory from iCloud?/strong  Thanks for help, if you you need more info put it in the comments...  <answer51603> You will still be able to access the mobile me website and files making the website through June 30th, but iCloud does not offer web hosting or internet-based disk storage. After June 30th you will need to find a different web hosting service.  Longer version here: http://www.apple.com/mobileme/transition.html
