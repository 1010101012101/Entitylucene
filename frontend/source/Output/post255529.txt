fn + delete does not seem to work on iTunes <body> The combination  kbd fn /kbd + kbd delete /kbd does not seem to delete characters on the right of the cursor, when it comes to the search field of strongiTunes/strong, but it works fine anywhere else. Does anyone else experience the same problem?  Is there any workaround?
