Software for design 3D graph <body> I'm looking for a software for designing 3D graph (graph with x,y,z axis).  I found OmniGraphSketcher but it seems that it allows me to design only 2D graph.  I don't want to use Matlab because my graph will not be a "mathematical" graph. It would be a graph with text and not dots or line or numbers.  I have to do something like the picture below but in a professional way.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/IoDbk.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer64854> Have you tried the built-in Grapher app in /Application/Utilities ?  <answer64921> Have a look at the following Software for visualizing X,Y,Z Data as a 3D Scatter and 3D Surface graph:  ul liIGOR Pro/li liQtiPlot/li liR/li liGraphing Calculator/li /ul  These are for the most part scientific tools, so don't expect any friendly UI. There are some other tools for *nix and Windows, but the you have to use Wine, Crossover or some VM to use it.  There is also 'ChartDirector' - a Script for PHP, ASP, JSP etc. for usage directly in HTML.  But I am still wondering: if all you want to do is put in some Text on a chart with 3 Axis, wouldn't it be easier for you to draw the graph by hand?   You could Illustrator, InkScape, Sketch or Gliffy  <comment76268> Thanks! I tried but I wasn't able to design what I want. See the edited question. <comment76274> Thanks, however I'm afraid that no one of the proposed SW are fine with my request. Because I don't have to make a mathematical graph. Please, see the example picture in the question. <comment76567> At the end I did it with OmniGraffle...
