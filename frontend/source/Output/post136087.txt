Windows management <body> Just wondering whether its possible to achieve my goal.  Imagine you are running Firefox and have all windows minimized to Dock.  If you switch to other application and back to Firefox via codecmd+Tab/code, it would open last minimized window (this is what I want to prevent).  So is it possible to force Firefox (and any application) to show only Main Menu Item after codecmd+Tab/code if all windows are minimized?  Actually I am talking about global OS X option and window management, Firefox mentioned just as an example of multi-window environment.  <answer136097> If I understand you correctly:  there is a setting in FF for that.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4onyC.jpg" alt="open FF window"     Don't load tabs until selected.   I have not found anything doing exactly what you asked on system wide level but ere are some alternative solutions.  Keyboard shortcut for restoring applications from the Mac OS X Dock?  What are the differences between minimizing and hiding an application?  https://stackoverflow.com/q/7681418/2241562  <answer137294> There is no current option to accomplish the said goal. I understand the frustration. OS X isn't doing exactly great on windows management, partly because Microsoft has patterns on certain operation design.  <comment161365> Actually I was talking about global OS X option and window management, Firefox mentioned just as an example of multi-window environment <comment161379> @Buscarì›ƒ He might have Word open with multiple documents minimized to dock.
