Delete Camera Roll Images <body> What is the best way to delete all images from camera roll.  I am selling my phone and don't want to try deleting them one at a time, nor do I want to leave them.  <answer194458> Connect the iPhone to a Mac or PC running iTunes and do a complete Restore to factory settings. This will wipe out all media &amp; data and install the latest version of iOS for that device.  If you don't have a Mac or PC for this task, on the iPhone itself, you can go to Settings  General  Reset  Erase all content and settings.  strongNOTE/strong: Be sure to disable Find My iPhone if you have it enabled, and logout of any iCloud services.
