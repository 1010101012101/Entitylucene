Double tap home button? <body> When I double tap (Not press) the icons or what ever your screen is on gets pulled down half way  Before:br img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jHRq7.png" alt="enter image description here"    After the double tap:br img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/P91Tz.png" alt="enter image description here"  Why does it do this?  <answer215297> So you can reach them when holding the phone  with one hand.   Apple refers to this feature as strongreachability/strong. This allows you to reach apps at the top of the screen with your thumb.   If you don't like this, change the setting in that app under strongGeneral/strong  strongAccessibility/strong - it's towards the bottom just under strongHome Button/strong  <comment260045> @bmike you are too kind! <comment260056> I'd rather others get the rep :) thanks for the great answer so fast.
