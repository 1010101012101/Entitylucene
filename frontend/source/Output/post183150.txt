iTunes select/create library dialogue doesn't show <body> I have tried the advice given on here to restore iTunes from backup but I don't get the dialogue box pop up which asks if I want to create library or choose library.  <answer183151> For OS X: Immediately after clicking the iTunes icon, leave kbdOption/kbd (kbdAlt/kbd) pressed. The dialog should appear.  For Windows: Keep kbdShift/kbd pressed and click the iTunes icon. When the dialog appears, you can release the kbdShift/kbd key.
