Thunderbird stopped working with iCloud email <body> I had Thunderbird configured with an iCloud (me) email account and it worked fine until about two weeks ago. When I tried to send a message, it asked me for the server password. When I entered it, I got a message saying the login or password was wrong. I also had this same problem on another machine with another account. I was able to add and use a Gmail account without any problems.  My setting are: Incoming  precodeProtocol: IMAP Server: imap.mail.me.com Port: 993 SSL: SSL/TLS Authentication: Normal password /code/pre  Outgoing  precodeProtocol: SMTP Server: smtp.mail.me.com Port: 587 SSL: STARTTLS Authentication: Normal password /code/pre  I got the settings from How can I configure iCloud mail in Mozilla Thunderbird?  I am able to login to both iCloud accounts through a browser.  <answer288414> Starting June 15, 2017, Apple requires two-factor authentication on all iCloud accounts that access their accounts non-natively. Apple’s third-party email client setup instructions have since been updated accordingly.  Native iCloud access is limited to strongSystem Preferences/strong on macOS, the strongSettings/strong app on iOS, and strongiCloud for Windows/strong. All other apps, including Thunderbird and Outlook, require an app-specific password.  To enable two-factor authentication:  ul liOn an iOS device open strongSettings/strong → strongPassword &amp; Security/strong and tap codeTurn On Two-Factor Authentication/code./li liOn your Mac open strong/strong → strongSystem Preferences/strong → strongiCloud/strong → strongAccount Details/strong → strongSecurity/strong and click codeTurn On Two-Factor Authentication…/code./li /ul  Then, login at https://id.apple.com/ and under strongSecurity/strong → strongApp-Specific Passwords/strong, click codeGenerate Password…/code. Enter emthat/em password into Thunderbird.  This was done to keep third-party apps from getting access to your iCloud password, thus reducing the likelihood of iCloud account breaches.  <comment364154> you have an old @me.com mail right ? <comment364202> One of the machines is me.com and the other is icloud.com
