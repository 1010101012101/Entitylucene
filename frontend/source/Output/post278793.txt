Can't use dictionary function after annotating a PDF. Is this a bug? <body> I recently received a PDF and as I read through it using Preview I used the Dictionary lookup shortcut (Cmd Ctrl D). It was working fine. Later I added a memo to the PDF and it seemed to break the Dictionary lookup functionality.   I reverted to a previous Version that had no memos and the Dictionary function worked again.   This is not good, since I regularly receive PDFs that are not in my native language and I need to use the Dictionary lookup a lot, but I would also like to annotate my PDFs sometimes.  I am using macOS Sierra 10.12.4. I have not yet had a chance to test this on other OS versions.  Is there a workaround if others can reproduce this?
