Remove some photos (or videos) from iPhoto without deleting from Flickr <body> I have a very large iPhoto library with photos and videos shared to Flickr using the built-in iPhoto/Flickr integration. I've run into problems with the size of my iPhoto library (100GB) so I'm splitting it in two to help manage the space.  I understand that iPhoto syncs photos with Flickr rather than exports them, so if I remove a photo from my iPhoto library, it will delete it from Flickr. While historically, I've enjoyed this sync approach, with splitting up my iPhoto library it is problematic.  strongWhat is the best way to remove photos from iPhoto that have been published to Flickr (or Facebook for that matter) without deleting them from Flickr?/strong  <answer230272> Found an answer here:  https://support.apple.com/kb/PH2432?locale=en_US  Very simple actually, just remove the Facebook and Flickr accounts in preferences and then delete away!
