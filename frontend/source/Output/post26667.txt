Matlab on the command line error in Lion <body> I constantly get this warning in Matlab, which I run on the command line:     This process is attempting to exclude an item from Time Machine by path without administrator privileges. This is not supported.   What can I do to prevent this?  <answer26683> Start Matlab as administrative user once so it can do the exclusion.  <answer54552> It is reported here, they claimed that the issue is for all version of Matlab on Mac OS X Lion. So I guess you could simply use strongemsudo/em/strong to get this problem done. And wait with more patient for a fix.  <answer54576> Running codesudo matlab/code once worked for me.  This assumes that code/Applications/MATLAB_R20???.app/bin/code has been added to codePATH/code.  <comment30417> What part of your code is trying to alter Time Machine information? <comment30422> no part at all... Matlab just starts spitting out this warning, even with me doing nothing
