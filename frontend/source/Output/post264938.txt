Check mark icon √ became "question mark" (as in unavailable) after masOS update <body> Yesterday I updated to the latest macOS 10.12.2 (Sierra) and today I noticed strange thing: places where you should see a native "check mark" √ sign show a question mark icon, indicating that check mark is probably missing  Here's a screenshot from a webpage standard   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rioNI.png" alt="enter image description here"  At first I thought it was a Chrome bug, but then I noticed same thing in a native cocoa app (Tower Git to be precise)  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mPWoy.png" alt="enter image description here"  Anyone else on the latest macOS has this issue or know to fix it?
