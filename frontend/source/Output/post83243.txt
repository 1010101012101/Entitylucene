How do I get my iPod touch (1st gen) out of a recovery mode boot loop? <body> I restored my iPod touch 1G and when it rebooted after completing restore, it got stuck showing the iTunes logo.  I tried two different methods of exiting the recovery mode as explained at  How To Fix Recovery Mode Loop OR iTunes Logo on iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch  I even tried via Snowbreeze as explained at   How To Jailbreak Using Sn0wbreeze v2.9  but these didn't work for me.  Does anyone have any ideas on how to fix this? img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QY8h1.jpg" alt=""  <comment96293> Was it a jailbroken iPod? <comment96294> Actually, I don't have idea whether it is a jailbroken one. I just tried to restore my friend's iTouch.
