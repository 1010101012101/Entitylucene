Preview search function returns blank results <body> I'm having trouble finding pages when I query for a string in Preview, where actual results are mixed in with meaningless, blank results. For example, when I search for emB-tree/em in my algorithms book, I get this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/328e8.png" alt="Search results for &quot;B-tree&quot;"  where page 494 and 495 shouldn't match at all.  <comment141842> How does it do with another search string <comment142021> similar results, for example when I search for "its" <comment142022> give me the link so I can download and test <comment142023> Found it, downloaded and my preview search does exactly as yours. <comment142094> Thanks, guess I'll just stick with Google Chrome's PDF Reader in situations like these. <comment142148> You are welcome, sorry could not do better :( If you use Adobe Readers FIND command, it will find each b-tree and highlight it, then you click next ect.. It is not quite what you are looking for for but just an alternative.
