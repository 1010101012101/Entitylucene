Statisitcs about ios devices and language <body> A want to localize one of my iOS apps into Chinese. I notice iOS has "simplified chinese", "traditional chinese" and "traditional chinese (hong kong)" as language choices in the settings.  To decide what language to go for, I am looking for statistics such as % of ios devices configured in a certain language (not just Chinese but splitted up into the above 3 variants). Been searching the web but can't find such info. Where can this info be found?  <comment232050> I'm voting to close this question as off-topic because it looks like a request for a professional marketing analysis, not about linguistics. <comment232070> The potential market for simplified Chinese is so much larger than the two others that the choice should be obvious. <comment232155> @Tom that is what I am trying to determine. Do you have any statistics to backup your claim? <comment232179> Surely you are aware that all of Mainland China (1.4 billion people) uses Simplified Chinese, while Traditional is essentially confined to Taiwan and Hong Kong. (30 million?) <comment232236> Thanks for this info Tom. But I am wondering if this is also reflected in the language people have choosen to run on their iPhone/iPad. Currently apple allows the above 3 choices... Do you know of any stats about this? <comment232271> Sorry, no idea whether any such stats would be available anywhere.  But you can compare the number of apple stores in China vs Hong Kong and Taiwan at https://www.apple.com/retail/storelist/
