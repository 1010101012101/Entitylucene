shutdown command - what can be wrong? <body> I have a late 2012 iMac. I use to shut it down with the codeshutdown/code command, in order to be able to delay the shutting down.  Here's how I use it:  precodesudo shutdown -h +30         # shuts down in 30 mins sudo shutdown -h 04:00       # shuts down at the next 04:00 AM sudo shutdown -h 1304302100  # shuts down on 04/30/2013 at 09:00 PM /code/pre  I noticed that the latter two options don't work every time for me. Since I'm sure I entered the right time/date, what could prevent my Mac from shutting down? I set it to strongnever/strong go into stop, and to lock the screen after 30 mins of inactivity.  I'm on 10.8.3.  h2Little edit/h2  Just a few minutes after I wrote this question, my Mac shut down unexpectedly (where I am now it was 03:40 PM. I never set this time anywhere. Yesterday night I set it to codeshutdown -h 04:00/code and it was about 03:00AM. This is becoming strange.  h2Little edit #2/h2  After suggestions from the comments, I looked at codesystem.log/code and I found this (where codeironmac/code is my user - original uh? - and codeAndreas-iMac/code is the name of my computer).  precodeApr 30 02:33:28 Andreas-iMac.local sudo[32613]:  ironmac : TTY=ttys000 ; PWD=/Users/ironmac/Dropbox ; USER=root ; COMMAND=/sbin/shutdown -h 04:00 Apr 30 15:41:26 Andreas-iMac.local shutdown[32620]: halt by ironmac:  Apr 30 15:41:26 Andreas-iMac.local shutdown[32620]: SHUTDOWN_TIME: 1367329286 508163 /code/pre  You can see the codeshutdown/code command was received and scheduled, but the shutdown time seems to be random.  <comment105814> From the man page " At shutdown time a message is written to the system log, containing the      time of shutdown, the person who initiated the shutdown and the reason." what does you log show? <comment105817> Also, you may have several shutdown processes running in addition to the energy saver scheduled events. I'd run a ps-ef | grep shutdown to be sure you don't have colliding events and multiple commands in flight to power down your system. <comment105826> @bmike the `ps -e | grep shutdown` was the very first thing I did, and I found no processes willing to shut down my machine. Note that I don't have any energy-saver scheduled events: I just have set up my Mac to never *sleep*. <comment105827> @Mark that is interesting indeed. I'm reading it right now, and I edited the question posting the content of the log too. Drop an eye there if you have time! Thank you.
