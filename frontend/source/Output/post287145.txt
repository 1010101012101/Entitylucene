Retina scaling reset when switching user on MacBook <body> For a long time I used the "maximum space" 1920x1200 retina resolution on my 15" MacBook Pro for all my user accounts. I recently switched to the slightly larger 1680x1050 resolution - again for all user accounts - but when I now switch from one account to another, the resolution gets reset to 1920x1200. The "Login Window" screen also defaults to 1920x1200  However, when I restart the computer and log into one of the accounts, it uses the right resolution, only when I then switch to another user, it reverts back to 1920x1200  It does not make a difference with which user I login first. How can I reliably make 1680x1050 the default resolution for all users? Where is the resolution for the login / user switch screen stored?
