How can I use Google shortening service (http://goo.gl) in Twitter for iPhone? <body> I tried to configure Google service as custom URL shortening service by adding this url stronghttp://goo.gl/strong but it's not working.  Any idea ?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hcQ0p.png" alt="alt text"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/IztPs.png" alt="alt text"  <answer4732> You need to add a wildcard to the URL to tell the application where to insert the original URL. Your custom url should look like this:   precodehttp://myshortener.com/shorten?url=%@ /code/pre  However, it looks like this isn't as simple as this on goo.gl. I'll update when I find a way without any proxy-site or other things.  <comment4657> I tried that route, by adding it at the end of the google URL, but it's giving some error. <comment4658> Yup, because Google doesn't accept the ?url=%@ argument. I haven't found a way to use it.
