Arrange different external displays of same model to different positions <body> I am running Mac OS X (Version 10.10.5) on a MacBook Pro (13 Inch, Mid 2010) and want to arrange an external monitor of the same type to different positions.  First, let me explain my setup:  ul limonitor at my office: DELL U2312HM (located above the MacBook's screen)/li limonitor at home: DELL U2312HM (located left of the MacBook's screen)/li /ul  As you can see, I am using different monitors of the same type (they have different serial numbers displayed in the System Overview window). However, they are located either above or left of the internal screen.  Since the only way I know to arrange an external monitor is draging the blue boxes in the monitor section of the system preferences, I need to do this every morning after connecting my monitor in the office and every evening after coming home. The monitor arrangement does not depend on the monitor's serial number but on the model since saving the arrangement of different models works as desired.  So is there a way, a hidden setting, a hidden setting accessible through the terminal or even a third-party app which enables different monitor arrangements for the same monitor model but based on the monitor's serial number as shown in the system overview?  The behavior which seems to be a system default is very annoying and does not feel very apple-like.  <answer257864> There is a product out there that will remember your monitor configurations - it's called Stay  From their website:     Stay can store a set of windows for every combination of displays that you use with your computer. Stay can also be configured to automatically restore windows as displays are connected and disconnected.
