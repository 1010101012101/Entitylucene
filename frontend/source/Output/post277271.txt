Can I run netstat with -w option in logging mode? <body> To trace network traffic rate, I use netstat with -w option:  precodenetstat -ib -I en0 -w5 | awk 'NR&gt;2 {print "in: "$3" b/sec; out: "$6" b/sec"}' /code/pre  It makes netstat to measure data for the five-second intervals, and output them to the terminal. The problem is that I only need emone sample/em. Is there an option like a [-l &lt;samples&gt;] or something, that tells the netstat output X samples and finish? (Like in top -l 1 or nettop -l 1).  P.S. I found the solution via awk (print line with first sample then exit):  precodenetstat -ib -I en0 -w5 | awk 'NR&gt;2 {print("in: "$3" b/sec; out: "$6" b/sec");exit}' /code/pre  But this script takes twice more time â€” ten seconds instead of five. It prints result then wait another 5 sec before exiting.
