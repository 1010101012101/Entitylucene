OS X El Capitan Downloading problem <body> I've downloaded OS X El Capitan from the AppStore. If I go AppStore -- Store -- Purchased it says "Downloaded" but I can't seem to prompt the install. I've tried restarting the Download but nothing happens.  Anyone have any ideas? Thanks  <answer217268> Solved, If you go into Applications there should be an App called "Install OS X El Capitan". Launch from there.
