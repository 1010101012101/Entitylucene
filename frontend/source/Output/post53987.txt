How do I move an iPhoto '11 book project from one mac to another <body> I have iPhoto '11 with Photostream set up on my Mac Mini and on my Macbook Pro. I'm getting rid of the macbook pro, but have a photo book I've been working on on it that I want to move over to my Mac Mini (to finish up the work and print it). Is there a way to do this? I have the same pictures on both computers, I just can figure out how to move the project...  <answer54024> The only way to move a project is to move the Library that contains it. There is no way to move a book from one Library to another.
