Is there a way to save your custom keyboard shortcuts in a config file? <body> Is there a way to save my custom keyboard shortcuts in a config file?  The reason i want this is so i can put that config file in the cloud (using git, dropbox, ...) and link this file on each os x computer that i have so my shortcuts are always the save on each computer.  <answer123389> App shortcuts can be stored in two places:  ul liThe app-specific plist  precode~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.iTunes.plist /code/pre/li liThe Global Preferences plist  precode~/Library/Preferences/.GlobalPreferences.plist /code/pre/li /ul  Services shortcuts are stored in code~/Library/Preferences/pbs.plist/code.  <answer123469> I use a shell script like this:  precodedefaults write -g NSUserKeyEquivalents '{ "Show in Finder"="$@r"; "Reveal"="$@r"; "Use Selection for Find"="@e"; "Find and Replace..."="~@f"; "Find Next"="@g"; "Find Previous"="$@g"; "Line Spacing..."="~@l"; "Zoom Reset"="@0"; "Original Size"="@0"; "Actual Size"="@0"; "Automatically Resize"="@9"; "Automatic Fit"="@9"; "Zoom to Fit"="@9"; "Enter Full Screen"="^@f"; "Exit Full Screen"="^@f"; "Enter Full Screen Mode"="^@f"; "Exit Full Screen Mode"="^@f"; "Toggle Full Screen"="^@f"; "Full Screen"="^@f"; "Fullscreen"="^@f"; "Normal Screen"="^@f"; "Remove Full Screen"="^@f"; "Select Previous Tab"="~@\UF702"; "Previous Tab"="~@\UF702"; "Show Previous Tab"="~@\UF702"; "Previous Workspace"="~@\UF702"; "Select Previous Tab View"="~@\UF702"; "Select Next Tab"="~@\UF703"; "Next Tab"="~@\UF703"; "Show Next Tab"="~@\UF703"; "Next Workspace"="~@\UF703"; "Select Next Tab View"="~@\UF703"; "Shift Left"="^\UF702"; "Decrease Indent Level"="^\UF702"; "Decrease Paragraph Indent"="^\UF702"; "Decrease Level"="^\UF702"; "Shift Right"="^\UF703"; "Increase Indent Level"="^\UF703"; "Increase Paragraph Indent"="^\UF703"; "Increase Level"="^\UF703"; "Shift Up"="^\UF700"; "Move Line Up"="^\UF700"; "Shift Down"="^\UF701"; "Move Line Down"="^\UF701"; "Minimize"="\U200B"; "Minimize All"="\U200B"; }'  defaults write com.apple.finder NSUserKeyEquivalents '{ "Show Package Contents"="@\r"; }'  defaults write -app iTerm NSUserKeyEquivalents '{ "Select Pane Above"="@\UF700"; "Select Pane Below"="@\UF701"; "Previous Pane"="@\UF702"; "Next Pane"="@\UF703"; "Open Autocomplete..."="@;"; }'  defaults write -app Safari NSUserKeyEquivalents '{ "Reopen Last Closed Window"="~@r"; "Reopen All Windows from Last Session"="~$@r"; "Mail Contents of This Page"="\U200B"; }'  defaults write -app Sequential NSUserKeyEquivalents '{ "Move to Trash"="\b"; }'  defaults write -app Skim NSUserKeyEquivalents '{ "Single Page Continuous"="$@0"; "Single Page"="$@1"; "Two Pages"="$@2"; "Crop"="@k"; }'  defaults write -app Transmit NSUserKeyEquivalents '{ "Show Invisible Files"="$@."; "Hide Invisible Files"="$@."; "Synchronize..."="$@y"; }'  defaults write -app WriteRoom NSUserKeyEquivalents '{ "Column 40"="$@1"; "Column 50"="$@2"; "Column 60"="$@3"; "Column 66"="$@4"; "Column 80"="$@5"; "Column 90"="$@6"; "Column 120"="$@7"; "Column 200"="$@8"; "Column Window Width"="$@0"; "Enter Full Screen Single"="^@f"; "Exit Full Screen Single"="^@f"; "Enter Full Screen"="$@f"; "Exit Full Screen"="$@f"; }' /code/pre  The shortcut strings use the same format as in DefaultKeyBinding.dict, but delete is code\U0008/code (code\b/code) and forward delete is code\U007F/code.  You can disable a shortcut by assigning the menu item to something like code\U200B/code (ZERO-WIDTH SPACE). codenil/code would be triggered when you type coden/code in some applications like Audacity. code\0/code would be triggered when you press any key in Safari in 10.9. code\1/code would be triggered when you press the home key.  codedefaults -app/code doesn't work with some applications like Finder or Notes.  codedefaults find NSUserKeyEquivalents/code shows current settings.  <comment331384> I have a setup script with `defaults write -g NSUserKeyEquivalents '{ "Zoom"="@$m";}'` - What does the combination `@$m` do? Can you explain each of those, `@`, `$`, and `m`, and their usage? <comment334712> `~/Library/Preferences/pbs.plist` doesn't seem to be the location on MacOS Sierra. Do you know where it is on Sierra?
