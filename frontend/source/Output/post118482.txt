Is there any way to save Mac OS X preferences into a shell file? <body> Whenever I reinstall my Mac OS and/or buy a new Mac, I have to configure manually almost all the options of mouse, dock, etc.  I'd like to know if Mac OS or some software can provide some way to save all the configurations I set up with the System Preferences app into a shell file, creating something like Mathias Bynens' https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles/blob/master/.macos  <answer118484> Automatically producing a script to make all the required changes is well nigh impossible. Mac system administrators spend many hours in dark bars drinking beer or bourbon and swapping bits of these files - we are reluctant to share all that work unless you are prepared to pick up the tab.  Actually the easiest way to capture the config changes is to use snapshotting.  Grab a copy of InstallEase and snapshot your new Mac. Now do all the configuration that you want and you can take another snapshot and build an installer that will install the changed files into a new Mac.   Of course complications can arise when applying the changes to a new version of the operating system but that's why we drink the bourbon.  <answer118491> The System Preferences appear to be stored in various places, depending on whether they are user or system specific. A lot of them are stored in either code/Library/Preferences//code or code$HOME/Library/Preferences//code (for per-user settings). But each preference pane will have its own way of storing them.  You can see which preferences are stored this way by typing:  precodedefaults read &lt;domain&gt; /code/pre  Where code&lt;domain&gt;/code is either the start of the filename in your per-user system preferences, or the full path to a code.plist/code file. For example:  precodedefaults read com.apple.screensaver defaults read /Library/Preferences/com.apple.screensaver /code/pre  The former will show your per-user customisation of the screensaver settings, while the latter will show the system screensaver settings.  The settings are largely organised by preference pane, though not necessarily that straight forward. You'll likely have to poke around in code/Library/Preferences/code and sub-folders (especially codeSystemConfiguration/code) to find them all.  One option would be to just copy the relevant files out, and put them back in place for new installations.  Another way would be to export and import it as required.  Exporting the Power Management (Energy Saver) System Preferences to pm.plist:  precodedefaults export /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/com.apple.PowerManagement pm.plist /code/pre  Importing those preferences from codepm.plist/code on the new computer:  precodedefaults import /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/com.apple.PowerManagement sysprefs.plist /code/pre  You may even want to edit the various exported code.plist/code files if there are specific system preferences you do/don't want to share between computers. That way you can have some customisation locally, and the codeimport/code command will not overwrite those, just add the ones you've set in the code.plist/code files. You can use the codedefaults/code command to modify your own code.plist/code files as well (but make sure you specify the full path to the file, not just a name, or you may be modifying your per-user preferences).  <answer118559> After many hours finding for something at least useful to my problem, I found a website called Secrets, which provides a lot of common Mac OS "defaults write" commands.  Anyway, thank Tony and drfrogsplatless for giving me clarifications and tips that were helpful to me.  <answer118733> The last time I did a clean reinstall I just copied the whole code~/Library/Preferences//code folder, and I didn't run into any issues because of it. Settings for old versions of applications and Mac-specific settings should just be ignored. There are almost no files in code~/Library/Preferences//code on a new installation, and if you delete all files in code~/Library/Preferences//code, the preference files will be recreated when they are needed.  The preference files for sandboxed applications are now stored in code~/Library/Containers//code, but I don't know if copying it to another Mac would cause any issues.  You might also just use Migration Assistant.  Or if you go the code.osx/code route, you can diff the output of codedefaults read/code:  ol liRun codedefaults read|awk 'length&lt;200'&gt;/tmp/a/code/li liChange some settings/li liRun codedefaults read|awk 'length&lt;200'&gt;/tmp/b;diff /tmp/[ab]/code/li /ol  You can run codesudo opensnoop/code or use fseventer to see what files are modified when you change preferences from the GUI.  <answer242211> Mackup is what you are looking for. https://github.com/lra/mackup/tree/master/doc  <answer251377> Here is a partially completed Apple Script I wrote in August of 2016 for my Mac, posted here as a, well, "proof of concept" is a bit strong, but it's something you can play with:  (* Before running this script you must first grant Apple Script tights under System Preferences-- Security &amp; Privacy-- Accessibility and allow Apple Script to control the computer. You can get a head start by running the script until it fails at that point. Then stop the script, navigate over to that Preferences dialog, and check the box next to Script Editor. Then you can go back, delete all the screenshots already taken (to avoid confusing duplicates), and start the script again.  Why do you need to do this? Becaues some prefernce dialogs, once opened and "photographed," need to be explicitly closed with a mouse click on the Cancel button. Apple Script can't do that unless it has rights "to control your computer" within that pref. *)  precodetell application "System Preferences" to quit delay 0.25  -- MAKE THE PREFS PICS FOLDER ON THE DESKTOP IF IT ISN'T THERE ALREADY. -- IF IT IS THERE ALREADY, NO CHECKING IS DONE WITH REFERENCE TO WHATEVER FILES ARE IN IT. tell application "Finder"     if not (exists folder "Prefs Pics" of desktop) then         make new folder with properties {name:"Prefs Pics", location:"desktop"}     end if end tell  tell application "System Preferences"     activate  -- THE PREFS ARE ORDERED BELOW ALPHABETICALLY.

It contains the preferences for the System Preferences application. So none of the actual configuration you do **with** System Preferences are stored in this file. <comment138266> @TonyWilliams, right you are, will fix that up... <comment138269> This is a clever idea. <comment286841> InstallEase seems to not be available anymore <comment286960> Casper has a snapshotting tool you can use instead of InstallEase. <comment343100> http://web.archive.org/web/20150322005829/http://secrets.blacktree.com/? has an archive copy from September 2015.
