How do I change the gateway of a specific connection using the Mac terminal? <body> My goal is to be able to change all of the following for a emspecific/em device: IP address, netmask, and gateway. So far, I've gathered that I should be able to use codeifconfig con0 10.8.0.14 netmask 255.255.255.252/code, but when I try to do codeifconfig con0 gateway 10.8.0.1/code, it gets pretty upset and tells me that codegateway/code is a bad argument.   Thoughts?  <answer81318> The command you're looking for is route.  strongCheck what your current gateway is/strong  To check your current gateway, run the command:  precoderoute -n get -ifscope en0 default /code/pre  This instructs route to return the path it would take using en0 to reach www.google.com.  ul liThe -n argument turns off domain name resolution in the output (else gateway in the sample output below would be the name of my gateway)./li liThe -ifscope argument limits the query to using en0.  Without it, to OS will select which interface to use./li lidefault tells route that you want to see the default gateway.  You can put a URL here instead if you suspect your OS is choosing something other than the default gateway to access a host./li /ul  The output will be something along the lines of:  precode   route to: default destination: default        mask: default     gateway: 192.168.1.1   interface: en0       flags: &lt;UP,GATEWAY,DONE,STATIC,PRCLONING,IFSCOPE&gt;  recvpipe  sendpipe  ssthresh  rtt,msec    rttvar  hopcount      mtu     expire        0         0         0         0         0         0      1500         0  /code/pre  strongDelete the current gateway/strong  To delete the current gateway from en0, run:  precodesudo route delete default -ifscope en0 /code/pre  This will delete the default gateway from en0 while leaving any other defined routes intact.    strongAdd the new gateway/strong  To add the new gateway to en0, run:  precodesudo route add default 192.168.1.1 -ifscope en0 /code/pre  Replace 192.168.1.1 with the IP address of the actual gateway.  For way more gory details, check out the man page for route.  <comment94773> So I tried this and it didn't quite work. In the case of trying to do this, my command was `# route delete default -ifscope tun0` followed by `# route add default 10.8.0.1 -ifscope tun0`, the output of both being `route: writing to routing socket: Network is unreachable` and `add net default: gateway x.x.x.1: Network is unreachable` in that order.
