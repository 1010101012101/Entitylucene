How to access apple support forum on "This username ... is already taken, please choose another. Another has been provided" message? <body> See screenshot: This username "***" is already taken, please choose another. Another has been provided.  If I enter a different forum username it tells me that the account is already associated with another user ID (I suspect the first one I tried).    How am I supposed to continue?    img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/naMDa.png" alt="Username availble" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/oHNNv.png" alt="This username &quot;***&quot; is already taken, please choose another. Another has been provided." img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QItDW.png" alt="Account exists"  <answer94663> Go to Apple ID support web page at http://www.apple.com/support/appleid/ and use the contact support button.  Your account is in a state where the tool can't let you continue and you may need a human on the other end to know what exactly to do. A search of the public knowledge base shows nothing that you should do in this case.  <comment67299> It is just telling you the username you tried is already used by someone else.  You need to pick a different username. <comment67480> Please re-read.  It does not allow me to choose another.
