How do we handle In-App Purchase being refunded by User? <body> There is two things we would like to prevent:  1) If the User refunded the DLC purchase, prevent the User to use the content that was unlocked by the DLC purchase  2) Found out which purchase was refunded, so we can do some financial stuff on business.  When Apple refunds a purchase to User, it doesn't inform the us. I know via In-App Receipt Validation we can check cancellation_date to see if user refunded the In-App Purchase. But this doesn't happen until User starts the app and is possible User will get refund with Apple anytime.  I was thinking to save all their transaction receipt and do validation with Apple.  But I heard Apple will block our request if we validate too often.  Is there any suggested way to handle such situation? Any way to get a report from Apple the transaction receipt list that was being refunded?  <answer241988> The problem is as followed:  1) You can not check WHO did a refund on your app. Apple only gives you knowledge how many users did a refund. Only thing you can do is let the user re-do the in-app purchase and after it was validated the user already bought it it gets a message "it's free to use as you already bought it".  2) Check out this topic on stackoverflow: Can we check if a users in app purchase has been refunded by apple. You need to do a check with Apple if the user did the purchase. From my experience, apple DOESN'T allow you to check if the purchase was made earlier on. This means you cannot get a check if the purchase is still available.   BUT what you CAN do is: Make the user re-check if the purchase was made. Depending on your app (is it a story game? or a continuous used app?), you can set a 5 days 're-check' and promt the user to redo the purchase. Eventually they'll get the 'you already purchased this' message and you can download the content content again.   As I don't know your type of app (or game) I can't tell what is best for now.
