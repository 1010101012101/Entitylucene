How can I send an SMS message from my Mac? <body> I want to know how I can send a SMS message (not an iMessage) from my Mac. I don't have great Wi-Fi right now, so I need to send a text message in order for it to go through. I know to send one on an iPhone, one needs to hold down the message bubble, but I don't know how to send one on OS X.  <answer213774> Forgive me as I am not sure where in the world you are, but at least here in the US you can typically send text messages in one of two ways (other than by phone):  ol liUsing the recipient's carrier's email-to-SMS gateway (typically something like NNNNNNNNNN@txt.carrier.com)./li liUsing the recipient's carrier's send-a-text website. /li /ol  This assumes, of course, that you know which carrier your recipient is using. If you do, doing a web search for one of the above along with the carrier name is likely to provide you with a solution.  <answer213779> This is called Text Message Forwarding and requires iOS 8.1 or above. Make sure both the OS X Messages App and your iPhone have the same Apple ID enabled. Then, do the following:  ol liOn your iPhone, tap Settings  Messages./li liTap Text Message Forwarding./li liEnable your Mac in the list of devices./li liOn your Mac, open Messages./li liA six-digit activation code appears./li liEnter this code on your iPhone, then tap Allow./li /ol  That should just about do it.  <comment258034> You can't send a text message on Wi-Fi, unless you set up Text Message Forwarding between your iPhone and Mac. <comment292419> Nope, that's not it.  There is no "Text Message Forwarding" under Message in settings.  Thanks for playing.
