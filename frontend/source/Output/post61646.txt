It had downloaded about 70% of the way there on Mountain Lion before the OS went to sleep. This lead to the "Failed to download/Use the Purchases page" error. After some web searching I found this thread that answered my problem:  https://discussions.apple.com/thread/4362474?start=0&amp;tstart=0  The solution for me was to open activity monitor, double-click the AppStore process, and select "open files and ports". Somewhere in this list is a folder starting with "/private/var/folders/". For me it was:  precode/private/var/folders/hw/... /code/pre  I quit the AppStore, deleted this folder, restarted AppStore. After clicking "install" again the download started fine.  <answer76332> I wanted to add my experience to this thread to help searchers. This has been bugging me for months and I was determined to sit down and fix it. The fact this Q refers to xcode is completely immaterial, I was seeing this issue across several apps with no commonality. I tried numerous searched fixes, including  ul liwiping all caches, cookies amd such like/li lirelogged into my account, signed out signed in etc/li lirebooted, reset app store, manually deleted caches and such like/li liscrewed about with DNS, networking as mentioned in some quarters (red herring IMO)/li lienabling the debug menu for app store ( codedefaults write com.apple.appstore ShowDebugMenu -bool true/code ) - this is what ultimately lead me to my solution/li /ul  strongMy symptoms were/strong: various apps were uninstalled (moved to trash can etc) OR were updated over time. Then app store would show same apps and "Update" button. You click it, and the "an error occurred" message would appear, then the "Please use Purchase page..." Using purchases page buttons resulted in the same error. I tried dozens of combinations of solutions and googled it to death.  The solution in the end was quite odd. With the debug menu enabled, I switch on logging level 2 (at random), tried to reinstall a smallish app I bought a while back. Then skimmed through code/var/log/install.log/code I saw an extract like this (some IDs deliberately obfuscated due to paranoia)  precodeDec 30 19:00:36 macbookpro installd[23755]: PackageKit: ----- Begin install ----- Dec 30 19:00:36 macbookpro installd[23755]: PackageKit: request=PKInstallRequest &lt;1 packages, destination=/Volumes/Iomega_HDD&gt; Dec 30 19:00:36 macbookpro installd[23755]: PackageKit: packages=(     "PKLeopardPackage &lt;file://localhost/var/folders/hb/6_bxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx/C/com.apple.appstore/xxxxx3/xxxxxxxxxxxx33.pkg#com.neatberry.PhotoStyler.pkg&gt;" ) Dec 30 19:00:36 macbookpro installd[23755]: PackageKit: Install Failed: Error Domain=NSCocoaErrorDomain Code=640 "You can’t save the file “Iomega_HDD” because the volume “Iomega_HDD” is out of space." UserInfo=0xxxxxxxxxx     {NSFilePath=/Volumes/Iomega_HDD} {         NSFilePath = "/Volumes/Iomega_HDD";     } /code/pre  And there it was - a weird reference to an external drive during an install.  My "Iomega_HDD" is a FW drive always attached. I was using it for SuperDuper root disk mirroring. However my files had grown bigger than the drive, so it had been sat mounted and idle for probably 8-12 weeks (do not worry: timemachine was working to a NAS :-)  Being a mirror, and mounted, I can only assume that somehow app store monitored, or maintained some sort of linkage to the files on there, eg so previously deleted / purged apps on my root drive were present on the mirror.  Anyway, long story short, I unmounted the mirrored external drive, restarted App Store, used the debug menu item to "reset" and amazingly, all the apps magically corrected themselves to "Install" rather than "Update" and the Install/Update statuses also corrected themselves. And more importantly, all the buttons worked and no more error messages!!  I know how bizarre this sounds but the proof is in the logs. App Store was taking into consideration a mirrored (idle) drive that had legacy copies of the apps on.  <answer77364> I had the same issue. I basically used Aitch's solution which is to unmount any cloned hard drives.  To discover the error and solution, I followed Aitch's steps.  1) Enabled debug menu in App Store using Terminal command ( defaults write com.apple.appstore ShowDebugMenu -bool true )  2) Quit and relaunch App Store app.  3) Enabled logging level 2 in the App Store Debug menu, and tried to install an app that was resulting in the error.  4) Skimmed through "/var/log/install.log"  My logs showed: "You can’t save the file “MyHDClone” because the volume “MyHDClone” is out of space."  So, it appears that the App Store was reading information from an external drive that I use to keep a bootable clone of my  internal drive.  I unmounted the external clone, Quit and restarted the App store and whola! All my apps were back in correct status. Several of the "updates" that were previously showing were now gone because I had updated them on my internal drive, but had not updated my clone, which is where the App Store was reading the status from.  <answer77405> The solution for me was quite simple, if a bit odd. I quit App Store, relaunched it, then 'quit process' from Activity Monitor. After that I relaunched App Store again and the app downloaded fine.   <answer80739> Similar story here.  An external drive I had attached for a Carbon Copy Cloner backup had also been left attached for some time. I noticed that the activity light was flickering so I ejected it. Finder complained that an app was accessing it, but why should it, only CCC accesses this drive. Assuming it was spotlight acting daft, I force-ejected it.  Shortly after, the app store app showed errors in updates it was carrying out, including an Xcode update that I was sure it had already done a couple of days ago.  Simply unmounting it and restarting App Store didn't help. Deleting the caches for App Store didn't help.  I followed the tips here (enabling Debug, performing a reset) I then rebooted and opened App Store again. I had to sign-in and only one app (out of the four that had been updating) was shown as update available. This updated without error. I therefore assume the other three had been apps that the App Store had been trying to update on the mirrored external drive.  There is clearly a bug here that the App Store is going looking on external drives rather than sticking to the apps it installed in the internal drive.  <answer82077> I tried many suggestions related to this error.

I asked to My System Admin. They Remove firewall restrictions. then its downloaded fine.  It may help for some one.  <answer148216> This is a dumb one, but I found that the reason I was receiving this message was that emmy hard drive was full/em. So I cleared up some space and it installed just fine.  Facepalm.  hr  Truth be told, the App Store should have better messaging around this. It's not an strongunknown error/strong, we totally know what it is.   Be forthright, App Store, come on.  <answer163300> One of the answer posted that mentioned the lack of disk space was my problem (but I can't comment on it because my reputation is still too low).  I had 7Gb of hard drive free space and was getting that error.  Tried the main solution and all the other ones posted and none of them worked.  Then I tried freeing up hard drive by uninstalling a bunch of apps I no longer need and got about 45Gb free, then tried installing again and this time it worked without a hitch.  So yeah, bad error message from the App Store -- and it should verify you have enough space for the installation embefore/em it tries to download.  I think currently it downloads the package first which is 2.5Gb ish, and then tries to unpack/verify that there's enough space for the actual installation, which requires a lot more, and fails here with a miserable generic error message if there isn't enough.    The error message itself should also be clearer and indicate that the reason for failure is not enough hard drive space for the installation.  My guess is you'll need about 10Gb+.  <answer167924> Here's what worked for me:  ul liGood network connection/li liEnough free space (if you need a few GiB, just codesudo rm -f /var/vm/sleepimage/code, osx will recreate it as needed)/li liCheck 3rd-party app firewall for interfering "deny" rules/li liClose App Store/li licoderm -rf /private/var/folders/pd/*/C/com.apple.appstore/code/li liReboot/li liRun updates (works!)/li /ul  To see what's going on while updates are installing:  ol liSet debug menu codedefaults write com.apple.appstore ShowDebugMenu -bool true/code/li liIn App Store  Debug, Debugging Level 4, Log XML, Log Headers &amp; Javascript Logging/li liIn Terminal: codetail -f /var/log/installer.log /var/log/commerce.log/code/li liRun updates/li liBe sure to disable debugging options before disabling the Debug menu/li /ol  <answer170302> Two simple solutions. 1) remove old X-Code install, restart, and re-download. or 2) Circumvent the app store, and download image direct here http://adcdownload.apple.com/Developer_Tools/xcode_6.1.1/xcode_6.1.1.dmg  <answer182817> In my particular case, the only way to fix it was to strongturn off my company's VPN/strong.  strongDetails/strong: I was trying to install Xcode 6.3.1 on OS X Yosemite 10.10.3.
