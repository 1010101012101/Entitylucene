With Ubuntu I could search packages.ubuntu.com for example, or Google since its using codeapt/code  <answer33357> codebrew search/code lists all available formula (aka packages), requires you to install brew first of course.  Additionally, if you want to get further information about that package before installing it codebrew info &lt;package name&gt;/code will list relevant information like version number, dependencies etc.  <answer33375> If you don't want to install Homebrew first (in order to see all the publicly available packages with codebrew search/code as patrix answered), you could browse the strongformulas on GitHub/strong to see which packages are available â€” and emhow/em they will be installed.  strongNote:/strong GitHub lists only the first 1000 files from a directory; which is far less than the number of Homebrew Formulae (3111 and counting).
