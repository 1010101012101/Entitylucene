How to disable voice dictation on an iPhone 4S running iOS 5.1 or later? <body> When the keyboard is active on my iPhone 4S (running jailbroken iOS 5.1.1 / 6.1.1), there is a key between the space bar and the numeric entry toggle. This key has a microphone on it and tapping it opens voice dictation.  How do you prevent this key from showing up?  Note that the instructions at http://osxdaily.com/2012/05/04/turn-off-dictation-on-ipad-iphone/ do strongnot/strong work; the Keyboard menu does not contain a Dictation toggle.  <answer79054> Disabling Siri is the only way I can think of. Go to Settings  General  Siri  slide the switch to Off  <answer79063> There are four things that you can try:  h2Disable Siri/h2  You can disable Dictation by disabling Siri. Navigate to Settings  General  Siri and turn Siri "Off".  h2Update PList File/h2  However, understandably, you may want to use Siri, and since you have a jailbroken phone, this appears possible by editing a .plist.  As per this MacRumors post, edit the file code/User/Library/Preferences/com.apple.keyboard.plist/code. Edit it to add the following lines inside of the code&lt;dict&gt;/code block:  precode&lt;key&gt;DictationOnSpaceKey&lt;/key&gt; &lt;false/&gt; /code/pre  h2Update a different file/h2  Using iFile, edit the file /Users/Library/ConfigurationProfiles/UserSettings.plist  Set coderestrictedBool &gt; allowDictation &gt; value/code to Off or false. It should look like this:  precode&lt;key&gt;allowDictation&lt;/key&gt; &lt;dict&gt;   &lt;key&gt;value&lt;/key&gt;   &lt;false/&gt; &lt;/dict&gt; /code/pre  h2Install "NoDictation"/h2  NoDictation is a free jailbreak tweak available from the BigBoss repos (available by default on most iOS jailbreaks). If neither of the previous options work, it may.  <answer152954> Settings  General  Keyboard  Enable Dictation - Switch it to off.  <comment91372> Not sure why you want to do this. The keyboard detects when you are typing and makes the dictation button activate the space bar. <comment91379> @corvec, Interesting. What about post #11 (the last one, and by Intell) on the post that I linked to? Does that work? EDIT: I see you found that before my comment. Let me know what happens. <comment91385> @KevinChen, that's accurate if I'm typing quickly. If I'm typing more slowly, when I pause the dictation button is again active. <comment91386> It also makes a really annoying noise when this happens, even with my phone on silent. <comment91393> @corvec, have you looked in (Restrictions) Parental Controls? I can't look myself this moment but I suppose it's possible that functionality could be disabled in there. <comment91482> @corvec, Try enabling restrictions, set a password **you will remember**, and then see if Dictation is in there. I doubt it is but it is worth looking. It's looking like Dictation and Siri are +/- one entity. <comment91486> let us [continue this discussion in chat](http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/7139/discussion-between-corvec-and-bassplayer7) <comment180096> Per the OP's question, they are not seeing the setting you reference in your answer. <comment180129> Sorry tubedogg-I see that now. Sorry. I just did that though, and it worked for me. Go figure. :) <comment180418> As of iOS 8.1 on an iPhone 6+, those instructions work - so that's something, at least.
