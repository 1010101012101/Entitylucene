After using `networksetup -setdnsservers Wi-Fi "8.8.8.8" "8.8.4.4"` how do I clear them? <body> I'm looking to script a temporary DNS server change to override the DHCP response I get from the network. I've figured out I can use codenetworksetup/code but once we're done testing. Before I push to production, I figure I should know how to undo this.  How can I script to clear these changes and restore the settings the network provides now as if I never ran the following script?  precodenetworksetup -setdnsservers Wi-Fi "8.8.8.8" "8.8.4.4" /code/pre  It's not feasible to save any the previous settings and I'm looking to remove the setting so that the actual new values can be retrieved from the network as opposed to saving what the settings were previously so I don't save an old value that is no longer correct.  Basically, I'm looking to codeipconfig /renew/code on macOS.  <answer288966> ul liCreate a new network service with the respective interface (e.g. en1 = AirPort):  codesudo networksetup -createnetworkservice Wi-Fi2 en1/code/li liRemove the one with the custom DNS settings:  codesudo networksetup -removenetworkservice Wi-Fi/code/li liRename the new network service to the original name:  codesudo networksetup -renamenetworkservice Wi-Fi2 Wi-Fi/code/li /ul  In my environment the new service fetched DHCP and its new settings automatically. You may have to set it with codesudo networksetup -setdhcp Wi-Fi/code explicitly or look at the DHCP response for the interface and parse the supplied DNS ip(s) with codeipconfig getpacket en1/code though.  <comment365020> Now that’s elegant - no need to remove a setting if the interface can be disposable. Next steps is I will have to test if this is reliable when we script this remotely, but it’s probably no more dangerous than my “test” settings.
