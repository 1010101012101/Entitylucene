Any idea what this sound is? <body> Sometimes my MBP plays this somewhat distressing sound through its speakers (external if connected, otherwise internal, if my system volume is not muted).  Has anyone experienced this? What is it?  [Listen to the sound here.]  Things that make me doubt it has to do with the electrical system:  ol liThe fact this seems to be emanating from my system (affects either internal or external speakers)/li liThe precise, musical, repeating nature of the sound/li liThat it has occurred on battery power at my girlfriend’s as well as in my house (plugged in). /li /ol  Makes me wish there was an app like Little Snitch but for audio output instead of network traffic…  <answer13998> Definitely computer-generated.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/47De1.png" alt="Spectrogram"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zvdCy.png" alt="Melodic-range spectrogram"  <answer14002> Sounds like a dashboard widget that is making sound when not in the dashboard, I have heard stuff like this from say an asteroids widget.  <answer14868> It’s the “strongInactivity Sound/strong,” called “Bass,” that Assistly plays by default when  you haven’t been using it for a few hours.  And I thought my computer was overheating!  I can’t understand why anyone would make a web app that non-obviously plays a emrepeating, scary sound on repeat hours after the user last interacted with it./em    Terrible.  Anyway, that’s one mystery solved.  You can +1 my relevant feedback to Assistly here.  <comment14974> That's a really odd sound... <comment14991> Pretty sure that "mysql" is the wrong tag. :) <comment14995> @MatthewFrederick MY System's Queer Language? <comment15001> Good thought -- it does sound rather "game-like". <comment15002> Off topic, but what program did you use for the FFTs? <comment15025> @Fake Name [Sonic Visualiser](http://www.sonicvisualiser.org/) <comment15042> Did I tag it “mysql”? I tried to tag it “mystery” and gave up because that’s not a real tag; it must have auto-completed to “mysql” for me. <comment15043> Not a bad guess at all, but my only dashboard widgets are iStat Nano & Apple’s default calendar widget. <comment15136> Damn! I thought I had the magic answer :( <comment15137> Wiretap studio DOES have application specific recording, and will record only the audio from that process. You could try the trial. <comment16003> It sounds so... sad  :'( <comment16004> Ha! Good detective work.
