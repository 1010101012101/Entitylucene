Many Flash Player Devices show up on Desktop <body> I logged my user out, logged back in and suddenly tons of Flash Player devices appear that were not there before.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ocAXX.png" alt="Many flash players suddenly on desktop"    Anyone an idea what happened and what I could do so that it never happens again?br I'm using a MacBook Pro, OSX 10.11.5  <comment358068> Did you add Flash Player to your start up items? Take a look at the Login Items: By navigating to System Preferences  Users & Groups  your username, and then click on the Login Items tab. Also, show us a screenshot from your Applications/Utilities/Activity Monitor. Please provide more information about your system. <comment358078> It's not in the Login Items tab, I never added it knowingly anywhere. I added a bigger screenshot now including the activity monitor, if you need any other information let me know because I have no idea what could be helpful in order to understand the cause of this issue.
