mac pro 3,1 early 2008 to power 4K video wall, how to select graphics cards? <body> This is a question for anyone who installs video walls or has set up multiple monitors in the past powered by a Mac pro computer. The case has 5 bays available, as you know, and wonder if fewer cards are easier to work with, the ones with many HDMI or mini display ports or spread the graphics demands over many cards. Currently I use 2 monitors off one card and also wonder if the OS allows multiple screens for 1 "desktop" or do I need to find 3rd party software. What is the best option if I want to configure 4 or 6 HD 4K monitors (with tiny bezels) to create a video wall for myself? Thanks!  <comment327196> What app will drive the video? Once you have that solved all the card buying will be pretty easy based on how many pixels they can drive and what cables you choose to connect. <comment327244> To add to @bmike, most PC graphics cards work in Mac Pros, they just won't show boot screens. Your limiting factor will likely be PCIe power, as there are only two six-pin power ports built into the Mac Pro. (I run an Nvidia Quadro K1200 in my Mac Pro tower.) <comment327250> From the specs the power limit is 300watts from what I read. As for software, I was hoping an expert reading this could suggest something. I am not that familiar with newest version of QuickTime and what it can do.
