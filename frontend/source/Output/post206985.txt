How can I review the most recently shown dialog box in OS X? <body> I was just typing a long string of text into an input field in Chrome. I saw my screen flash briefly and the shape of a dialog box appear, but before I could stop typing I had already hit some key that closed the box (I'm guessing space, but possibly a letter or even enter).  How can I find out what the dialog box said and what action I took to close it?  I'm using OS X Yosemite 10.10.5.  <answer233410> Unfortunately, I have to inform you, that there's strongno/strong such possibility in OS X Yosemite. Operating system doesn't log this type of event for dialog windows.  The information you have - is not even enough to understand who fired this window to popup: was it dialog box, was it OSX window, was it another program with informational message which raised the popup, or it was simply styled popup/popover of the web-page you've been.  All OSX can do - is to reopen regular windows, programs, restore console, etc, when you reboot Mac OS X with a checkbox next to em“Reopen windows when logging back in”/em that restores all of your currently open applications and windows. This state is stored, but not for emdialog/em windows.  <comment286042> Do you have a source or evidence that supports your answer? <comment286168> @tubes, I'm sorry, but what kind of evidence do you need? I'm sure in it, as well as other guys, who up-voted and haven't left any better answers/objections. The nature of the **dialogs** is almost the same in all the Operating Systems, not only in OS X: OS itself doesn't log it, unless the Application does it explicitly. The state of the applications could be restored in some cases, but never for a dialogs. The information you have now - is not even enough to say what triggered this popup, see the details in my answer. <comment286171> When I say about specific nature of dialogs themselves, I mean something, that's written in every book on programming, and doesn't really dependent on the platform you are using: *A **Dialog window** is an independent subwindow meant to carry **temporary** notice apart from the main Application Window.*. <comment305478> [Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?AbsenceOfEvidenceIsNotEvidenceOfAbsence)
