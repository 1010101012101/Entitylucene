nsurlsessiond process in iMac (OSX Capitan) <body> I have a 10 Mps ADSL and since a month I experience a very bad bandwidth (down to 1,5/0,08 Mbps and large latencies (1,500 ms) measured with Pings. I have asked for a solution to the Internet operator without results until today that an operator technician suggested me to look if there were some application or process bandwidth hungry after detecting that was the iMac the cause. I started OSX Activity Monitor and I saw that the process nsurlsessiond was up/downloading a lot of Mb and the Avast daemond was doing so. And also I had problems with AVASTSECURELINE (VPN).  I close iCloud session and after a while the latency and bandwidth of ADSL went to normal situation ( 8/0,8 Mbps and 50 ms latency). The nsurlsessiond finished its synchronization.  Why that design?. This does not happen with Dropbox.  This does not occurs in my iMacBookAir (Sierra)  <comment356280> Are you asking why Avast developed their application that way or why iCloud was developed that way?  It's a bit unclear from your question. <comment356286> Avast is a well-known resource hog. Simplest fix would be another antivirus.
