How to gain insight into spotlight index? <body> I'd like to get a list of all indexed files and their path that spotlight came across. How would I do that ? mdutil does not seem to be of any help.    <answer178200> This command will list all files indexed by spotlight system:  precodemdfind "kMDItemDisplayName == '*'" /code/pre  To store the output in a file:  precodemdfind "kMDItemDisplayName == '*'" &gt; listOfFiles.txt /code/pre
