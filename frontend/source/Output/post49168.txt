Holding the mouse button automatically on OSX <body> Is there some sort of app that will let me, preferably toggleable with a keyboard shortcut, hold down the left mouse button? (Not click fast, just hold down).  <answer49171> Will the default double tap to drag work for you? You can enable it in System PreferencesUniversal Access:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xQ57T.jpg" alt=""  <comment56290> Great idea, works perfectly! <comment56327> @JJ56 Awesome! (would you upvote the answer too? Thanks!) <comment190290> I have enabled "Dragging (with Drag Lock)" but when i double-tap, nothing happens.  It's as if the left mouse button isn't being held down at all!
