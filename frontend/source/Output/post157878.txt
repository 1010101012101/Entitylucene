Keyboard backlit light control from command line <body> Is there any command to control the intensity of keyboard light of a MacBook Pro?   <answer158000> Have you tried the f5 key?  That changes my keyboard light.  <answer213303> I haven't found a great solution yet. Here is some information that can help:  ul liApparently there is a solution for Ubuntu on MacBooks. /li liLab Tick runs on OS X but unfortunately not command-line (nor open source)./li licodebrightness/code is free software to control the display brightness./li /ul  This turns off automatic backlight in low light:  precodedefaults write com.apple.BezelServices kDim -bool false /code/pre  This turns off keyboard illumination when computer is not used for 1 second:  precodedefaults write com.apple.BezelServices kDimTime -int 1 /code/pre  But ideally I would just turn off the illumination under all circumstances. And I haven't found a CLI solution for that - yet.  <comment185817> This does not remotely answer the question. He asked for a solution from the command line not from the keyboard function key. <comment185877> As @JashJacob said, I need the command to do that. Actually i want to add that command to my customized shutdown command so that whenever I start my MBP from shutting down, it starts with minimum backlit light. <comment257534> Not sure whether this will still work (and don't have time to check), but there's some code here: http://osxbook.com/book/bonus/chapter10/light/
