It's owned by root.  Change the owner to gaurav with:  precodesudo chown gaurav:staff ~/.ssh/config /code/pre  enter your password and it will work (if you are a sudoer).  <comment353237> It is completed thanks . Now i am able to do . Once more thing giving ownership to current_user is it safe in case of SSH <comment353239> @twister_void I don't really understand your question in the comment. Please add a second question regarding security issues (of the config file?) on the main (apple.stackexchange) site.
