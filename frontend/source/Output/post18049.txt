Is there a shortcut to expand all folders in Finder's list view? <body> I have my Finder window set up to display in "list" view so that it shows all folders with triangles on the left to click to expand. I have a number of levels of nested folders. Is there any way (keyboard shortcut, menu item, etc.) to expand all, so I don't have to click through each level to see the files contained?  <answer18054> Select the folder you want (or kbdcommand/kbd + kbdA/kbd to select all) and then press:  ul likbdCommand/kbd + kbdright arrow/kbd/li /ul  And the left arrow undoes what the right arrow did, should you want to close things back up again.  <answer170908> I find mouse/trackpad-clicking the triangle while holding the Alt/Option or Command key works too.  <comment19729> Thanks! I was hoping it was something simple like that. <comment134253> [option] + [right arrow] is enough <comment188326> [option] + [right arrow] expands all subdirectories as well, whereas [command]+[right arrow] expands only the selected directories <comment236413> This is a much better solution if you wanna expand the whole tree, including sub-trees! <comment372110> option click recursively expands all subfolders whereas option right arrow expands all the selected folders but not the subfolders
