Dreamweaver CS6 for mac <body> Dose any one know the shortcut key for opening a file from the "files" browser?  I tried Command+O but that open the location in finder instead of dreamweaver.  Or how to change it to the enter key?  Thanks  <answer112794> You can change the shortcut key for FileOpen.  Click on Dreamweaver Menu. Select Keyboard Shortcuts. Then you will get a window as shown in the picture. You can change the shortcut there. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kHWUc.png" alt="Keyboard Shortcuts, DW"  <answer112795> Ive look at the shortcuts tab and found nothing for the files window. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gVGMQ.jpg" alt="Files Sidebar window"  Cmd+O opens the finder file window, and lets you press enter there. Im asking if there is a shortcut for the files sidebar window?  Thanks   <comment132349> Are you using Cmd+O when the Dreamweaver is active ? Because it is working in my Mac. <comment132421> Yes I am. Might be a setting in Dreamweaver
