Why I cannot play M4A audio on iTunes, but I can play it on QuickTime? <body> I have some M4A audio files, that I can't play on iTunes (e.g. double click the file, and then iTunes fired up, the audio added to the library, but the play doesn't start. Tried double clicking on the audio on the library, still doesn't start the player).  But when I open them in QuickTime, QuickTime can play it. Why that happens? And what can I do about it so I can import those files to iTunes? Thanks.  <answer287545> I had the same problem. Try changing the extension from M4A to MP4. It worked for me.  <comment302085> Where did the `.m4a` file come from? I'd like to see the first 30 bytes of the file, so in a Terminal do the following.  Type `cat `, that's "cat " followed by a _space_. Now drag & drop the `.m4a` file onto the Terminal window and it populates the command line with its _fully qualified pathname_. Now type `| head -c 30 | xxd -p` and press enter.  The output will be in _hex_ format, e.g.: `00000020667479704d344120000000004d3441206d70343269736f6d0000` <comment302406> it's solved now. turns out the file is corrupt, not in the correct size. as far as I know, iTunes should be able to play it though even though when it's incomplete. thanks.
