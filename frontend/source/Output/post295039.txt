Taking long list of repeated values and copying to sorted, unique list <body> Alrighty, I’m working on some homespun financial rejiggering. I have a manually-entered “strongKeyword/strong” column that features many repeated values.  A small sampling:  ul liCleaners/li liCleaners/li liCleaners/li liCell/li liCell/li liCell/li liCell/li liCell/li liCable/li liCable/li liCable/li liCable/li liBand/li liBand/li liATM Fee/li liATM Fee/li liATM Fee/li liATM Fee/li liATM Fee/li liATM Fee/li liAmazon/li liAmazon/li liAmazon/li liAmazon/li liAmazon/li liAmazon/li liAmazon/li /ul  I need to create either another column OR table that takes these many values, de-dupes them and sorts them alphabetically, like this:  ul liCleaners/li liCell/li liCable/li liBand/li liATM Fee/li liAmazon/li /ul  This needs to be done with  formula… not manually or scripted.  Suggestions??  <answer295046> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/PJ1n0.jpg" alt="compoundcriteria"  You can using Access, I dont know if this is what your looking for but it is one way to do it.   <answer295108> This AppleScript uses terms from the AppleScript Toolbox plug-in to function correctly.  I copied your list of duplicates and pasted them between the double quotes in the first line of my code  precodeset theList to paragraphs of "Cleaners\nCleaners\nCleaners\nCell\nCell\nCell\nCell\nCell\nCable\nCable\nCable\nCable\nBand\nBand\nATM Fee\nATM Fee\nATM Fee\nATM Fee\nATM Fee\nATM Fee\nAmazon\nAmazon\nAmazon\nAmazon\nAmazon\nAmazon\nAmazon" set noDupes to AST copy list theList with sorting items without keeping duplicates set text item delimiters to {linefeed} set theList2 to noDupes as text set theList2 to reverse of paragraphs of theList2 set the clipboard to theList2 as text /code/pre  Will return A new list without the duplicates and copy it to your clipboard:  ul liCleaners/li liCell/li liCable/li liBand/li liATM Fee/li liAmazon/li /ul  <comment372379> AppleScript and JavaScript can extract data, sort, inject in a new table. Why cut off the best way to do this? <comment372386> Where do I start with incorporating JS? I could do that in a heartbeat. It just doesn't run real-time with updates, right? And do you have examples? <comment372388> Start with [Apple docs](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/releasenotes/InterapplicationCommunication/RN-JavaScriptForAutomation/Articles/Introduction.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014508) and Sal Saghoian's site https://iworkautomation.com/numbers/index.html <comment372581> Access is Windows only at this point no? Also quite expensive. Thanks for your contribution, though! Cheers
