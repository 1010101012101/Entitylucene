Cannot open Java Preferences <body> I don't know what the problem is. I recently went to Lion (Developer Preview) and restored a fresh new copy of 10.6. I later updated everything and then tried to open Java. It keeps giving me this error.  precodeCannot open Java Preferences 10.6 No compatible version of Java 1.5+ is available /code/pre  I've tried reinstalling the update, but it doesn't do anything.  <answer10987> :P, solved it. I just plugged my 10.6 restore disk in and ran the setup. I then updated the software, and voila, I fixed it.  <answer124633> Launch the preference panel with this terminal command:  precodejavaws -viewer /code/pre
