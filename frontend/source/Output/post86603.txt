How do I add custom DNS server and preserving default DNS of ISP in OS X Mountain Lion <body> I'm using OS X Mountain Lion. I'm using codednsmasq/code to set up wildcard localhost domain names, such as http://local.dev, to point to localhost. But I have to add 127.0.0.1 in my system preference - network settings.  After I set up 127.0.0.1 as the DNS server, the ISP's default DNS servers were over wrote by mine. This was preventing me from accessing websites. It's not a big deal when I don't move my computer, I could manually enter the ISP's DNS server. But if I change places, the ISP's DNS changes.  I also tried to use google's DNS server, but it's not working in some instance. How can I reserve (or update) the ISP's DNS server without deleting 127.0.0.1 as a DNS.  Thank you in advance.  <answer86604> Is there a specific reason for using codednsmasq/code?   You could simply add entries to your code/private/etc/hosts/code file leaving DNS pointed to whichever ISP you happen to be connected to. Here's how to do that using Terminal:  codesudo nano /private/etc/hosts/code Enter you password when prompted.  Add any additions at the end of the hosts file (a single entry per line), for example:  code127.0.0.1   local.dev/code  Control + O and then enter to save the file within nano. Control + X to exit nano.  You'll than need to flush the local DNS cache using: codedscacheutil -flushcache/code  <answer86774> Yep. You can do this, code/etc/resolver/code is your friend.  code$ man 5 resolver/code:      domainbr   Domain name associated with this resolver configuration.   This option is normally not required by the Mac OS X DNS search system when the resolver configuration is read from a file in the /etc/resolver directory.   In that case the file name is used as the domain name.   Simply put you can place codenameserver 127.0.0.1/code inside a file you create called code/etc/resolver/dev/code  You'll need to reload/restart. It'll then direct any requests to code*.dev/code to your local nameserver.  Your network connection DNS remains on automatic, so it will cope with any changes in your environment.  strongEdit:/strong I've just found https://serverfault.com/a/164215/163311 and http://www.echoditto.com/blog/never-touch-your-local-etchosts-file-os-x-again which have a few more details and include codednsmasq/code setup details.  <comment100619> Use hosts file can be a simple solution, but I need to setup wildcard domains such as *.dev to point to localhost. <comment100621> It works, thank you
