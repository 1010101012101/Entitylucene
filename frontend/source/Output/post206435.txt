How can I change the orientation of a picture in the printer menu? <body> In the printer menu I can change the orientation, but that only rotates the paper not the image on the paper. How can I rotate the image itself?  I already tried rotating the image itself, but that did not help. It still wants to print the image with the wrong orientation.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/beMIG.png" alt="enter image description here" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nJPyN.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer206450> Switch off Auto Rotate / Automatisch drehen  You may need to then adjust the Scale to fit the page better - it may depend on whether the entire actual page content is visible.
