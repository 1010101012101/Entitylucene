How to restore or rebuy deleted iTunes audiobook purchase? <body> I lost my copy of a downloaded audio book from iTunes. I also accidentally deleted my computer copy.  I am willing to rebuy the audiobook but iTunes will not let me rebuy the audiobook. It just tells me I have already bought it.  Is there any solution to this issue?  <answer172171> You can't. It's one of the things that you can't re-download from the iTunes Store (others are Tones and iPod games).   <answer235226> You can speak to Apple support. Tell them what happened and they will sometimes allow you to redownload your audiobooks.  <comment285679> This is why I hate apple sometimes.
