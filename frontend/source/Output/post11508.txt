How can I transfer my Google Chrome bookmarks to my iPad? <body> I have been looking around for a method and haven't been able to find one, any suggestions?  <answer11509> Assuming you want to stick with Safari on the iPad, you'll need to sync via iTunes.  Take your Chrome bookmarks and save them to an HTML bookmark file.  Then import these into Safari (on a Mac) or Internet Explorer (on Windows).  Then, in your iTunes sync options, under the Info "tab", choose to sync your bookmarks.  What I personally do, though, is to use Pinboard to store all of my bookmarks online.  I can access it from any device with no syncing required.  <answer11512> If you want them synced (but not built-in Mobile Safari), you may use XMarks.  <answer34819> Use the Apollo browser for iPad.  <answer37814> Maybe someone might be interested.
