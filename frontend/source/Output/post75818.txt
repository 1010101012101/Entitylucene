Why can't I add new m4v videos to my iTunes library? <body> Using iTunes 11.0.1, I tried to add some newly converted movies to my library for consumption on my Apple TV 2. This used to work well: ripping some movies from my DVDs, converting them using HandBrake with the AppleTV or AppleTV 2 setting and adding them to my media library. However, now nothing happens when I add the movie using Cmd-O in iTunes or via Drag-And-Drop from the Finder. Opening the movie via right click in the Finder in iTunes works however, and I can even stream to the AppleTV then. So what's wrong? I checked in the console logs, and can't find any iTunes related error messages.  <answer75836> Are you sure you're looking in the right Media section of your library?  Try looking in Music Videos, TV, etc, in case iTunes is putting it in the "wrong" section.  <answer102775> iTunes doesn't play well with items added via kbd⌘ cmd/kbd+kbdO/kbd, so just transfer your media file into the strongMusic/strong → strongiTunes/strong → strongiTunes Media/strong → strongAutomatically add to iTunes/strong folder. Make sure iTunes is not running when you do this, then when you start it up, it should show the file under 'Movies'.  <answer111097> I've found if you switch to the list view before adding it seems to work much better.  <answer111115> Since iTunes 11 I haven't had these problems anymore. So I guess somewhere along, this seems to have been fixed.  <comment88039> Yes. I even searched in the whole media library using iTunes' search. <comment88305> I just added a bunch of MP4 container files, encoded with HB's H.264 (x264) codec and AC-3 pass thru.  iTunes doesn't normally like AC-3 pass thru (it doesn't usually play), but it added the files just fine.  Try backing up your iTunes Library, and then deleting it (or log in as another/new user).  Does it work with a fresh library? <comment120983> Why do you propose to have iTunes *not* running during the file move? I use it all time with iTunes running and it picks up any files moved into that folder within seconds. <comment120988> I used to do that too and it usually worked, but it occasionally hung iTunes and caused it to be unresponsive. So I've proposed that just to be safe.
