Safari opens bookmarks on search <body> I'm running OS X Yosemite 10.10.1 on my Late-2013 MacBook Pro. A couple of days ago my Safari (8.0.2) started behaving a little weird when searching. This became really annoying and I have no idea how to fix it.  Whenever I search using my address bar and confirm it by pressing codeEnter/code, the bookmarks list opens on top of my search result. I then have to click somewhere in order to close the list. This only happens when searching, not when typing any url's in there.  I don't think this could be a desired behavior for anyone and I have looked at my preferences, but couldn't find any settings related to it.  I hope you can help me to disable it.  <answer178045> Under Safari Preferences - Search - Smart Search Field - uncheck the "Show Favorites" option  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/w4Gcj.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <comment210760> I have the exact same issue, and would be extremely surprised if it were expected behaviour. Is there any solution to this?
