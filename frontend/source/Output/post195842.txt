Possible keylogger? How to remove? <body> I'm tailing var/log/sys.log and I keep getting this message:  precodeJul 13 23:43:52 mac[redacted lol] syslogagent[19960]: Authentication String htt[space added]p://logsviewer.com/membermac/livedesk/arewelive.php?username=  Jul 13 23:43:53 mac[...] syslogagent[19960]: { /code/pre  every 25 seconds or so.  Sometimes it'll include a string of numbers such as:  precodeJul 13 17:50:41 mac[...] syslogagent[19960]: Authentication String htt[space added]p://logsviewer.com/membermac/livedesk/arewelive.php?username=  Jul 13 17:50:41 mac[...] syslogagent[19960]: 2147483647  Jul 13 17:50:42 mac[...] syslogagent[19960]: { /code/pre  And as I was writing this it changed (for the first time since I caught it about 9 hours ago today, although after the tail logfile turned over and I restarted it) its process ID number to [21174]  After some intensive googling I found out that this URL roughly matches that which occurs in the SniperSpy spyware program.  First of all, am I correct. Second of all, I ran Sophos and nothing came up. Third, is it even functionally installed because the message makes it seem like it maybe didn't get fully installed. Fourth, how do I remove it?  <answer195852> There's a huge possibility that you have a spyware. Please check this link.     It is an Application named "SysLogAgent" which is hidden in your home   folder along with files to launch it at startup and when you log in   and none of them were detected as infected.   strongHow to remove (Spyware.SniperSpy.B - Removal)?/strong Please check this link.  <comment233862> @soren After removing Spyware.SniperSpy.B check the app(s) you installed on 13th of July and/or the website(s) you visited immediately before you got infected.
