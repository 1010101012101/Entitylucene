Is there a sandboxing program like Sandboxie for Mac? <body> With Sandboxie for Windows, you are able to run applications that you don't entirely trust in a sandbox; it tracks all files the program creates and modifies, and although the files technically go to the system, you can roll back the changes by deleting this sandbox. This removes all the files created by the program and restores modified files to their previous state. In a way, it's like a system restore when you restore the system to a previous point; in this case, it would only restore the files that the program in question affected, so is much easier to use. At least, that's how I understand it works.  On macOS, there are three(ish) ways to do this I know of:  ol liMake a Time Machine backup, and then install the program. After using it, restore from the backup and everything will come out intact as it was before./li liUse a VM to run it in; however, I'd like to avoid doing this as it complicates matters greatly/li liUse AppCleaner to remove files the program left behind. However, this doesn't do anything for files the program (perhaps maliciously?) modified, and if you install a program with administrative privileges or a package, it most likely will install files in the system that AppCleaner won't be able to get out. Also, I'm not sure if it is 100% accurate for normal apps, anyway./li /ol  So is there any way to do this on a Mac without using a VM?
