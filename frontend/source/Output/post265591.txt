Move iTunes media files to a different location <body> I'm organising my iTunes media in two folder myself code/Volumes/Data/Music/code and code/Volumes/Data/OtherMusic/code. My 2nd hard-drive port (yes, the port, not the HDD itself) died so I copied all music to codeVolumes/System/Users/Me/Music/Music/code and codeVolumes/System/Users/Me/Music/OtherMusic/code  How do I change all tracks in the library to be connected to the new location strongWITHOUT/strong  ul liconsolidating all files/li liloosing playlists/li lichanging the folder structure/li /ul  if I have to tinker with bash and RegEx that is fine too.  <answer265668> Step 1: Install iTunes  Step 2: Move any new content  Step 3: Copy the iTunes backup from your old computer  Step 4 (optional): Add back new content  <comment333006> Have you tried in the iTunes Preferences  Advanced and then change the iTunes Media folder location with the one you have copied. <comment333007> There's a long [& ultimately unsatisfying] method here - http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/230207/how-to-share-an-itunes-library-between-mac-windows/230208#230208 It used to work better before iTunes 12.3 :/ It doesn't answer your question directly, but gives a working method for manual data management. <comment333010> @Tetsujin This is really unsatisfying so I'm better off giving in and let iTunes manage the music itself? <comment333011> 'Better off'... in terms of convenience I'd say yes. iTunes is really meant to be a 'set & forget' experience. Trying to keep a track of its foibles manually is not the most fun you can have on a rainy afternoon. Having said that, I still, to this day, have a Win PC using the same 'repository' as my Mac & I still periodically go through all that to keep it in approximate sync. <comment333017> btw, your 'difficulty' is really only that you are trying to maintain two library folders in one library. If you merge [or possibly even just consolidate] them, iTunes can then take over with no issues <comment333024> I always took pride that I had all the bullshit music in another folder but I guess it is time to move beyond that for convenience sake ...
