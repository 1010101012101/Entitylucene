Safari 7.0.4 doesn't remember my login status. "Remember me" not working (OS X 10.9.3) <body> The problem is that I must press "log in"/"sign in" button on most web-services again and again per day. All login/passwords are stored successfuly but the feature which is often called "remember me" doesn't works. What could be the reason for this bug? In before: the cookies are enabled.  UPD I must say that I have an iPhone and an iPad with enabled keychain sharing via iCloud but the problem I have on the mac never happens on my devices. Maybe it will helps.  <answer134616> My best recommendation is to use Chrome on Mac OS. If you have a google account it syncs all your passwords and more across all devices. I'm an apple guy across the board and I use chrome for web browsing for exactly the issues you mentioned.   <answer136657> I can't believe I've finally fixed the bug.  Follow these steps:  ol ligo to Disk utility/li liselect your disk on the left list/li lipress "Repair Disk Permissions" on the right view/li /ol  here is the screenshot http://monosnap.com/image/5aVsTd4te6SD6Tp1UuxjyIi3ov1xHs.png  Hope this helps somebody!  <comment159352> This doesn't answer the question, but it would make an alright comment. <comment159388> The chrome works perfectly indeed. But I hate it for the unoptimized power usage which is critical on the laptop <comment159424> What are your cookie settings? <comment159448> @MaxRied as I said `In before: the cookies are enabled.`
