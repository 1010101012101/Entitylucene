Finder window does not remember size. Yosemite <body> Window Finder periodically receives the default size . I updated to Yosemite clean and updated, but it is repeated. Removes p.list, D_Store: sudo find / -name ".DS_Store" -depth -exec rm {} \; contents of folders Preference, the result is 0 the error persists . Who has this bug , is there a solution? Thank you all .  <answer154869> I'm not sure I understand your question: You want Finder windows to be of a certain size even after closing them?  Try holding the option key while dragging to resize, then immediately after that close all finder windows, and relaunch.  <answer164173> ol liDo a backup in case you mess up.
