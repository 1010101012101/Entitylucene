Long command in terminal.app cause a bug <body> If I am in the last line of Terminal.app and enter a long command, it does not create new line, but instead overwrites the same line.  How can I solve this bug?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/auOpF.png" alt="Terminal.app Screenshot with stacked command lines"  <answer38363> I have a hunch that this is primarily caused by your accented characters (çã) in your directory name, because this is not a problem by default:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/sXMyT.png" alt="Terminal.app multi-line screenshot"  Special characters, unprintable or otherwise, frequently cause problems with classic terminals / shells.  Try opening a new terminal tab/window, and see if this problem occurs immediately, or if it doesn't occur until after you enter a directory with special characters.  <comment43438> Wow.. You are correct.. You fix the bug!!! I have to rename the folder.
