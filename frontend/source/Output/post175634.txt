All downloaded files cannot be opened as they are 'damaged and should be moved to the Trash' <body> Everything I download will not open. OS X says the file is damaged and can't be opened and should be moved to the Trash. Like Adobe Reader, for PDF documents. JPEG files will not open. Office files will not open. Yet the thumbnail preview is perfect and I can flip the pages to see the information is there. I tried to download OpenOffice for the Office documents but it says the same thing, damaged, cannot open, should be moved to the Trash.  supMacBook Air with Mountain Lion/sup  <answer175740> I got the same message today as well. This worked for me:     To get around this, temporarily disable Gatekeeper as follows:      ol   liopen System Preferences and the 'Security &amp; Privacy' options/li   liClick the padlock at the bottom if it is locked/li   liSet 'Allow applications downloaded from:' to 'Anywhere'./li   liKeep that open, but go back to your finder window/li   liOpen JOSM.app it should work this time ...although you still get:           "JOSM.app" is an application downloaded from the Internet. Are you sure you want to open it? - Click 'Open'   /li   liNow re-enable gatekeeper back in the settings window. Put it back to the default "Mac App Store and identified developers" /li   /ol   I found that on this site - https://help.openstreetmap.org/questions/21301/josmapp-is-damaged-and-cant-be-opened-you-should-move-it-to-the-trash  <answer235612> h3Turn off the "Allow apps only from Mac App Store" in System Preferences./h3  This seemed to work for me.  Yes, I know that it wasn't a code.app/code file, but that didn't seem to matter.  Note: I found this out after the bounty.  I still would like to see a better answer, maybe with a cause.  <answer236357> The problem that you are running into is that Gatekeeper is trying to protect you from malware and not only  doesn't recognize the developer "signature" of the App you downloaded it "sees" the file was modified by someone/something other than the developer.  Gatekeeper options are found in strongApple menu  System Preferences…  Security &amp; Privacy  General/strong tab (El Capitan shown below) under the header "Allow applications downloaded from:"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/RzAYO.png" alt="Security &amp; Privacy Settings"  Even with Gatekeeper turned off, if you get the "Damaged App" message, you still won't be able to open the file  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GDIBd.png" alt="App is damaged"  Per Apple's Support site:     "Damaged" app. – The app has been altered by something other than the developer. This message will appear no matter the Gatekeeper option chosen.   h2Making Gatekeeper more friendly..../h2  The solution to this is in the codeinfo.plist/code found inside the app.  If you set the following key values in codeinfo.plist/code, the App will revert to an "Unsigned App" and allow you to install it.  precode&lt;key&gt;CFBundleSignature&lt;/key&gt;  &lt;string&gt;????&lt;/string&gt; /code/pre  strongWhere is the codeinfo.plist/code file located?/strong  It's located in the root folder of your App and will be prefaced with the App Name:   code{My-App-info.plist}/code  strongNOTE:/strong  You will need a program like TextWrangler (free) to open .plist files or the Property List Editor available in XCode.  (My preference is to go with TextWrangler)  h2Opening the file..../h2  Once you edit that file and save it, you will be able to open it by kbdControl/kbd clicking (or right clicking) the App and selecting open.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YuRlS.png" alt="Unidentified Developer"  h2Standard Disclaimer/h2  Gatekeeper is there to protect your Mac from the malware that's ever increasing on the Internet.  strongYou should only use this solution with Apps that you fully trust./strong  If you are just randomly downloading software and using this solution to bypass Gatekeeper, you will end up with a compromised system.  strongSo, use at your own risk./strong  <comment207183> from where are you downloading? what is your setting in the Security & Privacy for downloads. How are you connecting to the Internet? <comment207185> Welcome to Ask Different! Whilst information about your machine is useful in helping diagnose a problem, please use a title specific and appropriate to the actual problem you are facing so that this question can be found by others. <comment207347> Since it's happening on all files, it's not the same problem described for JOSM.app. On the other hand, it's possible there's a problem with the system's security policy database, and switching gatekeeper off & back on *might* rebuild the relevant part of that... <comment207348> To get more information about the problem, open the Console utility and report any messages that appear as you try to open files. Also, open the Terminal utility, enter the command "spctl --assess -vv " (including the space at the end, but not the quotes around it), then drag a downloaded file from the Finder into the Terminal window (this'll paste in the file's path), then reselect the Terminal window and press return. Let us know what it prints. <comment247457> @GordonDavisson Indeed it says permission denied. I'm using an iMac from my university and I guess that's why the problem occurred. <comment288496> You can also disable Gatekeeper for a single file by right-clicking and choosing "open", rather than needing to change the system-wide setting. <comment288774> Hw does that differ from the other answer? <comment288820> @Mark he describes it as helping with JOSM.app, I am point out it helps with all downloads.
