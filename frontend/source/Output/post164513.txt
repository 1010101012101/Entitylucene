iCloud won't let me backup my iPod <body> iCloud won't let me backup my iPod due to "insufficient space", but it won't let me delete any of the data when I go to Manage Storage! I don't want to buy more storage, but I don't know why it won't let me delete any data. It keeps saying that the app cannot be deleted at this time. Can somebody please tell me why this is happening and what I should do?  <comment192901> Did you try a power off and on or hard reset?  solves lots of weirdnesses...
