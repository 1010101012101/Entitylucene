Mackie Blackjack Audio Interface Only Recognized During Hard Boot <body> I have a Mackie Onyx Blackjack audio interface that is only being recognized on my mid 2012 Mackbook Pro Retina when it's plugged in before a hard boot. This same interface is detected without issue by my early 2011 MBP, and I used to have no problems with recognition until recently.  I upgraded from Mountain Lion to Mavericks hoping it might resolve the issue, but the problem persists.  Almost everything I'm finding online regarding similar issues pertains to an interface with special drivers where upgrading the drivers fixes the problem. Mackie states that the built in drivers are all that's needed, and does not provide any OSX drivers for my interface.  Any ideas on what I can do to get this computer to recognize the interface every time it's plugged in again?
