Copy iTunes playlists to external USB flash drive <body> I have lots of playlists on my iTunes library, and I want to be able to copy the music of certain playlists to a flash drive to play on a stereo system. I have too many songs in too many folders to just copy the raw .mp3 files, so that option is out. Any other ideas?  <answer18898> iTunesExport is a Java program that you can use to export iTunes playlists including the music files to a specific directory or drive.  If you regularly want to export iTunes playlists the iTunesExport command line version makes it easy to create bash scripts you can reuse.  <answer18911> Unless I miss something, you can just drag &amp; drop the playlist to your USB drive.   <comment20840> I don't know why, but I couldn't the first time. I decided to try again, and it just started copying :S I have no idea what changed
