Two Google Drive accounts <body> I am trying to enable two Google Drive accounts (private and work) following these steps. In addition, I did chown to my main account (user), and chmod appropriately. However, it seems to me that the second account is not synced until I actually switch to that second user. Anyone with similar experience? Any solution? Thanks!  <answer264548> Two solutions:  (A) This one (Being a few terminal commands you can run)  OR  (B) Buying this app called Insynchq for $25/yr (15 day trial avail.)  <comment340792> Any thoughts about ExpanDrive and CyberDuck? I know they deal with the issue differently but offer comparable results so to say.
