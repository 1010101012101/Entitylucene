What is the purpose of "Apply Rules" in mail? <body> The Mail client (that comes with Mac OS X) has an "Apply Rules" menu option, but I don't see any option to create a rule like most other mail clients have. Two part question, what rules does the "Apply Rules" menu option apply, and how do I define new rules in Mail?  <answer47557> To add a rule in Mail, open Mail preferences (strongMail  Preferences…/strong or kbd⌘/kbd+kbd,/kbd) and go to the Rules pane.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/P1IpC.png" alt="Preferences"  The Apply Rules function applies to all rules whose "Active" checkbox is ticked.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zQzsc.png" alt="enter image description here"
