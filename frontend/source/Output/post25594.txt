equivalent of windows+L in osx snow leopard <body>    strongPossible Duplicate:/strongbr   Is there a quick way to lock my Mac?       whenever i used to leave my system i just press kbdWINDOWS/kbd+kbdL/kbd in my windows system. Now i have macbook pro with snow leopard OS and i am searching for equivalent of windows+l.  So my question is what is the keyboard shortcut to lock macbook pro?   i know the shortcut kbdCOMMAND/kbd+kbdSHIFT/kbd+kbdQ/kbd. But this shortcut is for logout not to lock the system.  <answer25596> kbdcontrol/kbd+kbdshift/kbd+kbdeject/kbd sets the display to sleep. If you have then the option "Require password immediately after sleep or screen saver begins" set in "Security &amp; Privacy" it will lock your machine.  This will only put the display to sleep not the system: not exactly what you asked but the additional screen sleep is not bad (less energy consumption :-)  There are other answers here that point out ways to establish a automation to lock the screen from a keyboard command of your choosing. See  ul liIs there a quick way to lock my Mac?/li liLock screen with LaunchBar/li lihttps://superuser.com/questions/45740/fast-user-switching-apple-menu/li /ul  The last two show several methods to script this. You can then use LaunchBar or FastScripts or another tool to launch the action you prefer.  <answer25597> There isn't really a "lock" feature in Mac OS X. Your best option is to enable the "Require password after sleep or screen saver begins" option in System Preferences  Security &amp; Privacy  General. Then, either put the screen or entire computer to sleep. To put just the screen to sleep from the keyboard, type kbdShift/kbd+kbdControl/kbd+kbdEject/kbd. This will make the screen go blank, but your computer will still be running. To put the entire computer to sleep, type kbdCommand/kbd+kbdOption/kbd+kbdEject/kbd. This will cause all running processes to stop until the computer is woken up.  <comment28982> This question has been answered over at Superuser SE.

Actually I like more my option as it also sends to sleep my screen and does not require much configuration. Depends if Vivart wants exactly the same as WINDOWS+L or just wants to lock the Mac before going away (as I do) <comment28985> kbd does not work in comments, unfortunately. <comment28987> I'd leave this as not a duplicate, personally. I didn't know windows + L was a keyboard shortcut to lock the computer. Yes - it's the same answer, but the search terms to get to it seem quite different to me... <comment28988> @bmike there's also the "windows+L" keyword in the other question. <comment28990> So there is - I stand corrected and convinced :-) Thanks <comment29027> I think you meant control, not command.  :-) <comment29029> @Harv: ooops, thanks
