How do I make an ISO image out of a folder using Toast? <body> I've seen guides on how to do it using Disk Utility and the hdutil command but when I search the net for something that involves using toast, I came up blank.  I've looked around toast (version 11) and I don't see a way of doing it.  Can you help? Thanks  <answer162334> Toast has never used .iso format, it uses its own proprietary .toast format.  You can convert back to .dmg or .iso from .toast using something like DiskImageMounter but not the other way round.  <comment136048> Why do you want to do it in Toast specifically? <comment136116> because I want to use toast? because I wanna know if it's possible using toast?
