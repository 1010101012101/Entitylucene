What will be stored in the users.dmg file I'm creating via Disk Utility? <body> I accidentally deleted some library files from my Mac (running macOS 10.10.1).   As a result it's now not turning on, so I pressed kbdcmd/kbd+kbdR/kbd while booting and entered Recovery Mode.   I wanted to copy all the data from my Mac to an external hard disk, so I went into Disk Utility and selected: strongFile  New  Disk Image from Folder/strong and then browsed to the user's folder to open that to create the disk image of. Now it is creating stronguser.dmg/strong on my external hard disk .   strongMy question is:/strong- What will be included in this users.dmg? Will it contain all the files on the user's desktop, outlook, etc?  <comment369872> 10.10.1  what i did is file-new-disk image from Folder - select user folder-Click the Image Format pop-up (Read/write). <comment369876> It's still unclear what *select user (or users in another version) folder* means! There is a /Volumes/%Volume_name%/Users folder as well as your home folder /Volumes/%Volume_name%/Users/%username% and maybe the home folders of other users on the main (broken) boot volume and probably two usr folders. <comment369881> It's real simple, the .dmg file will contain the contents of the folder you selected. If you are unsure of what the .dmg file contains, then open the file and see what it contains.
