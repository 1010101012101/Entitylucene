Searching for apps that will run on an original iPhone – excluding apps that will not run on iOS 3.1.3 <body> h1Apps for an old iPhone/h1  I'd like to strongseek and find apps that will work on iOS 3.1.3/strong – without wasting time browsing apps that will not. And without a jailbreak.   Apple's App Store appears to lack this capability – no filtering out of incompatible apps, even when using the Store on the handset.   I found one answer … additional answers will be greatly appreciated.   Thanks  h2Background/h2  VintApps 3.1.3 might have been ideal. I never tried it.   There's an iOS category at MacUpdate but the filters are nothing like what's required.   h3Note/h3  I'll use my first generation iPhone for as long as it continues to work as well as it does. So please, no answers that suggest an alternative iPhone.   <answer130117> Seeking an alternative to VintApps 3.1.3 led me to older Apps – MacRumors Forums (2013-11-05), there's a link to an strongApple Club/strong article:   h1Finding iOS Apps Compatible with Older Devices/h1  First impressions: useful, US-oriented.   Adapted from what's there: I could use a Google UK search, such as the one below, as a basis for finding compatible apps in the UK App Store:   https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=site%3Aitunes.apple.com%2Fgb%2F%20%22requires%20ios%202.0%7C2.1%7C2.2%7C3.0%7C3.1%22  … for example, a search for carshare-related apps.  hr  Still, I'd prefer an app – ideally for OS X – with a smart user interface.   <answer130167> AppTimeMachine,  Blackout Store,  3Store   All of these require jailbreak...  Or, you can use this guy's list:  http://www.ifans.com/forums/threads/apps-for-idevices-running-ios-3-1-3.392703/  <comment152461> Thanks … it's standard iOS 3.1.3, without a jailbreak. I edited the question to make this clear.
