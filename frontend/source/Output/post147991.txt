How to restore iMessages from Macbook Pro to Phone? <body> I just updated to iOS 8.0.2, and it really screwed up my phone to the point that I had to restore my phone from a backup.   Now, my iMessages on my iPhone are only up to the date of my last backup, while my iMessages are all up to date on my MBP.   Is there a way to sync up the messages from my MBP to my iPhone so I can have all of my recent text messages?
