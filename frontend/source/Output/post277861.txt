Late 2010 iMac constantly freezing <body> I've had my iMac since 2010 without ever experiencing problems like this before. I understand that my machine is relatively old now (what with all the updates being released) and I haven't been able to update its' system for about two years now. However, it never caused me any issues and was running satisfactory to my needs all until a few days ago when I did the mistake of downloading Skype...  Shortly after running the app, my system froze up to the point where none of the apps were responding, let alone my cursor, so I had to force shutdown my computer. When I turned my iMac back on, it would hang on the spinning beach ball once the desktop loaded. Again, nothing was responsive as my cursor was still on the beach ball.  I've tried all the imaginable troubleshooting tricks; from booting Safe Mode to performing Hardware Tests (which came up clean), to doing codefsck -fy/code in Single-User Mode. Note that the first times I would do the codefsck/code, the message of "File was Modified" did come up and I would repeat the fsck until it would say "Macintosh appears to be ok".   So upon re rebooting my machine in Safe Mode to try and isolate Skype, I only have a 5 minute window before things become unresponsive again. Opening the Force Quit Application box doesn't help either because it will freeze up as well. However, I do get lucky and am able to move my cursor over the Dock and it responds to my cursor hovering over it and I can sometimes click and move Finder boxes I had open to run Disk Utility, but the second I attempt to force quit by clicking + kbdCommand/kbd, everything freezes and I'm forced to force shutdown my machine once more...  I did read somewhere that sometimes memory can cause this type of issue (which is due to get free space erased). But then again, my machine freezes up before I can even finish running any kind of scan (Verify Permission, or Check Permissions, or even Erase Free Space)! I know the more I force quit my machine, the more my files risk becoming corrupted (of course, I never backed up my files). I tried to delete everything that had to do with Skype, but I fear I might of missed one but because of my small time frame before things freeze, I don't know for sure if I wiped it clean from my machine...  Is there a way to securely erase free space when running in Single User Mode?  Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.  hr  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/tAWWc.jpg" alt="enter image description here"img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GQFeI.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Thank you Allan for the command line, unfortunately this is what came up; it spewed thousands of lines of text saying "unable to ..." and "read only" etc. I know it's probably the smallest of issues that is causing this much trouble since based on the AHTs, there's nothing wrong with my hardware.  <answer277953> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/tAWWc.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  I ran extended tests again after booting in Apple Hardware Test, results came clean.  <answer277965> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/tAWWc.jpg" alt="enter image description here"img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GQFeI.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Thank you Allan for the command line, unfortunately this is what came up; it spewed thousands of lines of text saying "unable to ..." and "read only" etc. I know it's probably the smallest of issues that is causing this much trouble since based on the AHTs, there's nothing wrong with my hardware.  <comment349700> It's highly unlikely that Skype is causing the issues you are experiencing.   I am suspecting that (given the age of your iMac), your drive is failing.  However, it's best to do some diagnostics.  The fist thing you should do is run [Apple Hardware Test (AHT)](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201257).  Hold the D key while booting from a powered off state with the AC adapter connected.   **Make sure you run the extended tests.** Post the results to your original question. <comment349702> Also, while in single user mode - query your drives SMART status.  Issue the command:  `diskutil info disk0 | grep -i smart`  If it says anything other than "Verified" your drive is definitely in the process of failing;  however, a "verified" could be a false negative.  More diagnostics will need to be done. <comment349712> Thank you for the quick reply. I did run a Hardware Test earlier today and it said everything was fine. But when I tried using the diskutil command while in single user mode, a message would say something along the lines of not being able to run such command because of being in single user mode. <comment349713> Just thought I'd add that I totally agree with @Allan - it's almost a certainty that Skype is **not** the cause of the issues you're having. I'd put the download/installation of Skype down to just a coincidence in the timing. It's also almost certainly a hardware issue. I know you've stated that you ran AHT, but did you opt to run the extended tests? This will take longer, but is more thorough. <comment349714> Thank you for responding and yes - I did run the extended tests. I don't mind doing it again and showing you guys the results. And you are all probably right about Skype and the timing. It's just really worrying/frustrating for me at the moment. I also believe that my memory being low is a factor to my problem and the downloading of Skype triggered this crash. <comment349762> In single user, try `/usr/libexec/repair_packages --repair --standard-pkgs` to repair  your volume.
