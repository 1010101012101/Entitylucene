ICloud stole Outlook Contacts from PC after upgrading iPhone 5S to IOS 10.0.2. How to get back to PC? <body> After I upgraded my iPhone 5S to IOS 10.0.2, my Outlooks Contacts are missing from my PC, but they are on ICloud.  Also, ICloud continues to open windows on my PC, interrupting my work.  So I intend to delete ICloud from my PC and instead back up my phone to an external hard drive, but before I do, how can I get my Outlook contacts back to my PC's hard drive?  <comment320243> I've never heard of iCloud opening windows by itself on a PC.  What are these windows for?  Can you attach a screenshot?
