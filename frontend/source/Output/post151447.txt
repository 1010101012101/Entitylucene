XCode 6 on Yosemite crashing in fullscreen mode when build & running app on device <body> Xcode 6 on Yosemite crashes everytime when pressing Build&amp;Run on Device. Current window disappears and Start screen appears. Anyone else experiencing this?   UPDATE:  As it seems Xcode is not crashing, but clicking "Run" triggers "close" and clicking "Stop" triggers "minimize". It's not whole buttons it's only area of closing and minimizing buttons behind.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/cs9o1.png" alt="Corner in Fullscreenmode and fulscreenmode with controls displayed (when mouse over topbar)"  So concluson is that new fullscreenmode somehow sometimes shadows click to underlying controlbuttons.  Reported this to Apple.  UPDATE 23.4.2015  This seems to be fixed now in Yosemite 10.10.3 (14D131).  <answer151591> It's not that it's crashing but it's executing the red close button when you hit the play button.  I have also seen it exit full screen when you press the stop button.    But Yes I have been seeing the same thing.  <answer152103> I've had the same. Selecting file openrecent and then opening the file you already have open before hitting build&amp;run seems to help.  <answer152716> I've started using ⌘R to compile &amp; run the app, to avoid this problem  <comment179156> Yeah thats correct. It only closes curren window. <comment179177> Good call. Looks like a Yosemite bug. <comment181069> I can (unfortunatly) confirm this. It's driving me nuts. <comment182167> Considering how frustrated it made me, a pretty funny bug. <comment183546> I'm facing the same issue. It's so frustrating not to be able to run the app connected to Xcode. Did you find a solution for this? <comment183548> i tried using ⌘R but it still crashes. Any other idea? <comment183549> not working for me :( <comment184031> @AbdullahUmer Not a real solution found yet. As primax79 mentoned  ⌘R works fine. And I have mastered to hit run buttons right edge so it doesn't trigger close action. Some eye hand coordination for everybody. <comment184391> @saq I had found a solution. It turned out there's some kind of bug in the language settings. When I deleted Urdu language and restarted there were no more crashes :) <comment185393> my workaround is to use the maximized window instead of fullscreen. you can maximize easily by clicking Option+(green button) <comment186685> Unbeleivable it's been over a month and it still hasn't been fixed. <comment187047> This works every time for me. You saved my mac from being thrown out of the window... <comment189840> You have to mouse into the menubar, knocking the app into semi-full screen. Then the 'play' button works.
