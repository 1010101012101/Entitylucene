How can I change the aqua theme in Yosemite? <body> How can I change the aqua theme/skin to a dark one in Yosemite? I'm referring to the window title bars, scroll bars, buttons, etc (the cocoa aqua ui theme?). Everything is grayish by default, but i'd like a dark theme.  <answer155066> Go to System Preferences → General → Right under Appearance check "Use dark menu bar and dock"  <answer155369> You can change the Finder icons with LiteIcon, freeware.    More icons than you could ever need at DeviantArt  Alfred (freeware) can do custom theming, but might require the Powerpack (not free) for what you require.  There's also ThemePark  <answer191063> If you're still looking for a method to darken your UI in Yosemite, download Flavours 2 and choose the "Smooth Criminal" flavour. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dwKcQ.png" alt="Here&#39;s a quick screenshot of &quot;Smooth Criminal.&quot;"  Flavours 2 is still in Beta, but most things look great with this skin.  <comment182397> I knew that already, and have that enabled. I was referring to the window title bars, scroll bars, buttons, etc (the cocoa aqua theme?). They are gray by default, but i'd like a dark theme. <comment182398> You may want to rephrase your question then. <comment182416> I don't believe currently that there's a way to get a system wide dark mode for Yosemite, as the dark mode theme only effects the menu bar and dock. <comment182451> I already did. Thanks! <comment182775> Thanks! Does Themepark work in Yosemite? The site seems to be "temporarily unavailable". <comment182779> idk, sorry - I tried to check, but discovered the same thing. I guess we'll have to wait for it to come back up. <comment182786> Hopefully it does! <comment205888> I'm not sure why changing the appearance of Alfred is being mentioned here. It's not capable of theming the OS.
