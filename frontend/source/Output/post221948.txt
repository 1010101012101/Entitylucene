Auto rotate photos and save them afterwards (perhaps using Preview?) <body> So I was previewing some photos using Preview app and I notice that Preview (at least on 10.10.5 Yosemite) automatically fixes rotation issues on the thumbnail on the left.  e.g. photo is upside-down when viewing it but the thumbnail shows it the right-side up. On preview, I still have to go through each photo and manually rotate them to make the changes permanent.  Do you know of any freebie app (or not so expensive) or perhaps using Preview? I want the app to ignore pics that's right-side up.  <answer221966> I came across a binary called "nconvert". I copied these to /usr/local/bin. I then created a simple recursive shell script to go through the folder and subfolders and convert any photo that needs converting.  precode#!/bin/sh  function recursion {     if [ $(find . \( -iname "*jpeg" -or -iname "*jpg" \) -maxdepth 1 -type f | wc -l) -gt 0 ]; then         _fullpath=`pwd`         echo "Processing $_fullpath"         echo "Processing $_fullpath" &gt; $HOME/logs/recursive-autorotate-photos.log         nconvert -jpegtrans exif -overwrite *.jpg     fi      for _item in *; do         if [ -d "$_item" ]; then             (cd "$_item"; recursion)         fi     done }  if [ ! -z "$1" ]; then     if [ ! -d "$HOME/logs" ]; then         mkdir "$HOME"/logs     fi     echo "" &gt; $HOME/logs/recursive-autorotate-photos.log      cd "$1"      recursion else     echo "Usage: recursive-autorotate-photos.sh path-here" fi /code/pre  sample: # recursive-autorotate-photos.sh "/Volumes/my-external-disk/photos"  take note of the quotes in the path. if there's a space in the path, there you need to enclosed it in double quotes. I always use double quotes now out of habit.
