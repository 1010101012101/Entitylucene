Disconnecting disks from Airport Extreme <body> Since Apple released the new Airport Utility with the simplified UI, there doesn't seem to be an option to "Disconnect All Users" to kick all users off a hard drive to safely remove it when connected to an Airport Extreme. See the screenshot for this button in the previous version of Airport Utility.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uUTmr.png" alt="Screenshot depicting this in the previous version"  How should I do this in the new version?  <answer45571> Consensus is that Apple simply forgot it - or didn't make the UI clear!   Deselecting "Enable file sharing" looks to have replaced it. At the very least that will disconnect users before you pull the plug.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2giO2.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment51932> Only thing is that it reboots the whole Airport, disabling everything for a couple minutes, whereas the Disconnect All Users button didn't reboot the Airport. <comment51933> I agree it's not an improvement... <comment51934> I only ever had one disk connected at a time, but did the previous version just disconnect all users from the disk that was selected in the list? It'll work for now though. Not that there's much of a choice :-)
