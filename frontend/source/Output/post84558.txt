How can I wipe my stolen iPhone with no sim <body> My iphone has been stolen, however I did not keep a sim in it since I no longer use it as a phone, just for a music player. It's password protected however in the notes app there's private and confidential information. Is there any way apple can wipe the whole device with just my apple ID?  <answer84559> The only way to wipe it is to use "Find my iPhone" (assuming it's registered there) and issue the "Wipe" command from there. As the iPhone doesn't have a SIM you'll have to wait until it gets online via WiFi.  <comment97326> Is the phone registered with Find my iPhone? <comment97327> I'm not sure, can't remember. Already tried it but it said device is offline.
