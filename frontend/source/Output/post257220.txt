How to mount hidden Windows partition on CD-ROM? <body> I have an old Windows 95 and Mac (PPC) card game on CD-ROM. When I insert the CD, the volume with the PowerPC based game gets mounted. I see in Disk Utility that there is 350 MB uninitialized space, which I suspect is the Windows version of the game.  Since I have CrossOver, but no PPC emulator, I would like to try to install that version. I have no Windows machine at hand. What is the easiest way to mount that volume on my iMac running macOS Sierra 10.12?
