Distribution In-House Application over Apple Developer Enterprise Program <body> There are many question I want to ask about Apple Developer Enterprise Program because when I entered their documentation, I was thinking I am lost at Amazon.  strong1. Enterprise Distribution Provisioning Profile (in-house) means?/strong  strong2. What is configuration profile installation on device (trust the developer or not) to use the app?/strong  I am asking this because I really need to explain it to my client. My client wants to distribute apps only to his employees for business purposes, like in-house application. He wants the feature like TestFlight which is acting like App Store where we can update the app and install the app every time the developer update the app. He doesn't want to submit his app to App Store. In order to make his employees to use easily, he also said, his employees can install the app easily and show the update easily like Testflight without expire date or limited testers. I found hockey app , but it requires testers to be Hockeyapp members.  Any help?  <comment280123> **TOO** many questions for one question! Ask Different works best if you ask one question per question! <comment280124> I am really sorry about that,but i really need to know all of these,you know all these question are concerned with Apple Developer Enterprise Program.So,your help is welcome. <comment280125> You may split all these into 12-13 questions and ask all of them in separate questions. Some of them may already be asked and answered here at Apple Stackexchange. <comment280126> I have updated the question,can you please take a look?Sir?Its done editing <comment280129> You really must stick to the "one question per post" rule. Why don't you start with *one* question focussing on one thing you don't get/understand yet and then ask additional questions once you got answers on that? Or start with a question describing how you tried to get answers out of the official documentation and where you got lost?
