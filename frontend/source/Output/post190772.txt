MacBook "address book" to iPhone from file <body> Can I import a MacBook "address book" to iPhone from file? There are various files from the exported address book; e.g. AddressBook-v22.abcddb.  I don't have a Mac available at the moment, only an iPhone and a Windows PC.  <comment226632> OS X, iOS versions? Exporting to VCF and mailing each contact to your iOS device will allow you import. abcddb looks specific to Address Book. From what I read it's a SQLite format, I wouldn't count on importing it directly. Is there a reason you wouldn't sync via iCloud? <comment226966> Hi Jamie, thanks for picking this up. The complication is that I returned my business MacBook and saved the file since the icloud didn't pick up the new contacts I added (they went to a MS Exchange Server). Now I am left with the file itself - luckily with all the contacts - a Windows PC and IPhone. If there is a way to sync the file to icloud on the basis described I would be grateful if you let me know. Many thanks.
