How can I rename a folder in Lion's Launchpad? <body> I created a folder by dropping one icon on top of another.  Now I want to rename that folder, since the default name, "Utility" isn't the one I want.  According to all advice I find on the internet, I should open the folder and then emdouble-click the title/em in order to rename it.  But, when I double-click the title, nothing is happening. Is there a lock somewhere I have to turn off?  This is what I tried:  ul liDouble-Clicking/li liRight-Clicking/li liCtrl-Clicking/li liOption-Clicking/li liCommand-Clicking/li /ul  What else?  <answer17856> Once the folder created (with the name Utility) you click (once) on the folder to open it,  once opened the name of the folder appears in bold + the different apps inside that folder.  To change the name, click on the name (shown inside the folder) to change it.  <answer17858> Ok, I did a google search and came across a page where others are having the same problem.  The reply by etresoft - https://discussions.apple.com/message/15661045#15661045 - basically says to kill the Dock application and it should restart automatically, and then it should work.  I did that, started Activity Monitor, found Dock, and force-quit it, it started right up again, and afterwards renaming worked as expected.  <comment19514> I thought I made that clear in the question - it doesn't work. I've tried that. <comment19516> I have lion as well, and i just clicked (not double clicked) and it worked fine. I doubt the made different versions of it. <comment19517> There seems to be a bug in this function. See my own answer. <comment19637> Just as a point of reference, noktecs solution worked for me with no changes needed after the upgrade from Snow Leopard. Remember, don't double-click the name when opening the folder -- only single click on the name.
