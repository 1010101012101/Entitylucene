Assigning keyboard shortcut to iOS User Agent in Safari's develop menu <body> I am trying to assign a keyboard shortcut to the codeDevelop &gt; User Agent &gt; Safari iOS 8.1 - iPhone/code menu item of Safari web browser. But in the codeSystem Preferences &gt; Keyboard &gt; App Shortcuts/code, when I enter codeSafari iOS 8.1 - iPhone/code, the keyboard shortcut does not work.   I suppose that hyphen [-] like character that appears in the user agent menu is some other character. Can somebody tell what character is that so that I can the keyboard shortcut working.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ynLax.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer180459> That looks like an n-dash to me, rather than a hyphen  Hyphen -  N-dash —   typing 2 hyphens will change to an n-dash in regular text areas, if you have Smart dashes enabled in Edit  Substitutions, otherwise you could try copy/pasting this one...  Safari iOS 8.1 — iPad  <answer247010> Newer versions of Safari use the codeem-dash/code instead of coden-dash/code.  Example:  precodeSafari — iOS 9.3 — iPhone /code/pre  You can find it under the punctuation section of the Character Picker.
