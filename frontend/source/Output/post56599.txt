Free or cheap software to boost volume of Macbook? <body>    strongPossible Duplicate:/strongbr   Do you know a simple sound booster app for Mac?       What software can I use to artificially increase the volume of my Macbook? I know Boom and Audio Hijack Pro are solutions but they are pricey. Any other recommendations?  <answer56601> I've done some research for you, and I didn't seem to find anything except paid applications, and one that is a half solution. I only found these three (paid) options:br img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fRTia.png" width="64"strongAudio Hijack Pro/strong (free trial, $32 for the full version)  Audio Hijack Pro will allow you to boost your sound pretty easily. Upon opening the application, click "System Audio" in the list on the side:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/aYk6D.png" alt=""br Then at the top, click "Hijack": img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5l8WM.png" alt="" Once Audio Hijack Pro is hijacking your audio, go to the Effects tab and where it says "Click here to insert effect", click and under the 4FX Effect, click Gain.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3fMrg.png" alt=""br You'll then have two dials to control the gain. Use these dials to boost the volume.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YvYcs.png" alt=""    In my use of Audio Hijack Pro for boosting volume, this seems like a viable solution.  hr  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/R3zUL.png" width="64"strongBoom/strong (free trial, $6.99, on sale right now for $4.99)  Boom lives in your menu bar and has a simple slider to boost the volume.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/sysX3.png" alt=""    If you click on the img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/JuFt6.png" alt="" button, you will be presented with an equalizer and numerous other nifty controls:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/RwEUL.png" alt=""  hr  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FnjZG.jpg" width="64"strongHear/strong (free trial, $19.99 for a license)  Hear is a little more complex than the other applications.

However, it emis/em a half solution.   You may be wondering why I include VLC as a solution. Here's why: VLC boosts the volume of movie and audio files up to 400%. If you open an audio/video file, adjust the volume slider and it will boost the file's volume:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/XvGKt.png" alt=""  <comment65063> Other related questions: [8311](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/8311/amplify-sound-output-on-mac), [45700](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/45700/skype-way-too-quiet-how-to-get-louder-skype-audio-output-on-my-macbook-pro) <comment69934> Better to improve the answers on the existing question if all you seek is different answers.

The eq controls (right side of screenshot) let you boost gain even more.
