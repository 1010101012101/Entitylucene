Is there something similar to the Greasemonkey script system for a browser in iOS? <body> Greasemonkey is explained in this Wikipedia entry.  I would like to add my own stylesheet to a particularly non-mobile-friendly website. Is there any way to accomplish this? Are there any browser apps that can do it?  <answer31594> At the moment there is the GreasePocket project in the works.  Have a look at their website, but it's far from a finished product, it will also probably need to be run on a JailBroken device.  <comment36219> Yeah I saw that, but it hasn't been updated in over three years, so think it's a no-go. <comment36235> I haven't found any at first glance. Try to check browser with ADBlocking features. <comment36236> Also you can try Opera Mobile for iPhone. <comment46167> Have a look at the iCab Mobile app. I'm not sure if it supports this now, but it's worth emailing the developer and asking. If any good iOS browser has it, I'd expect it to be iCab. <comment232890> Make that 7 years.
