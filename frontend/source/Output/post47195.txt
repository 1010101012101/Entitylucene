How can I make Finder start not in "All my files" <body> I don't like that Finder shows me "All My Files":  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/eKt1R.png" alt="Finder sows some useless stuff"  It also delays Finder start a little.  How can I make Finder start in some different place (not in "All My Flies")? Can finder start in my home directory code~/code or anywhere here:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Fkf57.png" alt="places"  <answer47196> You can change this in codeFinder &gt; Preferences &gt; General &gt; New Finder windows show/code. I've set mine to my home directory, but you can also choose codeOther.../code and set a different directory  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FAROB.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment106838> thank you for this tip, it's been driving me nuts for a while, haha!
