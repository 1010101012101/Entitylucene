Export iMessages in human readable form for archival <body> I have a long (several months' worth) iMessage conversation with a contact.  He lost these messages when he re-installed his OS, but I still have the archive.  There is some important information there that we'd like to keep.  Is there a simple way to export this conversation for archival in a human readable form, and also keep any images?  I can select parts of the conversation, copy it to the clipboard and paste it into a rich text document, but this discards all images.  I'm looking for a way that keeps the images.  Note: I use iMessage on OS X only, not iOS.  (Ideally I'd also like to export all non-image file attachments, but I'm not expecting that this will be possible.)  <answer108172> If you know the iMessage account of your contact here is a bash script of mine to retrieve text + images.   precode#Parameter is a iMessage account (email or phone number i.e. +33616.... ) if [ $# -lt 1 ]; then     echo "Enter a iMessage account (email of phone number i.e +33616.....) " fi login=$1  #Retrieve the text messages   sqlite3 ~/Library/Messages/chat.db " select is_from_me,text from message where handle_id=( select handle_id from chat_handle_join where chat_id=( select ROWID from chat where guid='iMessage;-;$1') )" | sed 's/1\|/me: /g;s/0\|/budy: /g' &gt; MessageBackup.txt   #Retrieve the attached stored in the local cache  sqlite3 ~/Library/Messages/chat.db " select filename from attachment where rowid in ( select attachment_id from message_attachment_join where message_id in ( select rowid from message where cache_has_attachments=1 and handle_id=( select handle_id from chat_handle_join where chat_id=( select ROWID from chat where guid='iMessage;-;$1') )))" | cut -c 2- | awk -v home=$HOME '{print home $0}' | tr '\n' '\0' | xargs -0 -t -I fname cp fname . /code/pre  <answer108180> I found a workable solution:  ol liScroll up until all messages are loaded/li liPrint to PDF/li li(If you have Acrobat,) crop off the margins from the pages to improve readability of split-across-pages messages./li /ol  The result doesn't look emgreat/em, but it does contain all the images and the text is searchable.  So it's good enough.  <answer129866> h2Archiving/h2  This person appears to have a more polished solution (no disrespect intended to the extremely useful SQLite scraper above):  http://www.chrisfinke.com/2013/11/05/convert-ichat-transcripts-to-useable-xml/  To summarise the blog:  ul liinstall Adium/li lichoose the "import from iChat" option/li liAdium transcripts are generated from your logs and stored in:  ~/Library/Application Support/Adium 2.0/Users/Default/Logs//li /ul  The converted files are in HTML, more easily readable and hopefully more archive-friendly, but the codesqlite/code approach to attachment linkage looks sensible.  h2Attachments/h2  Note that iMessage attachments tend to live in:  precode~/Library/Containers/com.apple.iChat/Data/Library/Messages/Attachments/... /code/pre  (I don't know the rules for what goes in there and what doesn't, so it might not be complete - but there's a fair amount in there)  But actually you emcan/em see some information about the contact and conversation in the  file's extended attributes:  precode$ xattr -lp com.apple.metadata:kMDItemWhereFroms &lt;attachment&gt; /code/pre  will print an origin if Messages put one there on download.  <answer196363> I took the liberty of furthering the above answer by Matthieu. I wrote a script that would automate the process by backing up all the user's messages, including images, audio files, and movies--storing each conversation into a text file by phone number.   https://github.com/PeterKaminski09/baskup  Edit: I developed the script into an OS X app with some nice features like contact recognition. https://peterkaminski09.github.io/baskup  <answer215400> Export iMessages app allows you to save, print, backup and recover SMS/iMessages to your Mac/PC.  <answer239741> Your mac should automatically save them. Here are instructions on how to extract them:  http://www.imore.com/how-view-and-move-your-imessage-history-and-attachments  <comment126837> Do you want to save them from an iDevice or a Mac ? <comment126838> @MatthieuRiegler A Mac.  I don't use iMessage on iOS, so I didn't think of that possibility.  I'll update the question. <comment126839> Does http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/88023/how-to-transfer-entire-imessage-conversations-to-computer help or are you looking for something else? <comment126843> @patrix I am looking for a way to get the messages out of iMessage, so I can view them even if I stop using OS X.  I realize that it was a mistake to reply on iMessage to keep important information, so I want to move away from it completely, and hopefully salvage the chatlog for the future. <comment126849> Thanks, this is useful.  This won't give me the images though ... <comment126850> I'll dig a bit more to find them ;) <comment126855> Thanks!  I just found a solution which is good enough for now, so please don't spend your time on this any more. <comment152049> Yes, @Szabolcs, I did see the "please don't spend your time on this any more" comment, but had to do a bit of digging of my own so thought I ought to share in case it's useful to someone else. <comment166546> hi, how to run this script <comment166548> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25202168/converting-ichat-file-into-text-formate-using-applescript-or-any-other-script <comment218500> How could I add the date in front of the message text?  I am aware of how to include the date in the SQL query, but not the sed bit. <comment234542> What if the contact has no phone number? <comment234620> I retrieve all contact info from the chat table in ./Library/Messages/chat.db. This is not specific on user phone numbers. Just their id that is associated with their messages. In most instances this is in fact a phone number. <comment260236> This doesn't really answer the question as I explicitly said that I use iMessage *only* on OS X, not on iOS. <comment270576> What if you have 25,000 messages in the conversation and scrolling up is not viable? <comment294329> Welcome to Ask Different!
