Finding DVB-T Driver <body> I have a DVB-T dongle which has following information:  precode  Product ID:   0x9016   Vendor ID:    0x15a4  (Afa Technologies, Inc.) /code/pre  After googling these information I found out the chip model used in this device: codeAfatech AF9015/code. I could not find a driver (even a generic one) for it, would you know how to find it?  <answer199548> It appears unlikely an OS X driver is available but you may have success with Linux.

The Linux Kernel Media Subsystems provides support for devices like webcams, streaming capture and output, analog TV, digital TV, AM/FM radio, Sofware Digital Radio (SDR) and remote controllers. It offers native support for a large number of drivers for commonly available PCI cards and USB devices, but the subsystems are also targeted towards Linux based set-top-boxes and embedded devices, like mobile phones.    ul liLinux TV: Talk:Afatech AF9015/li liCan anybody help me to make Kworld UB445-Q TV tuner work?/li /ul
