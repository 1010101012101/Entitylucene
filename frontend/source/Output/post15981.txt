Problems saving changes to /etc/sshd_config <body> I am trying to setup my mac mini as a secure git server, I'm following this very helpful blog post, http://www.tomdalling.com/blog/software-processes/how-to-set-up-a-secure-git-server-at-home-osx.  Now I get stuck at number 6 when i am trying to save changes I have made to the /etc/sshd_config file.  I am logged in as my administrator account and can open the file correctly, when I try to save it I receive the following error:  The document “sshd_config” could not be saved. You don’t have permission.  To view or change permissions, select the item in the Finder and choose File  Get Info.  I have tried to change the permissions using chmod but I can't do this either.  I also can't locate it using the finder to be able to change permissions using File  Get Info as suggested in the error message.    Does anyone have any idea how I can resolve this? Please help!  <answer16024> Using sudo on the codeopen/code command doesn't do anything particularly useful -- the actual program still gets run under the user's regular identity.  To solve this, make sure TextEdit isn't running, then do:  precodesudo /Applications/TextEdit.app/Contents/MacOS/TextEdit &amp; open -a "TextEdit" /etc/sshd_config /code/pre  The first command runs TextEdit as root; the second tells it to open the file.  After this, you should be able to edit &amp; save changes.  When you're done, be sure to quit TextEdit (or it'll keep editing files as root).  Alternately, use TextWrangler (or its even-more-capable-but-not-free sibling, BBEdit).  It handles saving files as root automatically, as well as having easy ways to edit invisible files.  I much prefer it for editing config files and the like.  EDIT: Be sure to get the version of TextWrangler from the Bare Bones Software web site, emnot/em the version from the Mac App Store -- the App Store version has the save-as-root feature removed to comply with Apple's rules.  <comment17479> Fantastic, thanks!  TextWrangler has done the job! :-D <comment17480> I would have liked to vote up the answer but I don't have enough reputation on this site yet <comment40734> +1 for TextWrangler ... great tool.
