MBP Brightness doesn't go to max when reconnected to external screens <body> I use a 3 display setup. 2x 27" Apple Thunderbolt Display and the screen of the 15" 2016 MBP.  When I use all the 3 screens I have the brightness set to the max. Then when I disconnect the MBP it brightness drop to something like 70% (and I am ok with that) but when I reconnect it doesn't return to max brightness but it goes to something like 80%.  Is there a way to configure that?
