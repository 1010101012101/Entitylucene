iTerm text search is in reverse order <body> I'm running iTerm2. When do a text search kbdâŒ˜/kbd kbdF/kbd, pressing kbdReturn/kbd moves the highlighted occurrence back (the previous occurrence). Is there a way to make it move to the next (forward) occurrence?  <answer236927> Try using Shift+Enter to reach the next occurrence.   <comment290068> We're looking for long answers that provide some explanation and context. Don't just give a one-line answer: please explain why you're recommending it as a solution. Answers that don't explain anything may be deleted. <comment290069> I apologize, I'm new here. I tried to find documentation on the internet to back up my personal experience, and I found this thread. In the future, should I find a source on the web with my answers? https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/iterm2-discuss/find/iterm2-discuss/XL55TiIlPOw/-rNB1dp1VA0J <comment290070> That's ok...it's how we learn.....but I don't belive shift-enter does anything in this context.  You might want to try Cmd-G or just Enter <comment343534> Cmd-G also works in reverse
