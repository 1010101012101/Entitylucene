How to scroll a table down to bottom <body> I know that when you tap on the status bar on top, it will scroll the table all the way to the top.  Is there a similar way that can scroll it all the way to the bottom?  <answer244326> No, there is no built-in way to scroll to the bottom of a table.   It would be up to the developers to add that specific function to their table view.   <comment301097> Thanks, wish they add this in the future.
