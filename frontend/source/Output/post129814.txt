Excel error : "Not enough memory" <body> A friend of mine just bought an MBA. He installed Office 2011 in order to work mainly with Excel. As he opened one of his file (6.5MB - multiple sheets - company logo - no graphs) and wanted to save it this box appears: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kIvjX.png" alt="Excel error picture"   where you can read something like codeNot enough memory/code. If I click on kbdOK/kbd the box appears again like 15 times.  Thinking of an installation issue, I tried on my MBP which did the same result. But his old computer (win7 - Excel 2013) can open and save the file without any issue.  During my google searches, the only result that I found led me to a Windows based solution or an help site from 1994...  <answer129827> The file was saved as codeExcel 95/code and was to big for the destination file. A simple codesave As/code with the new format codexlsx/code solve the issue.  <comment151930> Is it running on the latest version of office 2010? <comment151932> @JashJacob I guess, how can I figure it out? <comment151949> @Buscarì›ƒ trust me, for a so stupid solution, I also regret the time I spent on this. <comment151950> as long you have the solution it is all OK :) <comment152027> I will try this on my problematic file!
