Mail app and templates for emails? <body> I used Mail as my main mail client on Snow Leopard. It would be really useful to manage mail templates with it. I used to send similar emails every day and I need to create 20 or 30 email templates to used whenever I need.  How can I accomplish with this?  <answer41134> By templates I think you mean strongcanned messages/strong. Here's a workaround (source):  ul liCreate a "Templates" folder./li liCreate and save a new draft message (including title)./li liMove the draft to "Templates" folder./li liWhenever you need to use that template select a message and then choose emSend Again/em from the Messages menu./li liMake necessary modification and send./li /ul  <comment75685> I am unable to find an option for "Send Again." <comment79028> @SAP995: It's in the Message menu. Try Shift+Cmd+D.
