Can't delete partition on El Capitan <body> So I created a 6gb FAT partition on the disk utility but I don't need it anymore so I erased it and then tried to resize the main drive so it could take up its space and it just doesn't happen.  this wheel doesn't move towards the direction I want, basicallyimg src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jqW0S.png" alt=""  here's what diskutil looks like img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/us0Rs.png" alt="enter image description here"  am I missing a step or something? I looked pretty thoroughly (I would say) and found nothing that would resemble this  if I should specify anything else about my case please let me know  <comment320274> Possible duplicate of [Partitioning Software](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/101928/partitioning-software) <comment320301> Click on the small piece of the pie and hit the minus button to delete it
