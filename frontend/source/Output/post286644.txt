Trouble fixing FontExplorer X Pro file path conflicts <body> strongNavigating a very annoying problem with FontExplorer X Pro./strong   I did a clean re-install of OS X Sierra on my Macbook Pro from a flash drive. In moving the previous fonts back onto my HD, I also brought over the previous 'FontExplorer X.fexdb' file so I could still keep my sets from before. From what I have researched, my sets should then be restored as 'missing' and in the 'Conflicts' panel I am to locate the files. I have had no such luck.  The 'Current Path' of the fonts also vary. I have managed resolve a few of them but only family by family at best.. and the ones that have a 'Current Path' that differs too much from where the files are now located don't work at all. When I click 'Apply' the text field goes blank. Also, many of the system fonts are 'missing'.  My question is mainly with the 'Conflict' panel and how to mass resolve conflicts! Given what I've read, all I should have to do is 'replace path component: type Users/oldusername/ then in all selected fonts with: type User/newusername/'  I did this and nothing happens. Possibly because some of those fonts are system fonts and 1 layer above /Users in /Library?  I just have no clue.. this is starting to feel immensely hopeless and depressing... so any advice and/or suggestions are much appreciated!  <comment361709> Did you look in the console and check if there are any Errors? If so, post them. Are you using the current Version of FEX 6.01? <comment361710> Also: did you look at the 'Tools' in the Menubar? Did you do Clear the Font Caches?
