Two Apps in iPad side-by-side i.e. sharing screen between two apps? <body> I would like to have PDF Expert -app and UPAd -note-atking-app at the same time open where 50% screen area preserved for each. Is it possible to share the screen this way? This way studying would be more natural: I have lecture-slides open and a note-book, not all the time going to-and-fro. Is this possible and how?  <answer69649> This is not possible. Only one application can use the screen at a time.  <answer69666> It's not possible to split your screen, but you might try an app like notability or good notes, which allow you to read PDF's and take notes at the same time.  <comment81191> ...this is not possible because iPad has no multitasking or way? <comment81331> At this time, it is simply a feature that the iPad does not offer. I believe that it is technically possible, but would require user interface modification and developer participation.
