pptx file not opened via Apple Script <body> I want to write an Apple Script that converts me Microsoft PowerPoint presentations into PDFs. I started with a small version, but strange enough, already that very short stub fails:  precodeon run arguments     tell application "Finder"         set fileAlias to POSIX file (first item of arguments) as alias          tell application "Microsoft PowerPoint"             open fileAlias         end tell      end tell end run /code/pre  The argument provided refers to a valid .pptx file. But when calling the script via  precodeosascript path/to/script.scpt ~/path/to/file.pptx /code/pre  PowerPoint 2016 opens, but shows an empty presentation instead of the presentation in file.pptx.   When I slightly change the script, it actually opens the file:  precodeon run arguments     tell application "Finder"         set fileAlias to POSIX file (first item of arguments) as alias           open fileAlias           end tell end run /code/pre  Why is the file opened when the open command is not issued within the PowerPoint application block, and is not opened when issued within the block? Is it possibly a timing issue?
