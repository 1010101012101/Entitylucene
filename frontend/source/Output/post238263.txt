How does a "machine" and a "computer" differ in a systemsetup command? <body> codeman systemsetup/code defines two separate arguments for setting (and two for checking) a sleep time:  ul lione defined as the "emidle time until strongmachine/strong sleeps/em"/li lithe other defined as "emthe idle time until strongcomputer/strong sleeps/em"/li /ul  On a MacBook Pro using either of the arguments changes the other one accordingly (battery/power adapter settings do not play role here either).  What is (or was) the difference between a "machine" and a "computer" as an argument for codesystemsetup/code? Is there any difference between the two arguments for different Apple hardware?  hr  Full excerpt from codeman systemsetup/code:  precode -getsleep          Displays amount of idle time until machine sleeps.   -setsleep minutes          Sets amount of idle time until computer sleeps. Specify "Never" or "Off" for computers that          should never sleep. Important: if you set the system to sleep, you will not be able to adminis-          ter the server remotely while it is sleeping.   -getcomputersleep          Display amount of idle time until computer sleeps.   -setcomputersleep minutes          Set amount of idle time until computer sleeps. Specify "Never" or "Off" for never. /code/pre  <comment292100> That's a very good question and I'm interested in what light can be shed on this by others too.
