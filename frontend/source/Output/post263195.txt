Frame skips on external 144 Hz monitor? <body> I'm using a 2011 MBP connected to a 1080 external display.  I've noticed a bit of frame rate choppiness, when playing certain 60 FPS games (at low resolution) or watching videos, that I don't get on my internal display.  This happens even if I scale the external resolution down or use the codeDisableMonitor/code app.  The display is not actually dropping frames, as I've recorded perfect 60 FPS videos from it and smoothly played them back on my internal display.  The recordings feature objects that flicker every frame so I can confirm each frame is captured.  The frame skips are only visual on the external monitor regardless if I set the refresh rate to 60, 100, 120, 144, or have vsync enabled/disabled.  This is on El Capitan 10.11.6 and the display is AOC G2460PF connected with DisplayPort.  Anyone know what could be causing this?
