Disable <Option-u>, <Option-n> accent mark <body> I know this has to do with my keyboard layout being U.S, but I have no idea what to do from here. I'm using MacVim, so I want to bind code&lt;Alt-u&gt;/code to something, but I realized it was waiting for another character, and sure enough if you type code&lt;Alt-u&gt;/code you can get characters like this: Ã¯  if you type another character after it. I want to disable this behavior and I'm not sure where to look.  <answer138588> There is a simple solution, which is to download Ukelele and then create a new US keyboard from your current (or whatever language you are reading this in), and then modify the dead keys to whatever you want. I made https://github.com/norcalli/undead-us-keyboard as result of this with a keyboard layout already made and installation instructions.
