Slow WiFi on macbook pro, normal on other devices <body> New to the Apple ecosystem  I got a macbook pro last week. It's running OS El capiton.  I first had it connected to the WiFi at my office and everything was fine. However when I connected it at home the speed is way slower than its supposed to.  I tried changing channels but that didn't work, I really don't know what to do now. Is there an issue with my router? Would appreciate it if someone helps me out here.  Thanks   <comment321749> Have you tried it on other wifi networks?  If it works fine at work but not at home then your problem is probably not the MacBook.
