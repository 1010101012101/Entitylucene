Open shell script from Finder interactively <body> I am running my manual backups with a shell script that asks me for a password. However, when I open the script from the Finder, it terminates immediately.  How can I get a script to run interactively when double clicking on it in Finder?  <answer260485> For a bash script to work from finder, it has to have the code.command/code extension  For example, I created the following script to use codesudo/code to ask for a password and then to output a welcome message, then "wait" to simulate execution time:  precode#!/bin/bash sudo echo "Welcome to Ask Different" sleep 10 exit 0 /code/pre  I saved it as codetest.command/code.  You also have to make it executable:  codechmod +x test.command/code  Here's the result of clicking on the script:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/PKWys.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment326122> PS. `set -i` doesn't help. <comment326179> Turns out, the Terminal setting 'Close if shell exited cleanly' does not keep the window open if the script exited non-zero. Entirely different problem. The `.command` part does not seem to make any difference at all. So, mea culpa, should have worked perfectly fine in the first place, if I hadn't been so stupid
