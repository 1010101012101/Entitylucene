Transferred iCloud backup from iPhone 5 (iOS 9.1) to new iPhone 7 but says I still to update to 10.1.1? <body> I received my new iPhone 7 today and transferred my stuff from iPhone 5 to it and it was successful because I'm using all the apps I had on the 7 now. However, on the Settings app it's showing a notification on the software update saying I can't install the update until the iPhone has finished restoring the the iCloud backup? I'm quite confused and would like to know how to get rid of the notification when it's been already installed since it's a new iPhone? img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nSS9r.png" alt="enter image description here"
