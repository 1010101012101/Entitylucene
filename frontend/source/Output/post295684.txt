Remove missing drive from Spotlight <body> I was cloning someone's drive, it was named emMacintosh HD/em, just like my my own. Eventually it showed up in Spotlight as strongemMacintosh HD 1/em/strong.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0CUNZ.png" alt="Spotlight showing missing disconnected external drive"  Now when I search for apps and such I always hit its applications. At least nothing happens, since the drive has been removed and no longer exists.  How can I get Spotlight to stop showing me results for it?  I've tried reindexing with the following commands but it only applies to mounted devices:  precodesudo mdutil -a -i off sudo mdutil -a -i on /code/pre  <answer295703> Just turning codeoff|on/code strongSpotlight/strong emindexing/em using codesudo mdutil -i off|on/code, doesn't mean the emmetadata stores/em are cleaned up and or rebuilt. Here's what I'd do...   First delete the strongSpotlight/strong emmetadata stores/em using codesudo mdutil -E //code and wait for the prompt to return. What actually happens is emindexing/em is temporarily turned off, the emmetadata stores/em are deleted and emindexing/em turned back on.  Then run codesudo -k/code to terminate the codesudo/code session.  Next I'd rebuild the strongLaunch Services Database/strong, using:  precode/S*/L*/F*/C*/F*/L*/S*/lsregister -kill -r -domain local -domain system -domain user /code/pre  <comment373457> @user3439894 Cool, I didn't know you could skip spelling full paths like that. I'll try it out! Thanks <comment373458> @user3439894 This worked! Would mind making an answer?
