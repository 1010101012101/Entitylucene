USB Keyboard's number pad doesn't work while using vim <body> I have a usb keyboard that has a numberpad.  When I use the number pad in most situations, it works as expected (IE when I click the bottom 3 buttons, I get 123 in this web form).  However, when using vim (in a terminal window), in edit mode, if I type 123, I get:  precodes r q /code/pre  I did not have this problem while I was using synergy to share the keyboard I had plugged into my linux desktop.
