Windows 10 partition disappeared after resizing <body> My Windows partition disappeared after resizing it. I found a post on NERDr with a walkthrough for how to fix it and I did everything.

It's marked as an HFS+ partition, it should be Microsoft Basic Data though.  ul liBoot to Internet Recovery Mode/li liOpen Terminal in the menubar  Utilities  Terminal/li liEnter codediskutil list/code and with the disk identifier of the internal disk found there: codegpt -r show diskX/code. Usually it's disk0 - below I assume it's disk0. Use the disk identifier you have found in your environment in the commands below! You also have a CoreStorage volume (e.g. FileVault). Check its disk identifier also. Below I assume it's disk2. If you haven't mounted it (because you didn't unlock it - if it is encrypted), you don't have to unmount it below./li liUnmount the logical volume and then the internal disk:  precodediskutil umountDisk /dev/disk2 diskutil umountDisk /dev/disk0 /code/pre/li liRemove the fourth partition:  precodegpt remove -i 4 /dev/disk0  /code/pre/li liRe-add the 4th partition with the same first block and size but with the proper type:  precodediskutil umountDisk /dev/disk2 diskutil umountDisk /dev/disk0 gpt add -b 133448880 -i 4 -s 356523688 -t EBD0A0A2-B9E5-4433-87C0-68B6B72699C7 /dev/disk0 /code/pre/li liReboot/li /ul  <comment355362> Comments are not for extended discussion; this conversation has been [moved to chat](http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/57920/discussion-on-question-by-mrblargg-windows-10-partition-disappeared-after-resizi). <comment355375> Whenever I enter gpt remove -i 4/dev/disk0 it says that the path does not exist, same result when I try to add it as well. No idea how the hell it does not exist since the terminal shows its as a result. <comment355379> @MrBlargg There has to be a space between 4 and /dev/d... <comment355380> Yeah I typed it properly into the console. I had a similar issue with the first solution I tried. After talking to someone else they told me theres little chance of recovery because I reformatted the partition on accident. So Im just doing a new windows version through bootcamp. Should be able to get most of my files back through professors so thatll be ok.
