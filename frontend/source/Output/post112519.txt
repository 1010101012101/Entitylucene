Best Office app for the iPhone? <body> I'm looking for a good Office application for iOS. Something that is advanced, much like this: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/word-docs-microsoft-office/id645778970?mt=8  If you notice, I'm talking about the screenshots and its tools the app includes. I bought this, but I'd like something newer, better if you know of any. Perhaps similar tools but more advanced. Or in general, I just want a good office app that I don't need to zoom in for -- an app that fits text to screen automatically.   Do any of you additionally know if this is any good?: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/word-on-go-document-writer/id655397428?mt=8  <answer112522> I'm with Richard J. Ross III on this one...Pages is a very good tool for creating and editing documents on the iPhone. If you haven't tried the latest release of Pages for iOS7, I would recommend looking into it. The latest release of Pages offers the ability to indent, and add tables very easily. Tables can even be moved around by simply touching and dragging it to any place in the document. The only thing I'm haven't seen is the ability to type in subscripts and superscripts...though Pages does provide a lot of custom fonts.  <comment132120> Why not use Pages? <comment132122> I hate Pages, but that's a personal opinion. I like something with really cool tools. I want to be able to type subscripts, superscripts, indent, tables, etc. All without needing to zoom on an iPhone. If you look at the first link in my question the screenshots will give you an example. <comment132127> "Better" or "best" will be different for everybody. We can't tell you what application to use only based on the criteria "better than x" or "the best." Please ask again with specific requirements for the app (detailed feature set, where you want it to be strong, etc).
