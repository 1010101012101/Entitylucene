iCloud not backing up anything <body> I want to back up my Macbook Pro to iCloud before upgrading the OS: I added a terabyte to my iCloud, but it's not backing up anything. Current OS is Mountain Lion.  <comment346829> iCloud is a sync solution and not (primarily) a backup solution.  You should be able to use many parts of iCloud but, because you have an older OS, you can't use all that it has to offer.  See [this Apple page](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204230) and update your question to include what you're trying to do with iCloud.
