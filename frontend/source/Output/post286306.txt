Enable Safari Zoom by Script <body> I've got a WQHD (1440p) Monitor hooked up to my 13 inch MacBook Pro when I'm sitting at my desk. Love the high resolution (much screen real estate) but sometimes I find myself toggling Safari's Zoom to 125%: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0QQPc.png" alt="enter image description here"  Is there an option to toggle this setting by Script/Terminal Command or else automatically? If so I could toggle it automatically when connecting the monitor with Control Plane.  This code gets to the right settings tab, but I canâ€™t figure out how to set the zoom level:  precodetell application "System Events"     tell application process "Safari"         set frontmost to true         keystroke "," using command down         delay 1         tell window 1             click button "Advanced" of toolbar 1 of it             delay 1             keystroke "w" using command down         end tell     end tell end tell /code/pre  <answer286309> This Applescript code sets the zoom level globally:  precodetell application "System Events"     tell application process "Safari"         set frontmost to true         keystroke "," using command down         delay 0.5         tell window 1             click button "Advanced" of toolbar 1 of it             click pop up button 3 of group 1 of group 1 of it             click menu item 4 of menu 1 of pop up button 3 of group 1 of group 1 of it             keystroke "w" using command down         end tell     end tell end tell /code/pre  change codemenu item 4/code to code5/code for a 115% or code6/code for 125% zoom level.  Using an Applescript is better than using codecmd +/code / codecmd + -/code because it sets the default zoom for all pages.  <comment361204> Is Cmd/+ not doing what you need? <comment361223> cmd + / cmd + - does not sets the default zoom for all pages.
