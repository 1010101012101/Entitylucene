Modify the keyboard opt symbols <body> Is there any way to (or existing program which can) modify the keyboard symbols you get when holding down the option key?  I.e. I want to be able to modify these mappings:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/91OuV.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer131294> If you want to do this without using external application there is a good answer here  https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/130099/46541  DefaultKeyBinding.dict  Create code~/Library/KeyBindings/DefaultKeyBinding.dict/code and enter  precode{ "~l" = (insertText:, "@"); } /code/pre  This rebinds ⌥L to insert @  precode~ = ⌥ /code/pre  Quit and reopen applications for the change to take effect  Some examples of external sources  https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/112381/46541  <comment154206> modify to what? those are the original you are showing? <comment154207> @Buscar웃 to a different assortment of characters/symbols (e.g. greek characters, mathematical symbols, etc).  This is the current mapping (thus I assume default).
