How to enable disk access on Ipad mini? <body> I remember there used to be a check box that allows "enable disk access", but now iTunes 10 has taken away that check box. What should I do if I want to enable my Ipad mini for disk access (preferably without using a 3rd party software..)?  <answer79175> Enable Disk Access was a feature on the iPods, but has never been an option on the iPhone, iPod Touch, or iPad.  <answer85818> Some jailbreak-only tweaks have allowed for creating a disk image to be made accessible as a standard flash drive over USB, but their historical records in compatibility - both relatively to iOS updates and towards Windows systems- is very poor. For that matter, none of them is known to work on iOS 6.1.
