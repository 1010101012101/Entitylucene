Mail.app shows empty Gmail labels, but they're not empty in Gmail <body> This used to work, but at some point it stopped.  I have labels defined in Gmail. In Mail.app they show up as folders on the left side, like:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nQhMI.png" alt="enter image description here"  That image shows the codeapartments/code label. The problem is that Mail.app thinks there are 0 message in codeapartments/code, but if I go to Gmail I see 27 messages.  The "Show in IMAP" checkbox is checked in Gmail settings.  <answer277604> I had the same issue, under Mailbox there is a Synchronise option. This worked for me on Sierra.  <comment287920> did you figure it out? <comment288232> Nope, never did. <comment288234> I found a few tips around the internet regarding label and rebuilding did you try all those methods?
