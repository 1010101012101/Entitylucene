How to get a value from a list with a string in AppleScript? <body> What I try to achieve is that the dialog should output the IP adres that is in the list.   precodeset ipList to {DNS1:"8.8.8.8", DNS2:"8.8.4.4"} set input to "DNS1" set output to input of ipList display dialog output /code/pre  it gives an error: error "input of {DNS1:\"8.8.8.8\", DNS2:\"8.8.4.4\"} kan niet worden opgevraagd. " number -1728 from input of {DNS1:"8.8.8.8", DNS2:"8.8.4.4"}  If I do:   precodeset output to DNS1 of ipList /code/pre  it works, so my guess I should do something with variable input.   I've been googling for some time now but I can't seem to find a hint. I'm pretty sure the answer is already somewhere on here but I can't seem to find it. Sorry for that.   strongUPDATE/strong: I think I asked the question all wrong.   Let me retry, I have a list:   precodeset ipList to {DNS1:"8.8.8.8", DNS2:"8.8.4.4"} /code/pre  I would like to loop through the items. So have this coded with less code:  precodeset IP_address to "8.8.8.8" try     set ping to do shell script ("ping -c 2 " &amp; IP_address &amp; "| head -2 | tail -1 |cut -d = -f 4")     if ping contains "ms" then         set Output1 to "DNS 1 UP"     else if ping contains "timeout" then         set Output1 to "DNS 1 DOWN"     end if end try set IP_address to "8.8.4.4" try     set ping to do shell script ("ping -c 2 " &amp; IP_address &amp; "| head -2 | tail -1 |cut -d = -f 4")     if ping contains "ms" then         set Output2 to "DNS 1 UP"     else if ping contains "timeout" then         set Output2 to "DNS 1 DOWN"     end if end try  display dialog (Output1 &amp; return &amp; Output2) buttons {"OK"} default button 1 with title "Resultaat" /code/pre  Again, I'm a newbie, I'm sorry   <answer164319> You need to be asking for the 'item' [record] referred to by the list 'label' [record property]br The label [record property] is DNS1, the item [record] is the string "8.8.8.8"  precodeset ipList to {DNS1:"8.8.8.8", DNS2:"8.8.4.4"} set input to DNS1 of ipList set output to input display dialog output /code/pre  You can easily just shorthand that to   precodeset ipList to {DNS1:"8.8.8.8", DNS2:"8.8.4.4"} display dialog DNS1 of ipList /code/pre  Though I imagine it's part of a larger construction  emEdit:/em btw, you cannot extract a record by its index. That only works for lists without predefined property:record structures.  strongEdit 2/strong after question edit.  Try something like thisâ€¦  precode--debug only, to save actually doing the ping, swap to test --set ping to "ms" set ping to "timeout"  global ipList global resultsList global theString set ipList to {"8.8.8.8", "8.8.4.4"} set resultsList to {} set theString to ""  repeat with IP_address in ipList     --set ping to do shell script ("ping -c 2 " &amp; IP_address &amp; "| head -2 | tail -1 |cut -d = -f 4")     if ping contains "ms" then         set the end of resultsList to IP_address &amp; " UP"     else if ping contains "timeout" then         set the end of resultsList to IP_address &amp; " DOWN"     end if end repeat  --build dialog repeat with theReturn in resultsList     set theString to theString &amp; (theReturn &amp; return) end repeat display dialog (theString) buttons {"OK"} default button 1 with title "Resultaat" /code/pre  sup NOTE: I'm not really used to working in Applescript. It treats globals &amp; locals differently to what I'm used to, so my declarations at the top might be overkill, but it does function that way. /sup  <answer164352> This would be my take on this:  precodeset ipList to {"8.8.8.8", "8.8.8.6", "8.8.4.4"} set Output1 to "" set Output2 to "" global Output1, Output2 repeat with i from 1 to number of items in ipList     set this_item to item i of ipList     my ipCheck(this_item, i) end repeat   if Output1 is not "" or Output2 is not "" then     display dialog (Output1 &amp; Output2) buttons {"OK"} default button 1 with title "Resultaat" end if  on ipCheck(IP_address, i)     try         set ping to do shell script ("ping -c 2 " &amp; IP_address &amp; "| head -2 | tail -1 |cut -d = -f 4")         if ping contains "ms" then             set Output1 to Output1 &amp; return &amp; "DNS" &amp; i &amp; "  UP"         else if ping contains "timeout" then             set Output2 to Output2 &amp; return &amp; "DNS" &amp; i &amp; " DOWN"         end if     end try end ipCheck /code/pre  hr  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YvoDP.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment192638> It is part of a bigger thing and maybe i've asked my question too limited. In the end I would like to loop through this list . <comment192640> not sure you can do that with records, if the list is of variable length. If it's fixed, then you can call DNS1 then DNS2 but you can't call by an 'unknown' record. Might be better to add raw data & iterate through it by index. [This](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18062494/how-to-enumerate-the-keys-and-values-of-a-record-in-applescript) would appear to agree with me. The example given as answer doesn't work for me. return ipList's every item will give you all the values, but it doesn't link them to any specific record <comment192643> thanks for the response, i've updated my question to show what I need. I did see the question you linked to but I don't see the similarity to my question :-) <comment192646> it was referring to iterating a list containing record properties, which cannot be done [apparently]. Your edited question makes no reference to record properties, so I'm a bit stuck now. <comment192662> My Answer updated to reflect change in question...
