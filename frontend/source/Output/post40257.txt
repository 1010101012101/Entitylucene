Application Switcher is minimizing apps <body> At some point when I reinstalled Mac OS X Lion, the application switcher started minimizing apps so that when I switch to one all others minimize.    This causes problems when working with my developer IDE and a browser. Many times throughout my day I want to look at two or more applications at once.  How can I fix this?  <answer40282> You probably enabled a hidden preference for the experimental single app mode. It can be undone with:  precodedefaults delete com.apple.dock single-app killall Dock /code/pre
