Pictures are not deleted from "Photos" iphone app when deleted from "Google Photos" <body> When I delete a picture from "Google Photos" on my iphone it is not deleted from the "Photos" app. How to fix this? Thank you  <answer248797> When deleting on my iPhone, it asks if I will "Allow "GooglePhotos" to delete this photo? This photo will be deleted from iCloud Photo Library on all your devices." I can choose not to allow it and it will only be deleted on my Google Photos app.   I evidently have iCloud Photo Library turned on, and backup and sync on the Google Photos app turned on as well.  Also, check on Settings  Privacy  Photos to see if Google Photos is allowed to access your pictures.
