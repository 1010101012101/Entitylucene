data transfer for iPad app <body> How do I extract the data for a single app to transfer to another device running the same app? I want to move a personal wiki from an iPad 1 to an iPad 3.  <answer116677> You can copy any file from and to your ipad manually using a software tool like iFunBox without the need for jailbreaking.
