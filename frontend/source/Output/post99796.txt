Showing SENT messages in VIP mailbox <body> Is there any way to modify the VIPs box to show all messages both TO and FROM a particular contact?  <answer99798> The VIP mailbox contains From e-mail emonly/em. I haven't found an official link from Apple stating this though.  <comment117431> +1 as I think you're right.. But I want you to be wrong! <comment117432> I want me to be too, and if I am, I'll certainly correct it. But in practice, I've been unable to show TO: email in the VIP box. I can certainly see a use case for it.
