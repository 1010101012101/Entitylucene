Launchd script's output not being logged to system.log <body> Sample script:  precode#!/bin/bash echo "Hello?" ... (other things) /code/pre  When run via launchd, it definitely runs (the other things are being done) but nothing shows up in system.log. I'm running OS 10.9.  I tried replacing that line with  precodesyslog -s "HELLO?" /code/pre  but that also shows nothing.  <answer108731> You can use the command codelogger/codeinstead.br For example codelogger "test"/code will result inbr codeNov  7 17:37:20 bounty.local napcae[82311]: test/codebr in the file code/var/log/system.log/code.
