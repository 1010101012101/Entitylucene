Mount/remove data from misbehaving USB device <body> A colleague of mine has a USB drive with important data on it (no backup). My Mac is the only machine that could recognize it, but it worked for about ~15 seconds before disappearing from the desktop with a popup of "Unsafely Ejected". Disk Utility and "diskutil list" doesn't show the drive, but I am able to find the device through "ioreg -p IOUSB" (it's the bottom device):  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jymOE.png" alt="The bottom device (&quot;SM3267AB MEMORY BAR&quot; is the drive in question)"   This leads me to believe that the device is being enumerated by the USB controller (so the internals of the drive are at least emsomewhat/em functional, even if perhaps the flash module(s) have gone bad) but my knowledge of the USB protocol is limited so I'm not really sure where to go from here.  My question is, how can I mount this drive with the information that is available? The drive is unimportant, if I could just get to a point where I could dd the contents off the drive and try to rebuild the filesystem then that would be a great starting point.  Other potentially useful info:  The device is completely unrecognized on some Windows PCs, while other machines pop up with an "Insert Disk into Drive E:" dialog box. The Mac is the only option for this as it's my personal machine while the Windows PCs are corporate machines with no access to Disk Management and no admin privileges. Filesystem is unknown but it's a 32GB drive and I believe Windows default is exFAT for drives of that size.
