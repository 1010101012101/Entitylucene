How to swap two lists of desktops in two displays? <body> I have two external displays, each have a list of desktops, but today they swapped the list of desktops.   I tried to rearrange the positions of the two displays, but the lists of desktops remained the same.   I tried to pull out and plug in the connect cables, no help.  <comment333821> Did the main display change? (Check under system preferences - displays - arrangement)
