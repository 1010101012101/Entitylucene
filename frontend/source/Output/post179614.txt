headset doesn't works on my iphone <body> My headset doesn't work on my iPhone (4)  But it works on another iPhone.  Sometimes when I turned off my iPhone &amp; unplug the headset it works but now.  How can I fix that?  <answer179619> I had the same issue. I used a broken paper clip to clean out junk that was stuck in the headphone jack.  <comment213002> Can you make it clearer what you are asking. Sentences would help but more information is also needed. <comment213094> Careful with that.  While it is possible pocket lint is the issue, don't poke with enough force to bend anything.  I would also choose a non-conductive wooden toothpick over a paper clip.
