MacBook Pro (Early 2015) works with monitor until connection drops, then never works with the same monitor again <body> My MacBook Pro screen has recently been damaged and I want to send it in for repair, but it will take a little bit for the claim to be processed and I want to be able to continue using it and back it up to an external drive before I send it in. I've been trying to connect the MacBook to external monitors to get it working. Every monitor has worked for a while, but as soon as a connection drops (whether the cable comes loose or the computer goes to sleep) the monitor fails. When I try to reconnect to the monitor using the same process as before which worked, it fails to reconnect. Then I find another HDMI monitor and repeat the process. This happened for three times until I realized that it wasn't just a coincidence.  My MacBook was a 13 inch early 2015 model (12,1) running El Capitan 10.11.(5?).  I've tried clearing NVRAM and resetting the SMC but it doesn't fix the issue once the monitor is rejected.  Does anyone have any suggestions to fix this?
