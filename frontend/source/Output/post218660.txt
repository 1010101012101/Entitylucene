How can I remove the borders from my Dock? <body> Like on the right side of the following image:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/z213A.png" alt=""  <answer218695> I don't use El Capitan, but it should be the same as in previous versions.  ol liIn Finder menu bar: Go → Go to folder…  ul liInsert this path: code/System/Library/CoreServices/Dock.app/Contents/Resources//code/li /ul/li liSearch for: "dockbackground"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qWjuy.png" alt=""/li liNow, what file it is that you need to modify depends on a few things:  ul liIf you have Retina Mac, it's one of the code@2x.png/code files/li liIf you have System Preferences → General → ☑︎ Use dark menu bar and Dock checked, it's going to be one of the files with "dark" in the name./li /ul/li liIn this case, since you want to remove the border, you can just strongmove/strong all these files to another location.  ul liAdmin password required./li /ul/li liThe changes take effect next time the dock loads.

I guess I would rather advice to downgrade to Yosemite :) <comment264608> @Joonas thanks for help, but every time I try to move dockbackgrounddark@2x.png to another folder, I get a message saying: ""dockbackgrounddark@2x.png" can’t be modified or deleted because it’s required by Mac OS X." <comment264752> That would be the [SIP](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204899) talking, @kirion. Many people are choosing not to update for now, due to the crippling effect that it can have. I personally have so many 3rd party apps that would require me to [disable SIP](http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/208478/126929), that I haven't even put any thought into it yet. All the devs of affected applications have written about disabling it and why it's required. Here's [the SIP article about TotalFinder](http://totalfinder.binaryage.com/system-integrity-protection) as an example. <comment264754> Some devs are coming out with new versions, that work within the restrictions of SIP: [Bartender](https://www.macbartender.com/system-item-setup/), [Default folder x](http://www.stclairsoft.com/DefaultFolderX/el_capitan.html). **If I were in your shoes, and this is the only modification you want. I would just leave the dock border as it is.** That said, I'm pretty sure you could disable SIP, make this modification and then turn it back on. <comment268944> @Joonas strange, but after moving dockbackgrounddark@2x.png to another folder, the borders look like this: http://i.imgur.com/8Vg6t2V.png <comment268947> @kirion Is that not what you wanted? The only difference I can see is that there is no shadow. I knew it wouldn't, but I figured it would be close enough with minimal effort. <comment269052> @Joonas yes, the background looks like I wanted now, but after removing the borders, this tiny line appeared above the dock: http://i.imgur.com/aQ13f2r.png how can I disable that? <comment269058> @kirion Huh... This does not happen when I do this on Yosemite. The only thing that comes to mind, is to try and replace the image with one that is just a blank png with not background. Not sure if the png size matters, but to be on the safe side, I'd take the original image, make a copy of it and use photoshop to: select all (`cmd+a`), delete (`backspace`) and save it. Then move that into the folder.
