Launch command using app <body> Could someone please tell me how to insert a terminal command into an "application" so when the app is clicked/opened the command is launched?  <answer228430> Instead of an application, you could always try writing a bash script.  To write and run a bash script, there are a few things to do:  ol liOpen TextEdit from code/Applications/Utilities/TextEdit.app/code and then brpress kbdshift/kbdkbdcommand/kbdkbdt/kbd (⇧⌘T) to convert it into a plain text document./li liInsert a emshebang/em as the first line:  code#!/bin/bash/code/li liAdd your command below it. In the end, your script should look like:  code#!/bin/bash/codebr code&lt;your command here&gt;/codebrbr Then save the script./li liIn Terminal, do codechmod 775 /path/to/your/script/code/li liTo run your script, either click on the file (which should now have an executable icon)./li /ol  <answer228432> Open strongAutomator/strong and choose strongApplication/strong for the document type.  Add a strongRun Shell Script/strong emAction/em.  Add your emcommand line/em to the strongRun Shell Script/strong emAction/em so it's the only emcommand/em in the emaction/em.  Save it as an strongApplication/strong to the desired location giving it whatever name you want.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4LOmi.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment278504> What is it, explicitly, that you're trying to accomplish?  There are several ways to do what you're asking, AppleScript, Automator or third-party Platypus. <comment278506> um I'm trying to put an terminal command in an app so when open all the apps will open so my old computer won't work any more. pretty stupid way to crash it, but please don't judge <comment278507> What is the actual command you're wanting to execute? <comment278508> find /Applications -name \*.app -prune -exec open {} \; <comment278517> For some reason SE doesn't allow me to escape the hash but interprets it as a title character. Thanks for pointing out the plaintext mistake. <comment278525> I've made edits to have it show properly for you.
