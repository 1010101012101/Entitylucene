Finder and other apps lagging behind with 1 click <body> My girlfriend is having a really weird and annoying problem with Finder and occassionally other apps.  The app will start lagging behind with one click. Say that, in Finder, she clicks folder "A". Nothing happens. Now she clicks file "B". As she does this, Folder "A" is selected. Then she clicks folder "C". Now file "B" is selected. And so on.   The behavior will persist until she clicks the app's frame. This only helps for an indeterminate amount of time, though - the behavior might as well resume in two seconds as in two hours.  She'd really like to get rid of it, as it annoys her to no end. I can't come up with anything on Google, maybe I'm not searching for it the right way (I'm not a native English speaker).  She's using a MacBook Pro with OSX Mavericks.  halp!
