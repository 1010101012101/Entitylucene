Is there a TODO list app for mac you can change Font Size? <body> You can't do it, in wunderlist, reminders, any.do, etc.  You really need to ruin your eyes to read you notes.  <answer168657> Google Keep might have a default text size that is large enough.  <answer168658> With OmniFocus you can change the font and display styles with a ton of options.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YSUyw.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <comment199782> Thanks this is an option. I'm looking for something more simple like indeed Reminders... very simple and clean interface
