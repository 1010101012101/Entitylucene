Erase old iPhone - forgotten restrictions passcode and no WiFi <body> I have an old iPhone 4 that has been sitting unused since I got my new phone - it has now sold and I have to clean it out so it's ready for the next person.  Here's the problem:  ol liThe wifi doesn't work and the phone's inactivated (so I can't get online)./li liIt is asking for a restrictions passcode I don't ever remember setting./li /ol  I tried the default (0000) but no luck. What can I do to get this phone back to factory settings?  <answer182110> You can wipe your iPhone with iTunes: Apple's support page  Sometimes, it's also possible to recover the restrictions passcode, but that requires a lot of work. 2   <answer182115> To bypass a forgotten Restrictions password, you must restore the phone as a 'new phone' by connecting to iTunes, without restoring any backup.  You must also make sure to remove the phone from iCloud before you sell it -br https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201351br otherwise the next owner will not be able to activate it.  <answer195787> You can retrieve the restrictions passcode for iPhone 4 (iOS 6-specific) by following the steps outline in the blogpost found here.  Also, for iOS 7 and iOS 8, I've published an updated version of the blogpost cited above.  My new one can be found at http://excentrix.io/recover-your-ios-78-restrictions-passcode-forgotten-or-otherwise/.  <comment216681> FWIW, there is no default passcode. You set up the passcode when you enable restrictions and there is no standard passcode as you are required to enter one.
