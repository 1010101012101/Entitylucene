Is there any antivirus software that DOESN'T slow down Time Machine? <body> Time Machine making a backup to my TimeCapsule has been extremely slow.   I finally figured out that it was an issue with Avira Antivirus. So I looked for a better software. Seeing the reviews I went for Sophos which is another free software.   What a mistake! Same problem there and some others too.  So, let's forget about free software then, I thought. Let's get the number one software (according to Tom's Hardware) Bitdefender instead! But this time I won't be so naive. I'll do my research first. And after a quick googling I find they have the same problem as the previous to contenders.  So, is there any antivirus software that won't break vital functions for my Mac?  <answer254981> I'm not really sure if this fits the ask different format, however, according to AV-TEST (the closest thing to an authority on the subject) BitDefender comes out very high on their scores, especially on the 'slowdown' tests.br I do use it on Windows &amp; it's a lot less irritating than some I could mention.   Avast on the Mac is a known resource hog, btw. I could even feel it on a dual 6-core Mac Pro.br emoops, Avast/Avira... they're both near the bottom of the speed tables, so I'll leave it as is/em  <comment317436> You don't need antivirus on Mac. <comment317441> @IronCraftMan A more coherent inference is: you only need some food, water and appropriate clothing (i.e depending on the climate some wool or a loincloth) ⇒ you don't need a Mac ≈ you don't have a Mac ⇒  you can't install an antivirus app on a Mac you don't have. <comment317530> I use BitDefender on my 2015 MBP and I don't notice any slowdown.
