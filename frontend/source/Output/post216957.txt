What can be with the battery? <body> My MacBook Pro (13-inch, mid 2010, El Capitan) periodically turns off. And this is happening completely randomly - sometimes it works fine for more than a day, and sometimes turns itself off 10 times in an hour, sometimes just turns off when you turn on the laptop. TG Pro App after each shutdown displays the message "Forced - Battery current outside limit". The number of charge cycles: 859. Maybe I should change the battery?  strongUPD/strong I changed the battery but the problem remained.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HulCE.png" alt="Coconuts Battery screenshot"  <answer216961> strongYes/strong you have to change your battery.  The Apple technician will confirm you it is beyond dead, as a dead spring (a battery is just a chemical spring with a finite life).  <comment262238> Could you provide a screenshot of Coconuts Battery? <comment270432> So, I changed the battery but the problem remained. <comment270433> @Thomas added for new battery that I just install <comment270435> You'll have to add some console output from just before it rebooted... <comment270529> Why did you install a 2.5 years old battery? The average time to live of modern batteries is under 3 years, and much shorter if you don't load them every 6 months.
