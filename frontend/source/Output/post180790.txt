Creating power point presentation using iphone photos <body> I have iPhone 5S and I want to create a powerpoint presentation but want to keep on the original resolution of the photos I take from my iPhone. How can I insert the photos from iPhone to my power point presentation AND keep on the quality of the photos?  Thanks!  <answer180792> Once you have inserted the pic in PowerPoint, use the Compress function where you can select the resolution, or keep the original.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KIJzR.jpg" alt="resolution"
