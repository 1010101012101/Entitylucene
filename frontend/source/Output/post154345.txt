How do I change HTML5 video playback speed (e.g., 1.5x, 2x) in Safari for Yosemite? <body> I use ClickToFlash to switch most videos from Flash to HTML5 (QuickTime) versions in Safari.   HTML5 allows for variable speed playback, but not in the quicktime plugin for safari so far as I can tell. Any suggestions?   Looks like there's a Chrome extension: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/video-speed-controller/nffaoalbilbmmfgbnbgppjihopabppdk?hl=en  <comment183762> closest thing I"ve found so far is [Swift for iPhone](http://www.tapparatus.com/swift). Would like a safari extension though..
