Can I fix my iPhone's "No Internet Connection" problem? Network is fine <body> I am typing this question on my mac using my home WiFi network. The internet connection is fine.   My iPhone 5 running iOS 10.0.2, on the other hand, tries ad infinitum to connect to the same network, but displays a "No Internet Connection" in orange text under the network.   I've never had this problem before.   I've tried turning the phone on and off, stopping/starting WiFi, going into and out of airplane mode, but the phone persists. When it tries to connect to the WiFi at my job, it does not display "No Internet Connection", but it also tries ad infinitum to connect without success.   What is causing this problem, and how can I fix it?   <answer274282> The best thing to do is to reset your network settings by going to SettingsGeneralResetReset network settings.  <comment323571> Have you tried `Reset Network Settings` yet?  If not, try that first for all similar issues. <comment323581> Is the phone on your router's permitted MAC address list? <comment323608> Update: I'm at my job now. Resetting network settings allowed it to connect to WiFi here. I'll try it again when I get home. @WayfaringStranger: I've always been able to connect at home in the past, and have not recently changed any of the router's settings, so I have no reason to suspect that. (I'll check it out anyway if it still doesn't work tonight.) <comment323740> Restart the router, perhaps its not giving any DHCP adress to the iPhone, then you would end up in your situation. <comment344826> Welcome to Ask Different.
