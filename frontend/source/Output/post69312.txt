How to use Finder to find all files that do not match a certain criteria? <body> How can I use Finder's search feature to find all files that strongdo not/strong match a certain criteria?  For instance, all files that strongdon't/strong end in ".txt" in the current folder.  <answer69314> Just typing the operand strongNOT/strong before the criteria will do the trick.  So, in this case, typing codeNOT .txt/code will show all the files but the ones with the em.txt/em extension.  <comment80550> Wow! Thanks a lot! <comment313778> Outstanding!  Also to add to this, if your search requirement has more than one word, you need to enclose them in quotes, like `Name  Matches  NOT "two words"`
