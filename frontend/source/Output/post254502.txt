How to allow non-identified developpers'app <body> I'm wondering how to allow non-identified developers' apps since I updated my MacBook Pro to macOS Sierra.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/sGclL.png" alt="enter image description here"  This option seems to have disappeared.   Can someone help?  <answer254504> You can right-click on the unidentified app and choose strongopen/strong.
