Windows print screen when using Boot Camp <body> I have bootcamp installed on my Mac, and when on Windows, I need to frequently capture screens using windows shortcuts such as Print Screen.  Using virtualization is not an option, since I need to run a virtualized environment within Windows already.  On the Mac keyboard (I have a MacBook Pro, and an external think aluminum keyboard), there isn't a print screen key. Is there any equivalent when using a mac keyboard?  <answer98> Follow these instructions in order to map the F13-F15 keys on an Apple keyboard to the functions, Print Screen, Scroll Lock, and Break commonly found on PC keyboards:  ol liOn your PC, copy the following lines into a text file./li /ol  REGEDIT4 [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Keyboard Layout] "Scancode Map"=hex:00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,04,00,00,00,46,E0,5F,00,46,00,5E,00,37,E0,5D,00,00,00,00,00  ol liRename the text file remap.reg/li liDouble click on the file remap.reg and answer yes to the question about adding the information to the registry/li liReboot/li /ol  Function keys are now remapped to their PC equivalents  Source: MacWindows.com  <answer222> This article at Apple's KB includes the mapping of Windows keys to each of their keyboards.  <answer14913> Under Windows (with Boot Camp software installed) you can press kbdF13/kbd or kbdFn/kbd+kbdF11/kbd to take a screenshot.  <comment161> Nice trick!
