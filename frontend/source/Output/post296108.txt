What do the "Other" and "Developer" options in Spotlight index? <body> In Spotlight, you can set what types of items you want to be indexed and searchable.  Most of the options are fairly straightforward: "Contacts" searches your contacts, "Images" for images, and so on.  However, there are two options that I don't understand: "Other" and "Developer".  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2HOgg.png" alt="Spotlight Search Preferences"  The Search Results panel is rather fine grained.  Why is there, what I'm guessing to be, a catch all option with "Other" and what does it catch?  Similarly, what does the "Developer" option index?  I looked in the "Spotlight preferences" page of the "Mac Help", but from what I can tell, it doesn't detail it.  In fact the "Narrow the scope of your searches" topic details everything but those two options under the "Search by the type of items" section:  precodeType of item        Keyword ----------------------------------------- Apps                kind:application                     kind:applications                     kind:app  Contacts            kind:contact                     kind:contacts  Folders             kind:folder                     kind:folders  Email               kind:email                     kind:emails                     kind:mail message                     kind:mail messages  Calendar events     kind:event                     kind:events  Reminders           kind:reminder                     kind:reminders  Images              kind:image                     kind:images  Movies              kind:movie                     kind:movies  Music               kind:music  Audio               kind:audio  PDF                 kind:pdf                     kind:pdfs  Preferences         kind:system preferences                     kind:preferences  Bookmarks           kind:bookmark                     kind:bookmarks  Fonts               kind:font                     kind:fonts  Presentations       kind:presentation                     kind:presentations /code/pre  <answer296121> This is sort of a half answer, half response containing observations and guesses in response to bmike's comment.  It looks like the "Developer" option is for files that macOS considers to be development related files.  For example, I searched for code.h/code, code.html/code and code.m/code files and they were listed under the "Development" category:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vOmOD.png" alt="Developer Files"  "Other" must be for anything that macOS can't make a good guess at.  For example, I searched for code.json/code files and actual code.json/code files showed up under "Developer".  However, files that had unknown or missing extensions showed up under "Other":  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/A77rN.png" alt="Other Files"  I'm still not sure of the complete criteria that macOS uses to discern what files fall into what category.  Additionally, it looks like Spotlight won't even try to display a preview of files in the "Other" category even if they are textual.  <comment373949> I imagine that when you install XCode it will index your projects, documentation and other things associated with developing on your computer and "other" is simply everything that macOS does not recognize as fitting into any other category. <comment373973> Can you find any items that show up if you only search that one item? I could answer generally if so. If not, we might need to wait for someone to do that work (or just know the answers) <comment373975> @bmike See my answer.  I added images showing what shows up in each category as well as some observations.  If you would rather me move that content to the question, I can; but I made it an answer since it sort of answers the question. <comment373976> It will display preview if you have QuickLook plugin that renders text files such as https://github.com/whomwah/qlstephen or similar. <comment373978> Great answer. Iâ€™ll edit in some tips that might help more
