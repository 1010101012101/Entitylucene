iPod Car Stereo Adapter Sound From Source other than Music Library <body> I have an iPod Touch 2nd gen that I can hook up to my car's stereo through a CD Changer adapter. It works great and will play anything in my iPod's music library, and I can even navigate the library from the stereo's interface.   However, whenever I try to play a video or application and hook it up to the iPod adapter, the sound will play briefly before it switches over to the main music library.  Is there any way that I can get past the limitation of only being able to listen to music in my library with this adapter? I've considered going to dealership and having an auxillary sound input installed, but is there anyway to solve this problem from the iPod itself?  <comment25984> Can you give us more details on this CD changer adapter? What is the exact make and model of the adapter? What is the exact make and model of the stereo in the car? Is it standard equipment or a third-party product that you added on? I know of documented incompatibilities with an iPod touch with iOS 4 on a Volvo/Blaupunkt stereo system, for instance. <comment26009> Alpine CD-9835. I'm uncertain as to the adapter's make. Anyway, the adapter does what it's supposed to do. I'm wondering if there's a way to make the iPod do more than what it's supposed to. E.g. get the adapter to think its reading from the library when it's reading from a music app. <comment26029> I think we need to know more about the adapter unit. How does it interface with the stereo in the car? When you say "I can even navigate the library from the stereo's interface" that must mean that the adapter uses the iPod dock connector and is designed to work specifically with the Alpine car stereo. Is that correct? Have you contacted the Alpine company tech support to see if they know of any issues? <comment26219> Since no one here has an answer, I think you should contact the technical support of the company that makes the adapter.
