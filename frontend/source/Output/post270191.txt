Is there a conference call extension or app that integrates with OS Calendar? <body> Are there any apps that set up conference call bridges (like MobileDay) that integrate with Mac OS Calendar app?  Ideally, I would like to be able to setup/schedule conference calls, with my bridge, directly in the calendar app on Mac OS, not iOS. Is that possible? I hope my questions is clear. Thx.
