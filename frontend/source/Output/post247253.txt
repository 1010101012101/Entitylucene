hdiutil: Creating case-sensitive image fs for Steam <body> I'm attempting to use Steam on my Mac, but I set up my system to have case-sensitivity.  Steam has a thread for setting up an image file with a case-sensitive file system, however, I'm finding that it doesn't work.   Regardless of whether I create the sparse image from Disk Utility or from codehdiutil/code, I get a mount-error.  precodehdiutil: attach failed - no mountable file systems /code/pre  However, as far as I can tell I've created the file correctly?  precode#!/usr/bin/env bash set -e  MOUNTPT="/.000" SPARSEIMG="/Users/Shared/Steam/steam.sparseimage"  if [ ! -e "${MOUNTPT}" ]; then     echo "sudo mkdir -m0777 ${MOUNTPT}"     sudo mkdir -m0777 "${MOUNTPT}" fi  if [ ! -e "${SPARSEIMG}" ]; then     hdiutil create -type SPARSE -fs 'Case-sensitive Journaled HFS+' -size 32g "${SPARSEIMG}" fi  hdiutil attach -mountpoint "${MOUNTPT}" -nobrowse "${SPARSEIMG}" /code/pre  Can anyone tell me what I am not doing correctly?  UPDATE: The image that's created mounts properly in Disk Utility, but does not with codehdiutil/code  <answer247262> It's a better practice to leave all uppercase variables for the shell and use lower and or mixed case for user variables in scripts. You need to preface the codehdiutil attach .../code emcommand/em too with codesudo/code if using code/.000/code as the mount point.  Here's my version of the emscript/em which works.  hr  pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"code#!/bin/bash  set -e  mountpt="/.000" sparseimg="/Users/Shared/Steam/steam.sparseimage"  [ ! -d "$mountpt" ] &amp;&amp;  sudo mkdir -m0777 "$mountpt" [ ! -e "$sparseimg" ] &amp;&amp; hdiutil create -type SPARSE -fs 'Case-sensitive Journaled HFS+' -size 32g "$sparseimg"  sudo hdiutil attach -mountpoint "$mountpt" -nobrowse "$sparseimg" /code/pre  hr  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8Uj3A.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment305106> If you read the reference page from Steam, it requires its whole path to be case sensitive hence the very gross `/.000`.
