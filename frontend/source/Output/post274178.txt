Changing the Sudo time in a script <body> I am trying to make a script which edits the sudo time length to 0, requiring the password everytime.  I know if I was not using a script, I would have to type  precodesudo visudo /code/pre  and add the line   precodeDefaults timestamp timeout=0 /code/pre  The problem is I cannot find a way to edit the file via a script.  When I use other editors like vim, nano, or just try echo, the file doesnt save.  I have read that visudo specially signs the file so I need to use visudo.  I have not found anything on the internet which shows how to use visudo in a script.
