Why can't I send my files to the Trash? <body> When I try to delete some items, whether from the keyboard (kbdCommand/kbd+kbdDelete/kbd) or by dragging to the Trash on the dock, I get a message informing me that I can only permanently delete the item.   Why is that? How can I change that? (Is it a permissions issue?)  <answer11159> The Finder can't create or manage trashbins over network shares, and will tell you that.  <answer11173> Check out this link. It provides a number of options for you to try.  http://www.thexlab.com/faqs/trash.html     A variety of issues can result in   making it difficult or impossible to   either move files to, or empty, the   Trash in MacÂ® OS X. This FAQ, derived   from our book Troubleshooting Mac OS   X, covers the following Trash-related   topics:      [snip]   <answer11235> If you suspect it's a permissions issue (and permissions can be the cause of a great many problems in OSX), open Disk Utility (/Applications/Utilities/Disk Utility.app) and select 'Repair Permissions' from the First Aid tab.  It will output permissions problems if finds and fixes.    <comment11659> It does the same for files on my desktop. <comment11667> Interesting.   It *might* then be permissions:  open a Terminal, type `ls -ld ~/.Trash`.  It should look something like `drwx------  46 allbery  staff  1564 Mar 30 23:50 .Trash/` (with your username instead of mine). <comment11670> So how would I fix permissions? With that command? <comment11671> Depends on what's broken, but simple permissions issues would be `sudo chown $USER ~/.Trash; sudo chmod 700 ~/.Trash`. <comment11673> Nope, still wants to trash things permanently. <comment11674> Make sure that you have rw access to your home folder. Select your home folder and choose RMB-`Get Info`. <comment11745> This community appreciates a little extra bit of info or something like that to make answers more than just a link. Can you add some such tidbit here? Thanks! <comment11761> Please run the command `ls -leO@d ~ ~/.Trash` and post the results -- that might help show exactly what needs fixing. <comment11788> It reports this: `drwxr-xr-x+ 37 Moshe  staff  - 1258 Mar 27 13:26 /Users/Moshe  0: group:everyone deny delete drwx------  18 Moshe  staff  -  612 Apr  1 14:49 /Users/Moshe/.Trash` <comment11789> @Mspasov - I have R&W access to my home folder. <comment11790> That looks entirely normal -- apparently it's not permissions on either your .Trash or home folder. <comment11795> This worked! It found a bunch of permissions settings and fixed them.
