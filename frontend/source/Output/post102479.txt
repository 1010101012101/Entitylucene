External Keyboard key remapping <body> I recently bought a CM Storm QuickFire keyboard. This keyboard is made for Windows. It works perfectly on Bootcamp, but when I use it on the OS X side, the keys are completely remapped.  the kbdF/kbd key acts like kbdF/kbd + kbddown arrow/kbd etc.  Does anyone know how to fix this? Or how to completely remap a keyboard?  Extra info: I used an identical keyboard on a work computer (Mac) and it worked well. Any ideas why that would be?  <answer102495> You could use KeyRemap4MacBook brThis app can remap every key on your keyboard.  <comment277417> There are versions of this app from 10.5 to 10.11; highly recommended.
