How to auto show unarchived files in Finder? <body> Currently Archive Utility is configured to unzip all archives opened by me in their directory.  While this is good it is not enough for me, I want it to show me the result in Finder.  How can I obtain this behavior, is there a hidden switch?  <answer14915> Instead of Archive Utility.app, I recommend The Unarchiver. It'll show the extracted files  in Finder. (I'm not sure if it's default behavior but you can change the setting in preferences.)  <comment16146> +1 I would prefer to stay with the default one if possible but if I get no answer for it in few days I will accept your answers. Thanks!
