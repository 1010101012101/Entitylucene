Accessing FTP on different port using Finder <body> Just wondering, is it possible accessing FTP on different port (not port 21) using Finder? For example if I have FTP port opened at port 8021 -  how can I access that FTP server at that port using Finder?  If I'm accessing it using Terminal, it's working like a charm and I have no issue with that.   I want to use Finder because it will be integrated in the side bar, and that makes my life easier when transferring the files to the server.  <comment293923> Does adding `:8021` to the end of the address not work? <comment293927> somehow it doesnt work. adding :8021 or put space and then 8021 it's not working either. <comment293967> This is strange behavior. Are you using Finder's "Connect to Server" menu option? Also, the format for ports is [address]:[port], no spaces. <comment293980> yes, I was using "Connect to Server" options, I was trying [address(space)port] also not working...
