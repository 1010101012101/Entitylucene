How can I install a new dictionary on OS X for use with the "Word of the Day" screensaver? <body> The reason is trivial: I am a fan of the "Word of the Day" screen saver and I would like to add dictionaries for languages other than English and Japanese (these are the two that I can select now in screen saver options).  How can I do it?  <answer95039> This should solve your problem: http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/easily-expanding-apple-dictionary-â€“-mac-only/  <answer95040> If you have 10.8, you can enable French, German, Simplified Chinese, and Spanish dictionaries from the preferences of Dictionary.app:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DqAtN.png" alt=""  They don't seem to be shown as choices for the Word of the Day screensaver though:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9h1An.png" alt=""  I also tried restarting after enabling the dictionaries.  <answer192557> On a rather obscure comment thread, someone explained where you might find the word list that Apple uses to power the screensaver. It is at code/System/Library/Graphics/Quartz\ Composer\ Plug-Ins/WOTD.plugin/Contents/Resources/NOAD_wotd_list.txt/code. The file looks like this:  precodem_en_us1282510  quinsy m_en_us1273791  orbicular m_en_us1220945  alimony m_en_us1250517  genome /code/pre  It is a list of tab-separated entries. On the right you have the word, and on the left, what looks like an ID. But what's it an ID for, and how would you be able to find it for another word not already on the list?  As you might expect, the ID refers to an entry in Apple's default dictionary, the "New Oxford American Dictionary". (That's what "NOAD" stands for in the word-list path above.)  How to find the IDs for emother/em words?  A fellow named Joseph Gentle, in a series of blog posts, shows how to get at the data underlying Apple's dictionaries. In his "Apple dictionaries, part 2" post, he points to code that unpacks the relevant binary file (stored in code/Library/Dictionaries/code) into XML. Using the codededict.c/code and codestrip.c/code files found here, and following Gentle's example, I used the following bash commands to get at the NOAD's XML (these commands are run from the directory where you downloaded the codededict.c/code and codestrip.c/code files):  precodeclang dedict.c -Wall -lz -o dedict clang strip.c -Wall -lz -o strip ./dedict "New Oxford American Dictionary" | ./strip &gt; dict.xml /code/pre  When I codehead/code-ed the first few lines of the codedict.xml/code file, I saw something promising, with entries that looked like this:  precode&lt;d:entry xmlns:d="http://www.apple.com/DTDs/DictionaryService-1.0.rng" id="m_en_us1219333" d:title="abode" class="entry"&gt; /code/pre  Notice that codeid/code param... it's an identifier that looks exactly like the one in the screensaver word list!  I wrote the following Ruby script to parse the XML, and then, using my own word list, create a emnew/em screensaver file that maps my own words to their IDs in the dictionary:  precoderaw = File.open("./dict.xml").read my_words = File.open("./word_list.csv").readlines.map { |line| line.split(',')[1] }  word_id_map = {}  raw.scan(/&lt;d:entry .*? id="(.*?)" d:title="(.*?)" class="entry"&gt;/).each do |entry|    word_id_map[entry[1]] = entry[0] end  my_words.each do |word|   if id = word_id_map[word]     puts [id, word].join('  ')   end end /code/pre  When I replaced the original screensaver file with this new one, it worked. You can now have a "Word of the Day" screensaver that gives definitions for the words you choose.  <comment111459> Yes they don't appear in the screensaver, exactly. <comment111460> See Lauri's comment. It doesn't work with the screensaver. <comment177531> Japanese works though! Thanks! :D <comment215369> Any luck? It seems to make absolutely no sense at all that only English and Japanese dictionaries can be selected but I've found no way around it. <comment215370> No idea why this post got so many upvotes- Didn't solve the question at all :( <comment215371> Seems like a half-assed project/easter egg abandoned after OS X 10.8.
