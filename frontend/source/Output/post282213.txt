iCloud unread email badge won't go away, even though no emails unread <body> Using mail on my mac, I have two accounts my gmail account and iCloud account. The iCloud account has a badge notification of 7 unread messages that won't go away, even though there are no unread messages. Also, my gmail email address is my apple id. When I attempt to remove the iCloud account from my email, it notifies me that the account is used with other apps so I need to remove it via internet accounts. Will this cause me to lose anything or should I try this and then re-add the iCloud account?  I am using Macbook Air with macOS Sierra.  <comment355361> To me this reads as two distinct questions, although they _may_ be related. I would edit this to focus on the badge notifications, and ask another question about removing the iCloud email account. <comment355457> removing iCloud was my attempt at finding a solution to the problem (phantom unread emails)
