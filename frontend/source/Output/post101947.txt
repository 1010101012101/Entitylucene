Is there a way to access and stream one's iTunes music collection from a web browser? <body> Does the possibility exist to access one's iTunes music collection from any web browser? e.g. to browse the library and stream the songs.  <answer101949> One possibility :   Moving your iTunes library to your code~/Sites//code directory and enable files sharing.   With this your the content of your library will be accessible from your browser with your ip ( codehttp://myip/~MyUsername//code )   <answer103065> Found an application that maybe a suitable alternative to Matthieu's answer:  pulpTunes aka emThe Web Server for iTunes/em  Allows you to access your music from anywhere via a web browser.  It is available for both OS X and Windows.  <answer127812> Another application that fits the bill is iHomeServer for iTunes - this app generally extends iTunes's media serving capabilities including providing an iTunes web interface.  The web interface is initially only available internally on your home network, however if you register at http://www.StreamMyiTunes.com then you can log in to your home computer's iTunes from anywhere.  Also has a built in DLNA server so I've been able to replace quite a few different programs with just this one.  http://www.bizmodeller.com/iHomeServer/iHomeServer-Access-iTunes-From-The-Internet.aspx  <answer169303> Use Plex, it's free and awesome. Stream iTunes playlists, stream movies all from your home computer. Tutorials on YouTube.  <answer231650> you can only open iTunes app from browser by going to this link : https://itunes.apple.com/store/  you can't get the music lists...  <comment120095> What exactly does "access the collection" mean to you? <comment120144> @bmike I guess some kind of webserver that would allow your iTunes desktop app to be accessed from a web browser. So that if you are away from home, you could use potentially any internet enabled device as long as it had a web browser. <comment120170> @bmike "Access the collection" - Stream the music, to clarify. <comment120171> So - simply streaming the files as they are stored on the filesystem is easy (as described by Matthieu in his answer). What is harder is getting to the playlists, play count, extra layers that iTunes adds instead of simply being a finder replacement for music. <comment120173> @bmike Ah I see. I'll continue looking to see if something comes up trumps - maybe including the things you mention above.
