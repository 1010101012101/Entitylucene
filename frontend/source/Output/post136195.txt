I would like to delete all the contents on my Iphone but the LCD and touch sensitivity is gone. What should I do? <body> I already did a back up before and now I would like to delete all the contents on my iPhone, but the LCD and touch sensitivity accidentally went gone and blacked out. What should I do? Before the exchange of the new Phone from the Phone company to the old broken one. I would appreciate it if someone could teach me on how to delete all the contents. :)  <answer136197> I don't really know what you mean by the LCD and touch sensitivity is "gone", but try this:br - Connect your iPhone to your Computerbr - Open strongiTunes/strongbr - Select your iPhonebr - On the strongOverview/strong Panel select strongrestore/strongbr - Follow the instructionsbr br I hope it works.
