Music app without iTunes <body> I don't always have PC with me. Also, I have quite big music collection on my DropBox. Is there any good app for iPhone that I can use to download music from DropBox and listen to without connecting to iTunes?  <answer137136> I managed to find appropriate app for this purpose. Its name is VLC for iOS - https://itunes.apple.com/pl/app/vlc-for-ios/id650377962?mt=8  I can connect my DropBox account and play music.
