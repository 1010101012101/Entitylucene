How can I change the tags in the context menu? <body> I can't find any way to edit the tags within the context menu which appears when you double-tap on a file in Finder. Is there a way to choose which ones appear? An example of what I mean is below:  img src="https://i.imgur.com/5IIUwmY.jpg" alt="Screenshot of the context menu tags"  <answer251801> From Finder prefs [Finder menu  Preferences... or kbd Cmd âŒ˜ /kbd kbd , /kbd  Tags  You can check which to show in the sidebar in the top section &amp; in the lower section you can drag &amp; drop the set to use on contextual menus.  It will replace the tag you drag to with the new one.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/BLmZ1.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment313179> Woah, awesome! Thanks.
