How to print a four pages on one page? <body> I would like to print a PDF document, so that four pages of the docoument is printed on one A4 page. (It is 26 pages all in all, so I want to have 7 papers printed having four pages from the pdf on each and having two on the last one). How is it possible to set?  <answer285652> Using Adobe Acrobat Pro 10 one can do 4-up (and more) printing and PDF output in the strongPrint.../strong dialog itself. Using the Page Sizing and Handling options, choosing Multiple and accepting the default 2 by 2 pages per sheet setting. The thumbnail on the right shows 4 consecutive pages of a pdf document per page.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xbhR6.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer285656> You can do 4-up printing from most macOS applications in the standard print dialog.  ol liChoose File menu  Print (Command-P)/li liIf there's a Show Details button, click it.
