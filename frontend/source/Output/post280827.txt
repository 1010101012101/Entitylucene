Gestures don't work when dragging a file from desktop on macOS <body> I've had a MacBook Pro early 2012 before and there are was a feature, that I could use all macOS gestures when I dragged files.  Now I have a MB Pro retina 2015 with Force Touch trackpad and gestures is not working when I'm dragging files from my desktop (with Show Desktop gesture).  It's Force Touch trackpad issue or what?
