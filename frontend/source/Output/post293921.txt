Some of my purchased albums are not showing up on my iphone <body> So, I recently noticed as I was downloading music to my iphone (iphone SE) that some of my albums that I've purchased are missing. They're not on the device itself, but in the cloud. I can see them fine on my macbook, but they're not available to download on my phone. For example, I have the soundtrack "Turbo Kid". It's there, plain as day on my computer. I go to search it on my iphone so I can download it, and it's nowhere to be found. Like, what the heck? Where is it? I thought music purchased from itunes would show up across my devices. I'm signed in, why isn't it there?   I have no clue what to do and any help would be appreciated. I'm missing a good portion of music too.   <comment370935> Try searching it on iTunes. <comment370955> Also try searching this site for missing music (top right corner).  There's quite a few questions with answers that worked for people and they might be able to help you, too. <comment371009> Settings  iTunes and app store, do you have automatic downloads turned on?  How much space is available on your phone? <comment373524> Thanks for the help! Tyson, I don't have automatic downloads turned on as I like to select the music on my phone myself. I have 32 gigs on my phone.
