Can I use two additional Apple Thunderbolt Displays at 60 Hz with my MacBook Pro Mid 2014? <body> Which is the maximal refreshment rate for two connected Thunderbolt Displays? I want to connect them via Mini-Display-Port to the Thunderbolt Ports of my MacBook Pro 15" Mid 2014. I want to use the maximum resolution (2560 px) on both TB Displays. Is it possible to run them both at 60 Hz and max. resolution?  <answer166519> According to Everymac     This model supports a simultaneous maximum resolution up to 2560x1600 on two external displays via Thunderbolt. Alternately, it can support a single display up to 2560x1600 via Thunderbolt and a single 1080p display at up to 60 Hz, 3840x2160 at 30 Hz, or 4096x2160 at 24 Hz via HDMI.   â€¦so I'd say 'yes'.  <answer167860> I am trying to run 4 monitors to my MBP Mid 2014.  Is the answer to this question accurate?  How exactly can this be made to work?  <comment195111> If you didn't buy the displays yet, a TB display update might be imminent, just fyi <comment197057> The answer you have posted under my question is not a solution to my question.
