My SSD just disappeared <body> I have a mac mini, with two ssd, both internal. They worked fine for over a year.  The secondary (not system) ssd has just disappeared. While I was copying a folder on it, a popup appeared, saying it was not properly ejected.  Not even disk utility can see it any longer, even after a reboot. It contained many important files, I really need help.  Any advice?  <comment260790> I hope you have a backup. In the meantime, check cables; try it in an external enclosure over USB; try it on another machine too. <comment260977> No backup needed, it just contained my dropbox and google_drive folders. Now, extracting a disk from a mac mini can be a long and even dangerous operation. I'd rather try something else prior to open my mini..
