How to unlock an iCloud account <body> My apple iCloud is locked for security reasons, when I try to unlock it using my recovery gmail account, I don't see the link sent to me.   I mailed to the iTunes Store customer suport team more than thrice where they gave me steps to follow but still I couldnt unlock my account. I can't update my apps or backup them.   Even if I create a new Apple ID, the old one is stuck to the apple store, popping and asking for password.  <answer228522> If you haven't had any luck with email support, you should call AppleCare. They can unlock the account.  <comment278613> Are you really sure the email you are using is correct? <comment278617> Which steps did you get from Apple, what happened when following them (especially where did they fail)?
