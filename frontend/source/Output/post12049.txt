How to clear the cache or do a hard refresh in Safari? <body> I am used to doing this in Windows with FireFox or IE by pressing codeCtrl + F5/code.  Is there a way to do this for Safari on a Mac?  <answer12052> Shift and clicking the Refresh button generally does a full refresh. You can also empty cache with option command E, and then refresh.  <answer12053> Go to codeSafari &gt; Empty Cache/code, or hit kbdOpt/kbd+kbdCmd/kbd+kbdE/kbd. To refresh, click the refresh button on the addressbar or press kbdCmd/kbd+kbdR/kbd.  Another tip. If you want to restore Safari, like completely clear all the caches, or parts of it, go to codeSafari &gt; Reset Safari/code. I use it usually when I need to clear a lot of memory from Safari, for it will clear the webpage screenshots, the cookies, the favicons, etc.   hr  strongEdit:/strong On the latest version of codeEmpty Cache/code isn't on the codeSafari/code menu any more. It's now on the codeDevelop/code menu. To show the codeDevelop/code menu it, go to codeSafari &gt; Preferences.../code, click the codeAdvanced/code tab, and check codeShow Develop menu in menu bar/code. The keyboard shortcut remains unchanged, though.  codeSafari &gt; Reset Safari/code isn't an option any more. To clear history you can use codeHistory &gt; Clear History.../code and to clear cookies/local storage data, go to codeSafari &gt; Preferences.../code, click the codePrivacy/code tab, and either click codeRemove All Website Data.../code or codeDetails.../code to view and remove it for individual sites.  <answer273360> Empty caches a single time: strongDevelop  Empty Caches/strong  Keyboard shortcut to empty caches a single time: strongOpt + Cmd + E/strong  If you want to emdisable caching/em (for example, if you are developing a website and need to consistently reload changes to files on your site) you can do so: strongDevelop  Disable Caches/strong.  Select this option again to reenable caching.  <comment159207> I appreciate your answer as it solved my issue. <comment159271> @NullPointer great to hear it! <comment160820> The command sequence for that should be Cmd + Shift + R. As described here: http://dotjay.co.uk/2007/05/hard-refresh-firefox-mac <comment331796> I really _need_ this solution to work, but it doesn't. I'm looking at a css file at url ending style.css?ver=1.0  If I view this URL in chrome, or with wget, it's showing the restored version, but safari is refusing to refresh. If I change the URL in any way then it refreshes but that's no use to me. So now I'm left trying to figure out how to backup my saved passwords so I can try the 'Remove All Website Data...' nuclear option. All this so that safari will lose its cache on one poxy little css file. Infuriating! <comment331994> While looking into it yesterday I came across a couple of other ideas which I'll stick here: [RichardF suggests](https://twitter.com/richardf/status/808685513469231104) _"open resource (alone) in a new window, shift-cmd-R, then go back to first window and shift-cmd-R"_ .  [Mathias Bynens suggests](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/46735/how-do-i-truly-flush-safaris-cache#comment53470_46739) _"focus the Web Developer Tools while performing the keyboard combo"_    I can't confirm whether those would fix it for me, because when I came back after lunch the problem had gone away. <comment369611> What can be done on an iPad or iPhone Safari?
