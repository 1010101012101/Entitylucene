Karabiner F1 to Launch Defined Applications? <body> What is the coding to program my F1 key to launch an application that needs to be defined (like Notes) using Karabiner?   <answer235045> The coding is similar to your question here: Karabiner F1 to Launch Safari? You have to add a emvkopenurldef/em tag though.  Some apps are already defined here:  precode/Applications/Karabiner.app/Contents/Resources/vkopenurldef.xml /code/pre  After an update or an upgrade the file may be overwritten so customize your private.xml and add:  precode    &lt;vkopenurldef&gt;         &lt;name&gt;KeyCode::VK_OPEN_URL_APP_Application&lt;/name&gt;         &lt;url type="file"&gt;/Path/to/application&lt;/url&gt;     &lt;/vkopenurldef&gt;     &lt;item&gt;         &lt;name&gt;F1 Application&lt;/name&gt;         &lt;identifier&gt;f1_application&lt;/identifier&gt;     &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::F1, KeyCode::VK_OPEN_URL_APP_Application&lt;/autogen&gt;     &lt;/item&gt; /code/pre  Example:  precode    &lt;vkopenurldef&gt;         &lt;name&gt;KeyCode::VK_OPEN_URL_APP_Notes&lt;/name&gt;         &lt;url type="file"&gt;/Applications/Notes.app&lt;/url&gt;     &lt;/vkopenurldef&gt;     &lt;item&gt;         &lt;name&gt;F1 Notes&lt;/name&gt;         &lt;identifier&gt;f1_notes&lt;/identifier&gt;     &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::F1, KeyCode::VK_OPEN_URL_APP_Notes&lt;/autogen&gt;     &lt;/item&gt; /code/pre  Then enable it in emChange Key/em. Depending on your settings (Consumer Keys or F1-F12 for the F-keys) in System Preferences - Keyboard - Keyboard - F-key behavior you may have to hit the fn-key also.  <comment287442> @BlackOrnament App definition is a different beast! App definitions are used to **restrict** key codes to single apps. Example: cmd_r-s in Word can be defined differently to cmd_r-s in Excel with an app definition included. You may redirect cmd-shift-s to cmd_r-s in Word but don't want that behavior in other apps. Then you add a (predefined) appdef to the key code and thus restrict the mod to Word. <comment287445> How would one modify the private.xml to launch an outside App like Microsoft Word?  Apologies, I'm out of my element & have constantly failed trying to insert it into your fantastic examples <comment287452> @BlackOrnament Apparently this doesn't work with Microsoft apps or I don't get it to work. Maybe I find another way...
