Why did an "Untitled" partition appear that uses up half the disc space and how do I get rid of it? <body> On a Mac OS X Server, I realized today that the 1TB disk has all of the sudden two partitions, both of them around 500GB large:  precode1TB APPLE HDD ST1000LM024   Macintosh HD2:     Mount Point: /     Format: Mac OS Extended (journaled)     Capacity: 499.41 GB   Untitled:     Mount Point: /Volumes/Untitled     Format: Mac OS Extenden (journaled)     Capacity: 499.28 GB /code/pre  When I look in /Volumes/Untitled, I see the following data:  precode.DS_Store .Spotlight-V100 .Trashes .fseventsd /code/pre  And that is it.  So maybe I'm becoming crazy but I am almost certain that this partition has not been there before. Was it created by the OS? Is it important? Can I just delete it, so that my other partition can use the full 1TB space?  <answer228606> You only have bookkeeping files on that partition. Unless there are hidden files, you can delete it and expand the / partition to get all the space to use.  precodesudo ls -laOR /Volumes/Untitled /code/pre  As to why, that might be hard to guess unless someone was contemplating Bootcamp or making a RAID and needed to reduce the size to match the other disk.  To delete it, Disk Utility is the easiest method to resize the main partition once you've deleted the Untitled one. Just read the dialog carefully on which partition's data will be erased and which will remain before pressing OK in the dialogs.

If your second drive was disk2 that held the splits, you would substitute codedisk2s2 disk2s3/code after checking the strongs2 and s3/strong parts matched the volumes to merge.
