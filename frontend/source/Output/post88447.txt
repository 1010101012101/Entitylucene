Clicking help on Time Machine "to improve reliability, Time Machine must create a new backup for you" message cancels it? <body> On a fairly new machine running 10.8.3 I'm getting the message:     strongTime Machine completed a verification of your backups on “&lt;disk&gt;”. To improve reliability, Time Machine must create a new backup for you./strong      Click Start New Backup to create a new backup. This will remove your existing backup history. This could take several hours.      Click Back Up Later to be reminded tomorrow. Time Machine won’t perform backups during this time.   with three buttons: kbd?/kbd kbdBack Up Later/kbd kbdStart New Backup/kbd  When I click kbd?/kbd to get more information, the dialog is dismissed and nothing (apparent) happens.  The dialog comes up again when I manually trigger a backup, so it looks like whatever happened was the equivalent of clicking kbdBack Up Later/kbd.  I'm able to repeat this every time the dialog comes up: clicking kbd?/kbd dismisses it instead of bringing up any help.  When I click, in code/var/log/system.log/code I see:  precodeApr 10 16:43:05 blahdiblah.local com.apple.backupd[31047]: Recovery backup declined by user.

While I'm interested in fixing the underlying problem causing my backups to need to be fixed too, in the immediate I just want to confirm this bug and find the link to Apple's documentation.  <comment103511> This knowledge-base article: [OS X Mountain Lion: If you see a message that you must create a new backup](http://support.apple.com/kb/PH11310) (or a local copy) is *probably* what that help should be linking to, but it'd be nice to hear confirmation from anyone else.
