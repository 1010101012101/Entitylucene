How to add a file into zip? <body> I have a quite large zip file with archived documents and I want to add a new file into it.   How to do it quick and easy? The archive is quite large, so extract+add+compress+delete is not preffered option.   <answer94361> AFAIK There's no (free) onboard app to achieve this.  The easiest way would be to do it via command line.  precodezip /path/to/zipfile.zip file1 file2 /code/pre  If you want to add all(!) files within a directory and subdirectories, run  precodezip -r /path/to/zipfile.zip /path/to/dir /code/pre  It will also add code.DS_Store/code files and that like, so be careful with the latter command.  However, if you're fine with spending some money, you could take a look at http://macitbetter.com. They provide an app called BetterZip 2 which is also capable of doing what you want.  <comment111121> Sad there is no native way in OS X, so lets go back to trees (and command line:)  Isn't it possible to create a service or whatever when I drag and drop file/folder to .zip to launch a command for me?
