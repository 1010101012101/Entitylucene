What sector is Photos folder on hard drive? <body> I'm trying to recover some deleted photos from my Mac, but the problem is that I'm not able to select what folder it should be looking in.  I am, however, able to select what sector it should be looking in and I was wondering if you guys know what sector the pictures folder is in?.  <answer100522> Usually the Pictures folder is under code/Users/&lt;your username&gt;/Pictures//code. Some other third-party photo apps might be under code/Users/&lt;your username&gt;/Documents/&lt;app name&gt;/code.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/sIG3W.png" alt=""  <answer100531> Photos are not stored on a particular sector on your hard drive, the sectors are maintained by the operating system and the hard drive itself. I would suggest scanning the entire drive for deleted files as your best chance of finding the files you are looking for.    <answer120576> You can search for specific file types with Data Rescue 3  For in your case you could just search for jpegs.  <comment118300> I would say the sector is lower level than the folder structure. Especially when you're trying to recover deleted data.
