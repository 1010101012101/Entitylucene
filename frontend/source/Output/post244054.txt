iOS whatsapp offline pending messages not supported <body> I'd like to know if there is a way to press the whatsapp "send" button while I'm offline (for instance on the metro) so they are send latter when rich connection. This can be done on the Android version and is a useful feature. There is a way to do it on the iOS version? If not do you know if there is any intention to implement this feature?  Thanks in advance!  <answer244055> strongHere in iOS that's not currently possible/strong, in fact when you've no connection and try to send a message, the strongSend/strong button will be strongdisabled/strong, and even though you could successfully tap it before the connection goes off, the message wouldn't get sent and a red icon would appear on its right side, to alert you it was not sent and it won't until you don't get connection back.  hr  h1Summary/h1  So the only strongmessages/strong which will be strongsent/strong when you get the strongconnection back/strong will be those who were strongsent/strong when you had actually a strongconnection/strong, but got stronglost/strong during the process of sending the message.  Instead you strongwon't/strong be able to do that when you have strongno connection/strong at all.  hr  Though, developers love to hear their customers strongfeedback/strong, so I highly suggest you to give it a try and contact WhatsApp support (strongsupport@whatsapp.com/strong) for iOS and let them know your idea, who knows it may be added in the next update hopefully!  Hope this helped you out!  <answer270126> For future reference: This is now supported (starting from version 2.17.1) on iOS.  <comment300743> Nice answer. Do you think that's due to background-app-usage restrictions in iOS? Could Whatsapp theoretically get around this and enable background sending? <comment300754> Yes I think anything you can think of is possible. The fact this is already possible In Android and not in iOS makes me surely think there's something in between these two Operating Systems. I think you may try to contact WhatsApp support and tell them your suggestion, or maybe (if you have the right version of iOS) see if this is possible using the jailbreak, but I'm not sure about this. <comment300772> Well Android and iOS are very different in how they handle background apps. In iOS, for an app to be kept open in the background, it must actively be using Notification Services, be connected to a Bluetooth device, be on a VoIP call, or be actively calculating something (like factors of a number). Additionally, it can request to have 3 minutes in the background at a random time the system determines. On Android, it is much easier to keep an app open in the background as there aren't many such restrictions. So yeah, the operating systems are actually pretty different in this regard! <comment300774> Yeap, definitely agree @JohnRamos
