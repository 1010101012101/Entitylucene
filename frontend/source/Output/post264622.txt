How to fix system.log filling up with servermgrd "Record of type dsRecTypeStandard:Config named 'ServicesInformation101004'? <body> h3Record of type dsRecTypeStandard:Config ... already exists in /Local/Default/h3  I passed by a Mac OS X Leopard server (10.5.8) that is no longer accessible via SSH neither ARD. CPU load is maxing out and the system log is filling with these messages:     xserve servermgrd[66]: Record of type dsRecTypeStandard:Config named   'ServicesInformation101006' already exists in /Local/Default. Trying   with new name: ServicesInformation101007      xserve servermgrd[66]: Record of type dsRecTypeStandard:Config named   'ServicesInformation101007' already exists in /Local/Default. Trying   with new name: ServicesInformation101008   How to fix this OS X server?  <answer264624> This is happening because OS X is creating lots of files in:  precode/var/db/dslocal/nodes/Default/config /code/pre  h3Delete files from Terminal/h3  Due to  the high number of files involved don't use Finder but use Terminal instead.  precode$ cd /var/db/dslocal/nodes/Default/config /code/pre  h3Permission denied/h3  You might have difficulty doing this due to not having enough permissions to enter that folder, in that case get yourself super powers:  precode$ sudo su /code/pre  h3Delete files/h3  You need to delete all of the codeServicesInformation..../code files, for example:  precode$ rm ServicesInformation* /code/pre  h3Too many matches/h3  You probably are not able delete all files in one run due to the high number of matches. In that case do delete the files more selectively. In my case, this worked:  precode$ rm ServicesInformation1{1,2,3}* $ rm ServicesInformation1* $ rm ServicesInformation2{1,2,3}* $ rm ServicesInformation2* ... /code/pre  h3Reboot/h3  And my the message is gone from system.log and the CPU usage has gone from 100% to below 1%.  partial source: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/1481182?start=45&amp;tstart=0
