Re-download a paid app from the App Store <body> I paid for a game and app bundle in the App Store. I'm trying to change to a new iPhone, using the same Apple ID, but when I tried to find the app in the App Store, it shows me I have to pay for it again.   I tried deleting the app on the old iPhone to see whether I could re-download it, but it shows me I have to pay for it again. I can't find it in either "purchased" or "updates" in the App Store.   Now I only have the screenshots I took to prove I had these apps before. I asked the software developer, but they said it's not a one time app.   How can I re-download it?  <comment363535> Are you using the same Apple ID that was used to download the game?
