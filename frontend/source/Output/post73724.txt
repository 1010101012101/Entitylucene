mac fails to reconnect to SMB share after coming back from suspend <body> I've got a mac (OS X 10.8.2) that's accessing files on an Win7 SMB share. About half the time the Mac comes back from suspend it can't connect to the SMB share. The Win7 machine is on and the password hasn't changed. But when I try to connect to the SMB server it asks for the username/password. When I type it in, I get told it's wrong. Then I restart the machine (Mac) and it can connect to the SMB server fine.   It's an annoyance really, especially when I've got 8 different terminal windows open and they're all named the way I like etc.   Anyone got a suggestion/tips for re-connecting to an SMB drive after suspend?   <comment133408> why are you running 10.8.2 and not 10.8.5? <comment133419> Because this question is a year old. <comment226499> see http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/153754/smb-auto-unmount-then-unable-to-re-mount-without-restart/190740#190740
