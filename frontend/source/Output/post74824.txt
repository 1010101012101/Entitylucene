Safari extension for adding arbitrary Javascript to a page? <body> Is there a way to do this?  I know I can use Stylish for adding arbitrary CSS to pages on a per-domain basis. Looking for something similar to add Javascript.  For example, let's say I wanted to turn the text red for any h1 element on a particular site if the content of that h1 element is "News". Can't do that with CSS, need to do it with Javascript. Is there any extension I can use to add this? Or would I have to write my own?  <answer74842> The emdotjs/em Safari extension sounds like it will do what you want. It injects the JavaScript (from your code~/.js/code directory) that is served up by a small, local Ruby web server from the original emdotjs/em Chrome extension.
