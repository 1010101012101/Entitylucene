How do I reorder my songs on an album? <body> I upgraded to ios7 this morning, and now strongall/strong my albums have their songs out of order. Does anyone know where the setting to change them back to album order is?  I can't find anything to indicate that shuffle is switched on (it does say "Shuffle" in the top right, but when I press it, it just changes to a highlighted "Shuffle All", which I don't think I want.)  <answer102303> Please use the  Settings - General - Reset - Reset All Settings.  to reset your settings after the ios7 installation.  that should take care of your problem.  <answer103967> This simple step fixed my song orders and left all my other settings intact.  “Reset iPad.

You are quite correct. It did reset the album order. <comment120709> I did too. Got my tracks into order, but lost other info, including my wallpaper. <comment120710> @JohnColeman easy to recover your settings.
