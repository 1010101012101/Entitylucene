Safari makes os freeze <body> I have a Mid-2014 MBP retina 15" running codeOSX 10.11.5/code. It runs flawlessly except for occasional Safari freezes. It happens only while I'm using Safari, and mostly when I try to close a tab. I've contacted Apple support multiple times, and they advised me to try a few things, none of which worked. I've tried to following:  ul licleared history/li lideleted cashes in code~/Library/caches/code and code/Library/caches//code/li /ul  When it freezes, everything freezes with absolutely no response, so I have to do a hard reset every time. What could be the problem? How can I diagnose the problem and fix it?  <answer246139> You can try the following:  In Preferences (kbdcmnd/kbd+kbd,/kbd)  strongPrivacy:/strong  ol liCheck: Allow from websites I visit./li liRemove all website data../li liPrompt for each website one time only/li liAsk websites not to track me/li /ol  strongNotifications:/strong  Remove all  strongExtensions:/strong  Disable them all for now.  strongSearch:/strong  Untick all and only tick: Enable quick website search  hr  Quit (kbdcmnd/kbd+kbdQ/kbd) and re-open the app. Let us know if it happens again? :)  <comment303399> May or may not work, but an answer is better than no answer. :) <comment304148> Hey, thanks. I've been trying this for a couple of days, hasn't frozen yet. It kind of slows down after a while, though. Specifically, when I try to select the address bar either by clicking on it, or doing `Cmd+L`, it hangs for a second or so, and then lets me type. <comment304149> The same is true for opening a new tab with the keyboard shortcut. <comment304150> So it gets slower by time until you clear cache again? Thnks for Cmnd+L never knew about it! hehe <comment305332> It doesn't get linearly slower. Sometimes it's slower, sometimes it's working fine. I'm inclined to think it's a RAM issue, but every other app works fine, and it's only Safari that creates problems. <comment305359> Search for FreeMemory on Mac AppStore, makes space if theres none and u can check how much free RAM u got etc. <comment305365> Thanks. I can already check this using activity monitor -- but isn't it weird that it's only safari that freezes? Also, I'm sure the OS has better ways of handling the situation if the system runs out of RAM: freezing up entirely is so 90s :)
