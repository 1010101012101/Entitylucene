Does OSX have a hidden "Device Manager" list like Windows? <body> Back in the Windows world there was a Device Manager control panel that would list all the devices that were connected to your computer.  There was even an option to show "hidden devices", basically a list of items like thumb-drives, SD cards, etc. that were once connected to your PC.  I'm just curious if something like this exists in OSX? Is there a list of devices that are connected or ever were connected?  <answer49987> Search for codeSystem Information/code in Lion or later (or codeSystem Profiler/code in Snow Leopard and earlier versions of Mac OS) in Spotlight (press kbd⌘/kbd and kbdSpace/kbd).   The program is in /Applications/Utilities and is the tool to see the connected USB devices and other hardware details. It is quite simliar to codeDevice Manager/code on Windows.  Alternatively you can access it via the Apple Menu  code/code - codeAbout This Mac/code - codeMore Info.../code - codeSystem Report.../code  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LMa7A.png" alt="System Information"  The System Information can save system profiler information to a file, so you could review an older snapshot to see what was connected once, but the Mac OS doesn't record all the devices connected - just the ones actually connected when you run the tool and it scans the current items on the device tree.  <comment57292> +1, BUT: System Profiler does NOT offer you any option to change device settings. <comment57301> remark: this instructions are correct for osx 10.7. On 10.6 and before its called: System Profiler <comment59055> Thanks! And it's good to know that OSX doesn't record all the connected devices. That was one _feature_ that annoyed me in Windows because I would become so OCD that I would periodically go in and delete/cleanup the unused invisible items! <comment218980> the profiler just only shows the report you can't configure or reinstall your device or drivers <comment261574> remark: in Mavericks (10.9) and above, the `More Info...` button is now labelled `System Report...`. <comment310565> Still wondering if is possible to manage (not only list, like the System Information do) my USB devices, like turning off the trackpad USB.
