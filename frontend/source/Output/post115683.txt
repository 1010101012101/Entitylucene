How does one change the share name with file sharing in Mac OS X? <body> In Mac OS X you can create shared folders. Usually the share name is the same as the folder, but it can be different. For example if the is a user with display name "John Doe" and system name "johnd" the system creates a Shared folder named "Public" in the users folder Users/johnd/Public but the share name is "John Doe's Public Folder".  If that Shared folder is removed from the File Sharing folder list and re-added then it just shows as "Public".  How do you change the Share name?
