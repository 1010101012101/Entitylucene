documentation for `tcpdump -I` format? <body> Apple's version of codetcpdump/code has a -I option:  pre        -I     Put the interface in "monitor mode"; this is supported  only  on               IEEE 802.11 Wi-Fi interfaces, and supported only on some operat-               ing systems.  code                Note that in monitor mode the adapter  might  disassociate  from                 the  network with which it's associated, so that you will not be                 able to use any wireless networks with that adapter.  This could                 prevent  accessing  files on a network server, or resolving host                 names or network addresses, if you are capturing in monitor mode                 and are not connected to another network with another adapter.                  This  flag  will  affect the output of the -L flag.  If -I isn't                 specified, only those link-layer types  available  when  not  in                 monitor mode will be shown; if -I is specified, only those link-                 layer types available when in monitor mode will be shown. /code/pre    I am trying to find documentation for this file format. I have a packet capture and the fields just don't line up properly. I have no problem parsing standard codepcap/code files, but Apple seems to be using a non-standard coderadiotap/codeheader.  Does anyone have docs?  <comment115307> Here's [Apple's Developer page](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#qa/qa2001/qa1176.html) on the subject. <comment115367> Those pages do not document the `-I` mode.
