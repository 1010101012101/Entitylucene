Quicktime record screen without the overlay <body> I'd like to record part of my screen, but the QuickTime screen recorder dims the rest of the screen while it records (the gray in the screenshot below).   How can I turn this dimming off so I can use the rest of my computer normally while recording.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/M8URX.png" alt="Gray screen mask overlay whilst recording"  <answer185904> You can use the dimmed area as normal, the dimming is to show what is being recorded.  I did look in the preferences files of Quicktime and there is no listed toggle to disable that.  One thing that will be different is screenshots include the dimming as it is a overlay that is almost top layer but below the screenshot layer.  <answer185905> This is not possible with QuickTime. There is a reason it is called Screen recorder.   It will record whatever screen is on top (even if you switch it) it will now keep recording the new window.  You can not fix it to a specific window and move on letting it record that same window.  <answer185907> The screen dimming can't be disabled, but what you could do is record the whole screen and then import the finished recording into iMovie and crop it (instructions) to only contain what you want it to.  Instructions, in case of link rot:  ol liIn the timeline, select the clip or photo you want to crop./li liTo show the cropping controls, click the Cropping button./li liClick the Crop to Fill button.  An adjustable frame appears on top of the clip in the viewer.  Note: This frame is constrained to a 16:9 aspect ratio./li liMove and resize the frame until youâ€™re satisfied with the result./li liTo apply the crop, click the Apply button in the cropping controls./li /ol  <comment219494> Please summarize or copy the relevant steps from the linked article, to prevent [link rot](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_rot). <comment219495> I think you may have misunderstood the question. I don't think the OP is unclear on what is being recorded; he simply wants the screen dimming to be disabled. <comment219513> @tubedogg this is what I read in the question: "I'd like to use the rest of my computer normally while recording." <comment219514> Yes, in relation to "How can I turn off this dimming?" His screen is bigger than the recording area, so he seems to want to be able to do other things outside the recording area while it is still recording, without having to see through the dimming. <comment219516> @tubedogg do you know how to use the rest of the computer while a screen recording is going on ? outside of the recording area? <comment219517> So you're saying that I cannot use the computer outside of the recording area? That is factually incorrect. If I bring another window forward, _and it is inside the recording area_, then yes, the recording will capture it. Otherwise, no, it won't, regardless of what application is "on top". See [this test screen recording](https://www.dropbox.com/s/0qvz3q6jwpm9okf/Untitled.mov?dl=0) I just made. I was using Finder in a window next to the recording area the whole time, except at the end where I typed "Testing". <comment219518> Again, the OP's question was "how can I turn off this dimming". That does not seem to be possible, but other than making it harder to see the area outside the recording, it does make the computer unusable. <comment219521> Well, the OP wants to disable the dimming so he can use the rest of the computer. As you confirm even if disabling would be possible, using the rest of the computer would impact what is been recorded if the screen changes. <comment219534> could you explain how to use the "rest of the computer" while the screen recording is going on ? <comment219591> Consider it done!
