M4V video playing sound but not picture <body> I have a few videos that previously played fine, and now they play the sound but have no picture (on both iTunes and QT).  The only thing that I did was to use MetaX to modify the meta data.  The file size is still the same size.  I've looked at the QT inspector, and have attached it here.  Any thoughts on how to get the video to play?  Thanks!   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FcpEm.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment164291> Have you tried playing the videos on another device? Just to confirm that the problem is the videos and not your Mac? <comment164350> Yes.  I've tried on a MacMini, and Air and an iPad.  The crazy thing is that it worked on the iPad, until I resynced.  Same movie, different result.  Very strange. <comment164359> Do the videos play okay with [VLC](http://www.videolan.org/)? <comment164714> Nope - same issue with VLC. <comment164718> Sounds like MetaX might have corrupted something. Which version of MetaX did you use? If you open the files in VLC does it say anything interesting in "Errors and Warnings..." or "Messages..." under the Window menu? <comment164906> Not sure - I'll check.
