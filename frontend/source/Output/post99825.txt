Final Cut Pro X crashes when using transform tool <body> Starting from some update of the Final Cut Pro X (~ 10.0.7) I have started to experience frequent crashes of the Final Cut when using the transform tool.  It doesn't seem to crash when setting transform to video directly in the inspector. But when I use the visual transform tool, it works for some time, but then at some point it crashes.   I've already removed Final Cut, and installed the last version (10.0.9), but the problem persists.  Has somebody ever experienced a similar problem?
