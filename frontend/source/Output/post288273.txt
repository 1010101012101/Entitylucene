Require password every time drive/partition is accessed? <body> I just created a new partition on my macbook's SSD set to Journaled/Encrypted.  It seems I only get prompted for the password once, when the macbook is turned on, rather than every time I try to access it.  How can I make this drive inaccessible unless a password is provided on-the-spot?  <comment364039> I'm not sure it is possible with encrypted partitions, so If you will not find a solution - consider using encrypted disk images instead. They will ask password every time you mount them. <comment364049> @toma but mounting only happens once right? If not, how do I do this? <comment364051> the scenario of usage is 1. login to your account 2. mount encrypted image 3. work with secure data 4. unmount. Also you can try to automate mount/unmount using Apple Script or sh. http://osxdaily.com/2013/05/13/mount-unmount-drives-from-the-command-line-in-mac-os-x/ <comment364053> @toma but I want to be password prompted every time I try to read/write <comment364056> Well, that is the problem. I don't think it is possible to require password on read/write - it can be done only on mount. As I know, HFS driver is not designed to work as you expect in this case. You can try to search some 3-rd party solutions, that will provide virtual drive (WebDav), that will redirect read/write calls to encrypted drive, and mount/unmount it when needed.
