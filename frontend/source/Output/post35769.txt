Can't Control Volume on Lockscreen with Volume Buttons on iPhone <body> I upgraded to iOS 5 and I just noticed that I can no longer control the volume level on the phone by pressing the volume buttons while the screen is locked. I recall distinctly that I was able to do this on iOS 4. Has something changed or did I miss something?  <answer35799> ★ [Settings  Sounds  Ringer and Alerts  Change with Buttons = strongON/strong]  Tapping the home button twice should bring up the audio player/volume slider on the lock screen. While it's visible try the buttons on the side — depending on whether or not you see the volume slider move on the screen should tell you if your buttons are not actually working.  hr  This is straight from the iOS 5 user guide:  When iPhone is locked, nothing happens if you touch the screen. iPhone can still receive calls, text messages, and other updates. You can also:  ul liListen to music/li liAdjust the volume using the buttons on the side of iPhone (or on the iPhone earphones) strongwhile you’re on a phone call or listening to music/strong./li /ul  Use the center button on iPhone earphones to answer or end a call, or to control audio playback.  ul liiPhone User Guide For iOS 5.0 Software (PDF)/li /ul  <comment40774> No, nothing has changed. Volume buttons should work as they did with iOS4. ¿Have you jailbroken your iPhone? ¿Have you tried pressing them a bit harder? <comment40819> Ah. I had a jailbroken iOS 4. It must've been something I installed then.
