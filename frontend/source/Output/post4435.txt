Is there a PDF viewer with a vertical split screen feature? <body> I have a very wide PDF and I would like to find a PDF viewer which would allow me to split the screen vertically so I can keep the left side the same while scrolling the right side back and forth.  I found the application http://skim-app.sourceforge.net/, but it only allows one to split the screen horizontally.  Is anyone aware of such a PDF viewer on the Mac?  <answer4502> A quick look suggests that this feature does not exist in any PDF reader.  One responder on this forum [ http://is.gd/i0R12 ] believes that there are no such readers.  Most of the links in this Google search [ http://is.gd/i0QQy ] are requesting such a feature be implemented in some reader, any reader.  <answer22894> You can take a snapshot in Skim (File - Take Snapshot), then using the wonderful ShiftIt move the snapshot and the main view of the pdf to the opposite sides of the screen (vertically) with just a few keystrokes. Or horizontally. Or to all four corners if you want.  <comment4325> I don't know a special app. You can open two instances of your pdf viewer and tile them vertically on the screen ;-) <comment4335> While true, it's also a PIA. <comment92513> Neat! This fulfills my need for vertical split. I already use BetterTouchTool for window moving and resizing, it's wonderful. So thanks for the snapshot tip! <comment312015> Open the same PDF using Preview and Skim and arrange them side-by-side.
