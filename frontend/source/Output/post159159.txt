Configure menus to close on roll out <body> Is there a way to change the behaviour of menus so they close when the mouse cursor leaves the menu? Currently, if I open a menu in an application, and then roll to the bottom of the screen, the dock will not open until I either click somewhere, or hit escape to close the menu.  Ideally menus would close after a small delay to avoid inadvertent closing when navigating menus.  (OSX Yosemite)
