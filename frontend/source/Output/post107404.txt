Is it safe to allow apps to access your photos? <body> Some wallpaper apps try to access your camera roll in order to save photos there. Is it safe to do so ? What am I giving developers once I allow them access to my camera roll's photos ?  I'm just concerned a bit regarding my privacy.  What are they allowed to do with the photos ? Are they encrypted or plain .img files that they can view ?  <answer107413> That is the purpose of asking you to allow access to your photos. Allow only the apps that you trust. In general if you set in security&amp;privacy settings to allow apps only from the mac app store and certified developers, you have little to concern about.   <answer107431> emstrongWhether it is safe or not depends on whether you trust the app and the developer's privacy policy or not./em/strong  When you give access to an app to photos (either through the prompt that comes when the app tries to access photos or through strongSettings  Privacy  Photos/strong), the app gets access to emwrite new photos/images to your strongCamera Roll/em/strong and to emread all your photos/em on the device in an unencrypted form.  The date and time when each photo was taken is embedded within the photo. Plus, if you have enabled strongLocation Services/strong for the strongCamera app/strong, then an app that has access to the strongCamera Roll/strong can also find out emwhere/em you took the photos.  How the app then treats the photos and the associated metadata (like date/time and location), if it uploads or sends them elsewhere, is left to the app. For example, once you give permission, iOS apps for popular services like Dropbox, Facebook, Flickr and Google+ can upload all your photos to their services. emWith iOS 7, these apps can also be allowed to do it in the background (when you're not actively running the app). Most users wouldn't even actively know which photos are being uploaded and when./em  From the Data Management in iOS page of the developer documentation:     Similarly, your app can load, display, and edit photos from the Photo Library, as well as use the built-in camera to take new photos.   So far, Apple has not implemented any granular settings in iOS within strongPrivacy  Photos/strong to restrict read access to specific photos in the photo library.  <comment125955> Do you know what kind of access do we give developers ? <comment125960> We do not give access to the developer, we give access to his app to use our photos within the app or save photos to our photo library. <comment125964> Can this be abused ? Is the app limited to certain use of the photo library ? Can the pictures be accessed or exported to another location ( online server ) ? <comment126019> Hmm, it seems like some apps can abuse this power and handle our photos in a way that is deemed unacceptable. <comment126022> Yes, they can. So far, Apple has not implemented any granular settings within **Privacy  Photos** to restrict read access to specific photos in the photo library. <comment126044> This doesn't really answer the question, evident from the fact that the OP re-asked it in comments. And there are no settings regarding allowing apps only from the App Store / certified developers on iOS, which is the subject of the question. <comment126045> There is no setting in iOS for that? Actually all apps in iOS are from certified devs and all apps are reviewed by Apple, so there is less to concern than the mac. <comment126064> Thanks for clearing this out. I will refrain from allowing such access from unpopular apps then !
