Can I update an early Airport Time Capsule? <body> I have an Apple Time Capsule model A1254. It has a 1Tb drive. Is it possible to replace the drive with a larger capacity unit? It seems a shame to replace the whole unit. Thanks  <answer176094> It seems to be possible: Here is an ifixit.com article.  In the comments there the following successful upgrades are mentioned:  ul liWD Red 3TB/li liWD20EARS 2TB/li liSeagate ST4000VN000 4TB/li /ul  At youtube you'll find several movies demonstrating how to replace the HDD (e.g. Apple Time Capsule Hard Drive Upgrade)  Check the power consumption specs of your new HDD as well as the comments about reliability issues of the power supply unit of the Gen 1 Time Capsules all over the net.  <answer286203> Here is the link to the videoclip on Youtube where a guy replaces his 1-st generation Time Capsule disk with a new disk with 8 Tb capacity.  And it works after formatting - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVwUMobLa_8  <comment207802> Thanks very much. Just what I needed to know, especially the possible pitfalls ( power, speed, reliability). I'd better think this over some more..
