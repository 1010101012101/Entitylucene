Network Caller ID on iOS without a computer <body> Network Caller ID (or NCID) allows incoming call information for a regular landline telephone to be sent over a local network to display on computers and other devices. There are programs for OS X that can handle this, and there's even one solution that broadcasts to iOS devices via a computer using the Prowl app.  Is there is a solution to show NCID details on iOS that doesn't involve a computer?  <answer111699> Since there didn't seem to be a stand-alone solution, I made a little app that connects to a NCID Server and gets the list of phone numbers:  http://erike.net/ncid/  Unfortunately Apple didn't allow me to keep the connection open in the background, but I may release a fix for this in Cydia.
