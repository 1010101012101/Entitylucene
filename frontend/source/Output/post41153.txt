Is it possible to copy Firefox bookmarks with iOS Safari? <body> Quite simply I use Firefox sync on both my Macs and want to migrate these bookmarks to my iOS devices, not necessarly sync all the time, just migrate them as they currently are.  Is it possible, and how should I try doing it?  <answer41159> Here are some ideas:  ol liUse Firefox Home/li liImport bookmarks from FireFox to Safari on one of your Macs and sync them to your iOS devices using iTunes./li /ol  <answer41171> Export the Firefox Bookmarks     ul   liOn the menu bar, click strongBookmarks/strong and select emShow All Bookmarks/em to    open the Library window./li   liFrom the toolbar on the Library window, click strongImport and Backup/strong    and choose emExport Bookmarks to HTML..../em/li   liIn the Export Bookmarks File window that opens, choose a location    to save the file, which is named embookmarks.html/em by default. Thebr   desktop is usually a good spot, but any place that is easy tobr   remember will work./li   liClick the strongSave/strong button. The Export Bookmarks File window will       close. Close the Library window.      Import the bookmarks.html file into Safari on the Mac by navigating   to the strongFile/strong menu within Safari, choosing emImport Bookmarksâ€¦/em, then   selecting the file you saved.You may want to delete or archive the   existing Safari bookmarks first./li   /ul   You can now sync Safari on the Mac with Safari on your iOS devices. iCloud syncing will make this two-way and happen over the network, but you can also sync using USB and connecting to iTunes if the bookmarks will change rarely.  <comment46606> Firefox home is a nice little app, but it is not a browser so for me it fails on that. I will prob go down the iTunes and safari sync at some point, hoping there is another solution out there. Thanks
