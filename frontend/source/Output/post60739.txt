MacBook Pro won't recognize my analog audio jack headphones. Help? <body> Periodically, my MacBook Pro 17" stops recognizing my headphones. No amount of unplugging and replugging seems to help. The sound settings never show headphones as an output device. How can I fix this? The only thing I can find elsewhere on the Internet are people saying, "Reboot!" This works, but is impractical and annoying.  <answer60740> There seems to be a bug whereby if the headphones are plugged in when the MBP is put to sleep and are not present when it is rewakened, the headphones stop being recognized. The solution is to:  ol liUnplug the headphones/li liPut the MBP back to sleep (close the lid; without an external display hooked up)/li liPlug the headphones back in/li liWake the MBP by opening the lid. /li /ol  This should fix the problem.  <answer88542> open system preferences and go into sound. under the output tab make sure where it says "use audio port for:" is set to "sound output"  <answer92712> Yes sleep the macbook connect the headphones then awake the mac, voila!  <answer106726> Plug-in the headphones. Using the button in the upper right corner of the powerbook, restart the computer. Hold down the alt option key while clicking on the speaker volume icon in the top, menu bar. The headphones should show on the dropdown menu. They are now you output device. This worked for me.  Simply ... plug in the headphones. Restart the powerbook.  <answer134849> Ok, looks like I fixed my issue by resetting PRAM. Here are the steps:  ol liShut down your Mac./li liLocate the following keys on the keyboard: Command (âŒ˜), Option, P, and R. You will need to hold these keys down simultaneously in step 4./li liTurn on the computer./li liPress and hold the Command-Option-P-R keys before the gray screen appears./li liHold the keys down until the computer restarts and you hear the startup sound for the second time./li liRelease the keys./li /ol  Source - http://support.apple.com/kb/ht1379  <comment69956> Regular audio jack headphones or USB ones? <comment69983> Regular audio jack. <comment105789> Im tired of this thing.... need some permanent solution <comment108726> How is this different than [the answer above](http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/60740/5472)? <comment125260> Is the restart really necessary? <comment159056> Can you explain why that may happen, and how the issue can be fixed permanently please? <comment159107> I definitely feel your pain. My hypothesis is that the save/restore from sleep mode gets the sound driver in a weird state and the steps above unwind it. If I'm right, a permanent fix requires someone at Apple to fix the code. If I'm wrong, then there may be a permanent fix. If you find one, please post it. <comment346378> Works on iMac too. Sleep it from the apple menu ...
