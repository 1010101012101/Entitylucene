They are both commercial. Copytrans (19.99$) is available for Windows, while iExplorer (34.99$) has also a Mac download. And both apps have free test downloads.  <answer71013> Here are two alternatives both for free:  For Windows: SharePod  For Mac: DeTune   <answer71020> You could use the Google and Amazon double play to have access your music and sync and store locally certain tracks.  ol liGoogle Play, where you can upload 50,000 songs for free and access them all from a web browser, this works on iPhone, and there is a handy utility that you can install on your PC / Mac that will manage uploading to Google Play automatically. The only down side to Google play is that you must be connected to the internet to stream and play the music.

Answers on Ask Different need to be more than just a link. It's okay to include a link, but please summarize or excerpt it in the answer. Thank you :) <comment82452> You're right. I added some comments. <comment95327> I couldnt have really explained in any greater depth than I had already done so. The article explains in more detail & I didnt want to copy it word for word. <comment157161> All these software allow only to copy from device to pc. The question was the other way around. <comment196937> SharePod apparently (after some trying) only copies music FROM and not TO an iPhone/iPod :-( <comment228366> You might want to have a look at [Tonido](http://www.tonido.com/support/display/docs/How+to+transfer+music+from+computer+to+iPhone+or+iPad+without+iTunes).
