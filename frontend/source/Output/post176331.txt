Which firmware should I download for iPad 2 A1397? <body> I want to update an iPad 2, I've done this before but not with this model yet  The model is A1397, according to Apple warranty check is: strongiPad 2 3G (Verizon)/strong  I want to download the file .ipsw directly from Apple server without using iTunes  Which version I download: strongiPad 2 (CDMA)/strong or strongiPad 2 (GSM)/strong?  <answer176370> The best way to find out is actually to use iTunes &amp; see which file it downloads.br You don't need to let it go through the entire process, you can set it to download only.    Based on personal experience - my iPhone, according to all online evidence, [&amp; the fact that it has a SIM card] is a UK GSM model - yet iTunes always downloads the CDMA update for it.br I've never attempted to download the GSM instead to see what happens.  I always do an update in clear stepsâ€¦    ul liDownload only  /li liSync  /li liBackup  /li liUpdate/li /ul  Everymac lists that as as CDMA, btw.  For independent download - http://ipswdownloader.com carries listings of Apple's file locations, but they don't list 8.2 yet.  <answer176388> You need the CDMA version.
