Dual Boot 10.7 Ubuntu <body> I have an old MacBook running 10.7 and want to install Ubuntu 16.04  I Installed coderEFIt/codebr I used Disk Utility to create a 100GB partition at the end of the disc.br I downloaded codeubuntu-16.04.2-desktop-amd64.iso/code which I copied to a USB key.br I booted using rEFIt, created a SWAP partition of 1GB and the rest as EXT4 with code//code as the mount point.br I installed codeUbuntu/code then attempted to reboot.   I expected to see the tux logo after shutdown and starting again, but see 4 options:-  precodeEFI\ubuntu\fwupx64.efi from EFI EFI\ubuntu\grup64.efi from EFI EFI\ubuntu\shim64.efi from EFI EFI\ubuntu\MokManager.efi from EFI /code/pre  Selecting the codegrup64.efi/code entry boots to Ubuntu.  How do I fix this to get a simple boot to Ubuntu menu?  A possibly unrelated issue, the Wifi does not work (I did not select the update system option on initial installation). There is a transient message on boot indicating the need to install additional drivers, but I can't seem to relocate it.
