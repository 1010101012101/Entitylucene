El Capitan Remove Finder from Application Switcher (cmd tab) <body> I'm having trouble removing the Finder icon from the application switcher in El Capitan.  The guides seem to be all from 2012 - I get permissions errors (even using codesudo/code) when I try to update codeInfo.plist/code.  Is there a way to edit code/System/Library/CoreServices/Finder.app/Contents/Info.plist/code, or a completely different way to remove the Finder that I'm unaware of?  <answer232374> The file is protected by System Integrity Protection as outlined here.  By disabling SIP you will be able to edit the info.plist again.  So boot to Recovery Mode by pressing kbdcmd/kbdkbdR/kbd while booting.  ul liOpen Terminal.app (menubar - Utilites - Terminal)/li liEnter codecsrutil disable/code/li liReboot your Mac /li liEdit the file em/System/Library/CoreServices/Finder.app/Contents/Info.plist/em/li liReboot again to Recovery Mode and enable SIP again: codecsrutil enable/code/li liReboot your Mac/li /ul  hr  You should also be able to edit the file directly after booting to Recovery Mode without disabling SIP:  precode/Volumes/name_of_main_volume/usr/bin/nano /Volumes/name_of_main_volume/System/Library/CoreServices/Finder.app/Contents/Info.plist /code/pre  hr  You may have codesign Finder.app afterwards:  precodesudo codesign -fs - /System/Library/CoreServices/Finder.app/ /code/pre
