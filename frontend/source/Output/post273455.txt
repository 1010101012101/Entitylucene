Magic Mouse drags windows around <body> I run a Mac Pro (trash can) with a Magic Mouse. My issue seems to be random, when moving the mouse around the cursor jumps to the active windows 3 dots (for closing, maximizing and minimizing the window). When it does this cursor jump it always latches onto the window, and because I was in the process of say moving from one monitor to the other it drags the window and moves it. It does this by just dragging the mouse, no clicks. This behavior is very frustrating. It happens a few times everyday. I have not been able to figure out how to stop it. Is it a built-in gesture that I can disable? Something I haven't found yet?  My Mac is all up to date running the most current software. I use two monitors and thats when it seems to happen most, when moving the cursor from one to the other. I do have BetterTouchTool installed using the default settings. The only gestures I have in there are for two finger swipe left and two finger swipe right (to go forward or back). My batteries are also fresh. Doesn't matter on battery level, it always happens. Any ideas?  <comment343800> Try plugging in a usb mouse and see if it still happens.  That way you can narrow it down to either the mouse or the MP. <comment344895> A regular (wirless usb) mouse has yet to cause the same issue. It works smoothly with no cursor jumps. It seem it is related to the touchpad/gesture of the Magic Mouse. Any ideas on where to look? I have disabled the default gestures I don't want and cannot find one related to the issue I have. <comment344899> Disable/Uninstall BBT to see if it's causing the problem.  See if there's any other BT devices connected to your Mac that could cause interference.  If all those don't fix it, you could have a bad mouse.  If it's under warranty you can have it replaced.
