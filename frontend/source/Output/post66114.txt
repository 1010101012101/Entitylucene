Where does Quicktime store its screen recordings? <body> I was recording my screen whilst giving a presentation. Instead of stopping the recording cleanly I closed the lid of my laptop. Later, when I opened it again, the recording had stopped, but there was no sign of the resulting file. Can anyone tell me where the recording may be stored on disk so I can recover it?  <answer66134> Although the recording did stop when closing the lid, it does not mean that the recording is saved.  If it is, by kbdCommand/kbd clicking on the file's name, the full path where you can find it will be displayed.  The default storing place, of course, is under strong~/Documents/strong.  <answer97724>    Look for a very large .mov file (with an appropriate date) in   /private/var/folders/[randomly named subfolder]/[randomly named   subfolder]/-Tmp-/TemporaryItems/.  It's where Snow Leopard (and later   OS, as far as I know) puts temp files created in the preparation of a   QT screen recording. If you do find this large .mov file, COPY it to   the Desktop.  Under normal conditions, these temp files get deleted   automatically when the screen recording process completes; however,   when the process fails to finish properly, sometimes these temp files   linger.   This community thread should help anyone with this issue under OSX 10.8.  <answer137346> The screen recording movies are saved in the "Autosave Information" file if you didn't save them or close them manually. I stumbled on it a while ago, and believe me its not easy to find. They are located in a hidden "Library" file. The only way I found it was by searching for "autosave" in Finder, and I was able to recover my lost screen recording! There are several of those "Autosave Information" files for different apps like Chess, and Quicktime! But the specific "Library" file (where the autosave file is located) is hidden (at least on my computer) so, like I said, you can only get to it by searching for "Autosave Information" in finder. If you have any files autosaved, they would be there. I was able to recover my files there. Also I should mention I found my screen recordings there after I had to restart my computer without originally saving them. Such a relief!  <answer291389> As of OSX Sierra, it's here:  precode~/Library/Containers/com.apple.QuickTimePlayerX/Data/Library/Autosave Information /code/pre  It was a file named 'Unsaved QuickTime Player Document'. Double-clicking that file opens it in QT, and allows you to save in a proper place.  My battery ran out when I was recording and found my file there.  <comment77860> Sorry, I should've been clearer: there's not even a movie visible. <comment114692> Could you maybe cite the relevant post/text such that this answer becomes self-contained? <comment114764> Answers on Ask Different need to be more than just a link. It's okay to include a link, but please summarize or excerpt it in the answer. The idea is to make the answer stand alone. And in this case it's even more important because the referenced thread shows several potential locations without a clear indication on the *right* answer.
