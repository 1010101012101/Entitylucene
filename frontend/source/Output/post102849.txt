How to cut a file from my USB drive and paste it elsewhere in Finder on Mac OS X 10.6.8? <body> When I click kbdCmd/kbd-kbdX/kbd to try and cut the file on my USB drive so I can paste it elsewhere and free up space on my USB, it does nothing, and when I kbdCtrl/kbd-click it only gives the option to copy the file, not cut it.  How to strongcut/strong-and-paste a file on OS X?  <answer102858> Use kbdCmd/kbdkbdC/kbd to copy, then kbdOpt/kbdkbdCmd/kbdkbdV/kbd to paste in a new location and delete from the original location.  <comment121102> Option-command-V was added in 10.7, so it doesn't work in 10.6.8 though. <comment121200> Only user57827 knows what version was intended by "OS X" in the question.
