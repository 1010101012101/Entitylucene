Apps only crashing on iPad Air 2 with iOS 9.3.1 <body> I have a very strange problem with my iPad Air 2.   The problem is that certain apps crash immediately on launch. I tap the icon, the start screen shows and then the app crashes. This does not apply to all apps just a few. I have not been able to find a pattern. Even Apple’s own “Remote” app is one of the apps.   If I launch the exact same apps on my iPhone, iPad Air or my iPad Pro they work just fine. I am logged into the same Apple/iCloud account on all devices.   I have tried the following:   ul liLaunching the apps in airplane mode, with/without wifi and with/without bluetooth active. /li liDeleting and re-installing the apps in question./li liDeleting, restarting the iPad and then re-installing the apps./li liReset all the settings and apps on the device restoring from a backup with iTunes. /li liReset all the settings and apps on the device setting it up as a new device. Afterwards I downloaded the apps to the device and attempted to launch them./li liDownloaded the current iOS version (9.3.1) from the developer’s page (IPSW file) and then alt-clicked restore to select the IPSW and really re-install iOS on the device. Installed it as a new device and then downloaded the apps in question./li /ul  All attempts have been fruitless and futile.  Otherwise I could mention, that the iPad is a cellular model and has never been jailbroken.  Does anyone have any ideas what I could still do? Or is my only hope visiting an Apple Store nearby?  Thanks kindly for any feedback.  PS: I almost forgot the apps in question have never opened correctly on this specific iPad Air 2. My friend's iPad Air 2 can use the apps without any problems. So it does not seem to be a device-type specific bug.  <comment290570> You've already done everything I would've suggested. Have you looked thru any of the logs using Xcode?  You should be able to see the crash messages from there. <comment290573> yes - but these are also not very informative. There are `EXC_BAD_ACCESS` of the `SIGSEGV` (`KERN_INVALID_ADDRESS`), `SIGBUS` (`KERN_PROTECTION_FAILURE`) and `SIGILL` variety. And all the listed entries are all from core or standard iOS libraries. <comment290579> Maybe you have a bad memory chip or something like that?  Based on what you've already tried, can you return the iPhone and exchange it for another one?  I know this is probably the last resort, and hopefully others here can come up with something, but it might be your only option.
