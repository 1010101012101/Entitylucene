Why is file sharing missing from sharing preferences? <body> File sharing is not an option for me under 'sharing'.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fvMbF.png" alt="enter image description here"  The image above illustrates the lack of file sharing, but I do have the following items:  ul lidvd or cd sharing/li liscreen sharing/li liscanner sharing/li liremote login/li liremote management/li liremote apple events/li libluetooth sharing/li /ul  Any idea why certain macs have different items in the sharing pane?  <comment17886> You're also missing Printer Sharing, Web Sharing, Xgrid Sharing, and Internet Sharing. <comment17887> Is this a corporate or school-owned computer? If so, my guess would be that someone has disabled these functions for security purposes. <comment17908> what type is your account? Admin? Regular user? Restricted one? /btw, welcome here :)/
