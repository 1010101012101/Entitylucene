How do I open Google Chrome in Incognito mode by default <body> Is there any way (using apple script or by using settings on chrome) to open Google Chrome in incognito mode.  <answer25378> This can be achieved with the following in script editor:   precodedo shell script "open -a /Applications/Google\\ Chrome.app --args --incognito" /code/pre  Save it as an application, throw the alias in the dock. Tested this in 10.6.8.    Only works if you don't have chrome open already.   <answer25405> Another workaround:     strongmode (text)/strong : Represents the mode of the window which can be 'normal' or 'incognito', can be set only once during creation of the window.   precodetell application "Google Chrome"     close windows     make new window with properties {mode:"incognito"}     activate end tell /code/pre  <answer68882> I quickly created an app with platypus to launch Chrome incognito.   You can download it including the source from:  http://ente.limmat.ch/ftp/pub/software/applications/GoogleChromeIncognito/  The app features:  ul liopens a new incognito window whether Chrome is open or not/li lidoes not stay in the dock when Chrome has been started/li lishows the new window with a blank page/li lifinds Chrome from every where in any location/li liChrome update resistent/li liopen source/li /ul  (OS X 10.6+ required).  The script inside the app is the following:  pre #!/bin/bash  # (c) 2012 by Adrian Zaugg under GNU GPL v.2  CHROMENAME="Google Chrome"  MYPATH="$(dirname "$(dirname "$0" | sed -e "s%/Contents/Resources$%%")")" MYAPPNAME="$(basename "$(dirname "$0" | sed -e "s%/Contents/Resources$%%")" | sed -e "s/\.app$//")" # Ask Spotlight where Chrome is located, chose top entry since this was the latest opened Chrome version CHROMEPATH="$(mdfind 'kMDItemContentType == "com.apple.application-bundle" && kMDItemFSName = "'"$CHROMENAME.app"'"' | head -1)"  # Expect Chrome next to me, if the system doesn't know where it is. if [ -z "$CHROMEPATH" ]; then     CHROMEPATH="$MYPATH/$CHROMENAME.app" fi  if [ -e "$CHROMEPATH" ]; then     # Is there an instance already running?     if [ $(ps -u $(id -u) | grep -c "$CHROMEPATH/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome") -gt 1 ]; then         # use apple script to open a new incognito window         osascript -e 'tell application "'"$CHROMENAME"'"' \                   -e '  set IncogWin to make new window with properties {mode:"incognito"}' \                   -e '  set URL of active tab of IncogWin to "about:blank"' \                   -e 'end tell'     else         # just open Chrome in incognito mode         open -n "$CHROMEPATH" --args --incognito --new-window "about:blank"     fi      # bring Chrome to front     osascript -e 'tell application "'"$CHROMENAME"'" to activate'  else     # Chrome not found     osascript -e 'tell app "'"$MYAPPNAME"'" to display dialog "Place me next to '"$CHROMENAME"', please!" buttons "OK" default button 1 with title "'"$MYAPPNAME"'" with icon stop' fi  exit 0 /pre  <answer123909> I combined Lyken and user3936 answer to open a new chrome incognito window if it does not exist, and if a incognito window exists the script will bring it to the foreground.  precodeon is_running(appName)     tell application "System Events" to (name of processes) contains appName end is_running  set chrome_running to is_running("Google Chrome") if chrome_running then     tell application "Google Chrome"         repeat with w in (windows)                 if mode of w is "incognito" then                     set index of w to 1                     tell application "System Events" to tell process "Google Chrome"                         perform action "AXRaise" of window 1                     end tell                     activate                     return                 end if         end repeat     end tell     tell application "Google Chrome"         make new window with properties {mode:"incognito"}         activate     end tell else     do shell script "open -a /Applications/Google\\ Chrome.app --args --incognito" end if /code/pre  <answer268652> Zdne has written a nice way to do this that works even if you've already got Chrome open:  precodeif application "Google Chrome" is running then     tell application "Google Chrome" to make new window with properties {mode:"incognito"} else     do shell script "open -a /Applications/Google\\ Chrome.app --args --incognito" end if  tell application "Google Chrome" to activate /code/pre  Save that as an Automator application using a codeRun Applescript/code block and you can run it from Spotlight using the name you gave the application.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/K0ryF.png" alt="Screenshot of Spotlight with a search for &quot;incognito&quot; on display"  <comment80068> Can you explain how to do this rather than just give a link <comment80076> You can take the shell script from the first answer, then using Platypus (http://sveinbjorn.org/platypus) wrap it up in an app you can run like any other app. Platypus is very handy and very powerful, but cannot be described here in the detail you need. Experiment! <comment80222> Download and right-click the app, choose "Show Package Contents": You'll find then the script under Contents/Resources/script. How it works: The script asks LaunchService for the location of Google Chrome. Like this it should find Chrome even when Chrome is not located in the /Application folder or when its name has been altered. <comment103472> You are famous...

I only needed at most 2 windows so this worked for me, might not work for more than 2 windows <comment331941> This does not work if you click on a link in your mail client because chrome still opens in normal mode and not in private/incognito mode. <comment331942> This has the same problem as the accepted answer.
