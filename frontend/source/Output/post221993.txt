The usr folder is protected by the SIP.  <answer222036> As mentioned by user164077, this is protected by your computer's System Integrity Protection.     SIP is a security measure to prevent any User up to and including root (and thereby most malware) from modifying system files.  To disable:  ol liBoot into Recovery Mode (Hold Command+R while turning on Mac)./li liOpen Terminal (Click Utilities  Terminal)./li liType: codecsrutil disable/code/li liRestart your computer, and SIP will be disabled./li /ol  The "usr" folder should now be accessible by OnyX.  <comment268900> Did you give it admin perms at launch? <comment268902> @Tetsujin Yes, I did. It always asks for the admin password after launching. <comment268903> I wonder whether it's hitting SIP. Just trying something, brb... <comment268904> It's not an actual perms error, it's `link` vs `real` filetype - see http://superuser.com/questions/515048/verifying-permissions-on-osx <comment268905> @Tetsujin Thanks very much, [this](http://superuser.com/a/515276/270754) appears to be the useful suggestion. What would be the wise way to approach this problem? Shall I just ignore it? <comment268906> I'd ignore it.. My X11 is exactly the same, same errors on Onyx. <comment268909> Have you used Disk Utility to repair permissions and gotten the same results? <comment268910> @user3439894 No, apparently this is [no longer possible](http://www.imore.com/say-goodbye-repairing-file-permissions-el-capitan) in *DU* available with *El Capitan*. <comment268911> Not running 10.11, didn't know it was removed.  It can be done by command line using `repair_packages` however that's probably what OnyX is calling to do it. You might want to look at: [How to Verify & Repair Permissions in OS X El Capitan](http://osxdaily.com/2015/11/04/verify-repair-permissions-mac-os-x/) <comment268915> @user3439894 It returned the same output <comment268917> Well then I have to agree with Tetsujin and not worry about it.
