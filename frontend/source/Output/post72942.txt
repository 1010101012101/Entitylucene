What domain name is appended to a default Apple ID when created in OS X? <body> Upon booting a MacBook Air for the first time (OS X, Version 10.8), I was prompted to create an AppleID. I selected a username and a default domain name was added automatically to this username.   I cannot recall what the domain name was. Does anybody know the default domain name?  <answer72945> The default domain name for new Apple ID's (or iCloud accounts) is code@icloud.com/code. You can also use code@me.com/code.
