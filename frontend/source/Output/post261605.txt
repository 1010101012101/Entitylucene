How to make selection from AppleScript dialog list with keystroke? <body> I've created an application with AppleScript in Automator.  The application, right off the bat, presents the user with a dialog list.  By default, there are two ways to select an item from the list:  ol liUsing your mouse./li liUsing the arrow keys on your keyboard./li /ol  However, what I would like to do is offer the user a third option: to select the item based on a keystroke or keyboard shortcut. I would also like the selected item to be submitted directly after the keystroke or keyboard shortcut is pressed.  For example:  precodeon run {input, parameters}      set FruitList to {"Banana (#1)", "Kiwi (#2)", "Mango (#3)", "Coconut (#4)", "Pear (#5)"}      set FavoriteFruitAnswer to choose from list FruitList with title "Fruit Dialog" with prompt "What's your favorite fruit?" default items "Banana (#1)"       if FavoriteFruitAnswer is false then         error number -128 (* user cancelled *)     else         set FavoriteFruitAnswer to FavoriteFruitAnswer's item 1 (* extract choice from list *)     end if      return input end run /code/pre  The preceding code produces the following:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QZrfG.png" width="440"  What I want to occur is if the user presses the number "2" on their keyboard, therefore "Kiwi (#2)" is selected and then the "OK" button is automatically pressed. If the user presses the number "4" on their keyboard, therefore "Coconut (#4)" is selected and then the "OK" button is automatically pressed. And so on.  Is this possible?  What I know is possible is to create a dialog box with a text field where the user types in the number manually and then the user hits enter manually and the number is assigned to the corresponding fruit type.  But that's not a particularly pretty solution.  <answer261606> AppleScript is not robust enough to do exactly what you're asking, however if you want to be able to select by emnumber/em then put the emnumber/em ahead of the emname of the fruit/em, although kbdenter/kbd will still need to be pressed after the emnumber/em is pressed. Otherwise, pressing whatever the first character of the emlist item/em entry is will select it too.   For example, change the following two lines of code from:  precodeset FruitList to {"Banana (#1)", "Kiwi (#2)", "Mango (#3)", "Coconut (#4)", "Pear (#5)"} set FavoriteFruitAnswer to choose from list FruitList with title "Fruit Dialog" with prompt "What's your favorite fruit?" default items "Banana (#1)" /code/pre  To:  precodeset FruitList to {"1. Banana", "2. Kiwi", "3. Mango", "4. Coconut", "5. Pear"} set FavoriteFruitAnswer to choose from list FruitList with title "Fruit Dialog" with prompt "What's your favorite fruit?" default items "1. Banana" /code/pre  hr  As a side note, double-clicking a list entry to select it with the mouse does also trigger the kbdenter/kbd key press automatically.  <comment327681> This workaround is a satisfactory solution. Thanks for the helpful insights; I was unaware of both of them.
