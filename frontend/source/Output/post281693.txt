Opening Mail App on iMac 27" causes external display to go black <body> Not sure what happened but recently whenever I open my mail app on the iMac (27" Retina) my second display goes black. I cannot open any other programs. Interestingly the Menu bar is also hidden I have to bring it down with my cursor. Just cannot figure it out. This only occurs with my Mail. Every other program can open in either window.   Does anyone know how to fix this behavior?  <comment354464> What would be really helpful is if you provided which version of macOS you are running.  Also, have you tried this in Safe Mode?
