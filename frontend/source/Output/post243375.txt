Withdrawing iTunes Connect payment in another territory <body> Can anyone tell me for sure whether Apple pays the developer in Cayman Islands? Do I need to have the developer license from Cayman Islands in order to receive payment in Cayman Island ?  Any resources clarifying my queries are appreciated.  <answer243377> The Cayman Islands is supported by the App Store to buy apps. This means you can receive payments. The app store is available in these countries.    Please keep in mind: Apple will only payout you monthly if you earned at least 150 dollar a total. If you don't make the 150 dollar this month, it will be combined to next month untill the 150 dollar minimum is reached.  <comment299705> Can you describe your situation a bit more? Are you a OS developer on the Cayman Islands? Or are you from somewhere else?  Apple does all the administration stuff for developers. You don't need to have a physical location in a country to get the payments from your users. <comment299706> @rwzdoom I am working on behalf of a client. He would like to withdraw any payments received from apple for his app from within Cayman Islands. Should he purchase developer license from within Cayman Islands to receive payments ? <comment299709> https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/LanguagesUtilities/Conceptual/iTunesConnect_Guide/Appendices/AppStoreTerritories.html But this link list Cayman Islands too I think you are listing countries for shopping Apple Store <comment299711> Correct, wrong link.
