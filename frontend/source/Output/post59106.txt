com.apple.dock.extra - maxing CPU <body> I've recently installed Mountain Lion and the codecom.apple.dock.extra/code process is suddenly constantly active - and is maxing my CPU usage. Activity monitor is showing usage running from as low as 45% to as high as 130%. Force quite momentarily stops the process - although it doesn't remove it from the list of processes - before it kicks back in.   What is this process and how do I stop it?
