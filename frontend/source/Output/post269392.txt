MacBook takes screenshots without user input <body> Yesterday my desktop MacBook with Yosemite took a screenshot although I did not use that facility. It made the sound and created a file that I threw away fearing it was a virus. The doc created was not in fact a photo from the camera or the screen.  Today it happened again: the same sound of screen shot, but this time there is no file to be found in the computer.  Can this be a virus or an intruder?  <answer269406> According to Trend MICRO (September 12, 2016) the symptoms you describe do confirm that this could be a virus or intruder:     Infection Channel: Downloaded from the Internet, Dropped by other malware           This backdoor enables the attacker to steal a range of information, including screenshots, audio, and keylogs. It can also execute commands and communicate using encrypted data.       <comment338653> Thank you. How can I clean my Mac and destroy this potential virus? <comment338691> @EduardoTorres - You're Welcome :) By using antivirus software. Bitdefender was the best paid AV solution mid 2016 for Mac. Sophos came out second in terms of detection and performance, which is a free alternative. You can check AV-TEST for more up-to-date comparisons.
