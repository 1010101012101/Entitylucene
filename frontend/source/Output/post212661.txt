Intel GPU drivers for Linux - can't decide <body> I installed Linux (Kubuntu) on my MacBook. I always wondered if my graphics card drivers were configured correctly, as any games (and some other applications) running on my computer were extremely slow. codelspci | grep VGA/code returns code00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation 3rd Gen Core processor Graphics Controller (rev 09)/code (About this Mac: Graphics Card = Intel HD Graphics 4000 1024MB). So I found this website from Intel. However, they offer many many possible packages to choose from. I can't decide which one to use?  P.S.: What I mean by slow. For example, I didn't experience any problems running Minecraft with OS X. Now I have Kubuntu, and even with Xfce it has huge performance problems.
