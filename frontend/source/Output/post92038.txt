Changing email addresses on my @me.com and @icloud.com <body> When I was married I started both my @me.com and @icloud.com accounts.  The accounts are my first name and last (previously married) name run together.  Now that I am divorced I don't want that as my email.  I would rather have a different name at the front of my email.  How do I go about changing both accounts to another name and getting all my devices and itunes accounts moved over.   <answer92039> Unfortunately, depending on your situation, you may not be able to change your email address. You can check this Apple support page out for details.  If you sign up for an entirely new account, you'd lose the purchases you made under your existing one.  <answer92069> Unfortunately, as was stated, you cannot change your @me.com or @icloud.com email addresses independently of your Apple ID. What I would recommend doing is setting up a Gmail (or other) address and using that as your primary Apple ID email (as well as all your normal email for that matter).  If you have a Mac you can even move all the email from your @icloud.com/@me.com account to your new Gmail account simply by setting up both and dragging the folders from one mail account to the other.   After you set up a Gmail email address you can edit your Apple ID preferences at this site. That way, all you ever basically see is the new Gmail account.  <answer92104> I think the easiest thing to do here would be to change your Apple ID name, which is used to form your @me.com and @icloud.com email addresses.  I haven't done this myself before, but Apple's HT5622 document includes the following, which seems to explain how this can be done:  img src="https://cl.ly/image/1p0Q2r0X033f/Screen%20Shot%202013-05-22%20at%2020.56.18.png" alt=""  However... I don't completely understand this (eg exactly what they mean by "Apple ID Name").  So perhaps the best approach is to contact Apple Support and ask them.  Their page for Apple ID Support is here.  <comment108097> PS @heather If you do contact Apple, perhaps you could record their advice here, to help other people in the future... you could write your own answer, or add a comment... Good luck!
