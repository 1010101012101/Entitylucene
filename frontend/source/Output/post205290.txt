Deleting Virtual OS in VMware Fusion <body> I have a problem uninstalling virtually installed operating systems on VMware Fusion. I didn't upgrade VMware Fusion before upgrading OS X to Yosemite.   The error message that I get, when trying to launch VMware, is the following:   precodeYou can’t use this version of the application “VMware Fusion.app” with this version of OS X. /code/pre  I have VMware Fusion code6.0.1/code version and Yosemite code10.10.4/code version.  What should I do?  <comment247560> Upgrade VmWare Fusion <comment247571> How can I Upgrade VMWare if I can't even open it? <comment247601> Just download the DMG and copy over the app
