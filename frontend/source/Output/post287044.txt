How can I (reliably) delete only future events in Calendar? <body> In Apple's Calendar app, it is not always possible to delete future events as a group.  It seems to consistently be possible when I create a repeating event on my own calendar, but apparently not possible when I have accepted a meeting invitation.  Here's the response when I try to delete an event I created:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pdwM2.png" width="635" alt="delete only this, or only future events"  But here's a failure on Apple's part to give me that ability:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ltyfu.png" width="480"  Both give me the option to only delete the individual event, but only one gives me the option to delete future (and emnot past/em) events.  Is there any way around this?  Is there anyway I can delete only future meetings, without spending hours and hours doing them individually?
