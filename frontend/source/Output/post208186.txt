Photos: Search all photos captured by a particular device (iPhone 5s) <body> Is there any way in the new Photos app to search for all images taken from a particular device? I want to export all my iPhone images out of Photos app.  Currently my library has images imported from various other devices also.  <answer208191> emI am not used to the Photos App, so this might not be the best solution but could solve your question./em  ol liIn the menubar go to codeFile/code and then click on codeNew Smart Album.../code/li liSelect codeCamera Model/code from the first drop-down menu and then pick the rest to fit your needs./li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4zIF2.png" alt="Screenshot"  To find out what exactly you need to type there, you can just get the info of a picture where you know that you took it with that device and see what exactly it says.   Edit: As it turns out, my old iPhone 5s says "Apple iPhone 5s" but this Smart Album only worked if I wrote codecontains/code "iPhone 5s", so that should work.
