Boot camp no osx partition <body> So some time ago i used boot camp to install Windows 8 pro. Now i want to switch back to my mac/osx but there is no osx partition  Screenshot of boot camp on windows: (Ingore the langauge, it's in Danish)  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/XYtci.png" alt="enter image description here"  I have searched around for an answer but i can't find one.  Thanks for reading  strongNote 1/strong I have tried ALT at the start-up of the computer but there is now OSX disc. Only a windows one. And i have tried to reinstall OSX on one of the discs, but i gives me a error (Can't remember the error, but i couldn't delete the disc either)  <answer158941> That's an old bug in the BootCamp prefs.  Just reboot and hold the kbdalt/kbd key to get to the boot menu.  Then choose your Mac OS X partition to boot into Mac OS X.  <answer158942> Try holding down the kbdalt/kbd key while powering on your Mac. This should yield a boot device selection.  If this doesnâ€™t help, try booting in Recovery Mode as outlined here: http://support.apple.com/en-us/HT4718 There you can run Disk Utility to check wether your partition is corrupted.  <comment186835> like aaronk6 mentioned please boot into the recovery mode with alt-r, start Utilities/Terminal, enter "diskutil list" & "diskutil cs list" and add the outputs to your question <comment186837> did you try the cmd-r boot to restore OS X ? <comment186851> @user3527883 sorry command-r and not alt-r
