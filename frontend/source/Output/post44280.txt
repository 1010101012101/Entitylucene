Syncing photos doesn't appear to do anything <body> I have a ton of photos on my iPhone (4S, although most were taken with my previous 3G). I am trying to sync them to my computer (Windows Vista) but they are not appearing there.  I went to my iPhone in iTunes, clicked the "Photos" tab at the top and selected a folder. After synching, that folder now has a subfolder "iPod Photo Cache" with one file "Photo Database" that is 892 bytes.  Where are the photos? Do I need to do something different to actually copy the photos to this folder?  <answer44283> The "photos" tab in iTunes is for syncing photos on your computer emto/em your iPhone. To download the photos off your iPhone, use some software that downloads photos off cameras, such as Windows Photo Gallery.  <comment50366> Oh, well I saw I can just copy the files straight from Windows Explorer. Why is it called "sync" if the two folders are not actually synchronised? <comment50367> @DisgruntledGoat That I don't know. On Macs the "sync" tab syncs stuff over from iPhoto, maybe there isn't really a supported equivalent in the Windows world
