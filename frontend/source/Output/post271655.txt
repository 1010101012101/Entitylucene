Can't install trackpad drivers WintoUSB Macbook Air <body> I have installed WintoUSB, alongside basic Bootcamp drivers through msiconfig /i bootcamp.msi. However, this ignores certain drivers such as the trackpad. When I manually run the driver, it doesn't install because the trackpad comes up as a generic USB device. Without the driver you can't right click at all with it.   Am running Windows 10 on MBA 13" 2015.
