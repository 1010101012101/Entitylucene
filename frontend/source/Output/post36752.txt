Problems with font rendering on a MacBook Pro using external 24" LCD <body> I have a 24" HP LP2475w at my home and 23" Apple Cinema Display at work. Today when I turned on my laptop at work, I noticed that all fonts look perfect (after having an issue with rendering for the past two days). I thought the issue somehow got fixed and happily went on with my day.  Later when I came home, everything still worked, because I didn't turn off my MacBook. This is how it looks (correct), even on my home LCD  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/at892.png" alt="correct"  but when I quit the Terminal.app (or any other app for that matter) and launch it again, while the 24" is still connected, the fonts get ugly  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wgUSo.png" alt="ugly"  strongNotice even the background color is different, which doesn't make any sense at all, since the screenshots are taken about 15 seconds apart./strong  When I disconnect my LCD the Terminal still looks ugly, until I relaunch it, then it looks ok again.  The important thing here is, that I've been using the 24" LCD for the past year and never had this issue, it just started happening without me changing anything.  Is it possible, that my MacBook is somehow having trouble communicating with the LCD when the app starts? I would understand if this happened to everything that is displayed on the 24" LCD, but it happens only to apps that are launched when the LCD is connected.  Even if I quit all the windows in the terminal and open new ones it still looks ok, until I actually quit the application itself and relaunch it.  <answer36755> Have you per chance enabled any specialized settings via the Developer Tools? Such that your computer would now be showing HiDPA resolutions? You can verify quickly by going into System Preferences  Displays and you can see what kind of resolution setting your computer is using.  <answer36781> This is OSX "Text Smoothing" I believe.  In "General" preferences, the last option is to turn off text Smoothing for font sizes below a certain size.  I guess that value has changed to one higher than your current font size.  <answer37590> You should try adjusting font smoothing globally. Open up terminal and type:  precodedefaults -currentHost read -globalDomain AppleFontSmoothing /code/pre  Depending if it's enabled or not you might get a message such as:   precodeThe domain/default pair of (kCFPreferencesAnyApplication,  AppleFontSmoothing) does not exist /code/pre  (which is actually good, since it tells us it's not set, and why you have the issue).  Next, type:  precodedefaults -currentHost write -globalDomain AppleFontSmoothing -int 2 /code/pre  If it doesn't look any different, worse, etc. or want to adjust it even more replace the number '2' with '1'.  To remove the global setting you can use:  precodedefaults -currentHost delete -globalDomain AppleFontSmoothing /code/pre  hr  *Hopefully this solves your troubles.  <answer37627> The first image is using sub-pixel anti-aliasing, which is takes advantage of the way the RGB sub components of an LCD monitor happen to line up.  You can see this by using "DigitalColor Meter", or any other utility, to zoom in on the pixels.  The second image is using full-pixel anti-aliasing, which is 3x blockier, but works on non-LCD displays and LCD displays which use a different sub-pixel ordering.  At least in Mac OS X 10.6, this is controlled by the Appearance control panel and the "Use LCD font smoothing when available".  The key is "when available".  The OS must correctly detect when your display is an LCD.  A peculiar quirk that I've noticed is that if you change that setting, it does not immediately change the fonts already on the screen.  You have to at least close and reopen a window, sometimes quit and restart an application, for the new setting to apply.  My guess is that you have "LCD font smoothing" turned on, but you are moving back and forth between a display which OS X recognizes as an LCD and one which it does not.  <comment41797> No I haven't changed anything. I'm using my monitor's native 1920x1200. It seems to happen in all applications that I restart, so something must've changed since I last rebooted my MacBook. <comment41798> Very likely, have you tried restarting the computer and reseting the PRAM (NVRAM)? Maybe that would reset your computer back to defaults. Otherwise you could see if the issue occurs under another user on your computer/test account. <comment41801> I was just going to recommend a new user account as Andrew does. <comment41866> I have it set to the lowest - 4, but it doesn't seem to change anything when I turn it on and off. <comment41911> I've actually did a complete system wipe, reformatted the whole disk, reinstalled and the issue still persists. I didn't recover any backups, just made a clean install of Snow Leopard and direct upgrade to Lion. <comment42249> Which display is your primary one (the one with the menu bar)? <comment42250> @MattiSG I only use one of them at a time, and I always set the external LCD as primary. <comment42672> @stuwilson â€” +1 definitely good thinking on the text smoothing. The global setting in terminal is probably where it needs to be adjusted. <comment42731> Perfect! Thanks for the solution. <comment67539> wow, thanks for the solution @ioi I had the same issue when upgrading to Mountain Lion...I was wondering if there's any way to change that from System Preferences? <comment72521> There could also be a key for it in `~/Library/Preferences/.GlobalPreferences.plist`. <comment73442> What is the difference between 1 and 2 then? <comment141707> Note that (1) removing the global setting as shown above is same as checking System Preferences  General  Use LCD font smoothing when available, (2) unchecking this is equivalent to setting -int 0, (3) a value of 0, 1, and 2 is no, light, and medium font smoothing, and (4) setting a preference in System Preferences overrides the terminal commands above (and vice versa). I have a Mac Pro with OSX 10.6.8 connected to NEC LCD2490WUXi working great out of the box, but when I purchased a new 15" MacbookPro retina the same monitor on OSX 10.9.1 messes up text. Setting `-int=0` helped somewhat.
