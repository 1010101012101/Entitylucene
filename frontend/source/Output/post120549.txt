How can I tell who posted a photo in a shared iCloud photo stream? <body> Can you determine which/whose device took a picture in a shared iPhone photo stream?  <answer120554> Open the photo in the Shared Photo Stream, then tap to show details if necessary.  It should show the poster of the photo, as below ("Posted by you"):  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6SOiV.jpg" alt="Like | Posted by you | Add a comment…"  Individual devices can't be determined from this view though — only the Apple ID.
