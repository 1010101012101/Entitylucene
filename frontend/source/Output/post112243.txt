How to block and unblock the media ports in MAC OSX 10.9? <body> I am working on a test project that requires me to block all media ports on my Mac OS X 10.9.   The instructions I'be veen given are "Chinese" to me :-) I have no idea how and where to start, let alone how to unblock them after I manage to block them...   Thanks so much!  Instructions available:   [User]-iMac:~ [User]$ sudo ipfw add deny udp from any to any dst-port 50000-65535 00100 deny udp from any to any dst-port 50000-65535 [User]-iMac:~ [User]$ sudo ipfw list 00100 deny udp from any to any dst-port 50000-65535 65535 allow ip from any to any  <answer112254> Maybe you can use Little Snitch instead of trying to figure out the commands.
