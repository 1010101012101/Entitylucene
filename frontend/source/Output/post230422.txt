Type Lambda λ on a Mac? <body> Is there a way to type lambda λ on a mac without switching the entire keyboard binding to Greek, as described here: How do you type Theta on a Mac?  <answer230423> I use the Emojis and Symbols menu to plug in characters I can't type via the keyboard. Awkward, but it works. (PS - If you happen to be working in Microsoft Word, it's dead easy - in preferences, enable "Math Autocorrect" outside of math fields, then type \lambda to insert it.)  <answer230426> ol liPress kbdCommand ⌘/kbd+kbdControl ⌃/kbd+kbdSpace/kbd./li liType emlamda/em into the search bar.

According to the link provided by MJeffryes:     The use of the spelling lamda derives from ISO 10646. This does not   mean that it is more correct than lambda, merely that the spelling   without the 'b' is the one used in the formal character names.   Here are two more links provided by Itai Ferber:  ul liProof that lamda is in the standard/li liProof that lamda is in the standard since at least 1993/li /ul  hr  Here is a website about Mac keyboard shortcuts: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201236.  <answer230439> If you have access to Vim/gVim (the editor, which seems to go by the MacVim name on Mac), go into INSERT mode, press kbdCtrl/kbd + kbdk/kbd followed by kbd*/kbd followed by kbdl/kbd. A λ character will be produced.  Copy that into the clipboard and you're good to go.  You can do this for other Greek letters too, just replace l with a, b, c, d etc. You can also get upper case versions of those letters by just entering them as... upper case!  That applies to other Vim distributions as well.  <answer230492> If you will be writing it often, I would recommend going to codeSystem Preferences → Keyboard → Text/code and adding a new replace rule: Replace codelambda/code with codeλ/code.  <answer230528> What is your reason for not wanting to switch the entire keyboard binding to Greek?  If your reason was just that switching by the menu is a bit cumbersome, then you could strongset up a keyboard shortcut instead, for very quick layout switching/strong.  With this, strongit takes just three keystrokes to type a λ (or any other Greek letter)/strong.  I frequently need to type isolated Greek letters within a mostly latin-alphabet setting (I’m a mathematician), and I find this setup very convenient  In detail:  ul liAdd a Greek keyboard layout to your input sources, under emSystem Preferences  Keyboard  Input Sources/em:/li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9yXVN.png" alt="how to add an input source"  ul liadd a keyboard shortcut for switching to the most recently-used layout different from the current one, under emSystem Preferences  Keyboard  Shortcuts  Input Sources/em.

That's what I use whenever I need to quickly type in any unicode symbol on my mac.

I suspect that is why Unicode used it. <comment281361> @ItaiFerber Indeed, once an incorrect name has entered Unicode, it is impossible to change it. There are several  known misspellings. http://unicode.org/notes/tn27/ <comment281394> Why don't you just use the El Capitan default for this shortcut, Control plus Space? <comment281419> @TomGewecke: ah, thanks — I didn’t know that was the El Capitan default!  I’ve had this set up since a few OS versions ago, during the period when the default for this conflicted with the default for Spotlight — see e.g. [this Mountain Lion support article](https://support.apple.com/kb/PH11251?locale=en_US).  I guess now I can change to the new default, and re-train my fingers :-) <comment281447> Possible duplicate of [How can I expand the number of special characters I can type using my keyboard?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/49565/how-can-i-expand-the-number-of-special-characters-i-can-type-using-my-keyboard) <comment281470> @TomGewecke Isn't the default Cmd+Space? And Ctrl+Space for spotlight? <comment281483> It's not misspelt. The letter from the Greek block is "LAMDA" following modern Greek spelling. The character from the mathematical block is spelt "LAMBDA" following mathematical convention (and ancient Greek spelling). Both are correct for their intended use case. <comment281488> @zenith On my machine it was the other way around. Also in iOS 9, when you use a hardware keyboard, the shortcut is now Control plus Space to change language (with no way to modify it). <comment340015> for rule 2: the original must contain 2 letters :(
