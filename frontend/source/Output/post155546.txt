Should I install the AX88179 USB Ethernet Driver - or any other external driver? <body> I try to avoid external drivers that require root permissions to install, as they might break regular functionality/integrity easily, yet it seems like a must to install them sometimes.  I bought a USB 3.0 HUB with an Ethernet port, it seems to use an AX88179 chip, a common one as I see, it doesn't get recognised automatically  Should I risk it and install the drivers or keep using the Wi-Fi instead and not fix something that's not broken?  <answer155548> Should be safe, but make sure you have a backup to revert to - just in case.  Current drivers would appear to be v2.2, according to the Asix site  [untested]  <comment182987> adding a comment, that you have not tried it would be nice :) <comment183003> I could also add I don't even have any USB 3 ports ;-) but if you can't trust manufacturers' dedicated drivers, what can you trust? [Fair point, though - just joking] <comment183008> Thank you, the reason is when dealing with drivers one can not be careful enough :) and you got a +1 from me. <comment183009> Thank you too. I had mentioned a backup was a safety net - tbh, I'm so paranoid about backups mine are hourly on site & daily off-site - you can never be too careful.
