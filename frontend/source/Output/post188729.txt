iPad usage does not seem accurate <body> I have a 16GB iPad Air 2. I realize the OS takes up some space (on my iPad, "Used" + "Available" only equals 11.9GB), but looking at this screenshot, even my iPad can't accurately explain what's taking up 8.2 GB. I know it's not the OS because Used + Available is already lower than 16. And I added up all the apps underneath and only came to a little under 800MB. What on earth is taking up the remaining 7.5GB?!  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8VqNA.jpg" alt=""  My drawing to illustrate my question:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ANHkN.jpg" alt=""  <answer188909> These could be some temporary files - usually, after a restart they get deleted freeing precious space.  When you connect iOS device to iTunes, these often show as "other" in Summary tab.  <answer188935> Some corrupted files might be stuck on you device, and the best option is to start from scratch. Use iTunes to create a backup of your device, restore to the current iOS version, and restore the backup you created.   Check this page for more info about what might steal your precious space.  I have had previous success doing a backup, reset and restore of my device to remove temporary files that are stuck on the device.  <comment223519> you rarely get exactly the amount of storage you pay for, it fluctuates quite bad. take my iphone 64 gb for example, it actually is only 55,5 gb <comment223538> Thanks, but you're missing my point. The Used + Available definitely don't add up to 16GB. That's the same thing you're saying. But separate from that, look at my Used number in the screenshot I provided, then count up the space I've used in the numbers below. I'm several GB short. <comment223539> Add new picture to clarify my point. <comment223540> it is definitely the os, iOS 8 can take easily 6gb depending on your device, add that to the actual size of a gigabyte versus the advertised size of your storage and it is easy to see why your phone "lost" 7,5 gb. apple is currently facing a lawsuit about this issue as seen here for example: http://www.macworld.com/article/2863911/apple-faces-dumb-lawsuit-over-the-size-of-ios-8.html <comment223740> While this link may answer the question, it is better to include the essential parts of the answer here and provide the link for reference. Link-only answers can become invalid if the linked page changes. <comment223805> Yeah, I suspected that might be the issue, so I restarted, but still had the same issue. This was all before I posted my question.
