Adding new rule for emails containing header <body> Is it possible to create a new rule for mail to perform an action if the message contains a custom header?    I want to automaticaly detect emails that contain the "X-hashcash" header.    <answer117418> Yes.  If you go to codePreferences/code codeRules/code and codeAdd Rule/code then the first of the condition pop up lists has codeEdit header list../code as the last choice. In the dialog click on the code+/code and add in codeX-hashcash/code. Done.
