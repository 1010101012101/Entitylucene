OSX Mavericks Notifications Center synch/refresh timing <body> Is it possible to control Notification Center synch timing or manually refresh to check for new events?  I like to disable all app badges and alerts so that nothing disturbs me while working. However I like to use Notification Center to get an overview of recent app activity when taking a break. So under codeSystem Prefs → Notifications/code for the various apps I have everything deselected apart from codeShow in Notification Center → X Recent Items/code. Alert style is set to none.  I currently have a mail alert showing on my iPad from ~50m ago but nothing in my Mac Air NC. So it seems the iPad is checking more reliably/regularly.
