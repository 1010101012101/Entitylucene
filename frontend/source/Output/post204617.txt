How can I run a set of terminal commands using one click? <body> So I have this program I use to watch movies on my Apple TV that runs from my Mac in Terminal and goes to the TV. Well whenever you wanna start the server up you have to run a set of commands in Terminal.  precode$ cd Desktop $ cd PopcornTV $ sudo npm install $ sudo node atv.js /code/pre  These commands start the server which my Apple TV than connects too. Is there anyway I can make a Automator Application or anything of that sort that will run these commands for me when I click a button.  <answer204620> Open up Applescript-Editor  add this:  precodedo shell script "cd ~/Desktop/PopcornTV &amp;&amp; /usr/local/bin/npm install &amp;&amp; /usr/local/bin/node atv.js" with administrator privileges /code/pre  Save as an application. Just open it when you want to run.  <answer204637> Running it in an apple script is not that bad. you just have to run the entire script as root because sudo requires user interaction. if you do an apple script like this one:  precodedo shell script "cd ~/Desktop/PopcornTV &amp;&amp; /path/to/npm install &amp;&amp; /path/to/node atv.js" with administrator privileges  /code/pre  replace thencode/path/to/npm/code and code/path/to/node/code with the output of codewhich npm/code and codewhich node/code  it will open up a dialogue and ask you for your password.   <answer204688> I think this should work :   precodeecho "#\n cd Desktop \n cd PopcornTV \n sudo npm install \n sudo node atv.js" &gt;&gt; ~/Desktop/startMyServer.command /code/pre  then make the command file executable  precodechmod +x ~/Desktop/startMyServer.command /code/pre  you will then find the file codestartMyServer.command/code on your desktop  <answer204736> A solution without using Automator:  h11. Gathering some details:/h1  ul liWhat is the path to codenpm/code?  Find out using codewhich npm/code in Terminal.app/li liWhat is the path to codenode/code?  Find out using codewhich node/code in Terminal.app/li liWhat is your username?  Find using codewhoami/code in Terminal.app/li /ul  All of this is important, make a note of the outputs.  h12. Configuring codesudo/code/h1  Let’s now configure codesudo/code to not require you to use a password for those two commands.  In Terminal.app, enter the following:  precodesudo visudo /code/pre  You will need to enter your password, though you won’t see any typing as you enter it.  Press kbdenter/kbd when you’ve completed entering your password.  This will open the code/etc/sudoers/code file for you (probably in vi/vim) press kbdshift/kbd+kbdg/kbd to go to the bottom of the file, then press kbdo/kbd to insert a newline and start inserting text, enter the following:  precode# Allow me to use npm and node without password username ALL = NOPASSWD: /path/to/npm /path/to/node /code/pre  You will need to replace “username”, “/path/to/npm”, and “/path/to/node” with the details you gathered in section strong1/strong.  When you have finished entering these details, save and quit by pressing kbdesc/kbd then entering code:x/code then pressing kbdenter/kbd.    h13. Wrapping it up in a file/h1  Let’s create a file to put those commands in.  In Terminal.app enter the following:  precodeecho '#!/bin/bash cd /Users/username/Desktop/PopcornTV sudo /path/to/npm install sudo /path/to/node atv.js' &gt; ~/Desktop/startPopcornTV.command  chmod 740 ~/Desktop/startPopcornTV.command /code/pre  Again, you’ll need to replace “username”, “/path/to/npm”, and “/path/to/node” with the details you gathered in section strong1/strong.  h14. Running/h1  On your Desktop you will now have a file called codestartPopcornTV.command/code (depending on your setting it might just be called codestartPopcornTV/code).  All you need to do now is double click that file and it will start PopcornTV for you.  <comment246682> Sorry it didn't work. http://i.imgur.com/WcfvwVp.png <comment246685> Surely npm install does not need to be run more than once <comment246711> You'll need to add "with administrator privileges" at the end of the AppleScript line. <comment246731> error "/bin/sh: npm: command not found" number 127        http://i.imgur.com/YqDlueN.png <comment246732> error "/bin/sh: npm: command not found" number 127  [screenshot](http://s16.postimg.org/9w8p1dp9x/Yq_Dlue_N.png) <comment246740> @IlyaVorobyev Where is "npm"? Could you open terminal and type `whereis npm; whereis node`? Post the result. <comment246773> then you should call npm with the full path like /path/to/npm (same in node) <comment246775> @DisplayName btw, which not whereis.... <comment246787> How do I call a path, like where do I add the path? I'm sorry if I'm asking stupid questions, I'm sort of new to this. Here is the path to it     /usr/local/lib/node_modules http://i.imgur.com/RIFH1bF.png <comment246789> I'm not sure if this is what you mean but this is what I found when I searched npm in finder. /usr/local/lib/node_modules http://i.imgur.com/RIFH1bF.png <comment246791> if you call `which npm` the output will be something like `/usr/local/bin/npm` (not true as far as I know, but as example). if you call `npm` this command gets executed, but in the script you have to call this command with `/usr/local/bin/npm` instead of just `npm` (these paths were just example, I can't try out just now) <comment246798> @llya Vorbyev run the terminal commands
