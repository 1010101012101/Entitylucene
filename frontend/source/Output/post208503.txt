How to replace an IPhone 6 damaged display <body> I was the happy user of an iPhone 6. Until I accidentally dropped it on the floor and the screen got broken. Then I tried to find a solution for getting a new screen:  1) In my country, Romania, there are several Apple Authorized Services. All of them proposed me to replace my iPhone with a refurbished one (not a new one, a second-hand one) for 350Euros (half of the price of an original iPhone). Really?  2) Searching on Apple official website, I discovered that Apple replaces a damaged screen for 109$: https://www.apple.com/support/iphone/repair/screen-damage/. This operation can be done only in an Apple Store but in Romania there is no Apple Store. So I decided to contact Apple Support for guiding me to the nearest Apple Store which offers the screen replacement service. For this, I accessed the official Apple site (https://getsupport.apple.com) and they gave me a phone number to call. This number is specific for every country.  I used the number specific for Romania. The robot which answered that called told me that I should contact my network service provider for support. Perfect. I called my network service provider which redirected me to an Apple Authorized Service from my country. Conclusion: the only solution for fixing my iPhone in Romania is to pay half of his price and get a second-hand one. Shame on you, Apple!  Question1: It seems that the only solution for me is to travel to a foreign country with better Apple support. So, In a few days, I will go on vacation on Spain which has several Apple Stores. How I could find out if these Apple Stores offers the screen replacement service? How could I talk with an Apple employee for getting an official answer?
