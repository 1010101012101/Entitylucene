How to specify that cover art for a video in iTunes should be a frame from a specific time in the video? <body> When I add a movie or other video to iTunes, it appears that iTunes selects a video frame from somewhere near the beginning of the video file as the strongdefault cover art/strong &mdash; and most of the time this is a terrible choice.  Many of the shows and movies in my collection have an opening sequence containing frames where a title is plainly shown (e.g. em"Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas!"/em), or at least there's some scene in the video which is distinct &amp; identifiable, a scene I would clearly recognize when scrolling through my collection with the Cover Flow view.  I'd like to specify such a distinct frame, from an arbitrary point in a video, as a video's cover art.  I expected a slider somewhere to seek through a video and find just the right spot to use as cover, but I didn't find such functionality.  ol liHow does iTunes determine which frame to select for the cover art from a video?/li liIs there a way to tell iTunes to stronguse a different video frame/strong as the cover art?/li liFailing that, what is a good alternative?/li /ol  Thank you.  <answer46316> The frame that's used is called the "Poster Frame". It looks like iTunes chooses a frame 10 seconds into the video by default.  To choose a specific frame as the cover art:  ol liStart playing the video./li liPause the video on the frame you want to use./li liRight-click on the video and choose "Set Poster Frame"./li /ol  <comment52920> Thanks!  I knew it was hiding somewhere :-)  I was expecting to see the feature under the Get Info... Artwork tab, but I didn't think to actually play the video to look for this.  Also good to know what this is officially called - thanks again.
