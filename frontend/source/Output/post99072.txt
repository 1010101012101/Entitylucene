Mac OS X Terminal: -bash: $: command not found <body> While trying to install pagekite on OS X Snow Leopard using the following command:  precode$ pagekite.py --signup /code/pre  I got:  precode-bash: $: command not found /code/pre  I am a noob with the terminal but after reading a bit I understand that it is a problem with my PATH  precodeecho $PATH /usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/MacGPG2/bin:/usr/X11/bin /code/pre  Can anybody spot the problem? If you ask me -without knowing a thing about it- I suspect the MacGPG2 (MacGnuPrivcacyGuard2) is out of place?   Thanks for your time!  <answer99073> Your PATH looks fine. The PATH variable is a collection of folders/directories in which the shell looks for commands to execute. So if you install additional software like MacGPG there might get new parts added.  But I assume that the command you are calling is called codepagekite.py/code and not actually code$/code. So you should call it like  precodepagekite.py --signup /code/pre  or (if it is in your current folder/directory)  precode./pagekite.py --signup /code/pre  The code$/code is often used in documentation to represent the shell command prompt and should not be entered to run the command afterwards.  <comment116441> Are you including the $? The command starts after that(`pagekite.py --signup`). The `$` is used to refer to the start of the prompt, but that does not mean you include it when you type commands. <comment255544> Similar help can be found at http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/208425/5472
