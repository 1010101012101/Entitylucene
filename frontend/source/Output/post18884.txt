Xcode 4.1 not downloading - Lion <body> I am trying to download Xcode 4.1 from the Mac App Store (I am on Lion, and I have Xcode 3 installed). The problem is that the download bar barely moved, and after being stuck there for an hour it reset to 0%.   <answer21205> You can remove the partial download by searching for Install in spotlight, then return to the purchased section and re-download the installer.  A reboot will ensure it's not paused or some temporary error has caused the slowness.  <answer45449> If the App Store download doesn't work, you could download (for free) the Xcode dmg directly from Downloads for Apple Developers.  <comment20686> did you try downloading any other apps? do they work? <comment20687> Yes, other apps download fine. <comment20767> it could be paused, try clicking on it to resume
