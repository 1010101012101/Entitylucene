Adding appointments to IPhone6S calendar <body> Have lost the ability to put appointments in my IPhone 6S.  I can put an appointment on my Outlook calendar on my SurfacePro 4 and it shows up on my phone but not vice versa.  If I'm without my computer and I try to initiate a new appointment on my IPhone, it does not take it.  <comment316236> Welcome to Ask Different. It would help us if you provided additional info, such as the types of devices, OS, etc.  Also let us know what you've already done to solve the problem yourself.  Please see [ask] for how to ask good questions that have a better chance at being answered. <comment316301> Is this exchange related? Or just private outlook calendar?
