Remove table from a pages document <body> I have added accidentally a table to my pages document on iCloud web interface. Any idea how  can I remove. I tried several different shortcuts, remove columns, rows etc.  <answer178112> ol liSelect a cell within the table so that the column and row headers appear./li liThen click on the nine-dot square between in the top-left corner between the column and row headers. The headers should disappear and the table should be left with a faint blue selection border./li liHit the Backspace/Delete kbd&#9003;/kbd key on your keyboard./li /ol  The table should disappear.
