App. rejection reasons from Appstore <body> I am iOS Developer. I have seen and I had very bad experience with App store approval process.  We have developed app according to Apple standards which are define in official site of Apple.  But our App. was rejected 2-3 times with different reasons.  I just want to know, strongwhy is Apple not giving all reasons of an App rejection?/strong  Has anybody more information about Apple's strongApp review proces?/strong  Thank you in advance.  <answer173703> You really don't give us much to go on, like what the reasons where and such. BUT, when it comes to Apple, a lot has to come down to the App Reviewer and if they had a good day or not. I have had one rejected, and submitted it again, changing a font and color, and it was then successfully accepted into the App Store. At the end of the day though, they are professionals, and if there is a reason they have given, fix it and move on. It could be something as simple as UI Design ? You say they have given you 3 different reasons, but then say why are they not giving you all the reason ??  Apple ~ App Review Guidlines  <comment204359> No need to say anything.
