Similar to TextExpander App but simulating typewriting text effect <body> I'm looking for an app similar to TextExpander but I need that the strongexpanded snippet/strong to be shown simulating typewriting text effect.   Something like shown in this YouTube video.  If not posible, can I do it with Automator?  <answer102449> I'm not sure what you mean by typewriting text effect. If you want to delays before the keystrokes, you might use scripts like this:  precodedelay 0.5 -- time to release modifier keys if for example the script is run with command-R tell application "System Events"     repeat with c in items of "example"         keystroke c         delay (random number from 0.03 to 0.2)     end repeat end tell /code/pre  If you want to insert the text in a monospace font, TextExpander supports changing the font if you use rich text snippets.
