How to change pop up speed of "Press and Hold" <body> When pressing and holding a keyboard button, i.e. an codea/code, a character pops up.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/aJ50y.png" alt="PressAndHold"  I recall that I was somehow able to change how long I need to hold a key until the Picker pops up on Yosemite.  I cannot find a place to change the popup speed on Mavericks though.   codedefaults read -g | grep -i press/code does not return anything.    <answer180902> Apparently, this works for both Mavericks &amp; Yosemite...  You can do it right from the prefs  System Preferences  Keyboard  Keyboard  Set Delay until repeat  It works for the accent pop-up just the same as it does for 'regular' key repeat  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MZO2N.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment215021> I'd say not a dupe, as the option wasn't directly switchable before Yosemite, so the answer wasn't as simple. <comment215022> … and, apologies… I only just realised the question is for Mavericks facepalm <comment215023> I don't see this as a duplicate, since it seems there has been a change in how this setting could be set.  I believe it was possible to set this via `defaults write someoption` in Yosemite. <comment215026> Did it work from prefs in Mavericks too? <comment215027> It seems to have worked, yes. <comment215029> Cool - it may be worth re-titling the question to make it less-specific, then, for future Googlers. <comment215030> Not sure how though. Feel free to edit. <comment215032> Done. You can always edit your own question with the edit button just underneath it. Editing others' questions needs more rep, but you can always build towards that :) <comment215073> I was actually referring to the wording. ;) thx though.
