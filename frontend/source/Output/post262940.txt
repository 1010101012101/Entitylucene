How can I remap a Key+modifier output? <body> Basically, there was Karabiner that did the job, but with Sierra it doesn't work anymore and there's still no updates. What are other ways to change shortcut output?  In Particular I need to change "" + Option that gives "â‰¥" to give "."   <answer262942> You can make a custom keyboard layout to do this with Ukelele  http://scripts.sil.org/ukelele  <answer262960> There are several alternatives for software that can do this. My preference has been BetterTouchTool.  <comment329513> Wow thats some powerful multi feature tool <comment329527> Can you please in short explain how do I add demanded modifications?
