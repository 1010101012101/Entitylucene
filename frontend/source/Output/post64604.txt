How can I transfer my iPhone’s contents to an empty iTunes library? <body> Last night, my hard drive crashed and it is dead. I don’t have any single iTunes backup – I use my iPhone to sync apps music, photos, etc.   When I plug my iPhone in this new formatted PC, will it delete all content on my iPhone? How can I resolve this?  What should I do so that it will not delete all files in my iPhone when it syncs?  Also, is there a way to transfer my iPhone content to the new iTunes library?   <answer64605> ol liDownload DiskAid (free trial).
