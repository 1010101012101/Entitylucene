My Macbook can connect to ethernet over Ubuntu but not OS X <body> I'm currently dual booting Ubuntu 14.04 and OS X Mavericks (10.9.4) on my 2014 Macbook Pro. When running Ubuntu, I can plug in the Ethernet cable and instantly be connected. But when running OS X, there's no Ethernet connection detected.  Since I was able to connect on Ubuntu instantly, I shouldn't have the issue of having to set up additional configurations, such as a PPoE connection. Since I'm dual booting I'm obviously also using the same laptop, the same Ethernet cable, and the same Ethernet port so it doesn't seem like there should be a hardware issue either.  What could be the issue here?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/x5lOn.png" alt="enter image description here"  When I run "ifconfig" in my terminal while booting OS X, this is what I get:  precodelo0: flags=8049&lt;UP,LOOPBACK,RUNNING,MULTICAST&gt; mtu 16384     options=3&lt;RXCSUM,TXCSUM&gt;     inet6 ::1 prefixlen 128      inet 127.0.0.1 netmask 0xff000000      inet6 fe80::1%lo0 prefixlen 64 scopeid 0x1      nd6 options=1&lt;PERFORMNUD&gt; gif0: flags=8010&lt;POINTOPOINT,MULTICAST&gt; mtu 1280 stf0: flags=0&lt;&gt; mtu 1280 en0: flags=8863&lt;UP,BROADCAST,SMART,RUNNING,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST&gt; mtu 1500     ether 80:e6:50:16:b0:c0      inet6 fe80::82e6:50ff:fe16:b0c0%en0 prefixlen 64 scopeid 0x4      inet 192.168.70.245 netmask 0xffffff00 broadcast 192.168.70.255     nd6 options=1&lt;PERFORMNUD&gt;     media: autoselect     status: active en1: flags=8963&lt;UP,BROADCAST,SMART,RUNNING,PROMISC,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST&gt; mtu 1500     options=60&lt;TSO4,TSO6&gt;     ether 72:00:05:04:94:20      media: autoselect &lt;full-duplex&gt;     status: inactive en2: flags=8963&lt;UP,BROADCAST,SMART,RUNNING,PROMISC,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST&gt; mtu 1500     options=60&lt;TSO4,TSO6&gt;     ether 72:00:05:04:94:21      media: autoselect &lt;full-duplex&gt;     status: inactive bridge0: flags=8863&lt;UP,BROADCAST,SMART,RUNNING,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST&gt; mtu 1500     options=63&lt;RXCSUM,TXCSUM,TSO4,TSO6&gt;     ether 82:e6:50:61:cb:00      Configuration:         id 0:0:0:0:0:0 priority 0 hellotime 0 fwddelay 0         maxage 0 holdcnt 0 proto stp maxaddr 100 timeout 1200         root id 0:0:0:0:0:0 priority 0 ifcost 0 port 0         ipfilter disabled flags 0x2     member: en1 flags=3&lt;LEARNING,DISCOVER&gt;             ifmaxaddr 0 port 5 priority 0 path cost 0     member: en2 flags=3&lt;LEARNING,DISCOVER&gt;             ifmaxaddr 0 port 6 priority 0 path cost 0     nd6 options=1&lt;PERFORMNUD&gt;     media: &lt;unknown type&gt;     status: inactive p2p0: flags=8843&lt;UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST&gt; mtu 2304     ether 02:e6:50:16:b0:c0      media: autoselect     status: inactive /code/pre  After reinstalling OS X I can no longer see the rEFInd screen and thus cannot boot Ubuntu. However, I remember when I ran "ifconfig" earlier I saw an item that started with "eth0"  <answer143472> You deleted your Ethernet connection.  From System Preferences - Network, hit the '+' and add a new one (it may be Thunderbolt or Thunderbolt Bridge).  <answer143527> If you can see the interface in code/Utilities/System Configration/code  "Ethernet Cards", try creating a new network location.  If the issue persists in a new location, you can reset OS X's detected network interfaces by (re)moving code/Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/NetworkInterfaces.plist/code.  If you want to play it absolutely safe, you could (re)move the entire codeSystemConfiguration/code folder, but this will affect other settings (like custom network authentication, power management settings, etc.). strongemNOTE/em/strong: this step supersedes testing it in a new user since it removes global preferences (which affect every user).  If you're still not seeing it, try booting to your Recovery Partition, launching Terminal, and running codeifconfig/code to see if the Recovery partition can see the network interface.  If the Recovery Partition sees it, a reinstall of OS X might be needed.  If it doesn't, well then you did something that I've never seen... :)  <answer143667> It looks like the issue was with my Ethernet adapter, which is incompatible with OS X Mavericks. I just checked out its one-star reviews here: http://www.amazon.com/StarTech-com-Gigabit-Ethernet-Network-Adapter/product-reviews/B0095EFXMC/ref=cm_cr_dp_qt_hist_one?ie=UTF8&amp;filterBy=addOneStar&amp;showViewpoints=0  <comment168907> sounds like the Ubuntu is keeping the Ethernet to it self and not letting OSX have it. Check in Terminal for active connections. <comment169001> I tried that, but it doesn't look like it changed anything- http://i.imgur.com/Nu7hZ6B.png <comment169002> Hit apply, disconnect and reconnect the Ethernet. Are you using thunderbolt or is it an actual Ethernet port? <comment169003> Just tried that, but it doesn't look like anything changed. I'm using an actual Ethernet port. <comment169007> Create a new user and see if the problem persists? <comment169041> When you click on the **+** button, you should be presented with a drop down menu with a list of interfaces. Can you post a screen shot of this menu? Can you also run `ifconfig` in a terminal and **Application  Utilities  System Information** and look at **Hardware  Ethernet Cards** and tell us what they display? <comment169207> Creating a new network location didn't change anything, nor did deleting the entire SystemConfiguration folder. I booted to my Recovery Partition, ran "ifconfig", but didn't see an ethernet connection. <comment169210> Also, even though I didn't see an ethernet connection, I reinstalled OS X anyways, hoping it would help. Now, when I restart my laptop I don't see the rEFInd screen and I get taken straight to OS X.
