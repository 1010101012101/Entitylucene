Can't erase unmountable external HD <body> My external HD isn't mounted and can't be repaired by Disk Utility. However, I'm also unable erase the disk:  precode$ diskutil list disk2 /dev/disk2    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *4.0 TB     disk2    1:                        EFI EFI                     314.6 MB   disk2s1    2:                  Apple_HFS Everest                 4.0 TB     disk2s2  $ diskutil repairVolume /dev/disk2s2 Started file system repair on disk2s2 Everest Updating boot support partitions for the volume as required Error: -69673: Unable to unmount volume for repair  $ diskutil eraseDisk JHFS+ Everest /dev/disk2 Started erase on disk2 Unmounting disk Error: -69888: Couldn't unmount disk /code/pre  <answer230215> Disable Spotlight for that disk (System Preferences)  <answer238248> You can try entering in Single User Mode and do an fsck on the hard drive.   To enter single user mode, turn on your computer and immediately after press the kbdCommand/kbd kbds/kbd. This will load you to a terminal looking screen. Let it run its pre-checks.   After it is done there should be two commands to run:  ul lia command to mount the drive /li lia command to run fsck on the drive. /li /ul  Do the fsck first. This will make sure that at least the hierarchy of the OS file system is ok. Use the mount command just to see if you can mount the Drive.   If it fails, there could be a hardware issue, a cable or failing hard drive. If it does not fail and passes everything, reboot. See if it works normally.  I believe the following command is for the fsck  code/sbin/fsck -fy/code  and the following for mounting  code/sbin/mount -uw //code  Single user mode will display the correct commands.  Once you are done with Single User mode type codereboot/code and hit kbdReturn/kbd  And this will boot you up normally.  <comment211092> Welcome Jonathan H. If the linked question doesn't answer your specific instance, just edit this and flag it for review. I'll be glad to reopen it. Also kudos for adding the excellent diskutil command line details. <comment211340> Thanks. In my case the HD was not showing up under /Volumes/, so the situation is different than in the other question. The following ended up solving my problem: http://www.macissues.com/2014/04/05/how-to-fix-deep-formatting-problems-with-os-x-drives/ <comment211348> OK - if you could flesh out the answer, I'm sure it will help others in the same boat.
