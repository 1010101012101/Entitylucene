Xcode update would not work, and now won't leave the App Store update queue <body> Hello I am trying to remove this update.  It was not working and I ended up downloading the Xcode update directly from apple.developer, it gave me no problem.  This has been my spring cleaning project so now i am still update date with my Xcode but this resume update remains.  The update has actually also been updated to 6.3 as well.  Any advice or direction outside of third party solutions would be very helpful and appreciated.   Thank you,   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ky7Mi.png" alt="Appstore Update - Xcode"  <answer180580> I had this problem.  The issue was I had two copies of Xcode.  I had recently upgraded to a new drive and had the old one mounted to copy things over.  Xcode in code/Applications/code was updated, but the one in code/Volumes/OldDrive/Applications/code was not.  After unmounting the old drive and relaunching App Store the update went away.  To look for other versions of Xcode, open Spotlight, search for codeXcode/code and wait a moment for the full Spotlight search to open up.  If there's a list of Applications right below the Top Hit that may be your problem.  Also check in code/Developers/Applications/code.  If that doesn't work, try resetting the iTunes Store cache.  Quit the App Store, open iTunes, and in Preferences - Advanced and click codeReset iTunes Store cache/code.  Then reopen the App Store.  Finally, try Cmd-R in the App Store to refresh the Updates page.  <answer209377> I was having this exact same issue all night and wasted a good 3 hours troubleshooting it.  I didn't have to go through all of the steps that the other answer provided, but my fix was simply deleting my existing XCode from /Applications using an app called AppZapper (the OS X equivalent of Revo Uninstaller for Windows).  AppZapper makes sure to delete all of the other files associated with the application you are trying to remove.  You have to select a checkbox in the preferences in order to be able to delete Apple applications, but as soon as I zapped my existing XCode and emptied the Trash, the new XCode immediately started downloading from the Mac App Store.  <answer215822> I was able to fix this problem by correcting the permissions for Xcode. Run this from your Terminal:  precodesudo pkgutil --repair com.apple.pkg.Xcode /code/pre  It actually installed as I was doing this. Many of the permissions reported as "should be drwxrwxr-x , they are drwxr-xr-x".  <answer218056> Just managed to get it downloading by requesting the web version (https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?ls=1&amp;mt=12) of the app store to trigger an external request (press allow).  On that "page" in the app store (where you may see screenshots of xcode) a button should also state "Update". And pressing that update button worked - different than the button in the "Updates"-Section posted by OP.  Don't know why, but saved me a ton of time not having to remove everything and redownloading.  <answer243351> The AppStore was hung on the "Update" tab -- it was stuck on the same message as the original question.  I searched for xcode in the AppStore and clicked on the Upgrade button and it's started to download  <comment218384> Unfortunately I can't tell if this would work.  It eventually cleared up after a few restarts. Thank you for the work on responding! <comment218385> The issue resolved itself after downloading directly from the developer site and restarting a few times. <comment255640> What specifically did App Zapper remove? Does it purge files in ~/Library/developer or just in /Library? Does it remove command line tools? I'm generally against these tools, but curious what it did in this one case specifically. <comment255642> When you drag the application in your /Applications folder into the AppZapper window, the window populates with all of the associated files and/or directories to be removed.  I don't remember specifically what it removed, but you will be able to see beforehand.  I could be mistaken, but I believe it sends it all to Trash rather than deleting-outright.  For what it's worth, I did not have to reinstall command line tools after doing this.  I am also an avid `homebrewer`, and it did not have any negative effects on my `homebrew` installation either, such as `sed` being symlinked to `gsed`, etc. <comment255643> Bonus - Thanks @rubyonrails <comment256102> I had the same issue. Whenever I tried opening xcode it would say cannot open while updating. Then when I go to software updates and click update it would try to update and then go back to update. Could not update xcode until I went into the mac app store, searched for xcode, and tried to download xcode from the app store. then it started to download and update. <comment257040> Just did the same thing by uninstalling with Clean My Mac. Xcode instantly updated without having to re-open App Store, but still wasn't installed. After a reboot, was able to open App Store again and click "Install". <comment270390> starting downloading right after I ran this. not sure how it got messed up, I used App Store to download it originally <comment282399> Worked for me, thanks. <comment284782> four months passed and the problem still persists as I came across my own anwer to solve my problem, I'm facing again. Apple, this is embarassing. <comment297264> how long did this take for you? I saw `ACL found but not expected on 'Applications'. Repaired 'Applications'` and now it's just hanging. I should mention I have multiple version of Xcode installed for cross compatiblity <comment297295> For me, it fixed it in just a few seconds and it installed immediately. I haven't had the problem since.
