Outlook 2011 dowloading new mails slowly <body> I'm having a problem with Outlook 2011 for Mac. A user that I'm supporting has to wait for several minutes before new mails appear in his Outlook inbox. When mails finally arrive, several arrive in bulk.  The user is on Microsoft Exchange. In the OWA webmail mails appear instantly, but then it takes a long time before they arrive in Outlook. I've tried both with and without attachements, and it didn't make any difference.
