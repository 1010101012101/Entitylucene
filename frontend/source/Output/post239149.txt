two finger double tap zoom in any app <body> Is there a way to enable two finger double tap on Trackpad to zoom not only in browsers, but also in anywhere else on the computer? Currently it only works for browsers.  I am running osx El Capitan.  <comment293404> There's no standard way to zoom an application. Do You want something similar to CTRL+scroll ? http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/112879/ctrl-scroll-zoom-on-mavericks-gone <comment293429> The exact same used to happen with 2 finger double tap. Hmmm
