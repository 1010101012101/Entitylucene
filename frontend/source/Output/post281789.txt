How to permanently change my MAC address in macOS? <body> In macOS Sierra, for some reasons, I would like to change my MAC address and I would like that this change survive a reboot.  How can I do this?  <answer281790> If you have Homebrew, install SpoofMAC with  precodebrew install spoof-mac /code/pre  You can also install SpoofMAC with codepip/code, or directly with:  precodegit clone git://github.com/feross/SpoofMAC.git cd SpoofMAC python setup.py install /code/pre  Add a emlocal.macspoof.plist/em file in em/Library/LaunchDaemons/em:  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt; &lt;!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"&gt; &lt;plist version="1.0"&gt;         &lt;dict&gt;             &lt;key&gt;Label&lt;/key&gt;             &lt;string&gt;MacSpoof&lt;/string&gt;                 &lt;key&gt;ProgramArguments&lt;/key&gt;             &lt;array&gt;             &lt;string&gt;/usr/local/bin/spoof-mac.py&lt;/string&gt;                 &lt;string&gt;set&lt;/string&gt;                 &lt;string&gt;ca:fe:ca:fe:ca:fe&lt;/string&gt;                 &lt;string&gt;en4&lt;/string&gt;             &lt;/array&gt;                &lt;key&gt;RunAtLoad&lt;/key&gt;             &lt;true/&gt; &lt;/dict&gt; &lt;/plist&gt; /code/pre  Adapt the interface name and address to your need then reboot.  Then load the launch daemon:  precodesudo launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/local.macspoof.plist  /code/pre  P.S.: There is a similar question Change MAC address in OS X Yosemite but the question is not about permanent change and is only for Yosemite.  <answer281831> MAC address is always fixed based on the hardware NIC interface. You can spoof the Mac address but it wouldn't be ensured that it will remain spoofed with latest software updates etc.  <comment354651> Spoofing a MAC address is temporary as you can't actually change it.  *Why* do you need to have the same address? <comment354652> You can't *permanently* change a MAC address by spoofing. <comment354653> Because I use a network where there is a fixed association between IP address and MAC address, and I also need to keep the same IP address. <comment354654> It change the MAC address at each boot. So it's kind of permanent. But effectively if you remove the plist file the "hardware" MAC address comes back. <comment354655> So, there's some sort of accounting and authentication in place like RADIUS.  What you ***should*** do is contact your help desk or support organization, let them know that the adapter is lost.  They will update the system with you new MAC address. <comment354656> Or if you boot into Safe Mode, or from the Recovery Partition, or from Internet Recovery.  If your Mac goes sideways for any reason, when you try to do Internet Recovery, you will find yourself locked out of access. <comment354658> You're right and that's what I've already done. This a temporary trick. <comment354660> This will not be the case because I've Internet access without MAC address control. <comment354679> You want to "permanently" change your MAC address, as a "temporary trick"? After already taking the correct approach? I am confused! <comment354696> Here "permanently" means "survive a reboot".
