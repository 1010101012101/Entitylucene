Can I install Windows from a preexisting Windows installation? <body> I have an early 2011 Macbook Pro. The Superdrive broke, so I installed an SSD and put my old HDD in an optibay. The old HDD had a bootcamp Windows installation on it. Since I can't use bootcamp without a Superdrive, is it possible to install Windows on my SSD from within my HDD installation of Windows? Or do I need to do the installation through bootcamp?  Thanks.  <comment187540> why can't you use bootcamp without a superdrive? btw, I've never had my bootcamp partition on the same drive as my Mac boot - maybe see if Windows is still bootable as-is. <comment187625> Apple's firmware prevents booting off of USB unless your computer didn't come with a superdrive to begin with (e.g. macbook air, retina). <comment187630> ahh, didn't realise - must have used the superdrive when I did mine - was some time ago. Try thisâ€¦ http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=1680652 I've just ordered a bunch of new USB sticks so I'll be testing it too later in the week ;) <comment187637> This tutorial allows you to create the bootable disk, but not actually boot off of it. <comment187638> did you read it all? <comment187707> Yes. There is discussion in the comments over how USBs are not bootable.
