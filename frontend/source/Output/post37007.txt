How to run GimpShop on Lion <body> I've just downloaded GimpShop and wanted to run it on Lion. So I've copied the app to the Applications folder and started it. It starts, I can see it's doing something with cache and bam.. it goes away. The only thing left is X11 window with bash prompt. I've tried closing the X11 app and running it again... nothing. Is there any way I could start GimpShop on Lion?  Thanks  EDIT: There's something wrong with font caching or immediately after fonts are cached. If I remove the font cache directory it will go through the process of caching again and will close immediately after it [or in the middle, hard to tell]. I can see few files inside. If they stay there and I will try to start GimpShop again it will close immediately.  EDIT2: So I've followed these instructions, but I'm still getting an error:  precodebash-3.2$ ./Gimp  /Applications/Gimpshop.app/Contents/Resources/init: line 7: dev/null: No such file or directory Fontconfig warning: no &lt;cachedir&gt; elements found.

This could be why you are having issues. However, They do suggest that you use MacPorts to install GIMPShop. This might help you install it on Lion.  Resources:  ul liGIMPShop Instructions (from their website)/li ligimpshop on osx lion (a thread from Mac Forms)/li /ul  <answer52446> Gimpshop is not maintained anymore. Currently there are no differences between Gimp and Gimpshop, as from Gimp 2.7 you can run it in single window mode. There's a Gimp 2.8 version available for Lion here: http://gimp.lisanet.de/Website/Download.html  <comment42429> There's no GimpShop on mac ports. Also the Mac Forums thread seems not connected to the problem. <comment42435> https://trac.macports.org/browser/trunk/dports/graphics/gimp2/Portfile - Gimp 2 is the same thing as GimpShop. I know, I installed both yesterday and they were both called Gimp 2 once installed. <comment59991> The log shows that Gimpshop tries to call a library in /opt/local/lib which tends to imply that the app was built sing Macports - where did you get GimpShop from?
