Mac failing, Ubuntu used to recover files <body> I'm not a regular user of a MacBook, so I'm not too experienced with it.  The computer started flashing a file with a question mark on startup, and it isn't recognizing any internal harddrive to boot from.  However, I managed to boot Ubuntu from a thumbdrive, and it's now showing files from the internal hardrive.  I need help recovering files from the mac program textedit, but I didn't have the laptop functioning long enough to:  ol liLearn where textedit's directory is/li liAccess files through Ubuntu while files are password encoded with the macOS account password./li /ol
