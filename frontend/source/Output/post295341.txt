Looking for a free rss reader with push notifications <body> Is there a free RSS reader with push notifications for IPhone?  I am looking to receive a push notification once a new post appears in a feed. The reasoning is explained in this question.  Nowhere I can find a free alternative. Some of the apps I have already tried or read about:   Boxcar :  Discontinued  Hooks: Does not allow me to specify custom rss links. They have their own feeds.   LetMeKnow: Requires monthly subscription fee  Inoreader: Requires monthly subscription fee  Newsify: Registered stack overflow javascript question feed did not send me any push notifications. (There is a new post almost every minute). Somewhere in the app it says:      Background sync is controlled by iOS, which prioritizes apps that you   open more often. So, you may need to use Newsify manually for a week   or more for background sync and notifications to start.   I am not sure what that means but I do not think those are the push notifications I am looking for. Other apps that send push notifications do not wait one week before notifying.   Blogkeen:  They claim that they have Push. Again I have added stack overflow javascript feed:  https://stackoverflow.com/feeds/tag?tagnames=javascript&amp;sort=newest  Did not receive one notification. Should be at least once per minute.   IFTTT: Not sure how this will work? Still investigating.  If you know a working solution I would really appreciate it.   <comment372893> There are other blogs that asked the same question: [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/androidapps/comments/43qaop/is_there_an_rss_reader_with_push_notifications/), [Quora](https://www.quora.com/Is-there-any-RSS-reader-that-supports-push-notification), [xda](https://forum.xda-developers.com/android/help/rss-reader-push-notifications-t3306239), [macrumors](https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/rss-reader-with-push-notifications.1310951/)
