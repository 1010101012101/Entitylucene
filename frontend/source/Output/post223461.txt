Why does WhatsApp in iOS require a connection to the internet to send a message? <body> Well, I have used Android, Windows mobile phones, and at present I am using Apple iPhone with iOS 9.2. I noticed in WhatsApp you cannot send message to anyone if it is not connected to server or network, so the send button is disabled till it is connected, and when not connected it continues to show connection with progress bar.   However this is not the case with Windows and Android phones. It will allow you to send message and wait for server connection behind the scene, and once it is connected it will send message which is lot better than having user to wait for getting connected to network to send a message.  <comment270931> I can't see how this question is opinion based. <comment271201> It's because you're asking *why*. Also, the **question itself** is not primarily opinion-based. It's about the answer: "answers to this question will tend to be almost entirely based on opinions, rather than facts, references, or specific expertise."
