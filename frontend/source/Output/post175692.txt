New iPad as a backup without affecting current iPad. <body> So I got a new iPad. Which I would like to setup with iMessage same as my current iPad.  When I set it up it asks if I would like to set as a restore backup. I think I want to do this but I don't want to effect my current iPad in any way.  Is that how this works? It mirrors my current iPad but does not change my current iPad in any way?
