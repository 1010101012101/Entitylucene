Gatekeeper preventing from opening files from Finder (launching apps is fine) <body> Here's what's happening (in Sierra, 10.12.5)  ul litry to launch a non-application file which ISN'T a bundle (e.g. pdf, png -- numbers bundles will be fine) -- by double-clicking, or using open in the Terminal/li liA dialog is prevent with "FILENAME" is damaged and can't be opened. You should move it to the Trash. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/O3io0.png" alt="dialog"/li /ul  What I've tried:  ul lisafe mode/li lirunning as a separate user/li /ul  What I've discovered:  ul liIt's definitely related to gatekeeper: Turning gatekeeper off with codesudo spctl --master-disable/code makes these images launchable./li liSomething is wrong with spctl the underlying command line utility which manages security policies. See below./li /ul  Problem with spctl:  If you run a basic command like codespctl --assess -vvv --raw /bin/ls/code it replies with codeOne or more parameters passed to a function were not valid./code (I tried this as it is a diagnostic step in an old but closely related fix.  However running this same command with gatekeeper off gives the correct result.  I've also tried to restore the SystemPolicy db from the original by:  ul licodesudo spctl --master-disable/code  turning gatekeeper off/li licodesudo cp -p /var/db/.SystemPolicy-default /var/db/SystemPolicy/code  copying the system policy /li licodesudo chmod u+w /var/db/SystemPolicy/code fix perms/li lirestart the computer/li licodesudo spctl --master-enable/code  turning gatekeeper back on/li /ul  But this hasn't helped (but in fact I don't think the SystemPolicy db has reverted back to the defaults -- it seems to grow massively in size (or possibly just revert back to the previous db) when I turn gatekeeper back on.  Any thoughts?
