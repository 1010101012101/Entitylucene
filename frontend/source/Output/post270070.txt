Keychain: Application still requesting access with entry created via "security add-generic-password" <body> I'm adding a Keychain entry programatically onto a machine via the emsecurity/em command as such:  precodesecurity add-generic-password -a "username@exchange.server.here" -s "Exchange" w "P@ssw0rd!" -T "/Applications/Microsoft Outlook" /code/pre  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4eBJ1.png" alt="Screenshot of Keychain entry generated"  It looks great, just like one generated one when you set up Outlook! However, I still get the "Microsoft Outlook wants to access key Exchange in your keychain" prompt when the user opens Outlook.  Have I missed a step here somewhere? I was of the impression that -T allowed applications to access a keychain entry unprompted?
