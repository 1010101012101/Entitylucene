Macbook Pro Early 2015 13" Retina suddenly dead, no response <body> I have an Early 2015 Macbook Pro retina that was running fine until yesterday. I was watching Netflix on it (running on battery) and it just died without any warning. It has no response at all. When I try the SMC reset, the charging light changes from Orange to Green on releasing the buttons. That is the only response I can coax out of it. It is a lightly used machine with no damage. What could I try before taking it to the Genius Bar?   <comment361142> Have you tried booting to either internet recovery or Apple Hardware Test? <comment361167> There is no boot activity at all on pressing the power key. <comment361175> Unfortunately if you can't get a boot there's probably not much we can do to help. The hardware is so locked down on newer models.
