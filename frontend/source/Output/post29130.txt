Is there a keyboard shortcut to cycle between windows in the current space? <body> When I have two applications open side-by-side in the same space, I'd like to be able to swap between them quickly with the keyboard.  I can use codeCommand+Tab/code, but often I land on an application in a different space, and it moves me to that space.  Is there a similar shortcut which limits the list of applications to the current space?  (I'm using OSX Snow Leopard.)  <answer29131> I don't know of any keyboard shortcuts; but consider the following program.  http://manytricks.com/witch/  <answer29185> Move focus to active or next window (⌃F4). It cycles through visible windows (not applications) on the current space.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HYs96.jpg" alt=""  I've assigned it to ⌥⇥ myself, and assigned ⌥T to what ⌥⇥ would do normally: coded=~/Library/KeyBindings; mkdir -p $d; echo $'{\n\t"~t" = insertTabIgnoringFieldEditor:;\n}' &gt; $d/DefaultKeyBinding.dict/code.  <answer181626> If you go to System Preferences, Mission Control and then untick the second box ("When switching to an application, switch to a Space with open windows for that application") that should fix it I think.  <comment33598> This is very close to what I want, and good enough to do the job 90% of the time. :) For those struggling to decipher ⌃F4, it means "Control-Fn-F4" (as I discovered by double-clicking the shortcut in the window shown above and hovering over the text). <comment121748> I had the very same problem, and this is the best solution; comparatively, Ctrl+F4 is suboptimal, since it doesn't show any list of applications. <comment164705> Somehow it doesn't work in certain cases. For me it doesn't work when I move from, say spaceB(3 windows) to spaceA(2 windows) In this case when I try to switch windows in spaceA, it moves back to spaceA. I'm not sure why, but it is really annoying. Like @NathanLong says it works 90% of the time though. <comment242501> Could you update your details? "when I have two applications open side-by-side" would better read "when I have two windows open side-by-side" based on the top two answers.
