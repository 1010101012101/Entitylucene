Downscale a iMac 5K screenshot to 50% using commandline <body> ol liOpen the Screenshot in Preview/li liSelect “Adjust Size…” from the Tools menu/li liChange the Width and Height to 50 percent of the original/li liChange the Resolution to 72 pixels/inch/li /ol  I wish to do this on CLI with a generic command (percent, not actual width and height).  GUI instructions with Preview  <answer190976> You can do it with codeimagemagick/code by typing the following:  precodeconvert image.png -resize 50% -density 72 image.png /code/pre  hr  In order to execute the previous command you need codeimagemagick/code installed on your computer. You can easy do it via homebrew:  precodebrew install imagemagick /code/pre  And, if you haven't homebrew, you can install with this:  precoderuby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)" /code/pre  <answer191003> Here is some applescript to just what you wanted, can be coupled with automator or fed into the command line program osascript like so:  precodeosascript &lt;&lt; 'END' {applescript here} END /code/pre  You can add it into your ~/.bash profile as an alias for a command as well, so all you have to do is enter the downsize alias name and it will pop up, ask you which file you want to resize, and it does the rest automatically.  precodealias downsize="osascript &lt;&lt; 'END' {applescript here} END" /code/pre  Applescript:  precodetell application "Preview"     activate     try         open (choose file with prompt "Pick file to modify")     on error         display dialog "Invallid selection!"         return 1     end try end tell tell application "System Events" to tell process "Preview"     set frontmost to true     click (menu item 1 where its title starts with "Adjust Size") of menu of menu bar item "Tools" of menu bar 1     tell pop up button 1 of group 1 of sheet 1 of window 1         click         tell menu 1             click menu item "percent"         end tell     end tell     set value of text field 1 of group 1 of sheet 1 of window 1 to "50"     set value of text field 2 of group 1 of sheet 1 of window 1 to "50"     set value of text field 3 of group 1 of sheet 1 of window 1 to "72"     click button "OK" of sheet 1 of window 1     click (menu item 1 where its title starts with "Save") of menu of menu bar item "File" of menu bar 1 end tell ignoring application responses     tell application "Preview" to quit end ignoring /code/pre  Hope this helps!  <answer191006> Take a look at the 'sips' command:  precodeman sips /code/pre  It is much simpler than GUI-scripting Preview and it's part of OSX. So you don't have to install anything. Example:  precodefull_w=$(/usr/bin/sips -g pixelWidth image.jpg | /usr/bin/grep -Eo "[[:digit:]]+") full_h=$(/usr/bin/sips -g pixelHeight image.jpg | /usr/bin/grep -Eo "[[:digit:]]+") half_w=$(/bin/expr full_w / 2) half_h=$(/bin/expr full_h / 2) sips -z half_h half_w image.jpg /code/pre  <comment227663> please provide the exact command. Like the imagemagick example. <comment227690> Added an example script. A one-liner would look very confusing here. <comment227692> `sips` is a good answer as it is OSX native and light.  `imagemagick` is good to know as the Swiss-army knive for image manipulation but might just be too heavy for only resizing. <comment227769> thanks for example. imagemagick is much more user friendly than sips. Sips doesn't run on Linux and other UNIXes.
