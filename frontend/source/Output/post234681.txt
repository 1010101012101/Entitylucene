Phone wakes up a few minutes after every text message. Can I make that stop? <body> I have an iPhone 6S with the latest version of iOS. For a couple of months now whenever I receive a text message and put the phone back down it will wake up again for no apparent reason.  Sometimes it seem to randomly do so without a text message, but the text message one is reproducible.  Anyone have any idea why that might be and if I can stop it?  <answer234682> Settings - Notification - Message - Repeat alarm - Never  <comment286934> Oh what on earth, why was that set to "once". Thanks! 3 <comment286947> @KitSunde "Once" appears to be the default. Mine was set to that too, and I'm pretty sure I've never even *seen* that option before.
