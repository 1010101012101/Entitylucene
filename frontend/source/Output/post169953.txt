Music app that integrates well with Synology NAS <body> I'm looking for music software that will work well integrating with a large (~1TB) music collection on a Synology device.  Requirements:  ol liFast searching/li liFast connection/li liadapts happily to NAS being available/not available (no need to manually reconnect/reload)/li likeeping up to date passively when files are added to the NAS library./li liability to easily copy files over./li /ol  I have a synology NAS and I have iTunes Media Server running on it. It fulfills a number of these but fails pretty extremely at #1 and 2.  <comment199687> Pardon me for asking, how is that a Apple products question. <comment199731> @Buscarì›ƒ I want software that runs on OSX to access the NAS files. Although maybe this site is for things only specifically made by Apple, I thought it was for the general use of Apple products...
