The space in the others section of iTunes is taking 1.85GB <body> I have an iPod touch 4g on iOS 6.0.1; 8GB. The others section in iTunes takes 1.99GB. I don't have more than 20 contacts, no email accounts, and not more than 5 notes.   First what I backed up and restored my iPod and again restored from my backup to get my apps again. I did this 5 times and Others remained at 1.99GB.  NOTE: strongI don't have any music and removed all mail, music, and contacts for this./strong  I tried deleting the music folders of iTunes from diskaid and Others dropped to 1.85GB. That still seems like too much.  What should I do?  UPDATE: i dont have any big apps except FIFA 13. All othersare less than 100MB each. Excluding FIFA 13 all the other apps and photos takes 547MB.  <answer73449> Even with 10 apps, make sure none of them is containing lots of documents (e.g., an eBook or comic book reader).  Or download iExplorer (free for file system access) and browse through the content of your device.  Also, you can try this:  ul liConnect your device to the computer./li liOpen iTunes and select it./li liGo to the emApplications/em tab./li liScroll down to the emShare Files/em section and./li liSelect every app one by one and see what documents can be transferred to your computer (you'll be able to check its size)./li /ul  <comment85328> i have adobe reader with 3 files and thats it. none of them over 5 mb. i will try iexplorer. <comment85334> what should i delete through iexplorer? <comment85338> I don't think it's a good idea to use iExplorer to delete files. It doesn't try to be a _Clean My Mac_ for iOS devices. I mentioned iExplorer so that you can browse and see what is taking a lot of space. Do it via your iPod Touch. If it's not possible, then it's probably a system file you shouldn't delete. <comment85340> i didnt get anything useless..:(......so what should i do now....idea..? <comment85341> See [this](http://osxdaily.com/2010/06/25/what-is-the-iphone-other-capacity-seen-in-itunes/) and [this](http://osxdaily.com/2012/04/12/force-ios-devices-to-recalculate-other-capacity-in-itunes/). And go to your device Settings-General-Information and see if it shows a different amount of available space compared to what it shows in iTunes. <comment85342> the first i have seen it before. i tried the second one you told to see but didnt work. in ipod the available space is 2.1 gb while in itunes it is 2.2 gb.
