Resolution when connecting to a headless Mac Mini <body> My setup is as follows:  ol liMac Mini 2012 with a dummy video adapter with latest OSX./li liRetina Macbook Pro 13-inch, Early 2015 running the default OSX VNC client with the latest OSX./li liDisplay Menu to switch resolutions./li /ol  My problem is that I'm not able to get the right resolution such that it fills up the entire Retina Macbook Pro display. Ideally I would have liked 1280x800 or equivalent higher. This way it would fill up the entire screen (though it would be scaled since Retina has a higher resolution, which is fine).  However the only resolution options I see are:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LO1ob.png" alt="Resolution options"  My question is that do these options depend on the dummy video adapter? If so, is there a recommended video adapter to achieve such a setup?  <answer238873> That video adapter only supports resolutions up to 1080p. You would need one that supports 4K resolutions, like this one.  <comment293928> Thanks but that didn't work. I think my problem is that it doesn't show a resolution with 16:10 aspect ratio (which would fill up my Macbook Pros display edge to edge)
