In this specific case, the command fails because an install script is attempting to modify the code/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/code directory, which as of macOS 10.11 is guarded by System Integrity Protection. Try using a virtualenv.  <comment341907> Interesting that it's saying "Permission denied" even when executing as superuser. Just to be sure, can you run `ls -l /Library/Python/2.7/` and tell me what it reports back? There's definitely something funny with permissions here, but I'm not sure what. <comment341918> Virtualenv did the trick, everything works now smooth and I just used nova and neutron with it without problems.
