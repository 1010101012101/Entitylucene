Very weird behavior on Opera with youtube <body> When I try to type "youtube.com" to the address bar, the Opera browser restarts as soon as I hit the "b" key. Any ideas?? It doesn't do the same with any other key or address...  <comment359573> I don't know exactly (never has this issue) but try disabling the URL prediction (`Settings``Privacy & security``Privacy``Use a prediction service...`) and tell if you still have the issue. <comment359584> Thank you for the suggestion. It still happens.
