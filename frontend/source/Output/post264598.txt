OS Sierra, lost ability to write to network shares (NTFS) <body> I used to have the ability to write network shares on a Windows 10 pro machine.  The shares are formatted NTFS. On the windows machine, I have filesharing turned on, and I am logged onto the machine from my Sierra Mac as a local administrator. I can read but not write.  I upgraded to the latest version of Paragon NTFS and this didn't help.  Any idea what's wrong?  <comment331627> Paragon and/or NTFS haven't got anything to do with your problem. When you're accessing a network share, the underlying file system is not exposed to the client - so it doesn't have to support NTFS for writing, have Paragon installed or anything like that. It sounds like you have a permissions issue on the Windows machine. <comment335559> Hi it's true, as confirmed by Paragon Support. I think you must be correct about the Windows machine. Maybe if I run the app "tweaking.com" on the Windows machine, I'll fix it. I have examined the basic GUI settings in Network and Sharing Center, and run the system file checker, to no avail. I imagine if this was a Sierra problem, there would be widespread reports by now. Thank you.
