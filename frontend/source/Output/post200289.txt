Where are my iPhone Photos? <body> My iPhone states that my photo library is 8GB.  However, I can only access about 100 photos from the phone or my Windows PC file explorer.  I want to clear up space on the phone by moving photos to PC.  Thank you!  <answer200290> Try Microsoft Essentials Photo Gallery   The iPhone's folder hierarchy was never meant to be human-readable.  <comment241320> Where does the iPhone cite 8GB of photos?
