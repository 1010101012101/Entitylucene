Switching original backup from Timemachine <body> Im using the WD My Passport for Mac, and I recently formatted my entire computer. If I use this same harddrive to back up on time machine(with the old backups), will it mess anything up as it might recognize it as a different computer?  <answer221149> If you have completely formatted your computer then Time Machine will recognize your computer as a different one, and therefore the backups will be placed in a separate folder on your Time Machine hard drive.
