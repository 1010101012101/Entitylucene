Can I create a keyboard shortcut to lock a file in Finder? <body> I'm constantly opening Info panes so that I can lock the currently selected files in Finder. Keeping the Info pane open is no longer good enough; it gets cumbersome to manage with multiple desktops and screens.  Can I assign a keyboard shortcut to do this?  <answer117503> strongKeyboard Maestro/strong can do this with a macro such as this, which will run codechflags uchg/code on every file in the current Finder selection:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/meHm4.png" alt="Lock"  <answer117783> You can also create a service like this in Automator:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dYba3.png" alt=""  Then give it a shortcut from System Preferences.  Alternatively, save this script in code~/Library/Scripts/Applications/Finder//code in AppleScript Editor:  precodetell application "Finder" to repeat with f in (get selection)     set locked of f to true end repeat /code/pre  Then use FastScripts to give the script a shortcut.  You can use a script like this to toggle locking files:  precodefor f;do [[ $(GetFileInfo -al "$f") = 0 ]]&amp;&amp;chflags uchg "$f"||chflags nouchg "$f";done /code/pre  codeGetFileInfo/code is in code/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/usr/bin//code if you have installed Xcode and in code/usr/bin//code if you have installed the command line tools package.  Or using AppleScript:  precodetell application "Finder" to repeat with f in (get selection)     set locked of f to not locked of f end repeat /code/pre
