pleaaaaase HELP !!!!  <body> i need to find out if i can take away the scribbles on a screenshot ? someone sent me a screenshot but scribbled out some words and i want to figure out how i can somehow see it. please help   <answer203110> The blacked out part or scribbles on the image were rasterized and became a part of the picture when the screenshot was taken. So there is no way to remove the scribbles on top of the image as they are part of the image.
