What's a good key binding for tmux on OS X? <body> The default tmux binding is ctrl+b, which is pretty awkward to hit on a Mac keyboard, because there's no right control.  C-a was the default in screen, but that's the default in OS X for going to the beginning of a line (my shell uses vim mode, but it's inconvenient when ssh'd to other machines).  You can't use alt as a meta key, and cmd+a is already used to select all text.  So - what are others using that doesn't override default OS X behavior that works well?  <answer208389> I've been using codeCtrl+s/code for some time. It does not shadow any shell command I know of, and is quite convenient to hit if you also have codeCapsLock/code mapped to codeCtrl/code (this can be done from within System Preferences-Keyboard-Modified Keys).  <comment166852> I think this question is too subjective and will not give you a satisfying answer. I for example don't find `CTRL+b` awkward to hit for example and other people might have different ideas than you about convenient keybindings.
