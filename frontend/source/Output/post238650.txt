Why can't my friend text me on my iPad mini 2 from her phone which is not and iPhone? <body> I cannot receive nor send texts to my friend on her phone, which is not an iPhone. The error message is "This phone number is not registered with iMessage".  <answer238657> iPad can only send and receive iMessages. If your friend don't have any device from Apple (iPod, iPad, Mac, iPhone), he can't send you a message through iMessage. Use another chat service. (Like Messenger from Facebook or WhatsApp)
