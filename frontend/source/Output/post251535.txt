How do I enable VoiceOver using a Bluetooth keyboard? <body> I have an Amazon Bluetooth keyboard for iOS devices. I often use VoiceOver, but I often turn it off too, and so I have my accessibility shortcut of triple-tapping the home button set to that.  I had an old iPhone 4s running iOS 7, and if I were to tap the Bluetooth keyboard's home button three times, it would turn VoiceOver on or off, which was very convenient. Now on my iPhone SE with iOS 9 though, the same action only opens and closes multitasking.  Using the phone's physical home button still works with the triple-tap, but this is not always as convenient and can wear out the phone's home button faster if I always do this.  So how can I restore functionality like this over the Bluetooth keyboard?
