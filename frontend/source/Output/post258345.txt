iCal in macOS lists events in wrong chronological order <body> With an event spanning more than one day already entered, any new event for the first day is placed emafter/em the beginning of the multiday one in Month view. This happens regardless of its actual time.   (Note: It is placed correctly in Day and Week views; and is placed correctly in Month view strongif/strong the other events are within that day).    This seems to be a bug unless there is an obscure (to me) solution.  <comment322948> Day & Week both have a specific banner line stating 'all-day'. Month doesn't, but all-day events are always placed at the top, with a banner across all relevant days [since forever] <comment330070> Tetsujin:  Yes, I understand that, but the behavior I have described refers to multiday events with specific times, not "all day".  It showed up in this case along with a trans-Pacific flight.
