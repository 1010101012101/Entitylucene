Download a Free App published only to India AppStore while my primary iTunes account is US Appstore? <body> Download a Free App published only to India AppStore while my primary iTunes account is US Appstore?   I have years (maybe a decade) with my iTunes account on US Appstore. I do not wish to switch permanently as I have Apps bought from it.   I just need a few 'Free' India AppStore apps now and then for when I visit.   strongIs there some temporary way to switch or buy them?/strong   strongSome kind of workaround?/strongbr e.g. Maybe create an alternate user account and as a family member on India AppStore?  <answer201970> You can have multiple accounts, you just have to log in and out to switch between them.  After you created an India account, log out of your US account:   ul liSettings - App and iTunes Stores - Apple ID - Sign Out/li /ul  Then sign in with your India account. Swipe close your AppStore app, then go into it again. Now you can download apps from your India account.  <comment248828> I only wish to switch temporarily for few apps while I visit India, and wish to switch back to US store immediately without losing any of my US store stuff. Is this doable without issues? <comment248839> Well yes, have you tried the above? <comment249076> I was afraid I will lose my US store & US store apps on the iPhone so I wanted to be sure before I tried it. Can I switch right back or is there a waiting period/ i.e. you can also switch stores certain times in X weeks etc? <comment249207> Last time I did it it worked perfectly :) no waiting period
