Drive cannot be unmounted/disabled <body> I am new to OSX. The problem I am facing is that I am not able to erase the harddrive of a mac mini that I have recently purchased. Follwing is an overview of the situation and things that I have tried:  strongBackground:/strong   ul liThe mac is a late-2012 model with 1 TB HDD that was used in a company. /li liI purchased the mac from the owner of the company. /li liThe mac was set up as a server and has a partition on the HDD that apparantly cannot be erased. /li liThe OS on the mac at the time of the purchase was Yosemite /li liThere was a guest account on the mac at that time/li liThere were 3 other user accounts on the mac at that time, but the owner did not know the passwords as the employees that had made the accounts had long left the company/li liThe OS has now been updated to Sierra/li liThe guest account has vanished after update to Sierra/li liI do not have access to any other OSX besides Sierra/li liIt seems possible to create new partitions on the HDD/li /ul  strongThe problem:/strong  The seller tried to erase the HDD, but it did not work. He tried erasing both at the HDD level and at the partition level neither of which worked. The problem he got was the drive cannot be unmounted. I brought the mac home and created a USB bootable disk from my macbook that runs Sierra. I used the USB disk to boot the mac (Press option key at startup), but ended up with similar problems, i.e., drive cannot be unmounted. I then tried upgrading the OS to Sierra, but it did not fix the problem either. Moreover, now the guest account that was previously available at login has vanished. When running diagnostics on the HDD, everything is OK. The diagnostics on the partition do not proceed because "the disk is in use".  Any way to force erase the HDD? How to remove the partition without access to any user account?  Will either of the following work:  ol liRemove the HDD by opening the mac mini, replace with a brand new HDD, say an SSD. Use the bootable media to format the new disk?/li liIs it somehow possible to install Sierra on the bootable media, such that mac mini can be started from the bootable media and the HDD erased from a terminal window? Any idea how to do this given the situation above?/li /ol  Any other way?  Thanks!  <comment324556> You can't erase the drive that you booted from.  Boot from a [USB installer](http://www.macworld.com/article/3092900/macs/how-to-create-a-bootable-macos-sierra-installer-drive.html) and you will be able to erase it and do a clean install of Sierra. <comment324560> Hi Allan, I did not manage to erase the HDD using the bootable USB drive that I created (using DiskMaker X). Same problems as above. <comment324563> When you boot the USB installer, go into terminal and execute the following command:  `diskutil eraseDisk /dev/diskX` where X is the identifier of the drive in question.  You can find this out by issuing the command `diskutil list` and looking for the drive. <comment324578> Thanks Allan. Silly question - how to get terminal window with booting from USB? <comment324581> when you boot the installer, go into the "Utilities" menu.  Terminal will be there.
