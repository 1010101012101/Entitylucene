Why am I being asked for a password anytime I create a folder? <body> I am using Mac OSX Lion Server that I just got on a new Mac Mini. This is my first apple desktop experience.  However, I notice that when I want to create or rename a folder, I keep getting prompted for my admin password.  Is there a way I can disable this?  <answer34213> You are prompted for an administrator password when you attempt to create or modify a file or folder for which your user account does not have permission to modify. If this is happening within your home directory, it likely means that permissions are mis-set. You could fix this by running the program Disk Utility, selecting your startup drive, and clicking on the button reading strongRepair Disk Permissions/strong.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4Cq7h.png" alt=""  If this is happening in a system folder, this is by design, to make it more difficult to break something. While it can be overridden (the simplest way would be at the terminal to type codechmod a+w -R //code, but this is strongemhighly/em/strong unadvised) through changing permissions, I would suggest that this is a Bad Idea.  <comment38980> Where are you trying to make these new folders? On the desktop? In the `/Applications` directory? Elsewhere?
