Fusion Drive lost space after bootcamp-fail. resizeStack throws an error. What can I do? <body> I have a 2 TB Fusion Drive in a 5K iMac (Late 2015). Two days ago, I started the bootcamp assistant to create a partition for Windows 10. It got stuck (let it run 30 minutes), however, which forced me to reboot the machine. After booting, I lost 164 GB from my Fusion Drive.  I googled and found a solution, which states to boot into recovery and run codediskutil cs resizeStack &lt;LGVID&gt; 0g/code, which I did. However, I am not able to let it resize, because it immediately throws an error. Following the error does not work either.  I also tried repairing the disk with Disk Utility which runs for a few minutes, then says everything's fine. Nothing changed of course.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8hk4l.jpg" alt="diskutil outputs"  Output of codegpt -r show /dev/disk0/code: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bewFv.png" alt="enter image description here"  Output of codediskutil verifyDisk disk0/code: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nHltX.png" alt="enter image description here"  What can I do now?  <answer226982> Since I wasn't able to resize the stack and seemingly no one was able to help me, I decided to to this:  ul liMake an image of the Fusion Drive Volume and save it onto an external hard drive/li liDelete the Fusion Drive/li liRebuild the Fusion Drive/li liInstall OS X to let it create the Recovery partition/li liBoot OS X, run Bootcamp Assistant/li liRun the Windows Installer WITH NO EXTERNAL DRIVES ATTACHED (!)/li liRestore the image to the Fusion Drive/li liBe happy after 10 hours of work/li /ul  Not the best procedure to do but as this was the only thing that seemed to help, I did it.  For recreating the Fusion Drive I used this answer from klanomath: https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/168744/109455  I have a working setup with OS X El Capitan and Windows 10 now.  <comment274436> Please add your system version. To verify a Fusion drive use `diskutil verifyDisk diskX` with X=disk identifier of the two disk building the drive - in your case either 0 or 1 (check the physical volumes in your screenshot). <comment274437> OS X El Capitan 10.11.2 (haven't upgraded to .3 just yet). If I run it with disk0 or disk1, it complains that it will delete my stuff. <comment274438> Using the **verifyDisk** (instead of repairDisk!) argument deletes stuff? The proper command to resize a stack in El Capitan is a distinctive size (i.e. `diskutil cs resizeStack 25FF.... 2126g` or slightly smaller like 2125500m) <comment274439> Please also add a screenshot of `gpt -r show /dev/disk0` <comment274444> Sorry, misread that as `repairDisk`. Just appended two screenshots with the outputs. <comment274501> Just tried `resizeStack` with a value that is not 0g. Still complains about incorrect size.
