How to install OS to Mac Air with a different Apple ID <body> I got a Mac Air from friend and the Mac OS is 10.7(Lion). I tried to delete friend's data but unfortunately I deleted the whole disk and now there is no Mac OS in this Air. There was always only a folder with question mark in a white background after starting up this Air. My question is how to install any Mac OS to this Air now?  I tried to Restore to the manufacture and go to page Reinstall Mac OS X. I entered my Apple ID and password and it only showed OS Lion for download. But when I clicked download, it said this OS was temporarily unavailable in AppStore. It seems I have to download and install Mavericks (it's free.) But I need a proper Apple ID - the one that has been used with the computer to install App Store software, which should be my friend's Apple ID. May I use my Apple ID to install Mavericks to this Air? Is there any other way to install Mavericks or Lion to this Air? Thanks.  <comment169453> You can buy the OS Lion here http://store.apple.com/us/product/D6106Z/A/os-x-lion and this info https://www.apple.com/support/lion/installrecovery/
