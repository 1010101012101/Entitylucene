iMessage doesn't say "delivered" <body> I have an internet friend, we were chatting using imessage, everything works properly until i try to send a message and then imessage doesn't say delivered neither sending. I tried using my other email address to text him, and it works, it says delivered, i know this is weird so i tried again using my first email, but it still doesn't say delivered. Did my friend blocked me?  *i don't have his number, just his email.  <answer244352> If your friend turned off emiMessage/em or turned off emRead Receipts/em, then you won't get the emRead/em notification.  If they're using a beta of iOS 10, they can turn off emRead Receipts/em for individual contacts.  Also, as you suggested, if the friend decided to block you, you won't see the notifications, either.   strongEDIT/strong: As indicated in the comments, you will see the emDelivered/em notification even if emRead Receipts/em has been turned off.  Edited answer to reflect that.   <comment301143> The "Delivered" notifications appear whether Read Receipts are on or off (see also: https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/59297).
