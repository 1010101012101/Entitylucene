Do external DVD drives other than a SuperDrive work with the MacBook Air? <body> I need to access a DVD using my MacBook Air, and am planning to buy an external drive. I'd prefer going for an option cheaper than the SuperDrive.  However it looks like the SuperDrive doesn't work with other machines, and this worries me that other drives won't work with this machine.  If I get a recently manufactured non-Apple external drive, can I expect it to work with my MacBook Air?  <answer46960> The SuperDrive does only work with the MacBook Air, but the MacBook Air supports a lot of other drives.  For example there is the Asus External-Optical-SDRW ($37,75). Cheap, fairly fast and not very ugly :)br img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0KpiY.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Or the Samsung External-Optical-SE. ($45,80) A bit more expensive, but it support way more formats and speeds:br img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/aP45p.jpg" alt="enter image description here"
