Would monitors attached to my USB hub make my CPU run hotter? <body> Would having 2 monitors attached to my USB hub (along with 1 monitor attached to the MiniDisplay port) contribute to the CPU getting hotter?  My MacBook:  ul liCore i5@2.5-GHz/li li16-GB of RAM/li li1 HooToo 7 port USB hub/li li2 Diamond USB Multi-Display Adapter/li lithe USB Display Adapters attach to HP 2511x (25") and Samsung S24D300 (24")/li lithe MiniDisplay port monitor is HNC iF281D (28")/li liMacOS 10.11 (El Capitan)/li liI installed iStat to monitor things./li /ul  I just read in some forum that the strongCPU might overheat/strong with more than 1 external monitor???    I have been using this set-up for a few days. It is working fine.  <answer293021> I found the answer:  USB graphics devices, like the USB-HDMI-DVI, are “virtual” devices where much of the heavy lifting is done by the CPU, by hooking into the graphics stack.   Even so, I'll keep this set-up and monitor things with emiStat/em. All I display is emMSFT Word/em documents and stupid web pages. I think I'll be ok?  Sorry I did not do more research!  <answer293074> Thank you man, for publishing the answer.   Just as a follow up to the answer, it won´t make it run hotter, but it will consume some processing from your CPU (while compressing video) and mostly the GPU (for rendering the additional screens), this Wikipedia article tells exactly your answer and adds some context to it.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DisplayLink     The DisplayLink network graphics technology is composed of Virtual   Graphics Card (VGC) software that is installed on a PC and a Hardware   Rendering Engine (HRE) embedded or connected to a display device. The   DisplayLink VGC software is based on a proprietary adaptive graphics   technology. The VGC software runs on a Windows, Mac OS X, Linux host   PC and takes information from the graphics adapter and compresses the   changes to the display from the last update and sends it over any   standard network including USB, Wireless USB, Ethernet, and Wi-Fi.   After receiving the data, the HRE then transforms it back into pixels   to be displayed on the monitor.   <comment369753> But, isn't "consuming processing power from your CPU" what causes a CPU to get hotter? <comment369762> An intensive CPU process would cause an increase in temperature, but not at the level of compressing a signal and sending it through USB, that would just increase CPU consumption just between 1% and 3%. <comment369931> You are totally correct. Why didn't I just use Activity Monitor to watch CPU usage? "DisplayLinkManager" is always less than a 10% load. iStat shows my CPU temp is within normal range. yeah. I think I'm good with using 2 of those USB adapters. I am so relieved.
