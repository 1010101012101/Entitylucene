CLI Solution - Stripping File Attributes - LSOpenURLsWithRole() <body> I am getting this error when trying to execute an unsigned application that was downloaded via the native web-browser; codeSafari.app/code.  precodeLSOpenURLsWithRole() failed with error -10810.. /code/pre  There used to be a solution to a similar question on AskDifferent that emutilised the CLI to strip certain attributes/em from the file in question, allowing it to run. It was a good solution but it has since been deleted and now I've forgotten what it was.  Does anybody know the command('s?) that I'm referring to?   <answer206858> I believe it's codexattr -rc app-name/code, but I could be completely wrong.  <comment249401> I think you might be on the right track.. I recall there being more to it though.. <comment251385> Could you show your research? When you say "there used to be a solution" that doesn't show what you did now to research your problem.
