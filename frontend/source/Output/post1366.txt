How do I flush the DNS cache on a OS X 10.6 machine? <body> Trying to flush the local DNS cache. How is this done on Snow Leopard?  Using System Preferences and using the terminal?  <answer1367> precodedscacheutil -flushcache /code/pre  <answer1369> Use  precodesudo dscacheutil -flushcache /code/pre  or  precodesudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder /code/pre  In 10.6 the handling of Unicast DNS is now managed by mDNSResponder - codedscacheutil -flushcache/code now just tells mDNSResponder to restart (the second command above).  <comment1164> can it be done via pref pane? <comment1166> @jdiaz No. There is no option in System Preferences to flush the DNS cache. <comment22364> After I upgraded to OS X Lion, `dscacheutil -flushcache` does not seem to work anymore on my system.  Using Chealion's suggestion of sending a HUP signal to mDNSResponder does still work for me though. <comment112486> See [OS X: How to reset the DNS cache](http://support.apple.com/kb/ht5343) from the Apple support pages.
