How can I use LaCie USB Key "Private Volumes" with 10.6.8/10.7? <body> Today I purchased a LaCie iamaKey v2. When I first ran the included 'La-Private' software, it urged me to install MacFUSE, so I did. After going through the steps, I tried to open my Private Volume, though it wouldn't open.. So, I formatted the drive, and then downloaded the software, and went through the steps again. Though now I get an error message...    precode/Library/Filesystems/fusefs.fs/Support/fusefs.kext failed to load - (libkern/kext)   link error; check the system/kernal logs for errors or try kextutil(8).     the MacFUSE file system is not available (71) /code/pre  strongEDIT:/strong After some more research, I found that I had to use a specific version of MacFUSE. If you're a Mac user and have the above issue, check out the 'Important Note' here.  <answer31109> To use La-Private OSX Lion users must download the update from LaCie and also install the latest MacFUSE package.  <comment20177> Welcome to Ask Different, James!
