Is Lingo IRC is abandoned? <body> I'm using nice strongLingo IRC/strong client, but it a bit outdated.  Links in strongAbout/strong seem to be broken and I can't find this app in App Store.  Does anybody know for sure is Lingo IRC abandoned?  Maybe there is a way to contact with maintainer?  <answer223961> Based on the comments at MacUpdate for Lingo, the product appears to have been removed the Mac App Store and is no longer being maintained.  The domain associated with Lingo IRC, http://lingoirc.com, is now a holding page.
