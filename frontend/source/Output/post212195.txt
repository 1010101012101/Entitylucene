KeyChain Access and GPG Keychain - should those be running simultaneously? <body> I have installed GPG Suite and found out also during this time that my OS X has some app that stores all my passwords under my screenlock password - total news to me.  Can I get rid of Apple app if I now have GPG? Really need help with this Apple app.. Thank you.  <answer213777> No.  You have no reason to remove Keychain Access and doing so would break important parts of the OS.  <comment258750> Given that it is dependent on one single user password, I do not want to use it.  It's terrible security.  What can I do?
