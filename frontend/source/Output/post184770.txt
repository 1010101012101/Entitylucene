Kernel panic: need help to confirm or refute my hypotheses about the cause <body> I recently experienced a kernel panic on my MacBook Pro (OS X version 10.9.5). The crash report is attached below.  I did some research on kernel panics, and I figured the VirtualBox kernel extensions would be the obvious suspects. I find it odd, though, given that I wasn't running the VirtualBox app itself. To be sure, I just upgraded VirtualBox.  At any rate, let me explain in a little bit more detail the circumstances of the panic. I had had a Wolfram Mathematica notebook open for quite some time. The crash itself happened while I was browsing a PDF document in Google Chrome. After the panic, OS X automatically restarted and it could restore all windows and apps that were open before the panic, but something weird was happening: both Finder was unresponsive and I didn't have Wi-Fi connection. I also noticed that Mathematica had 7 or 8 grayed-out, unresponsive windows open with the “hourglass” icon superimposed on each of them (not the beach ball, but the icon you usually see under the Apple logo upon startup), instead of the 2 and 3 windows Mathematica had open before the crash (notebook, message panel, and a toolbar). Once I force quit Mathematica, Finder immediately became responsive again and the Wi-Fi connection resumed.  Based on this weird experience, I have three admittedly non-expert hypotheses about what caused the panic:  ol liMathematica exhibited some idiosyncratic, one-time behavior that somehow caused a systemic failure. Perhaps some pathological interaction with the VirtualBox extensions?/li liRAM problems: five months ago, I upgraded the manufacturer-provided 2x2 GB RAM slots to 2x4 GB RAM slots I bought on Amazon (the model had very good reviews) after double-checking it would work with my MBP. Up until today the new RAM seemed to be working properly./li liOther hardware problems: my MBP is not young (it's an early 2011 model that I bought more than 3.5 years ago), and there may be some mysterious HDD or other hardware failure that began to take its toll./li /ol  Given that I had never had kernel panics before and the horror stories I read about their frequent recurrences once they start, it would be very helpful for me to know what was the likely explanation for this panic and what steps I can make to prevent future occurrences. Do you think the description above points to a more definitive cause?  hr  [crash report attached below this line]  hr  precodeAnonymous UUID:       4CABCC7C-02A7-A534-BE98-7EEC1989E170   Mon May  4

So now we have four suspects: Mathematica, VirtualBox, Google Chrome pdf reader, and the Time Machine daemon, don't we? Could they have interacted in such a way as to cause a kernel panic? <comment219136> Here is a good place to start. This is a link [ https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/technotes/tn2063/_index.html ] to apple talking about kernel panics. From what I am seeing above it appears that there was a write issue to a not-present page based on section "How to Read the Panic Log from an Intel-Based Mac" specifically line 1 "type 14=page fault" and line 6 Error code: 0x00000002. <comment219137> @jimrice This seems helpful, thank you. Do you think a failed attempt to write to an absent page is more likely to indicate hardware failure or software issues? <comment219151> For what I see there was a problem with the Hard Disk, and with the USB disk com.apple.iokit.IOSCSIBlockCommandsDevice, and com.apple.iokit.IOUSBMassStorageClass. But to follow your path, disable the virtualbox and test without it. <comment220965> @Buscar웃 Thank you for your suggestions. Luckily, I've gone without another occurrence of kernel panic for more than a week now, despite intensive use of my laptop. I will make sure to get the hardware checked if something like this happens again.
