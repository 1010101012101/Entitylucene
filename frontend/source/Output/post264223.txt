Restoring messages from backup not working <body> I tried restoring the folder code~/Library/Messages/code, and code~/Library/Containers/com.apple.iChat/code, but when I opened Messages every single Message but the last was gone for every conservation. Can I bring back my Messages somehow?  <answer264224> The messages themselves are stored in the database file, code~/Library/Messages/chat.db/code. After that file is definitely in place, try rebooting your computer.   In my case, once that file was in place it would only show 1 message from each of the conversations, but after rebooting, all of the messages showed up.  <comment331081> Also, it would be good to know, what OS version are you using?
