How do I backup my complete iTunes library (to new a PC)? <body> I am currently using XP on my laptop, which has the iTunes library.  I use it to sync my iPod/iPad.  I am planning to buy a new laptop (Windows 7). How do I make the transition seamless to the new iTunes library switch ? i.e. I should get all the Music/Movies/Apps/Photos,etc on my new Win 7 laptop seamlessly.  <answer33366> Apple has a support document for this: iTunes: How to move your music to a new computer. It also covers things like de-authorizing your old computer from the iTunes Store etc.  <comment38056> Is it only for Music...I also want to move other things...Videos, Apps, Books, Photos, etc
