Why is migration from Mac Thunderbird to Mac Mail not working properly? <body> I want to switch from Mac Thunderbird to Mac Mail. To do so, I compressed all folders of the account in Thunderbird and after that, I used the import wizard of Mac Mail. Unfortunately, a lot of Mails are missing. A folder that contains hundreds of mails in Thunderbird, contains only one message in Mail, but I get no errors or warnings. How can I migrate my local folder? (I cannot switch to IMAP, thank you ;-) )  <answer71784> A friend of mine had a similar problem when migrating local mails from a POP mail account from Windows XP (Thunderbird) to a Mac (Mail.app).  This is what we did:  ol liCreate an IMAP account (we chose emaol.com/em, emgmail.com/em is another good choice)./li liConfigure the new IMAP mail account in Thunderbird./li liDrag and drop all mails from the local account to the IMAP account. This may take a while./li liConfigure both your current mail account and the IMAP account in Mail.app./li liCopy the files back to your current mail account (again, drag and drop)./li /ol  (You may consider keeping the IMAP mail address...)  This may be easier than troubleshooting why the import doesn't work properly.  <comment83358> Thank you for your answer. In the end, it is really the only way :-( Interoperability is such a nice thing ^^ <comment83359> Yes, sadly such a workaround is sometimes the only way. Be patient when transferring the mails, I'd recommend copying one folder at a time. <comment83377> The dialog "Window" - "Activity" is very helpful! If you do not open this dialog, it seems that Mac Mail does nothing when you try to copy large folders ^^ <comment83381> Yes, that's definitely a good trick.
