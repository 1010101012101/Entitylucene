Rsync: run backups like Time Machine and prevent removing non existing remote files/dirs on local folder <body> I have this configuration: a NAS and a local hard drive on my Mac I want to backup incrementally, like Time Machine does.  When I do this rsync command:  precodersync -va --exclude=.DS_Store --delete /Volumes/Drive/Folder /Volumes/RSYNC/Test /code/pre  A folder "test" on my NAS (so the remote) will be deleted if it doesn't exist on my local hard drive.br I would like to keep the possibility to add more content on the remote folder without having it on my drive (more like a shared folder, other users can add content, but I come with my possibly updated data to backup everything).  Any idea how to do incremental backups (in another folder, with file versions, etc — like Time Machine in some way), without deleting non-existing content on remote from local?  <answer218574> h2Folder selection in Time Machine/h2  You can specify folders to be excluded from your Time Machine backup, specifically, you could specify everything BUT your specific files.  precodesystem preferences &gt; time machine &gt; options. /code/pre  <comment264133> `rsync` is designed for syncing or data transfer, not for version control (like Time Machine). Version control is an whole other ball-game. <comment264134> ha, ok. The fact is I can't use Time Machine anymore because I would like to run different backup actions (one for music, videos, specific work folders on different remotes, etc). What tool can I use? I'm currently using  ChronoSync but the sync duration is damn long (11mn to check every single folder and copy only 100mb…) <comment264190> You CAN use time machine for this. Just alter your question, ask what you are trying to achieve, and I will try to answer it. <comment264214> From now, Time Machine is not the best tool for my use. I need multiple backup tasks for specific folders on my NAS. I would like to have a clean folder root structure with backups in a folder and not this date + latest folders from TM. <comment264255> Yeah, already did that to exclude my SSD drive from the Mac. But, here, I need to sync these excluded folders to another remote folders, so, Time Machine is not the best tool to do **multiple** backups tasks. <comment264261> @flks I see. Commercial software might help you out. Like: http://www.econtechnologies.com/chronosync/overview.html (I have no experience with this software) or see http://forums.macrumors.com/threads/can-time-machine-be-setup-for-multiple-backup-profiles.1117818/ <comment264269> I'm already using ChronoSync but it's quite slow to copy everything (11mn for almost 0 copied octet). Was wondering about something better and speeder.
