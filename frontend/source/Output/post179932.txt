How do I toggle parental controls on a cluster from the instructor's machine? <body> I have a cluster of computers used for teaching.  I have parental controls turned on which prohibit the kids from playing Minecraft without an admin password.  We use Minecraft in some of our coursework so I would like to provide my instructors with a "switch" by which they can toggle on/off access to Minecraft from the instructor's machine rather than having them go around typing the admin password on every machine individually.  How do I go about setting that up?   We have OS X Server on the instructor's machine.
