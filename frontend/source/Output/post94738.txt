Has Apple added universal TRIM support with OS 10.8.4? <body> I used to enable TRIM using 3rd party software, and I had to do it all the time Apple released a minor upgrade. Recently I installed OS X 10.8.3 on a SSD and when I was ready to install the SSD in a new MBP, 10.8.4 came out. I installed the SSD in the laptop and upgraded to 10.8.4.  To my surprise TRIM was enabled.   Anybody else with the same experience? My SSD is a 512 GB Samsung.  <answer94950> I can confirm that in my case installing OSX 10.8.4 on a new SSD I had to enable TRIM with TRIM Enabler.  When I first ran TRIM enabler the application displayed that TRIM was not enabled.  How did you determine that TRIM was enabled?
