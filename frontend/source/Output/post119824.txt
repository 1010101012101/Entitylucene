How to start Apple Hardware Test without Apple Software Disk (MBP13 mid-2010)? <body> My question is very simple. I have some trouble on my MBP13 mid-2010 (MC375LL/A) and I want to diagnose it using the Apple Hardware Test.   I try to hold the D key down during restart of the MBP but nothing happens. I think it is due to the fact that I need to use the DVD 2 coming with the MBP. Unfortunately I don't have the DVD currently.   I try to use Internet Recovery (by holding "Option+D") but it seems that Apple Hardware Test does not support my MBP...  So I am looking for a solution to achieve this diagnostic without the original DVD.  strongEdit:/strong My MBP is currently running on OSX Maverick (10.9.1).  <answer119839> As per Apple Support Page these Mac's are eligible for Internet Recovery:  ul liMacBook Pro (13-inch, Early 2011) /li liMacBook Pro (15-inch, Early 2011) /li liMacBook Pro (17-inch, Early 2011) /li liiMac (21.5-inch, Mid 2011) /li liiMac (27-inch, Mid 2011) /li liMacBook (13-inch, Mid 2010)/li listrongMacBook Pro (13-inch, Mid 2010)/strong/li liMac mini (Mid 2010)/li liMacBook Pro (15-inch and 17-inch, Mid 2010)/li liiMac (21.5-inch and 27-inch, Mid 2010)/li liMacBook Air (11-inch and 13-inch, Late 2010)/li /ul  Upgrade your MBP with EFI Firmware Update 2.5 for MacBook Pro (13-inch, Mid 2010) to enable it.  <answer135695> By knowing your exact Model Identifier (MacBokPro?,?) you could look in to this data base for the correct version of AHT to download.

Apple AHT for MacBookPro7,1 - 022-4653-A.dmg - do not use unless you've verified you indeed have a MacBookPro7,1, it won't mess up your computer if it isn't, it just won't boot.    To some these steps may not make sense, I'm just reformatting what I was told and worked when I did this for my iMac to a guide for this specific MacBook Pro, I don't dare wipe my flash drive to try another method as I don't want to loose its power. Continuing on...    strong(your flash drive will be WIPED)/strongbr 1. Insert your flash drive of at least 16MB capacity and open emDisk Utility/em then select your flash drive on the left and go to the emPartition/em tab.br 2. Select em1 Partition/em in the drop down then go to emOptions.../em and select emGUID Partition Table/em then verify emFormat/em is set to emMac OS Extended (Journaled)/embr 3. Finally enter a name for your drive (I recommend something simple like emAHT-FD/em, do not use spaces) and click emApply/embr 4. After formatting is finished mount (double click) the 022-4653-A.dmg you downloaded and copy everything to your freshly formatted emAHT-FD/em flash drive.br 5. In emFinder/em open emGo/em in the menu bar and select emGo to Folder.../em then paste em/Volumes/AHT-FD/System/Library/CoreServices/.diagnostics//em and click emGo/embr 6. Copy the emdiags.efi/em file and paste it to the root of your emAHT-FD/em flash drive.br 7.

Did you update the firmware? <comment139789> @Thecafremo I just verify the version of the ROM in my MBP and it is `MBP71.0039.BOE`. Thus it seems to be ok... <comment139791> I forget to say that my MBP is currently running on Maverick (10.9.1). <comment139815> My ROM version and SMC version are: `MBP71.0039.B0E` and `1.62f7`. Considering this [table](http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1237), my MBP is up to date. Unfortunately I can't start the AHT. Notice that the Firmware update proposed by Apple is for Lion and in my case my MBP is running on Maverick (10.9.1). <comment186697> I had (and still have) the exact same problem with "MacBook Pro (15-inch and 17-inch, Mid 2010)" = even with updated firmware, the internet recovery ("option+D") begins, but reports that "this mac is not supported" (and I can't locate the disk 1/2 that came with the mac originally) <comment186699> +1 I had (and still have) the exact same problem with "MacBook Pro (15-inch, Mid 2010)"; now running 10.10.1 (with latest firmware). <comment265773> The latter link, to the github project, is excellent, and pointed me straight to the right download link, direct from Apple.
