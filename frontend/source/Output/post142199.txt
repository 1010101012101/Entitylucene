iPad 3 as recording device - How to Connect Firewire 400 from a PreSonus device <body> Have: iPad 3 (Apple 30-pin connector) PreSonus Firestudio (firewire 400 output)  How to connect them?  <answer142201> You don't. Firewire isn't compatible with a full fledged USB controller and the 30 pin connector isn't even a full USB connection to connect peripherals.  Sell the Firewire device and buy a device that will work with the iPad is sadly the best advice I have for you.  <comment167577> sad indeed and thanks
