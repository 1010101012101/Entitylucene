Problems installing OSX Snow Leopard from ISO disk image on a MacBook Pro 13 inch 2011 <body> I want to do a clean install of OSX 10.6 on my MacBook Pro. I created a bootable USB on Windows using Trans Mac from an ISO image of OSX 10.6, but when I insert the USB on my Mac and hold the option key on the keyboard the USB stick doesn't show up at all.  I tried burning the ISO image on a DVD and booting from that, but it's still not working. When I boot from the DVD with the USB still plugged in it boots from the USB but then in Disk Utility my internal drive doesn't show up.  I'm currently using windows 8.1 on the Mac without Boot Camp and because of this some of the hardware of my Mac isn't working.  <comment342637> Can you add the output of 'diskutil list' from terminal when booted from the DVD?
