Can I backup or mirror an IMAP mailbox on Mac OS X? <body> What is the easiest way to create a dump of an IMAP mailbox on a local drive using Mac OS X?   I would prefer a tool that can mirror an IMAP mailbox's structure to something that creates a massive archive file because the former would be faster and slimmer to do an incremental backup for. But any solution is welcome.  <answer194751> If you're comfortable using Unix tools, a few applications spring to mind:  ul liOfflineIMAP/li liimapsync/li liMailsync/li /ul  imapsync isn't open source but the others are.
