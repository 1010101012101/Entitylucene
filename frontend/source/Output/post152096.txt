Determine if file or directory is encrypted? <body> I have FileVault enabled, so my home directory is encrypted. However, programs and libraries often use directories outside of code/home/code; and Disk Utility allows us to create encrypted files and directories at arbitrary locations.  How can I tell if a file or directory is encrypted? Does Finder or a command line tool offer something?  <answer152220> If you're using FileVault 2 (OS X Lion and newer), the entire boot partition will be encrypted, which includes your home folder as well as Applications.  I ran the following command and part of the output shows I am using an encrypted, unlocked volume:  precodeashley@sidekick-4:~$ sudo diskutil list /dev/disk0    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *251.0 GB   disk0    1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1    2:          Apple_CoreStorage                         250.1 GB   disk0s2    3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s3 /dev/disk1    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:                  Apple_HFS Macintosh HD           *249.8 GB   disk1                                  Logical Volume on disk0s2                                  2DDC5CBD-1B65-403E-9D4F-9424BC764433                                  Unlocked Encrypted /dev/disk3    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *2.0 TB     disk3    1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk3s1    2:                  Apple_HFS Time Machine Backups    2.0 TB     disk3s2 ashley@sidekick-4:~$ /code/pre  <answer152454> Since Lion OS X uses full disk encryption for filevault2. Therefore it creates corestorage volumes on your disk and overwrites the entire contents with encrypted data. This encryption process takes a while, depending on your system speed. Only after that your disk is "secure".  You can see the partition's encryption status either in the System Preferences  Security &amp; Privacy  Filevault. Or use the codediskutil corestorage list/code command in Terminal. Look for the fields codeConversion Status/code and codeFully Secure/code. I had cases when the encryption was not successful but received no error message.  pre     diskutil corestorage list     CoreStorage logical volume groups (1 found)     |     +-- Logical Volume Group XXX         =========================================================         Name:         10.8         Status:       Online         Size:         669162500096 B (669.2 GB)         Free Space:   16777216 B (16.8 MB)         |         +- Logical Volume Family XXX             ----------------------------------------------------------             Encryption Status:       Unlocked             Encryption Type:         AES-XTS             bConversion Status:       Complete/b             Conversion Direction:    -none-             Has Encrypted Extents:   Yes             bFully Secure:            Yes/b             Passphrase Required:     Yes             |             +- Logical Volume XXX                 ---------------------------------------------------                 Disk:               disk1                 Status:             Online                 Size (Total):       668826951680 B (668.8 GB)                 Size (Converted):   -none-                 Revertible:         Yes (unlock and decryption required)                 LV Name:            XXX                 Volume Name:        XXX                 Content Hint:       Apple_HFS /pre  <comment179113> What's your operating system? <comment179204> @Harv - I'm running OS X 10.8.5. But the question is more general. In the general case, I might do this from a shell script during an audit. And I'm interested in an Apple solution, and not arbitrary tools like Truecrypt (my bad, I should have stated that). <comment179207> Thanks @Harv. Is there anything more granular than a volume? I'm interested in seeing if `/tmp` or `/opt` are encrypted. <comment179227> @jww well, if the system is using OS X Lion or greater, and FileVault is enabled, the entire boot volume will be encrypted.  From terminal: $ diskutil info /dev/disk1 (for me that's my boot volume -- use diskutil list to see your volumes) shows lots of information about it.  At the bottom, you'll see info about whether it's a Core Storage Logical Volume, and whether that volume is encrypted. <comment179228> @jww and, if they're using FileVault 1 (older than OS X Lion), then it's only the home folder that's encrypted.  The boot volume is "normal" with a sparsebundle for the users' home.  That gets unpacked on boot, so that when the user enters their password the sparsebundle opens and they have access to their files.
