Triggering an Automator script upon text selection <body> Is it possible to trigger an Automator script upon text selection on Mac OS X? I.e. if I select some text in any application (e.g. Safari, Eclipse, etc.), it should trigger an Automator script.  I'm open to suggestions using other languages / automation programs.  <answer164426> If the applications are scriptable like safari is, then you can possibly have a Applescript application running and checking if there is a selection. Then respond by running you task or calling the Automator workflow when there is.   Afaik Applications do not send out notifications when text is selected so this would have to work using a periodic check. Which means wthere ould be a delay in when you Applescript Application reacts  Example of Applescript App. (save as Application with stay open checked)  precode    property oldSelectedText : ""   on idle     try         tell application "Safari"              set selectedText to (do JavaScript "(''+getSelection())" in document 1)             if selectedText is not "" then                 if oldSelectedText is not equal to selectedText then                      (* DO STUFF*)                      set oldSelectedText to selectedText                     display notification with title "Safari Selection" subtitle selectedText                  end if             end if         end tell      end try      return 5 -- seconds idle before next check end idle /code/pre  <comment192907> Thanks. Any idea how the application [PopClip](http://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/39470/popclip) displays a popover menu whenever some text is selected in any application? Period check? <comment192908> Sorry not a clue and Im afraid it is not an app I would install on my Machines to try and find out.
