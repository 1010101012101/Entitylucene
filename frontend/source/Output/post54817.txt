Hold Terminal open <body> Sometimes I'm working on something in the terminal, and then go away. When I come back, I want to resume what I was working on, but sometimes I forget, and hit kbdcommand/kbd-kbdQ/kbd, which closes all the terminal windows automatically, no questions asked.  Is there a command that can "hold" a Terminal tab so that I don't accidentally close what I was doing?  As an example, what I want can be hackishly accomplished by running codesleep LARGE_NUMBER/code in the tab I want to keep open.  Then if I accidentally hit kbdcommand/kbd-kbdQ/kbd, it won't close directly, and rather present me with the following, which gives me an opportunity to cancel and resume what I was doing:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/aN6HQ.png" alt=""  <answer54819> There's an option to show a dialog before closing any tab in the preferences:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/AMHIj.png" alt="enter image description here"  Translating the screenshot to english is left as an exercise to the reader.  <answer54820> This can be solved by running codecat/code, which will make it wait for input forever.  For faster usage, an alias can be defined in code~/.bashrc/code:  precodealias h="cat" /code/pre  <comment62829> Right, but most of the time I don't want it to ask... Although I guess this could work for some. <comment62830> @patrix , you are my hero :)  Not all answers have to be so serious. <comment62831> @houbysoft, this is probably your best approach. A gentle confirmation dialog isn't that bad given your propensity toward command-q. <comment62832> @houbysoft you can't have it both ways, either you get asked every time or not at all. Remembering to run `cat` in another tab in cases you don't to accidentally close is even more cumbersome. <comment62834> @patrix I'm tempted to revert the answer so the website isn't quite so monoglot and humourless. <comment62837> Runnin `top` should also work. <comment62852> @patrix: not in my case. It's basically just so I can mark a tab as non-closable when I put the computer to sleep and expect to resume work in an hour or more (so I'd have to do it like once per day max). <comment62870> You can have more than one settings profile ("Basic" is a settings profile), and you can change the profile of an existing terminal. So, make a copy of your default profile, change this setting to “Always”, and whenever you want to “mark” a terminal to prompt you, open the Inspector and change to the “always prompt” profile. (Shell  Show Inspector) <comment62951> :-) I changed it back due to popular demand...
