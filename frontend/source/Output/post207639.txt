How to change the GPT partition type of an EFI partition? <body> I have a perplexing problem with the EFI partition on my boot SSD. The GPT partition type is "Microsoft Basic Data". On all other drives in my system, including my Carbon Copy Cloner clone of my boot drive, the partition type is "EFI" (see below):  precode$ diskutil list /dev/disk0    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *512.1 GB   disk0    1:       Microsoft Basic Data EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1    2:                  Apple_HFS Tims Boot SSD           498.7 GB   disk0s2 /dev/disk1    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *960.2 GB   disk1    1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk1s1    2:                  Apple_HFS Users                   959.9 GB   disk1s2  ...  /dev/disk4    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *512.1 GB   disk4    1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk4s1    2:                  Apple_HFS Tims Boot SSD Clone     511.8 GB   disk4s2 /code/pre  My system boots just fine, but it appears to be loading the bootloader (Clover in this case) from the /Users drive (disk1) instead of from the boot SSD (disk0), and I think the incorrect GPT partition type is to blame.  I tried to update the partition type using the "asr adjust" command as outlined at https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/58705/mac-os-x-partition-type-problem, but it doesn't work and gives me a very unhelpful error message:  precode$ sudo asr adjust --target /dev/disk0s1 --settype EFI asr: Volume adjustment failed: Unknown error: -123 /code/pre  I have found information about other possible ways to set the GPT partition type through Google searches, but all the other methods seem risky, with warnings about erasing the partition in question, etc.  Does anyone know how I can fix this?  <answer207943> I recreated your problem using a 4 GB flash drive. Below is the output from the command codediskutil list /dev/disk1/code.  precode/dev/disk1    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *4.0 GB     disk1    1:       Microsoft Basic Data EFI                     209.7 MB   disk1s1    2:                  Apple_HFS Tims Boot SSD           3.7 GB     disk1s2 /code/pre  Below is the output from the command codesudo gpt -r show /dev/disk1/code  precode    start     size  index  contents         0        1         PMBR         1        1         Pri GPT header         2       32         Pri GPT table        34        6                 40   409600      1  GPT part - EBD0A0A2-B9E5-4433-87C0-68B6B72699C7    409640  7220264      2  GPT part - 48465300-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC   7629904   262150            7892054       32         Sec GPT table   7892086        1         Sec GPT header /code/pre  The problem is the partition type GUID for the EFI partition is codeEBD0A0A2-B9E5-4433-87C0-68B6B72699C7/code and it should be codeC12A7328-F81F-11D2-BA4B-00A0C93EC93B/code.  To correct this, I entered the following commands. In your case, you would substitute codedisk0/code for codedisk1/code. You should enter these commands from the strongbootable USB backup clone of your boot drive/strong.  precodediskutil unmountdisk /dev/disk1 sudo gpt remove -i 1 /dev/disk1 diskutil unmountdisk /dev/disk1 sudo gpt add -i 1 -b 40 -s 409600 -t C12A7328-F81F-11D2-BA4B-00A0C93EC93B /dev/disk1 /code/pre  Before entering type above commands, make sure your codestart/code and codesize/code entries are 40 and 409600, respectively. If not, make the appropriate corrections to the code-b/code and code-s/code options.  <comment250522> Have you booted from another HD (or Recovery HD) and tried the `asr` command? <comment250694> Yes, I have a bootable USB backup clone of my boot drive. I booted from it and got the same error when I tried the asr command. <comment251126> That did the trick - thank you! I wonder how the partition type got set wrong in the first place? <comment357912> `macerror -123  Mac OS error -123 (wrgVolTypErr): Wrong volume type error [operation not supported for MFS]`
