Disappearing Open Directory Configuration <body> MacOS X Server App: 5.0.4 MacOS X 10.10.5 16GB Memory 3GHz i7 Mac Mini  This is a closed network. All systems are not connected to the internet. Xsan environment.  Server was working fine till certificate expired. I had renew my certificate online. After that I can't create new user account, bind workstation to OD. Whenever I tried to create a new user or bind a workstation. The OD and Xsan configuration will disappeared and all users will have permission and login errors.  Services running on each server. OD1: DNS, Profile Manager, OD replica, Xsan secondary controller. MDC1: OD Master, Xsan primary Controller.  I had tried fixing the OD using:  sudo launchctl unload /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/org.openldap.slapd.plist sudo /usr/libexec/slapd -Tt sudo db_recover -cv -h /var/db/openldap/openldap-data/ sudo db_recover -cv -h /var/db/openldap/authdata/ sudo /usr/libexec/slapd -Tt sudo launchctl load /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/org.openldap.slapd.plist  ~This will work temporary.~  Thank you.   <comment335025> Any steps to fix this permanently or to create a network account using command line? <comment348644> We're having the same issue here. It's looking like it's related to the Certificate for OpenDirectory but we're still troubleshooting and looking for a long term fix.
