What is "private browsing" used for? <body> What is it when you are in "private" from the home screen?   What does private browsing do for me and what are the pros and cons in using it?  <answer207713>    Private Browsing protects your private information and blocks some websites from tracking your behavior. Safari won't remember the pages you visit, your search history, or your AutoFill information.   supSource: https://support.apple.com/kb/HT203036/sup
