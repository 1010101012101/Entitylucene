Can I sync non Amazon books from the iPad Kindle app to a PC? <body> I downloaded a mobi book directly to my iPad to the Kindle app, which does not sync with Amazon.  I read the post "Syncing non-Amazon purchased eBooks between Kindle, iPad, and iPhone 3"  (on: Syncing non-Amazon purchased eBooks between Kindle, iPad, and iPhone)  which mentions a "Send to Kindle for Mac" you can download on your mac.  I have two problems using the advice above:   ol liThe book is on my ipad, not my computer, and there doesn't seem to be a "Send to Kindle for iPad" app, and /li liI don't have a Mac, I have a PC./li /ol  What do I need to get the book off the iPad and on to the PC?  <comment225609> There might be an answer on http://ebooks.stackexchange.com or if not I think that is a better site as this is more to do with Kindle infrastructure than OS X <comment295818> I'm voting to close this question as off-topic because this is about the Amazon infrastructure rather than Apple hardware
