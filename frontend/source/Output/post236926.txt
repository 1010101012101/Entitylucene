How to quit "Force Quit Applications" using AppleScript? <body> I've been learning lots of different programming languages when I came across AppleScript. Since I'm technically new to it, this question may seem dumb.brbrI need an AppleScript script to quit the "Force Quit Applications" app.brbr The following code doesn't work:     tell application "Force Quit Applications" to quitbr   Probably it's because the process has a different name. What is the "Force Quit Applications" process name? Many thanks in advance.  <answer236930> You can use this Apple Script to close this window:  precodetell application "System Events"     key code 53 using {command down, option down} -- ESC + ALT + CMD     keystroke "w" using command down end tell /code/pre  This window is owned by codeloginwindow/code process and it's not that easy to interact with it. Here's the code to press codeForce Quit/code button on this window:  precodetell application "System Events" to tell process "loginwindow"     click button 1 of window 1  end tell /code/pre  However this does not work:  precodetell application "System Events" to tell process "loginwindow"     close window 1 end tell /code/pre  <comment290073> Good answer, just makes me sad there's no way to do this without GUI scripting. Oh well. One day.
