How to delete all photos from iPhone using mac or pc <body> I'd like to delete all of the photos and videos from my iPhone 5S. I am willing to use [free] software on a mac or PC. Image Capture on a Mac does not have a delete option, before or after import. I imported all of the images and it did not offer any way to delete them from the iPhone. And, the instructions at https://discussions.apple.com/thread/3075727?tstart=0 do not work for me since there is no delete icon visible.  On the PC side, the windows explorer delete function gives an error when I try to delete.  Is there an iPhone setting I need to change in order to make them deletable? Does this have to do with iCloud at all?  <answer245341> I found out that if you disable iCloud photo syncing, then Image Capture will allow you to delete your photos.  Go to Settings  iCloud  Photos and turn off "iCloud Photo Library". Then, close image capture, disconnect your iPhone from your Mac, and reconnect the iPhone. Then Image Capture will show the delete icon.
