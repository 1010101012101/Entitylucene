How do I delete a file from my desktop using keyboard <body> I have tons of file on my desktop. I am using latest macbook pro.  After selecting the file using mouse I hit delete and then "command and delete" and none of them work.  So finally I hit ctrl + mouse click and then I chose "Move to trash".  Is there a way to delete the file using only keyboard?  <answer16043> kbdcommand/kbd+kbddelete/kbd works just fine. Highlight the file (single click or use your keyboard to select it), then hold kbdcommand/kbd and without releasing it, push kbddelete/kbd. This moves the file or folder to the trash.  Note that kbddelete/kbd is in the same place as kbdBackspace/kbd on a Windows keyboard.  <answer199075> The emfull/em procedure to delete a file from the desktop, without the mouse, that should work almost anywhere in OS X, includes the following.    kbdCommand/kbd-kbdTab/kbd to switch applications until the Finder is the active application.  If any Finder windows are currently open, press kbdCommand/kbd-kbdShift/kbd-kbdD/kbd to open a new window containing the Desktop folder, strongor/strong kbdOption/kbd-kbdCommand/kbd-kbdW/kbd to close all active Finder windows and make the Finder's desktop active;  To highlight the icon, type the first few letters of the icon's name, or press the arrow keys until it is selected (highlighted);  kbdCommand/kbd-kbdDelete/kbd to send the icon to the trash;  Optionally, kbdCommand/kbd-kbdShift/kbd-kbdDelete/kbd to empty the trash.  Learning the keyboard shortcuts takes time, but many of the steps in the Finder can become natural, almost "automatic" with enough practice.  (This answer gives the key names in U.S. English.  The kbdCommand/kbd key is also labeled kbd⌘/kbd; The kbdOption/kbd key is also labeled kbd⌥/kbd; The kbdShift/kbd key is also labeled kbd⇧/kbd; and as mentioned by emStyfle/em, the "kbddelete/kbd" key is called "kbdBackspace/kbd" on other operating systems.)  <answer264554> highlight, then SHIFT + DELETE; click ok  <comment17501> A variety of other OS X apps also require Cmd-Delete instead of simply Delete, mimicking the Finder. <comment17523> how did you make the command, delete and backspace show up as buttons? <comment17524> kbdkeyname/kbd <comment17531> Also, is there a way to *delete* a file, instead of only moving it to the trash bin? I mean, other than "rm" at the prompt? <comment18407> Did the answer solve your problem? If yes you can mark it as accepted; if no can you provide more information? <comment238436> To select the icon of the file -- if no windows are active (or they are all closed -- you can start typing the icon's name. <comment238440> @lpacheco -- No, the Finder does not provide the ability to do this directly.  You can press the keyboard commands to send to Trash and immediately empty the trash, or check out this question and answer (http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/43577/can-finder-delete-a-file-directly-and-bypass-moving-it-to-the-trash) for other ways to extend Finder to be able to do this. <comment270113> This so confusing with irrelevant information. <comment331568> How do you highlight with the keyboard only?
