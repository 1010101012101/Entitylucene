What does it mean when a process is surrounded by parens in `ps`? <body> I sometimes try to codekill -9/code codeFinder.app/code when it's misbehaving and I'm in a Terminal. This normally works but every once in awhile it leaves behind the pid, even when run with codesudo/code, and the codeCOMMAND/code portion of the output changes to code(Finder)/code.  Interestingly enough, this process only appears in the output of codeps/code, not in codeActivity Monitor.app/code. No idea how to explain that.  At that point, I'm in for a reboot given my current knowledge, but I don't understand why. Can anyone explain what's happening and maybe how I can restart Finder without rebooting?  Thanks in advance!  strongEDIT/strong: I will note that once I'm in this state, I can usually attempt to go through the regular ⌘⌥⎋ method and codeFinder.app/code will be there. Once I've force quit it though, the name disappears forever from the codeForce Quit/code dialog and the zombie pid sticks around anyway.  I'll also note that codeFinder.app/code is treated specially in that dialog, where the button text turns from codeForce Quit/code to codeRelaunch/code, so perhaps that shows that OS X treats killing the Finder as special?  <answer87020> When you see a process in parentheses/brackets it means that codeps/code could not determine its command (which appear in the codeCMD/code column). This might explain why you don't see it in the Activity Monitor.  You can restart Finder also outside a shell. Just click on the Apple symbol in the top left corner of the MacOS task bar, click on codeForce Quit/code and select codeFinder/code (usually at the bottom)  Generally, I find codetop/code more convenient than codeps/code, but I think both should work equally fine.  <comment100671> My mental model for what `Force Quit` maps to is a `kill -9`. Is that not the case? Why would `Force Quit` be more likely to succeed than `sudo kill -9 $pid_of_finder.app`? <comment101993> Apparently, [Force Quit is equivalent to `kill -15` (`SIGTERM`)](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/53744/what-does-force-quit-do-in-os-x).
