Base64 strings in URL <body> I'm having a problem with Base64 strings in URLs in El Capitan.  I'm sending notifications from a web platform to its users. Those emails are strongplain text/strong and contain links to messages.  I have tried the following links  http://localhost#VGhpcyBpcyBhIGJvcmluZyBleGFtcGxlIHRlc3Qu  http://localhost?e=VGhpcyBpcyBhIGJvcmluZyBleGFtcGxlIHRlc3Qu  However when someone clicks on a link in Apple Mail then Safari opens the links with the Base64 code converted to lowercase. I don't get why this is happening. It seams like a big bug to me. Has anyone found an easy workouround?  The only solution I found so far was to use Base32 but that just increases the length of the URLs. Another possible might be to use HTML emails but that would mean quite a bit of extra work which I'd like to avoid.  <answer216443> You should explicitly put a slash "/" after the host name, ie   http://localhost/?e=VGhpcyBpcyBhIGJvcmluZyBleGFtcGxlIHRlc3Qu  Without the trailing / character after localhost, Mail treats the entire url as a hostname, which is case-insensitive.   <comment261549> Isn't the ? only valid after a page?  That is, without a "/", Mail treats it all as the host name which is case-insensitive. <comment261552> Thanks @Kent. You found the solution very fast :-) <comment261556> Maybe you could mention that this works as well: http://localhost/#VGhpcyBpcyBhIGJvcmluZyBleGFtcGxlIHRlc3Qu <comment261560> Fixed my answer. I wasn't sure if it would work without the filename; but good to know.
