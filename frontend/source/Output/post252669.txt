Error creating bootable installation media for El Capitan <body> I tried the following:  precode$ sudo /Users/thomas/Downloads/Install\ OS\ X\ El\ Capitan.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/ElCapInstall --applicationpath /Users/thomas/Downloads/Install\ OS\ X\ El\ Capitan.app --nointeraction Password: Erasing Disk: 0%... 10%... 20%... 30%...100%... Copying installer files to disk... Copy complete. Making disk bootable... Couldn't mount dmg /Volumes/Install OS X El Capitan/Install OS X El Capitan.app/Contents/SharedSupport/InstallESD.dmg (error code 112)Mount of outer dmg failed. Done. /code/pre  What is this error message telling me? Any hints?  emI guessed that the downloaded package might have been corrupt and tried to download again. But currently it seems not to be possible to download OS X El Capitan from the App Store (pressing the Get button has no effect, progress indicator displayed forever)./em  <comment314388> Please verify the checksum with `openssl -sha1 /Users/thomas/Downloads/Install\ OS\ X\ El\ Capitan.app/Contents/SharedSupport/InstallESD.dmg`. If you have downloaded the latest installer (10.11.6) it should be: 7739e3f62080000da5d28efa689c53976112a262. <comment314392> Yes, checksum is correct. <comment314394> What I have observed is that surprisingly the BaseSystem.dmg file is missing in the InstallESD.dmg according to the description here: [link](http://www.file-extensions.org/article/create-os-x-el-capitan-usb-bootable-drive). Is this description outdated? <comment314395> It's not missing, but invisible... in the root of the volume (with some other files) <comment314398> Right, my fault. Thanks! Will try to follow this description... <comment314412> I have tried [this](http://www.insanelymac.com/forum/topic/308688-anyway-to-create-bootable-usbdvd-with-installesddmg-el-capitan/) now and it finally worked with the same installer package.
