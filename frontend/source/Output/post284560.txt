Joined mac: user cannot login anymore after lock/sleep <body> I suspect the problem is caused by the vpn software. I have a mac joined to a domain, everything works fine until the mac goes to sleep and you cannot enter anymore: a force shutdown is necessary.  I suspect the case is like this:  1) the computer goes to sleep (or you lock the screen)  2) the vpn dies (forticlient software)  3) the mac thinks it's still connected but nothing can be resolved cause the default gateway has been set by the vpn which is in zombie mode.  4) it tries to resolve the domain server forever and never fallback to the locally stored password  5) you have to reboot cause there is no CTRL+ALT+F1 to kill the vpn client and go on  Does my diagnostics make any sense ?  Is there a fine tuning of the domain settings which let the mac switch to local if the domain is not reachable for i.e. longer than 10 secs ?
