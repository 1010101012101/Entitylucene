Search files across folders and move recursively to new folder <body> I need a way to search from a base folder, all the folders inside of that one recursively, and find all photos of codeJPG/code and codePNG/code that were created before a certain date (01.Feb.2013) and then move them to a particular folder.  How would I go about this?  <answer104206> You could use codefind/code:  precodetouch -t 201302010000 /tmp/a find ~/directory \( -iname \*.jpg -o -iname \*.png \) -Bnewer /tmp/a \     -exec mv {} ~/directory2 \; /code/pre  codetouch -t/code normally changes only the modification and access times, but it also changes the creation time if the target time is before the original creation time or when you are creating a new file.  code-Bnewer/code (for birth time / creation time) is not supported by GNU/Linux platforms which don't have metadata for the creation time.  The parentheses are needed because code-a/code (and concatenating expressions without code-a/code) has higher precedence than code-o/code.  <comment122759> Thank you very much. I had an answer, but I couldn't see how to string it together. This is better and succinct. I like it. Thank you very much for the explanation too! <comment122767> Very clever, as always.
