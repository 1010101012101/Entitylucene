1920 x 1200 resolution monitor with VGA not detected by Mac OS X 10.7.2 <body> I recently got a Dell 2412m monitor with a screen resolution of 1920 x 1200.  But in system preferences it only shows 1920 x 1080.  I had it connected, beautifully, to my spare linux machine, so that's not the issue.  How can I get the correct resolution on my display?  Specs: Dell 2412m Mac OS X 10.7.2 Connecting with MiniDisplay Port to VGA  <answer99750> For whoever still has the same problem, just unplug and plug again the minidisplay adaptor into your Mac.  I had the same problem with a smaller Dell and that does the job.

MacBook Pro with Retina display (Late 2012) not outputting anything above 1080p  Select the monitor in System Preferences:  System Preferences - Displays - Monitor(not Built-in Display) - Display Tab - Resolution   Change from 'Best for Display' to 'Scaled' whilst holding the 'alt' key, more resolutions will be listed for you to select,   As noted in the comments, you have to start in the default mode 'Best for Display', and move into 'Scaled' whilst holding the alt/option âŽ‡ key, not the other way round  <answer226038> OK, I know you guys down voted paolap, emhowever/em, for whatever reason, that worked for me.  When I connect by 1440 x 900 monitor to my macbook pro, it tends to default to a 800 x 600 resolution, and I am not able to change it (or at least change it to what I wanted, even with the use of the alt key).  It seems that somehow the order and timing of how things are plugged in and turned on can "magically" cause it to occasionally (1/5 times) default to the correct resolution.  My theory is that somewhere, the monitor tries to tell the computer the correct resolution, but if the computer already decides to send a 800 x 600 signal, the monitor just decides to go with it.  So somehow unplugging and replugging can sometimes make the computer realize what the correct resolution should be. Edit: I eventually switched to using DVI for the monitor and haven't had a problem since.  <answer258311> Change the different VGA cable, I know this sounds silly but it worked for me  <answer295242> If you go to display settings - Display. And hold 'option'-key before clicking scaled, you will get all the resolutions that are otherwise hidden.   <comment117361> The issue is not that it is not connecting. It is that the correct resolution is not displaying. Your answer does not resolve that issue at all. <comment233610> Alt Key secret works. <comment292476> If you already have "scaled" selected, then you'll want to click back to "default" then hold down alt as you click on scaled. <comment322940> Please elaborate your answer. <comment327485> Also try SwitchResX http://www.madrau.com, or similar, it's not free, but you get 10 days to trial it and see if it works for you.
