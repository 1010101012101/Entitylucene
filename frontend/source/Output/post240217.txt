How to delete Macbook from Find My iPhone without erasing data? <body> I have an iCloud account and there are my phone and a macbook which not belongs to me. I removed it from Apple ID and settings in iCloud, but it is still in Find my iPhone. I only able to erase this macbook. Is there a way to just deatache it from my account without erasing data?  <answer240220> In emFind iPhone/em you should be able to tap on the device you want to remove. That will take you to the screen where you see the codeErase/code option.   At the top-right of that screen is the option to codeRemove/code that device (see my iPad screenshot below).   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8sc3u.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  If the codeRemove/code option doesn't appear immediately, give it a few minutes to show up. After tapping codeRemove/code you'll get a confirmation dialog box. Once you tap emAgree/em the device will be removed.
