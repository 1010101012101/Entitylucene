com.apple.WebKit.Networking continually asking to sign using "privateKey" <body> Title sums it up, pretty frequently, once an hour or so at work I get a pop up asking me to "always allow" "deny", or "allow" WebKit to sign using my private keychain. At this point I've answered it pretty much all ways and it keeps coming up.  Some information that may be relevant:  ul liI'm not logged in as an administrator, but a normal privileged user/li liHappens most frequently when I log in/li liI have to use an invalid certificate to access a certain website for work. The pop up doesn't seem correlated with that website though /li liI'm on the beta release track of MacOS/li /ul  Any ideas on how to make it stop? Comments about what more information I could provide would be welcome as well.  <answer290407> I've had the same issue. After some searching I simply started Safari while holding down the "Option" key. This seems to reset some stuff. This is when the issue disappeared. Even when starting Safari without the option key. Maybe it will help you as well.  (it now only asks me when the site which is using the private key is being opened, which is logical)  <answer296017> I had the same issue with my company SSO certificate, it's a known issue in MacOS Sierra 10.12  Temporary workaround available:  Open Keychain Access.
