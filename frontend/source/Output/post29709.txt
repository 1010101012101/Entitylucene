Mail autocomplete is different for search and compose <body> It annoys me that Mail “To” field autocomplete doesn't match that of the search bar.  When I start typing name of a person strongI've had conversation with/strong in the search bar, I can see their full name along with the address. Clearly, Mail knows about them.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/D2R8V.png" alt="Mail search bar autocomplete"  When I hit Compose and start typing in “To” field, I see a tiny loading wheel image appearing on the right for a fraction of second—and then, nothing, no autocomplete, no suggestions.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/63lrL.png" alt="Mail compose autocomplete"  The search field looks among all the people you've ever talked to  but the compose form strongonly offers your address book contacts/strong.  Can I change it to work the same way as Search bar, or do I have to add each person in my address book to have them in autocomplete?  I'm using Gmail.  <answer29716> The difference in autocomplete stems from the fact there is no “Mail knows about”. The lookup happens on two different sets of data:  ul liAutocomplete in search happens on the strongSpotlight index of all received and sent mails/strong in Mail.app’s database (since version 2 of Mail.app)./li liAutocomplete on compose happens on Mail.app’s potential recipients list, which is a compound of strongcontacts with an email address in Addressbook/strong and stronga list of previous recipients stored by Mail.app/strong (a list you can see and edit under emWindow » Previous Recipients/em)./li /ul  Notice the difference: search knows about people you have only received mail from, compose does not. Hence different autocomplete results.
