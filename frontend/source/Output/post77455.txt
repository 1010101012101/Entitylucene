Can't shuffle playlists and then sync that shuffled playlist to my iPod <body> Can't shuffle playlists and then sync that shuffled playlist to my iPod. I was able to do this in the previous versions of itunes just by clicking a button. That button is not there anymore. How can I shuffle specific playlists and have that shuffled list transfer to my iPod in the shuffled order?  <answer79448> I'm having the same problem and I've looked at other websites and it seems that no one can a figure out a way to do it. I think the only option we have is to write to Apple and ask that they bring the feature back.   http://apple.com/feedback/  I already did that and I hope you will too.
