Change my shell to a different bash version at /usr/local/bin/bash? <body> How can I set my code/usr/local/bin/bash/code (which is the 4.2 version that allows auto-completion of 'cd to directory with directory name') to be my default bash for a new window instead of my regular (v3.2.48) version.  I can type code/usr/local/bin/bash/code and get into it but that's not the default for a new Terminal window which is what I want.  <answer55998> I don't know if this will populate in the terminal / advanced user account locations, but "The Way This Has Worked For Years"â„¢ in Linux-land is that you must update code/etc/shells/code with the path to the shell location, and then use codechsh -s /usr/local/bin/bash username/code to use it.  Simply running codechsh/code without modification to code/etc/shells/code should cause an error indicating you've chosen an invalid shell, in case you're curious.  code/etc/shells/code is a root-owned file, so you must use sudo in tandem with an editor in order to modify it. I hope you're comfortable doing that, else I would highly advise against trying out a non-default shell :).  Summary (steps):  ul licodebrew install bash/code, then/li licodesudo vi /etc/shells/code and add code/usr/local/bin/bash/code to the list, then/li licodechsh -s /usr/local/bin/bash [your_username]/code and restart your terminal in order for your changes to take place/li /ul  <answer55999> 1) go to "System Preferences"  "Users &amp; Groups"  2) click the padlock icon and authenticate  3) right-click the icon for your user and select "Advanced Options..."  4) change the value for "Login shell" from "/bin/bash" to your preferred shell  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/SaOWs.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment64276> Is this what you seek? http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/7984/change-terminal-apps-default-shell-to-bash <comment64290> No, this is about specifying a new shell entirely (likely an updated version of the bash shell), not simply about changing to use bash. <comment64303> Oh yeah - thanks for digging up how to add a custom shell to the list of ones that are trusted by the OS. <comment230713> this didn't work for me today (3 years on) but below did so switching accept.
