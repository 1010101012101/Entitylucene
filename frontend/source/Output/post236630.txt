iMac FD 16GB 21.5 inches Retina <body> My old Mac crashed badly and I had to sell it. Had a Mac TimeMachine Backup. Bought this new iMac and it came loaded with Sys and a few apps. I want to get my old email from Time Machine back. How do I import that and put it into this Mac?  <answer236634> In Finder go to Applications â†’ Utilities, and run Migration Assistant app. It will help you restore your backed up data including email.
