Open Outlook new message window from terminal <body> I would like to open a new message Outlook window from terminal and ideally prefill the message body too.  Any ideas on how to accomplish this? Txn!  <answer74174> The first step is to change your default mail reader on your Mac:  ol liOpen Mail.app/li liChoose Mail...Preferences from the menubar/li liOn the General tab, change your Default email reader to Outlook./li /ol  Next from the terminal, use the open command with the mailto: URL.  Here is an example:  precodeopen "mailto:someone@example.com?subject=This is my subject&amp;body=This is my body" /code/pre  You can see more examples of the mailto: URL here:  http://www.rapidtables.com/web/html/mailto.htm  <answer74296> Office is moderately scriptable with AppleScript, so the command line interface to AppleScript can get the job done.  Try this (adapted from this blog post by Jim Shank), replacing the subject text, name and email as appropriate:  precodeosascript -e 'tell application "Microsoft Outlook"' -e 'set newMessage to make new outgoing message with properties {subject:"My Subject"}' -e 'make new recipient at newMessage with properties {email address:{name:"John Smith", address:"jsmith@example.com"}}' -e 'open newMessage' -e 'end tell' /code/pre  It's a bit lengthy, but it will get the job done. You could adapt this into a small script that you could call and provide parameters to more concisely (emi.e./em codesendoutlook john@example.com "My Subject" "Hi John, blah blah blah"/code) without too much work, but that's probably best left as a separate question.  <comment86461> This is an option but my default client needs to be gmail in the browser. Thanks though! <comment86462> Works perfectly! Thanks! ;-) <comment86465> You're welcome, glad it worked for you. <comment137148> is there a way to add an attachment using this method?
