Apple Watch sends texts to wrong person <body> My Apple Watch Sport recently has decided to send all messages targeted at one person to a different person. No matter how I send messages to person A (i.e. respond to their texts, send through the friends interface, etc.) they are always sent to person B. I've tried to reboot the watch and my iPhone but no success.  <comment230006> Are the two people connected at all? <comment230010> Specifically, are they on the same Apple ID? <comment230237> They have no connection to each other and have no shared Apple ID. One is using an iPhone 6 and the other a Nexus 5. They have different names, phone numbers, email addresses, etc. The only similarity is that they are the 2 people I text with the most. <comment242822> Have you tried to unpair the ï£¿ Watch and re-pair it again? <comment242823> @bjbk: yes I did <comment242824> One more question, did you try removing the friend(s) using the My Watch app on your iPhone then re-adding them? <comment242859> Do the messages show for the right contact on your phone? <comment242868> I did try removing and adding them again which did not work. I tried repairing again and it worked though! <comment267779> Did anyone find a solution as mine is doing the same :( <comment267780> Repairing the devices worked.
