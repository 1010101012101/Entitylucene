How to pass file name/references from a shell script to subsequent Automator action? <body> I would like to produce a few file names in a shell script, as part of an Automator workflow, and have the subsequent action act on the files.br I echo the file names to stdout. But this does not work: the subsequent Automator action stops with the error message "No image files were passed as input to this action" (in my case, the following action is Import Files into Photos).br I pass absolute file paths to the subsequent Automator action. Funnily enough, the Log says "Conversion from Text to Files/Folders completed", which seems to suggest to me that the text output of a shell script is interpreted and converted as a list of file references for the following action.br See the following minimal (not) working example.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/drbBG.png" alt="Automator screen shot"  Funny enough, in a different part of my workflow, I have another shell script that also outputs a list of file paths, and those files are acted upon just fine by the following Automator action. Here is the working part: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LMaIf.png" alt="Automator part that works"  I am probably doing something wrong, but I have no idea, and google didn't turn up a solution.  Any insights and hints will be highly appreciated.  <comment308437> You are submitting strings instead of files/file paths. Using e.g. `find /Users/Gabriel/Downloads -name *.mov` instead should work! <comment308439> What's the first step in your workflow? Automator already will pass the dropped files into the chain as objects, so if you remove your script step entirely, you should be "good to go" with drag+drop processing of files and folders for importing into Photos. Perhaps you really just want to grok the difference between objects in AppleScript and strings passed to stdout. <comment308445> @bmike, I guess you haven't had your coffee yet this morning? This question is involving Automator not Script Editor and AppleScript. :) <comment308446> @user3439894 thanks - amended Automator in place os ScriptEditor. Since Automator glues parts together internally using Applescript I got off on a tangent. <comment308588> @klanomath: you probably mean that my shell script does not output absolute paths. So I changed it to  echo "/private/tmp/IMG_7619c.mov" echo "/private/tmp/IMG_7638c.mov" <comment308589> @Gabriel And the result is? <comment308592> Thanks a lot to all of you for your comments. I added more details to my post (see above). Still no clue. <comment308593> Maybe it is a bug in the "Import Files into Photos" action.   I have just replaced that action by "Copy Finder Items" in my minimal example, and now it works.   So, next (different) question is: how can I import movies into Photos from Automator? (via an Applescript? how?)
