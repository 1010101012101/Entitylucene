How to reinstall OS X on an iMac which only has Ubuntu installed on it? <body> I have a 2011 iMac with only Ubuntu installed. It's not a dual-booted iMac, it only has Ubuntu installed.  How do I revert back to original OS X and remove Ubuntu? I've tried pressing various keys (kbd⌘ Command/kbd kbdR/kbd, kbdAlt/kbd, etc.) to enter the boot menu,  but so far it hasn't worked.  <answer239060> Use kbdCommand (⌘)/kbdkbdOption/kbdkbdR/kbd key sequence at startup to boot from the Internet.  Use the Disk Utility application to reset Mac to a single codeMac Os Extended (Journaled)/code partition. Make sure you are using a GUID Partition Table.  Quit Disk Utility application and choose to install OS X from the Menu bar.  Once OS X is installed, buy (for free) El Capitan (OS X 10.11) from the Apple Store. Download and install.     Note: See Startup key combinations for Mac for more information.   <answer239076> I have figure out how to solve it : simply hold the alt (option) key since the booting, and it would lead to disk options.  <comment293294> If it is actually the Mid-2011 model it needs to have had a firmware update applied at some time in the past, or it won't be able to use Internet Recovery & you'll have to find a boot USB or CD for it. See https://support.apple.com/HT201314 & links. If it is capable, it should automatically switch to Internet recovery if it can't find a Recovery volume - that it isn't doing would indicate it doesn't have the firmware update. <comment293305> This is not really helpful because there is a disconnect between your original question and the answer.  Do you have re-install media?  Do you have a recovery partition?  You should  provide this info.
