OSX Server - Messages - Jabber issue <body> My current environment is set up using AD-OD magic triangle, I have messages server set up and everything is logging on and connecting fine using Jabber. The only issue that I am having is that our usernames numerical and pretty unmemorable, what I would like is when auto buddies adds the users to the contact list the users name is shown this seems to be possible using OD and workgoup manager with the apple_imhandle attribute but obviously this is not applicable as I am using AD to authenticate.  Does anyone know of a workaround for this?  I have tried switching the view in the messages client to show full name etc but it just shows the numerical log in name not the users full name.
