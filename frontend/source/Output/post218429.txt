How to enter multiple tasks at once as batch or text import in OmniPlan? <body> I want to enter multiple tasks at once. A simple import from a text file might work. I tried copy-paste multiple lines but then they were treated all as one task.   Is there a way to enter multiple tasks in one step?  <answer219140> You need to paste the list into the list of tasks, not into the title of a single task. Make sure you've selected a task, rather than the title field of a task.  ul liThis is the title field selected. ⌘V here pastes the list into the title field of a task.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/SecKr.png" width="313"/li liThis is a task selected. ⌘V here pastes the list in as separate tasks.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GDdxh.png" width="314"/li /ul  <comment264247> Welcome to Ask Different! Which OS is running in question? Version of the app? Bonus would be to show a little research (maybe pointing to the user's guide of the app and explaining what item isn't making sense...)
