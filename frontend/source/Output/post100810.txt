By what mechanism does finder insert a space in an app's name? <body> I was researching a problem with the Notification Center and noticed that Finder shows the program as strongNotification Center/strong, yet on disk and in the package receipts and installation media, the file is actually NotificationCenter.app em(And the full path to is is /System/Library/CoreServices/NotificationCenter.app)/em  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GgUai.png" alt="Notification Center - with and without a space"  I understand how Finder drops the .app extension by default, but where does the system know to add the space in this app's name?  <answer100813> That's handled by localization.  If you check the Info.plist, there's a key LSHasLocalizedDisplayName with a value of true.  That means that there are localized names for the application.  Localizations are stored in the app bundle in Contents/Resources.  Since I'm using English, I can look in /System/Library/CoreServices/NotificationCenter.app/Contents/Resources/en.lproj/InfoPlist.strings, and see the name of the app with the space in it.  Strings files are actually binary plists.  You can view them in a human-readable fashion with  precode$ plutil -p /System/Library/CoreServices/NotificationCenter.app/Contents/Resources/en.lproj/InfoPlist.strings {   "CFBundleDisplayName" =&gt; "Notification Center"   "CFBundleName" =&gt; "Notification Center" } /code/pre  <comment118656> Not at my Mac right now so I can't confirm but wouldn't it be listed in the plist inside the bundle? <comment118658> @tubedogg I checked there - no spaces at all in any text plist file I have installed on this Mac. What's odd is the code signing also signs the name without a space (both in the .app and the final Contents/MacOS portion, so I'm guessing it's a Finder oddity at this point.) <comment118661> Since that file is stored in a binary format, might you expand on how you "see" the name there if you didn't just extract random strings from the file as I edited in above? Bonus points for a command line tool that dumps the correct localization directory for a certain locale. <comment118666> Hmmmm... Still trying to find a way to find the right directory, since dialect-specific directories make it a bit more complicated. <comment118667> That's really a separate question if we don't get a quick "next step - here's the deeper mechanism" behind localization. That it's localized is 90% of the battle here.
