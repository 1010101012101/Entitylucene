Macbook loses network connection when connecting external display <body> In the image below you can see the mtr output while connecting the screen, the red part is where the monitor is connected. The monitor works just fine and has no problems with other computers, it's just that the macbook is apparently slightly crazy.  The wireless connection appears to be working just fine, but the connection has over 80% packet loss and/or have a latency of multiple seconds when the monitor is connected. The access point is a 2013 time capsule which has no problems as far as I know.  Specs:  ul liMonitor: Dell 2007FP connected through DVI with the converter shown below/li liLaptop: Macbook Pro Retina 15" 2012/li liThunderbolt to DVI/HDMI/Displayport converter (http://www.amazon.co.uk/Mini-Displayport-Adapter-Cable-Thunderbolt/dp/B0093UCXEO)/li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/y7SWg.png" alt="mtr output"  <answer142942> I do not know what is it that you trying to do.  The HDMI cabled external monitor has nothing to do with the Network (Internet).  Also the "My Trace route" applications is bit out of date.  I would suggest to use the build in app called Network Utility to check the internet connection parameters including the trace route.  The Network Utility app is located in the code/System/Library/CoreServices/Applications/code  <answer144738> It took a while for a new mini-displayport to DVI adapter to ship, but I have a new one now and no more problems. Apparently these type of converters can cause problems with Macbooks (the entire machine was hanging at times).  So if anyone has problems when connecting something through mini-displayport, know that it might just be low quality stuff and your apple might not like it ;)  strongUPDATE/strong  Turns out that the new adapter didn't solve everything yet and it was also a hardware defect. Apple replaced pretty much all of the parts in the laptop (only component that wasn't replaced was the ssd) and after that it has been working with a lot less problems. The current wifi issues that I have are probably just related to Yosemite which appears unable to keep a stable connection for more than a few hours.   <answer233132> I was having the same issue with a Mini-Displayport to DVI adapter.  Based on some odd advice on the apple forums I tried this:  Switched DVI display from native resolution to next step lower.  Boom, internet turns back on.  Weird stuff, but posting here in case anyone else has this issue.  <answer267570> Try changing the wifi channel. Worked for me.  https://discussions.apple.com/thread/4155096?start=60&amp;tstart=0     Mine was also fixed by changing to channel 1 (D-Link router was set to   auto-select and was using channel 5).  I'm NOT using thunderbolt. My   old configuration:      -MacBook 3,1 (that's right 2007!)      -Mini-DVI to DVI to Dell2001FP (lid not closed--spanned, not mirrored)      Wifi immediately stops working with external monitor connected with   native 1600x1200 60Hz. Lowered to 1344x1008 60Hz, still does not work.   Lowered to 1280x1024 75Hz and it works.  Changed router to channel 1   and native resolution works!   <comment168378> How are you connecting the monitor ? WiFi, Airplay, Cable..others ? <comment168381> The monitors are connected through thunderbolt to dvi converters (I have 2, both have the same results) <comment168382> Was just wondering what your Network has to do with the HDMI cables, or are you getting Internet true HDMI. <comment168383> They're completely unrelated, that's why the issue is so strange... For what it's worth, the problem occurs with bluetooth tethering as well so it seems to be that OS X is just freezing some network part when the screen is connected. <comment168385> I'm aware that they _should_ be unrelated, but as you can obviously see in the screenshot. They do affect eachother. As for the Network Utility, it only shows your current traceroute. It doesn't show the results over time which make this screenshot more useful :) <comment168386> I was wondering if the MyTraceRoute is acting up and you do not have any actual problems, that could be confirmed with network utility. <comment168387> I'm only using MyTraceRoute to illustrate the problems. All websites give timeouts, Time Machine stops backing up. Airplay stops working. It really loses all network connections. <comment168390> My guess is that somehow the kernel is stalling because of the connected displays, but I'm a bit in the dark as to how to debug issues like that. <comment168397> do you have thunderbolt showing in any of your network profiles in sys pref networks? I was wondering if you have your monitor connected thru a thunderbolt bridge in the network preferences for some reason. <comment168398> use the Console and report what it does when you connect the external monitor. <comment168473> I do have a thunderbolt network adapter but it's not connected right now (can't be connected since I have 2 external screens which both require a thunderbolt connector). The only common error I get in my log is this one but that's pretty much always there (even when I don't have problems): "kernel[0]: SMC::smcReadKeyAction ERROR TC0D kSMCBadArgumentError(0x89) fKeyHashTable=0x0xffffff803043c000". Beyond that nothing usable :( <comment168476> as said, I think your airport thinks for some reason the thunderbolt is the internet bridge connection, and acts up on that. If you do not use the Amazon box does it works? <comment168478> Without the Amazon box there is no problem because the monitor isn't (and can't be, Macbooks don't have a DVI connector) connected. When connecting the screens some things seem weird as well, it really seems to be a kernel freezing thing. After having it connected for a few minutes the internet connection does come back but still dies for some time at random intervals. The system log is totally not helpful though, I'll see if dtrace can provide some insights here. <comment168480> Removing the thunderbolt bridge seems to improve it a little but the issue is still there. Although it could be simply random cause it just works intermittendly right now. <comment168782> Well... I figured some things out, apparently it's a grounding issue. If I put my finger (non-conducting materials don't work) on the connector/laptop at that spot. It works flawlessly. Let's see if I can arrange a grounding wire over here (old house, no grounding available) <comment168827> that could be it...It could be that the Amazon box is receiving to much noise so your system thinks it is WiFi :), try to ground just the box. <comment255340> I have the exact same issue. I am connecting a Dell monitor to my 2012 MacBook Pro with a mini displayport to DVI adapter. As soon as the screen is connected I can't browse the internet, remove the connection and websites load instantly. My MacBook is out of warranty so Apple probably wouldn't be interested I'm assuming. Was your MacBook in warranty? <comment255345> My laptop was luckily still in apple care, without... Not sure what you can do about it
