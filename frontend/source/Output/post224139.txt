Allow mouse to cross displays that are not touching in Arrangement <body> I have the following display arrangement: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xU4p7.png" alt="enter image description here"  The reason there is a gap between the top 2 displays is so that my mouse cursor lines up correctly (or as close as possible) when going from the top&lt;-bottom displays. Unfortunately, with this gap, this does not allow me to move the cursor between the top 2 displays. If I move the displays so they are touching, then it works fine, but my mouse cursor is then off when moving vertically.  Is there a way to keep the displays spaced, but allow the cursor to cross between?  <comment271827> As far as I'm aware it can't be done unless you match the edges in that control panel - see http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/150502/bridge-non-adjacent-monitors-in-three-monitor-setup/219496#219496 & http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/188730/how-can-i-warp-the-border-between-two-different-sized-monitors-so-the-mouse-doe/219502#219502 for a couple of different situations, with the same result <comment271972> Thank you for that. I was afraid this was the case. <comment271973> Actually, after further testing, I have found that if I move the pointer quickly, it has no problem switching displays.
