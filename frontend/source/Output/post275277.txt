How to download file under same filename? <body> I have DropBox enabled on my Mac running Sierra and I have changed my Safari download location to the Downloads folder I created in my DropBox folder.  Whenever I download a file under the same name, Safari downloads it as 'name.extension', 'name-1.extension', 'name-2.extension' etc. Is there a way how I can prevent safari from doing this? When I download a file with the same filename, it is normally because it is an updated version from stuff that I make. Since DropBox allows you to revert to the previous version, it does not matter if I accidently  write to the same name since I will be able to restore it.  <answer275279> There is no way to override that "feature" permanently.  However, there are a couple of workarounds:  h3Hold the kbdOption/kbd Key/h3  Hold down the kbdOption/kbd key when you click on the link and it will tell Safari to strongoverwrite/strong the file if it already exists.  I just tested it on Safari 10.10.3 and it works as expected.  br  h3Use Download Linked File As.../h3  You can also specify interactively if you want to overwrite the file using the emDownload Linked File As.../em option.  Click on the link while holding the kbdControl/kbd key (or right click) and you will be presented with a context  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KaNOr.png" alt="enter image description here" menu.  After the "Save File Location" dialog box, if the file exists, you will be prompted to emReplace/em or emCancel/em.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Y8gMi.png" alt="enter image description here"  br  h3Set Safari to alway ask where to save downloads/h3  This is done in Safari Preferences (kbdâŒ˜/kbdkbd,/kbd while in Safari).  With this set as emAsk for each download/em. if the file you are attempting to save already exists, you will be presented with a confirmation dialog as above.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HwzuE.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment346248> This does not work on Draw.io when I try to export the image since it is a button which I need to click on. Also, is there a way to do this automatically? <comment346257> Holding Control while you click on the button should open the "Save As dialog"  If they file exists, it will bring up a confirmation dialog <comment355736> This doesn't work where: 1. There is no file linked; 2. The download is initiated by Javascript (Gmail for example). <comment355739> @certainlyakey - Of course it won't work in those scenarios - if no file is linked how can you down load anything to begin with and Javascript initiates the download, and is not the download itself.
