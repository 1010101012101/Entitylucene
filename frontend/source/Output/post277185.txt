Mail Photos browser minimises message being composed <body> If when composing an email in Mac Mail, I open the Photos browser to add a photo, the Photos browser opens in the background. If I click on a Photos browser to drag a photo into the message, the message I am composing minimises, along with the Photos browser.  Is this meant to happen? Or is this a bug?  I have found out that if I minimise the message, then open the Photos browser I can insert an image into the minimised email, but this seems like a workaround, rather than how this feature should have been implemented.
