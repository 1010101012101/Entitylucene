Turning on LED monitor causes menu items to disappear <body> When turning on my LG LED TV, random menu items disappear (but are still accessible, it's just the icons that seem to disappear).  Here is what the menu bar looks like on the newly turned on LG TV (connected via HDMI):  img src="https://i.netcoding.net/f1d241ad.png" alt="LG TV"  Here is what my two main monitors (connected via DVI - Active Mini DisplayPort) look like:  img src="https://i.netcoding.net/1883c324.png" alt="Monitor 1"  img src="https://i.netcoding.net/8f5b2089.png" alt="Monitor 2"  When I turn the LG TV on/off, the main monitors flicker and when the LG TV is turned off, the icons return to normal on the main monitors. As well, turning the main monitors on/off does not flicker or affect the menu icons.  I am still looking for a reason why this happens, and a possible solution.
