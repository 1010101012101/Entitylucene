Pinch to Zoom on Macbook Pro 2007 <body> I have an early 2007 Macbook Pro. The trackpad isn't multitouch - it doesn't support any of Lion's new many-finger gestures - but it does support two-finger scrolling. It obviously can keep track of two points of touch, so is there any way to get it to support pinch-to-zoom as well?  <answer53256> Perhaps look at BetterTouchTool. I don't know if it will support your Mac, but if it's at all possible I would expect it to.  <answer53257> Actually it can only discern between one narrow touch moving and one wider touch. It's not tracking multiple points - just calculating the area of touch and the single general motion.  Some other questions here might help explain this better:  ul liAre non-unibody MacBook Pros capable of Lion&#39;s 3 and 4 finger multi-touch gestures?/li liMacBook multi-touch trackpad support/li liMake Solid-state scrolling trackpad behave like Multi-Touch trackpad/li /ul  No amount of software will make up for your solid state based trackpad. You might be able to get a Magic Trackpad or use an iOS device to inexpensively upgrade your hardware set and take advantage of multitouch.  <comment60886> It doesn't seem to support it... Thanks anyway, though! <comment60893> OK, thanks... I guess I'll just either buy a Magic Trackpad or use my iPod Touch.
