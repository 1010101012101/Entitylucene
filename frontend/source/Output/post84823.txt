How to force OS X Notes application to lose formatting when I paste text from clipboard? <body> While I do find Notes.app very useful, especially due to the iCloud integration with iOS counterpart apps, I am very annoyed about the text formatting used by the application.  I just want to be able to copy text from web pages and paste it as emplain text/em in this application.  Is there any way to obtain this? Maybe some Clipboard manager that can work in background, or even another application that I can use to obtain this.  While I would like to keep bold and hyperlinks, I do not want to keep any fonts or sizes when I paste the text.  Note: the solution should be transparent â€” not requiring me to use extra steps for pasting, kbd&#x2318;/kbdkbdV/kbd only.  <answer84824> You can use kbdOption/kbdkbdShift/kbdkbd&#x2318;/kbd-kbdV/kbd to paste and match the current style. This removes all previous formatting, links, etc.  If you would like to make this the default action when pressing kbd&#x2318;/kbdkbdV/kbd, open System Preferences - Keyboard - Keyboard Shortcuts, and select Application Shortcuts from the list on the left. Then, hit kbd+/kbd to make a new shortcut, select Notes.app from the dropdown list, enter codePaste and Match Style/code strongexactly/strong in the Menu Title box, then hit kbd&#x2318;/kbdkbdV/kbd with your cursor in the Keyboard Shortcut box. After hitting Add, you can flip back to Notes.app and click on the Edit menu to see that the shortcut has been reassigned.  <answer278904> I would add to MattDMo that instead of pasting  codePaste and Match Style/code, the one worked with me is codePaste and Retain Style/code. After that you need to close and open Notes app.  <comment97679> If I would be able to swap the shortcuts it would be a great solution! Thanks. <comment97685> @SorinSbarnea - I just updated my answer to show you how to do it. <comment97687> BTW, this is on Mountain Lion, not sure if the steps are different on previous versions... <comment199986> Also, you can go to `Format  Font  Remove Style` to reset formatting to default for the current note. <comment345296> This works in Sierra. Important to exactly copy `Paste and Match Style`
