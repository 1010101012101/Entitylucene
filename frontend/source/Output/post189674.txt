iMessage spam injection from known contact - possible sources? <body> I was texting with my father (a known contact!) using iMessage on my Mac. He was using his iPhone. In one of his messages to me, a strange message and link appended itself to what he was writing and the message sent itself.   I've told him to immediately change the password for his Apple ID, but I am having a hard time finding anyone else talking about this issue. Any other ideas how an iMessage spam injection could occur?  See below for screenshot. The contents of the message starting from "Here's a picture of me..." is the injected message. (And yes, I'm an idiot and clicked the damn link - it went to a dead Microsoft Azure page.)  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/20uO5.png" alt="screenshot of spam injection into iMessage from known contact"  <comment225000> Difficult to answer without knowing what he has installed, ect... Since the iOS did not report it as Spam, the sender is a part of his contacts. <comment225004> To clarify, he is the sender and I am the recipient, so not sure what you mean by how his contacts come into play (other than me being one). <comment225006> iOS has a automatic alert as Spam if messages came from contact that is not in the list. see this https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202747 <comment225013> I understand, but that scenario does not apply here - the contact who sent the spam is a known contact - my father in this case. The spam appeared in an existing (non-spam) conversation thread. <comment225014> Does he have a third-party keyboard installed on his phone? <comment225018> Than see my first comment wrt 3d party stuff. <comment225102> 3rd-party apps, just like Apple apps, can share content using text messages (as well as email, etc.) This should require user interaction, but depending on the skill level of the user, it's possible the user interaction took place. The fact that both you and the person who "sent" it saw it means that it was not sent directly to you with a spoofed from phone/email, but was actually sent from their device.
