Apple Configurator Numeric Name Assignment when you already have a number in the label? <body> I'm reading about how to name devices in Apple Configurator 1.5 with codeSupervision/code set to codeOn/code.  It states that:     Apple Configurator assigns sequential device names to devices in the order that they are connected.   The place I work at manages devices for three different companies, and each company has a number code001/code, code003/code and code009/code.    I'd like to be able to label the iPhones for the different companies based on who owns them; labeling them such that if the first phone I plug in belongs to company code009/code and it's the first phone in that company that I plug in when preparing them, it will get the name / label of code009 - 1/code where code1/code in the name / label is the next number in the sequence for just that company.  Now what I'm concerned about, is that when I use this numbering scheme, that Apple Configurator will confuse my code009 -/code label basename to think that it is the starting number in the sequence (see step 4 in the article I linked above), and I will end up with code010 -/code when I plugin the next phone.  I suppose I could start my basename with code009 - 1/code to let Apple Configurator know that this is what I intend, but I still think it could interpret the other number set erroneously and I could end up with code010 - 1/code  I'm worried because I read in codeApple Configurator Help/code under codePrepare iOS Devices/code, step 4 that:     The number range can be from 0 to 99999.  Once the number reaches 99999, the next number in the series is 1.  You can also pad the number with leading zeros to ensure that all devices have the same number of digits, such as "codeiPad 0001/code".   Does anyone with Apple Configurator experience know how this might be handled?
