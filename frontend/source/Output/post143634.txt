How to identify application of hung menu bar icon <body> My Mac sometimes ends in a state with high CPU usage for SystemUIServer. This causes poor performance and decreased battery life.  I can resolve the problem by rebooting the machine but the problem inevitably reappears after some time.  I have found out that this seems to be caused by an application that has an icon in the menu bar. I tried closing all such applications by right-clicking them and selecting their emQuit/em menu item. Now, I notice a gap in the menu line and when I hover the mouse cursor over the gap then I see the infamous emspinning beach ball of death/em.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qpkBd.png" alt="Screen shot of menu bar icons"  How do I identify the misbehaving the underlying application – i.e. its name and/or filesystem path?  I am running Mac OS X Lion version 10.7.5  <answer143637> You can use the strongAccessibility Inspector/strong, accessible from Xcode → Open Developer Tool → Accessibility Inspector. Hover over the item and the pane may show you enough information for you to determine what it is. For example, hovering the Dropbox menu bar item shows "Dropbox &lt;version" under AXHelp, and hovering Little Snitch shows "Little Snitch Agent" under AXTitle.  <answer143638> You can look in Activity Monitor's list of processes for any which are not responding. Such processes are shown in red, as below, and can be force quit or killed.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mSKhe.png" width="253"  <answer274409> Try opening a terminal window and entering killall SystemUIServer and press enter, this should reload your menu bar.  You can also try copyingcodecom.apple.systemuiserver.plist/code from code~/Library/Preferences/code to your desktop, then deleting it from the Preferences folder. This will force a new .plist to be created.   You may just want to run this handy command from terminal:  precode cp ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.systemuiserver.plist ~/Desktop/com.apple.systemuiserver.plist ; rm ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.systemuiserver.plist ; echo 'All done here. Restart your computer from the Apple Menu' /code/pre  It will reboot your computer after copying the file to the desktop and removing the specified file.   <comment169176> You have incorrectly uninstalled a app. The menu bar icon (space) is still there but not active that is why you get the spinning ball. Best solution reinstall the app and uninstall correctly. <comment169181> Check in System  Library  CoreServices  Menu Extras <comment169220> I tried this, but no processes are red (not responding). <comment169221> Great suggestion and exactly what I was looking for. Unfortunately the *Accessibility Inspector* does not update its information when hovering or clicking the hung application area in the menu bar.
