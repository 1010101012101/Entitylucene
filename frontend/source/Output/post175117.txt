What are these files in my "~/Library/Safari/" folder? <body> So, I was messing with this folder and while doing this I turned show hidden files on and saw some strange files. These are the names of them, and sizes  precode.dat8ad4.007 (733K) .dat011e.000 (704K) .dat1267.003 (402K) .dat2eb2.06d (396 Byte) /code/pre  The top files are hex files, and the last one is some weird encoded text and a link to a youtube channel. What are these files?  <comment206372> FWIW: My Safari folder does not contain files like that. Which OSX? <comment206376> Are they directly in `~/Library/Safari`? All I get is `.DS_Store`. <comment206379> Im using Yosemite, but some of the files are very old, older than 5 years. <comment206415> I suspect that you'd be fine just deleting them. <comment206416> @dougggro yeah I know, but I'm more interested as to what they are. <comment206509> Could be remnants of an old plugin or add-on for Safari that left their cruft in those hidden files.
