Creating 2 quarter-sheet sized booklet on single sheet of paper <body> I need to create/print a booklet that is 1/4 size of a sheet of 8.5" x 11" paper. From this page, How can I print a booklet from a pdf file?, I know I how to create the booklet. But this is larger than I want.  Because this is just a quarter size sheet of paper, I can print two copies of the booklet on a single sheet of paper. I need to know how to automagically make this happen; stack one on top of the other.   Is this even possible?  <answer173748> ol liUse Table settings and cells, e.g. in Word/li liUse Pages as layout program able to integrate texts generated in Word or elsewhere/li /ol  in that manner, you can easily specify the printing fields.
