Memory exhaused error in Redsn0w <body> When I tried to build a custom iOS 5.1.1 firmware (ipsw file) using redsn0w 0.9.12b1 almost in the beginning of the process I receive a message:     Custom IPSW creating failedbr   Memory Exhaused   What should I do? I tried to run redsn0w on Windows Vista and XP and and as Administrator and with no results. Always the same.  <answer53863> This is a tricky error. A couple options to try, based on successful reports from this thread and this one:  ol liRun redsn0w as administrator emand/em in Windows XP (SP2) compatibility mode. Also try other compatibility modes, such as Vista SP1./li liMove redsn0w to a place where it will have a short file location - something like codeC:/redsn0w/redsn0w.exe/code - and put the stock IPSW in that directory too./li /ol  It'd be interesting to see if those steps work. If they don't, another option is to simply use sn0wbreeze instead, which is available here: http://www.ih8sn0w.com/ - it supports building custom firmware for the same devices that redsn0w does.  <comment61644> How much memory does the computer you're running the install from have?
