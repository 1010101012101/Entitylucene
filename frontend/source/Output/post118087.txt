MacBook Air hot after sleeping <body> I am experiencing strange issue with my MacBook Air (2011, with Mavericks):  ul liI don't like to turn off my machine, so I usually just close the lid and put my laptop to backpack before I go to sleep/li liI take it off the bag in the morning at the work, do only basic work (email etc. - no suspicious things in Activity Monitor), but my MacBook Air will get to high temperatures (90â„ƒ for CPU, runs fan at 6000 RPM)./li /ul  I can 'solve' that by putting computer to sleep, wait a while (~30 sec), wake it up again and temperatures will get back to normal. I already tried resetting the SCM.  Notes:  ul liI don't keep MagSafe connected to my Macbook Air during the night/li liI usually have plenty of running apps on my laptop (4GB of RAM, but Virtual Memory usually tops 10 GB)/li liI always run 1 instance of CentOS in VirtualBox (with Oracle database)/li /ul  <answer118991> Disabling the deep sleep seemed to have fixed the issue for me.  <comment137862> The VM would be the first place I'd check.  What happens if you pause it before sleeping?  If you save state and close? <comment137869> I will try tonight and update this post. <comment137995> Unfortunatelly I was able to reproduce the same problem even with paused VM. Any other suggestions will be appreciated. <comment138146> I tried disabling deep sleep and see if that helps:  http://pocketpccentral.net/blog/2011/08/02/disable-safe-sleep-lion/
