iPhone's name changed to just 'iPhone' <body> I noticed today that the name of my iPhone had changed from "XXXX's iPhone" to just "iPhone". Nobody except me has access to my phone and I haven't changed it. One reason someone gave was resetting network settings changes the name,which btw I had done.Can someone verify this?
