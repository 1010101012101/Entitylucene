Unable to close apps from mission control, Mavericks OS X <body> Unable to close apps from mission control, Mavericks OS X.  I do not get an "X" to close, and after downloading BetterTouchTool and attempting the close window with cursor over window (which says is suppose to work in mission control) I still have no luck. After reading some reviews I am going to wait downloading Yosemite and become comfortable with Mavericks.

You use it to bring an app to the front, change Spaces, add or remove Spaces - it doesn't act directly on the apps themselves.  See Mac Basics: Use Mission Control to switch between apps or spaces
