How do I share my location on more than one iOS device? <body> To take advantage of Mac-continuity, Safari, Photos, Passbook, and Keychain sharing features, I have to use the same account on all my devices. But, location sharing is also enabled through iCloud and it only allows one device to be specified. I want to share the location of each device at the same time.  All devices are using iOS 8.1.2.  <answer165204> This is not possible using a single Apple ID. If you wish to share the location of each device specifically, you will need to use a unique Apple ID on each device.  <comment193789> Why would apple require me to use a single apple id to enable the other features but then require different apple id's to share the location of each device? These are conflicting configurations.
