Folder with nothing in it is still using up space <body> I have a folder with absolutely nothing in it.  Zero.  I made sure there was no hidden files in it, by typing "defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles YES." into my terminal.  There is nothing in the folder 100% and I've emptied my trashbin, yet it still shows this folder holding 188GBs of space.  I know I can delete the folder and get that space back, but I'm looking for the root of the issue.  Why is this happening and is this happening in other folders on my Mac El Capitan  <comment345096> in Terminal.app type `ls -al pathway` (for example `ls -al /Users/Sean/Documents/`) and put what it displays in the question. You can also use `cd pathway` to **c**hange **d**irectory and get the command prompt working in that particular directory (pathway) and then just type `ls -al`. A shift+cmd+4 then spacebar snapshot of the command+i information window for the folder in question would also help (`open ..` or `open pathway` from the Terminal to launch the window in the Finder... give the folders info window a bit to load the total size)
