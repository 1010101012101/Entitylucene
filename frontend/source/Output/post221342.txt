Logic Pro X and SymLinked Files <body> I use Logic Pro X, and it's very particular of the naming of the directories it uses.  I'm SymLinking the Gigabytes of extra content it's downloaded from external drives. HOWEVER I wanted to ask something about the naming of the directories.  I want to name the original directories located on the external as strong"folderName[Sym]"/strong so I can remember that it's being SymLinked. And then the actual SymLink on the main drive will just be strong"folderName"/strong.  Will Logic em(or any program requiring default directories)/em see just the name of the SymLink file and be ok? Or will it follow the path, see the actual file is names strong"folderName[Sym]"/strong and tell me I've done something wrong?  <comment267990> Not exactly sure what you're asking, but you can rename symlinks and aliases without renaming the original file. <comment267991> Ok, so if Logic is looking for a required directory named "Apple Loops", and I name the relocated file "Apple Loops [Sym]", will Logic still respond correctly if the SymLink of "Apple Loops [Sym]" is named "Apple Loops"? <comment268195> If you have the folder "/Volumes/ExtHD/Apple Loops (SymLinked)" linked to "/Library/AppSupport/Logic/Apple Loops", then yes, it should work.
