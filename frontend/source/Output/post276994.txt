Calculate Network usage using nettop in terminal <body> I want to calculate the network usage like some apps do(which displays codeup/code and codedown/code which changes it's values by the usage of user)  strongUsing codenettop/code:/strong  precodenettop -t wifi -t wired -P -l 1 /code/pre  But then I saw this repo in Github.  The command used there is  precodenettop -x -k state -k interface -k rx_dupe -k rx_ooo -k re-tx -k rtt_avg -k rcvsize -k tx_win -k tc_class -k tc_mgt -k cc_algo -k P -k C -k R -k W -l 1 -t wifi -t wired /code/pre  Now I'm getting different values in codebytes_in/code and codebytes_out/code for both the commands.  strongFor the first command:/strong  precodeGoogle Chrome.284     153 KiB         150 KiB /code/pre  strongFor the second command:/strong Taken from github  precodeGoogle Chrome.284     156895          152847 /code/pre  strongQ)./strong I ran codesecond command/code first and codefirst command/code second. So obviously the codefirst command/code data should be equal or greater than codesecond command/code. But it's wrong when I converted(code150*1024 = 153600/code) Why is that? Which command should I use?
