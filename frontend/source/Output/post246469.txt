Pain with using multiple monitors <body> Today I got a new 13 inch mac book pro. I have a 30 inch asus monitor which I use as a secondary display. The resolution of the monitor is higher than the macbook pro.  when I move the mouse from my secondary display (the asus monitor) to my macbook, it gets stuck. I think the mouse can only move when you are in the resolution area of the macbook.  So I have to move the mouse in the center of the screen and only then I can move it to the macbook.  This is very annoying. Is there a way I can move the mouse between two monitors without really centering it first?  <answer246494> To rearrange the position of the displays, please see Configuring Mac OS X for Multiple Displays.  <comment304074> I did it... but still the mouse gets stuck on the areas where there is no corresponding position on the other monitor. I wonder why can't the mouse move to the other screen and remain at the top? why should it block
