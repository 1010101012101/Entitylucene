"User"-folder is larger than contents <body> My "user" folder is about 56GB big, but when I look at the contents (and add them up with a calculator) I get up to about 24GB. What happened to the other 32GB? Is there a way to free this space up?  I have a hidden folder called code.rvm/code with the size of almost 3GB. My Library is almost 30GB though, can I remove something in there? It seems excessively big!  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/EglJv.png" alt="enter image description here" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mBcy1.png" alt="enter image description here"  Edit: So, these are the biggest folders in my Library. Is there a way to get some space back, or do I just have to learn to live with this? img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/JZX22.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer146781> The one place you haven't listed is your Library folder..  From the Finder menu choose codeGO/code  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2nqet.png" alt="enter image description here"  then codeGo To Folder/code  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5wQCv.png" alt="enter image description here"  precode ~/Library /code/pre  The chances are your Application Support directory has loads of stuff stashed.  <comment172916> I named my Library-folder in the question, maybe not clear enough that it's the hidden Library, not music. However, that folder is almost 30GB big with these as the biggest culprits: http://i62.tinypic.com/2mevokl.png. How do I get some of the space back? It's only a 128GB SSD :P <comment172917> Also, it's easier to get to the Library by clicking on Go and holding `alt` :) <comment172918> I have alt re-tasked so forgat that shortcut a lot <comment172919> Ah ok! But, any way to get some of the space back? <comment172920> There are apps on the app store that will help locate space hogs and help delete them. I use Disk Doctor https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/disk-doctor/id455970963?mt=12 <comment172925> Thanks, saved a whopping 1.5GB! Haha! Well, at least is something. I guess it's time to invest in a USB 3.0 stick or external HDD.
