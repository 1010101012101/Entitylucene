Calendar 8.0 reminders in GMT <body> I have Calendar set to my time zone. However, reminder popups still give the time in GMT. How can this be adjusted?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zWPAR.png" alt="Screen shot of reminder popup"  <answer195903> Try going into (Calendar) Preferences... - Advanced and turn on "Time Zone Support"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uDlpG.png" alt="Settings"  You will se a new menu item where you can change Calendar's time zone: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5eExL.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment233979> Sincere thanks! I thought I already had that set properly. But I re-did the settings and will try again.
