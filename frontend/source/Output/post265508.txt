How to Connect a Macbook Pro A1501 to an HP Z24i Monitor? <body> I was wondering if there was any software to make my Macbook compatible with my external monitor. I've got a HDMI to DisplayPort adaptor connected to an HMDI cable coming from my mac, but the mac is not detecting the monitor.  The other issue: I am in South America, so other types of connectors would be difficult to come by.  Any thoughts? I really appreciate your help. Here are my specs:  Macbook Pro A1502 with: 2 Thunderbolt ports 1 HDMI port 3 USB 3.0 ports  My monitor is the HP Z24i. It has: 1 USB 2.0 port (lame; won't work with my Mac USB 3.0) 1 DVI Port 1 DisplayPort 1.2 port  <answer265510> I have this same setup, but with an older Macbook Pro (A1278).   Simply get a mini DisplayPort to DisplayPort adapter, and use DisplayPort only. The Thunderbolt port on your Macbook Pro is ALSO a mini-display port and it is compatible with a mini-DisplayPort connector.  Here is an example from monoprice.com http://www.monoprice.com/product?p_id=6006  <comment332960> Noting that the OP says that "...other types of connectors would be difficult to come by." There is no real *software* solution for this, you do need a different adapter.
