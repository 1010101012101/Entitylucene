Itunes does not want to play this one specific video <body> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vCg2n.png" alt="https://www.evernote.com/shard/s209/sh/1767ee83-94b2-4226-940f-a7745e1792eb/c41c3785c9057214e15d1663f73e3105/res/0c4abf31-6f30-4526-8cd9-9f892b55c750/skitch.png?resizeSmall&amp;width=832"  I was watching this important wmdc. Near the end of the video I thought I'll sleep for a while. Guess what I couldn't open the video anymore. It just show blank screen. I want to delete the video and redownload but do not know how.  I've been working for this for hours and couldn't figure things out.  The video title is building concurent user interfaces on ios. It has a strange speaker account there. Also there are 2 tabs, slides, and videos. Well, if I click videos I go to firefox instead of looking at list of videos.  <comment106469> This is to clarify... There is some inconsistency in your statement "watching this important" and "I'll sleep for a while" ? Did you actually download the video/Slides or watched its online version? The Speaker Icons are the Slides titles! <comment106475> Well, it's 48 minutes. Also I managed to watch that with my windows computer. The thing is once I finished watching it I want to rewatch. Same problem occurs. It just displays that one blank screen. <comment106476> Try to find the REWIND, or if you can give me the link to check it out.
