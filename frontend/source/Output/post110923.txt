How to un-stick iOS app upgrade? <body> In the App Store app, I clicked the "UPDATE" button next to an app, and it changed to "INSTALLING" (dimmed), and the app icon on the left got a little black thermometer on the bottom, but then nothing happened.  It's not a very big app.  It just seems stuck.  How can I kick it to make it start going again?  The App Store in general isn't stuck -- I can upgrade other apps just fine.  It's just one app that got stuck.  <comment130844> Have you restarted your device? <comment131993> Undo: Yes, I did a full reboot.  Amazingly, it's still stuck.
