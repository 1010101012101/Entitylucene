Terminal not recognising commands <body> I have tried to add TextWrangler to the path environment modifying the file code.bash_profile/code. This is what I have added:  precode# Just a comment  PATH=/Applications/TextWrangler.app/Contents/MacOS export PATH /code/pre  I am not sure if it was exactly like this, but I am sure it was not so different. I must admit I do not know exactly what I was doing with the commands above, but by suggestions of other people and content on the web, I decided to add it to the .bash_profile file.  Now, when I type for example codels/code or codeopen/code or codenano/code it does not work. I have seen on the web that this has already happened to other people.   I am not able to open the .bash_profile file with TextWrangler to restore it as it was, so this is a big problem, I might say.  <answer148735> Perhaps you can modify the .bash_profile with textedit or textmate? You can download textmate from http://www.macromates.com/download. I like it a lot better than TextWrangler.  <comment175166> Thanks, with TextMate I managed to open the .bash_profile file and modify the file again, and now it's working, it seems, at least... Is it open source? <comment175168> I don't think so. I use TextMate 2.0 alpha which is free, but it looks you can purchase other versions. <comment175169> It was telling that after 30 days I had to register the product, that's why I asked... <comment175170> @cell TextMate 2 is open source and on GitHub: [textmate/textmate](https://github.com/textmate/textmate). I've been using it (the alpha) as my main editor for a while and haven't noticed any stability issues. <comment175171> @0942v8653 Thank you ;) <comment175172> Is that the only thing in .bash_profile - also what happens when you try to edit the file? (The obvious thing to do is restore .bash_profile from a backup - if no backup set up Time Machine or anther backup before doing anything else <comment175173> The only thing that was there before was the python path variable.. I managed to modify the file by using the TextMate editor, and now everything seems to work normally... <comment175175> @Mark I am sorry for my English today, but I am quite tired and I cannot even think logically... <comment175236> Here's similar question about wrong `PATH` export: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/146940/accidentally-removed-all-commands-in-terminal
