My MacBook Pro disconnects from office wifi when other people join the network <body> I recently switched offices. The new office is located downtown, so there are multiple access points, both company controlled and external.   The laptop wireless disconnects shortly after I first connect to the network in the morning. It also seems to disconnect when groups of people join the network throughout the day (like, after meetings). I do not have this problem on other networks.  The problem only occurs with Mac laptops on our network. Linux, Windows, and Android devices all seem to stay connected.   precodeOS X El Capitan (10.11.6) AirPort Extreme (0x14E4, 0x134) Firmeware Version: Broadcom BCM43xx 1.0 (7.21.95.175.1a6) WPA2 Personal RSSI: -50 dBm Noise: -90 dBm Channel: 132 (DFS) Channel width: 80 MHz /code/pre  I did use Onyx to collect information about the connection when it failed most recently.

Some days are more often than others. After reading several topics I came to the conclusion that the wireless adapter on Mac is more susceptible to network noise (when many devices are connected to a network) then it drops (sometimes it takes a while to connect). You can do one of the following approaches.  ol liGo to strongApple menu - System Preferences - Network/strong, Select Wifi and on the settings /li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gCCs5.png" alt="enter image description here"   Then   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8quoj.png" alt="enter image description here"   then Press OK and then Apply.  OR  ol start="2" liChange the router radio channel to 2.4Ghz. Make sure your WI-Fi access point is set to automatically choose the best radio channel to use - as your radio environment changes constantly and the access point needs to be able to cope with this./li liIf your Macbook Pro doesn't have Ethernet connector, you should get an Ethernet adapter to avoid the frustration./li /ol  I hope it helps.  <comment311919> Welcome to Ask Different! Your answer is somewhat fleshed out, but to avoid [linkrot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_rot), please copy the relevant information from the link into your post in addition to providing the link. <comment311977> Done!, let me know if that's fine enough <comment312079> I was literally writing a comment saying things looked better and I would be accepting this answer at the end of the day if all stayed that way. . . when the connection died. <comment312113> Unfortunately, The adapter to get connected through the wire will be the problem solver in a noisy network. I've done many things and still it will happen from time to time.
