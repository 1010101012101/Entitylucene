File ownership appears to change to logged in user <body> I'd appreciate it if anyone can shed light on this file ownership bizarreness on my server.  Googling has revealed no answers.  I have a MacMini home server.  On this machine /Pierson is a mounted FireWire drive, shared to other household machines using Mac OS X File Sharing.  The problem: everyone who can SSH into the server thinks the files and folders under the shared drive are owned by them.  I can't restrict some folders for use by particular users using Unix file permissions:  Sam thinks the folders are owned by "sam":  precode$ ssh sam@server $ id uid=10000(sam) # etc... $ ls -ld /Pierson/Movies drwxrwxr-x  6 sam  staff  204 Oct 21 20:41 /Pierson/Movies/ /code/pre  John this the files and folders are owned by "john":  precode$ ssh john@server $ id uid=10001(john) # etc... $ ls -ld /Pierson/Movies drwxrwxr-x  6 john  staff 204 Oct 21 20:41 /Pierson/Movies /code/pre  Now I expect this kind of behavior if connecting to the shared folder remotely, but having things change from under me on the server is a problem.  This machine was originally a Lion Server, later upgraded to Mavericks.  <comment141400> Did you have the same *thingy* when running Lion? <comment141420> What filesystem is the removable drive (`mount` on its own will tell you)? That could very well have a bearing on the ownership... <comment141442> @mjturner It is HFS.  Hmm interesting, mount says "noowners".  I need to research what that means: `/dev/disk1s2 on /Pierson (hfs, local, nodev, nosuid, journaled, noowners) ` <comment141444> That was is! The noowners mount option ignores all ownership on the volume.  You can disable that by doing Get Info - Sharing and Permissions - Ignore ownership on this volume (uncheck).
