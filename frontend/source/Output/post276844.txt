How do I access workspaces by number on macOS Sierra? <body> I'm running macOS Sierra 0.12.3 (16D32).  By exploding the desktop (four finger swipe up on trackpad) and then moving the mouse to the top bar I can create/update/destroy my workspaces.  With a four-finger swipe left/right or codeC-left/right/code I can move to the left and right.Also with a tool like BetterTouchTool I'm able to set shortcuts to move left/right.  I'd like to create a shortcut to access the workspaces by number. For example given the following workspaces Desktop 1-4:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YA1w6.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  I'd like to find a tool or system event where I could jump right to Desktop 3 perhaps with a keybinding like codeCmd + 3/code.  ul liDoes such a tool, or system event exist on macOS where I can access my workspaces by number instead of only moving left or right?/li /ul  <answer276848> You can access different spaces in Sierra with codecontrol + number/code keys. But first, you must enable it in the Keyboard shortcut settings:  ol liGo to Keyboard Settings (codeSystem Preferences &gt; Keyboard &gt; Shortcuts/code)/li liSelect codeMission Control/code from the left column of choices. /li liCheck these boxes: codeSwitch to Desktop 1/code, codeSwitch to Desktop 1/code/li /ol  You can now use switch between spaces using short keys.  <comment348513> Could you please edit your question to include the version of macOS you're running?
