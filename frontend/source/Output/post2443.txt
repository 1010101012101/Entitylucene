Is there console mode in Mac OS X? <body> Is there something like Linux console in Mac OS X? Like "terminal", but without running graphics environment.  <answer2447> Yes. At the login screen, login as code&gt;console/code with an admin password.  To get the user name field, open the Login Options in System Preferences and change the default login window display option:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/H6J6g.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment2108> Gotta try this. <comment2109> Never thought you could! You get my vote. <comment2110> nice one!  never thought of that <comment2115> what is admin password? I only have password to my account. <comment2116> Nice! It worked with my own password, although I had to use `console` without space after greater-than symbol. <comment2117> As @Peter said I edit @mipadi answer and omit space, if you think the space still required tell to put it again. <comment2120> +1, interesting. Additional limitations: Only works when no user is already logged in. And you obviously need to have "Name and password" (instead of "List of users") selected in Accounts - Login Options. <comment2177> Really great tip, thanks for sharing! <comment102893> In Mountain Lion at least, it seems you can do `console` without a password. <comment107714> Wow. This is interesting +1 <comment151968> Still exists in Mavericks. Use without password. <comment288682> Every time I try this it shows the console briefly then blanks the screen.
