How do I force a folder to be opened in column view in Finder? <body> I'll try to give a general example.  I have the following folder structure somewhere on my local user directory:  precodeRoot_Folder ├── Icon_Folder │   ├── file1 │   └── file6 └── Column_Folder     ├── file10     ├── file11     └── file12 /code/pre  How can I force Finder to open the codeColumn_Folder//code in column view while forcing the codeIcon_Folder//code (and other possible folders) to be viewed in icon view?  hr  Sounds trivial, yes, but here's where I have problems:  ul liI open codeIcon_Folder//code, change its view to icon view, press kbd⌘ cmd/kbd + kbdJ/kbd and tick "Always open in icon view" — presto! it works./li liThen I open codeColumn_Folder//code, change its view to column view, double–check the Finder window's title bar reads "Column_Folder", open view options again — but wait! Finder wants to change the view settings for code~/Desktop//code, not codeColumn_Folder//code!/li /ul  NB: I know it specifically wants to change Desktop's view settings because that is where the codeRoot_Folder//code is. If I move the codeRoot_Folder//code to code~//code, Finder would like to change, while in column view, the view settings for my home directory and so on…  I'd rather like to know a GUI answer, but if it is much easier via command line, it's OK by me.  All in all, the question boils down to: strongHow do I open the active folder's view settings in Finder while browsing in column view?/strong  <answer31415> h3Workaround/h3  ol liWhile in Finder (in any view) drag the codeColumn_Folder//code to the Finder's sidebar./li liSelect the codeColumn_Folder//code from the sidebar/li liSwitch to column view/li liShow view settings ul liYou can see the view settings will now affect the intended folder/li /ul/li liTick "Always open in column view"; click OK/li liRemove codeColumn_Folder//code from the sidebar/li /ol  Now codeColumn_Folder//code will open in column view!  <answer104631> Note that if a folder is not shown in the sidebar, it won't usually be the root folder of any window in column view.  Also "Always open in column view" means "save a folder-specific view mode for this folder in the code.DS_Store/code file of the parent folder". If you check "Always open in column view" and switch to list view, the folder-specific view mode becomes list view.  So if you add code~/Desktop/untitled folder//code to the sidebar, open codeuntitled folder/code, and check "Always open in column view", the folder-specific view mode is saved to code~/Desktop/.DS_Store/code. If you remove code~/Desktop/untitled folder//code from the sidebar, it will never be the root folder of a column view window. But if you open code~/Desktop/untitled folder//code in list view and close the window, the folder-specific view mode becomes list view.  <comment36959> I decided to accept this as it works, but if someone can come up with a more elegant solution, I'm willing to accept it. <comment93011> This works because Column View looks at the current folder and finds its closest ancestor in the sidebar, and chooses that folder as the leftmost column. You can force a folder to *open* in CV by checking "Always open…" and "Browse…" in the View Options. You can force it to be the *root* of CV by placing it in the sidebar.
