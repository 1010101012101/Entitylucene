iOS Mail & Gmail Account, How to flag on swipe? <body> I would like to flag/star email when swiping left. Is it possible with gmail account in iOS mail app?  <answer216627> You can only change what a right swipe does in iOS. You can change what the middle option on a left swipe is, but a full left swipe will still be delete/archive.   Check out settings - mail, contacts and calendar - swipe options.    <answer216636> Swiping left gives you three options, with the middle option being customizable.  You cannot change the left swipe to have only emone/em option, unfortunately - it is built into iOS.  The middle option of the left swipe can be set to codeFlag/code if you so choose, leaving you with a swipe-tap motion.
