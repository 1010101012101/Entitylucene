Can I show a 24-Hour clock on my Mac's Lock Screen? <body> I just got a MacBook Pro, and different from my iMac is that I'll be using the lock-screen much more on this one.  I noticed that in the upper right corner of the lock screen, the time is shown, but it is in 12-hour mode with AM/PM indicators.  I guess this is some remnant of the machine having been configured to use english language as the main language (I'm a developer, I don't want to have to fight with badly worded Norwegian translations of error messages on google).  I have configured my main user to have normal Norwegian formats for everything, but I guess that on the lock (and possibly on the logon screen as well?) screen, there is some kind of global system-wide configuration in use.  So, can I:  ol liConfigure the lock screen (or the system wide configuration) to use 24-hour clock?/li liRemove the clock altogether?/li /ol  <answer27988> Since at the login window (and the lock screen) your user is not logged in, youÂ´ll have to edit the global preferences:   precodesudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/.GlobalPreferences AppleLocale en_GB /code/pre  and:  precodesudo defaults write /var/root/Library/Preferences/.GlobalPreferences AppleLocale en_GB /code/pre  and then do a reboot. This fixed it for me (and I hope, Apple fixes that sooner or later). :-)  <comment32033> I know this is nitpicking, you can tell that I get along with my MBP if this is the kind of things I'm worried about :) But still... AM/PM indicators annoy me *(mostly because I've never taken the time [no pun intended] to learn them properly)* <comment32045> This definitely sounds like a bug (I just repro'd it on my computer).
