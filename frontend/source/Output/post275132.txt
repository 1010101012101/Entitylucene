How to change Safari http header Accept-Language? <body> I just solve this situation (needed to change the language to test my multi-language website) by installing a complement in Firefox called "Modify Headers". But the fact is I like to develop with Safari, is my personal choice.  Is there a way to do the same with Safari, to simulate a different language/location for web develop purposes?
