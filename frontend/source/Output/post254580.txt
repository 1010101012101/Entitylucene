How to ask Siri to tell me the news <body> Siri seems to be smart enough to fetch some news for me, but let's say I just want to find out the news in my country.  I asked codeTell me the news/code and the answer was: emHere's some news for 'tell me the news'/em.  I tried codeTell me the breaking news/code and the answer was: emHere's some news for 'Breaking'/em.  So, how to ask Siri about the Breaking news and news in general?  <answer254625> The News app and features for iOS 10 are only limited to the USA, UK and Austraila at the moment. http://www.apple.com/ios/feature-availability/#news  In these countries, if you were to ask Siri for example:     What's the latest in New York City   Sir would respond with a list of articles from the News app.   However, if you are outside these countries. For example, I am in Toronto, Canada and if I ask Siri a similar question:      What's the latest in Toronto   Siri first asks for confirmation to use a Twitter account to recommend more personalised results if you don't have one signed in or don't allow Siri access to Twitter. Siri will display a list of Tweets related to the location of Toronto.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vaRaq.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment316944> You could try something like “What’s the latest in San Francisco?” replacing San Francisco with your city <comment316961> @LukaKerrΔ Thanks! That fetches it from Twitter, which is not bad, but I think there should be another way to ask for *news*. <comment317054> Interesting, but then, is there a solution to get the news, but not from Twitter? <comment317256> Currently not natively in iOS 10, if you do not live in those currencies that have the News app. There maybe an app on the store that supports Siri's new API that is a news related.
