iTunes 12.3 Doesn't Play TV Shows or Movies <body> iTunes won't play my tv shows or movies anymore. I push play but nothing happens. The screen remains black. Plus iTunes asks me to authorize my computer in order to play my content, even though I already have! I already tried deauthorizing/reauthorizing, repairing my iTunes, reinstalling it, and I even tried restarting my computer but to no avail. The problem has persisted for weeks. I've found other apple customers are facing the same issue.  <comment280281> Can you link to the other users you found with the same issue? <comment280585> Good idea. How do I do that? <comment280589> `[link text](link)` and just link to whatever you found. <comment280745> I'm still having trouble. I click the share button but I do not know the specific steps from there. I can't comment because I don't have enough points. Where do I copy from, and where on another user's page do I paste? Could you please clarify, in steps? <comment280748> I'm not sure why you need to use the share button or comment. Simply copy the url and edit it into your post following the format I posted above
