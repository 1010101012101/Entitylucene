In Safari 5.1, how do I disable Top Sites and the caching of thumbnail images of Web pages? <body> There were methods for doing this in earlier versions of Safari but I don't know of one that works with 5.1.  The reason I want to do this is that it takes up a great deal of disk space, and I suspect it slows things down on my older, slower Mac running Lion because of all the extra caching going on. I never use the feature anyway.  Here is the link to an earlier question on Ask Different with regard to Safari 5.0.  How can I disable &quot;Top Sites&quot; in Safari/Webkit completely?  I am creating a new question because apparently any methods that would work for Safari 5.0 will not work for 5.1.  <answer22585> While not a clean solution and not properly preventing Safari from creating the thumbnails in the first place, this apparently works to keep them from taking up disk space:  precoderm ~/Library/Safari/WebpageIcons.db &amp;&amp; ln -s /dev/null ~/Library/Safari/WebpageIcons.db /code/pre  Incidentally, even going to strongSafari → Reset Safari/strong… and ticking strongRemove all webpage preview images/strong will apparently leave this hack intact.  As for Top Sites, there are a few places you can remove it from:  ul listrongSafari → Preferences → General → New windows open with/strong/li listrongSafari → Preferences → General → New tabs open with/strong/li listrongSafari → Preferences → Bookmarks → Bookmarks bar/strong/li /ul  I don't believe the menu item can be removed this easily.  <answer26246> TinkerTool 4.7, a free utility for system customization, has just added a new feature for Safari 5.1, "Disable storage of preview images for web pages."  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/by0uc.png" alt="TinkerTool"  <comment29988> Haven't found a specific answer, but if you're having performance issues with 5.1, try one of the [WebKit nightlies](http://nightly.webkit.org/). I've switched recently and it improved a lot a of the performance problems introduced with 5.1, and so far haven't seen any problematic bugs.
