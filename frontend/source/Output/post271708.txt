Permanent "OS X wants to access key "(null)" in your keychain" message after reboot before login <body> I have MacBook Pro 13 retina (late 2012) with ElCapitan 10.11.6.  I have installed "Security Update 2016-003 for OS X El Capitan 10.11.6" (now I know that I should not, there are a lot of issues with it).After reboot a have message box on black screen with message "OS X wants to access key "(null)" in your keychain".Pressed to "Always" or "Always Allow" or "Deny" several times. Nothing helps. I have tried to recover the OS. The issue is the same. Have found several articles with keychain issues but nothing similar.Unfortunately   I do not have Time Machine backup for this Mac. So I can't recover from it back.  strongQ: How can I gain re-gain access to my Keychain?/strong  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/11k5s.jpg" alt="enter image description here"
