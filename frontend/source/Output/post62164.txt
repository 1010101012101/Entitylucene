How do I exit python in the Mountain Lion Terminal? <body> I'm having a couple problems with basic command line stuff in the terminal of Mountain Lion.  kbdcontrol/kbd + kbdD/kbd does not exit Python as it does in Lion; instead it splits the screen.  Meanwhile, I also haven't figured out how to continue writing after having viewed the contents of a text document - the terminal doesn't allow it.  precodeHello hello hello! ex12.txt (END) /code/pre  So far, no matter what I push after this, I get a nasty little beeping sound  <answer62165> You can type codeexit()/code to exit Python.  <answer62166> As kbdControl/kbd + kbdD/kbd works for me on multiple Macs, I'll presume something is amiss with your installation, keyboard or keyboard handler. (Your difficulty with the pager also lends credence to this theory.)   You can use the alternate codequit()/code to exit the interpreter until you have looked at how Python was installed or think of some modifications you might have on the key mapping on your Mac.  <answer113600> I had the same problem and I came across this post.  I think we both thought that we did kbd^ Ctrl/kbd-kbdD/kbd but we actually did kbdâŒ˜ Cmd/kbd-kbdD/kbd, which is different shortcut and splits the terminal window.  <comment71790> I just tried using the Windows commands for the same tasks and they work well. It must therefore be the edition I downloaded, I'm assuming <comment71797> If ^D splits the screen you have either re-configured your control keys or Terminal.app itself. On a standard installation, split screen is Cmd-D. <comment133297> How does this differ from the other answers? <comment133327> Typing `exit()` in the Python interpreter shell is the canonical way to exit the Python interpreter shell. It works for all Python interpreter shells across all Python versions 2.6 across all operating systems.
