iOS screen mirroring via USB onto PC? <body> I want to mirror the screen of an iOS device onto a Windows PC. I only found solutions which either uses a VGA-adapter or AirPlay. Because AirPlay uses WiFi I seek for a more stable and independent solution. I stumbled on iTools but it seems it isn't developed anymore. It used a USB connection for showing the screen.  The only things which would suit my needs are either using a VGA/HDMI-adapter or using iOS 8 with Ad-Hoc WiFi and AirPlay. But then I would adapters for Lightning and Dock-Connector. On the other side it won't work for iOS 7 if I use the AirPlay method.  So is there any software out there which can mirror the screen via USB onto a Windows PC?  <answer197673> The HDMI or VGA adapter that can be purchased from Apple allows mirroring to an external monitor, projector or other display that allows video strongIN/strong.  Does your PC allow video in via HDMI?  (I'm not aware of any that do, most are video strongOUT/strong)  There is a 3rd party application called Duet that allows your iOS device to be used as an external or second monitor via USB but I think that is the opposite of what you are trying to accomplish based on your question.  The screenshot shows Duet for Mac but there is a PC version as well.  From the Apple documentation regarding cable:     Use the Lightning to VGA Adapter with your iPad with Retina display, iPad mini, iPhone 5, and iPod touch (5th generation) with Lightning connector. The Lightning to VGA Adapter supports mirroring of what is displayed on your device screen including apps, presentations, websites, slideshows, and more — strongto/strong your VGA-equipped TV, display, projector or other compatible display in up to 1080p HD.   It also strongoutputs video content/strong - movies, TV shows, captured video- to your big screen in up to 1080p HD. Simply attach your Lightning to VGA Adapter to the Lightning connector on your device and then to your TV or projector via a VGA cable (sold separately).

I'd tested on a Mac, everything looks fine.  <comment206189> USB cable do not have the capability for screen display. <comment206314> @Buscar웃: For what are the VGA/HDMI-Adapter used then? <comment206322> HDMI might look like USB but it is not. <comment206324> I still don't get what you mean. This is an adapter which should convert to a video signal (VGA, HDMI). Because it's an official adapter there should be a video output. <comment206328> That is correct, but what dos that has to do with USB ? your question. <comment206332> As developer you can connect your device via USB with your Mac. With iOS 8 and the latest Mac OS X you can mirror your device via USB. I'm seeking for a solution which also can do this but on PC and perhaps iOS 7. <comment267251> Welcome to Ask Different. Can you please provide more details on how to do this? <comment267875> Does this also work on Windows? <comment300141> 1. open quicktime 2. choose "new movie recording" 3. next to the big red "record button" there's a small downwards arrow, where you can select your iPhone, if it is connected via usb needs a lightning connector on the idevice, and at least yosemite <comment326088> Yeah but that only works on MacOS, not windows
