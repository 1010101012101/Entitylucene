Can I use iChat with MSN through its new XMPP/Jabber compatibility? <body> The Windows Team blog announced XMPP compatibility with their MSN/Live IM network recently.   Have anyone tried to get iChat to work with MSN yet?  (I'm not looking for Jabber transports)  <answer34245> No, it is not implemented yet.  In the meanwhile, you can use Cocoon for MSN chat as an iChat extension.  <answer59387> As Gerry said, Cocoon is your only option at the moment - but it hasn't been touched in months, despite continued donations from users.  <comment39789> Wow, thank you! <comment71680> This answer got a bit outdated I think. No updates (or anything) from Cocoon for a year. <comment71684> @Alenanno Did it stop working? <comment71686> @Gerry I haven't even installed it, considering the project seems to be dead and seems it has been for a year. Not to mention it still had problems (failure to load avatars, no chance to add, block or remove contacts and so on). <comment72135> ^ should be a commment really.
