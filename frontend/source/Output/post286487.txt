How can I decipher the Activation Policy Details for an iPhone <body> I'd like to decipher the  Activation Policy Details for an iPhone such as these:  •   Activation Policy Description: UK Reseller Flex Policy br •   Initial activation policy ID: 399br •   Applied Activation Policy ID:br •   Applied Activation Policybr •   Next Tether Policy ID: 399br •   Next Tether Activation Policy Description: UK Reseller Flex Policybr •   First Unbrick Date:br •   Last Unbrick Date:br •   Unbricked: falsebr •   Unlocked: falsebr  Finding what these mean one by one is proving painstaking.  I wonder if anyone could take a bit of an effort to explain them to me or advice some online resource explaining this.  You can get if from sites such as imei.info.  Apple providers also get it from GSX.  It's 100% reliable. This one is in imei.info that they use as an example.  The explanations in this website are insufficient though.  img src="https://i.imgur.com/4GvO23A.png" alt="screenshot"
