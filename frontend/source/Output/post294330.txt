How to turn off autocomplete event names in ical <body> I have many hundreds of events in ical as I've been using it for about the past five years.     Problem is whenever I create a new event, then start typing in the event name field, as I work out what I want to call the event (or reminder), a giant list of similar past events that I've entered pops up and is annoyingly distracting. I'm simply not interested in those past events anymore and I don't want to know about them. I use ical mainly as a reminders system for tasks / todo list.  I'd love to find a way to turn these suggestions off, without having to delete all past events from my calendar history (which it looks like I might have to resort to).  Haven't found a way to do this but would be very grateful if someone knows how.
