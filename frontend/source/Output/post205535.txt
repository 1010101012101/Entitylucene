Command Tilde in Finder, prevent focus on Desktop at end of cycle <body> Say I have 2 finder windows open, strongA/strong and strongB/strong.  I begin focussed on strongA/strong, then code⌘ + ~/code to focus on strongB/strong, finally code⌘ + ~/code once more, and it still leaves strongB/strong in front, but strongB/strong is now slightly grayed out (same style as finder window strongA/strong when it's behind other finder windows).  This 3rd location is focussed on the strongDesktop/strong, how do I prevent the Desktop from receiving focus on code⌘ + ~/code? I only want actual Finder windows to receive focus?  <answer205536> It is selecting the Desktop, and any icons on it.
