Rating & Reviews no longer showing up in iTunes <body> When looking at the reviews on an app, if I view the app in iTunes it will no longer show me the customer ratings. I used to be able to look at the "Curren Version as well as "All Versions" and see reviews and their ratings. This stopped last week. I need this information.  <comment346538> I've tried to tag this. Are you running iTunes on Mac or PC? Which App Store reviews?
