How can I make all folders in Finder "snap to grid"? <body> I don't like how in Finder, you can drag a folder and drop it emanywhere/em, even overlapping on another folder. For example:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/sT5z3.png" alt="enter image description here"  That is just annoying. And when I resize the window, the files stay how they were (like the files don't reorganize to fit in the new size of the window).  I do realize I can right click and select "Clean up", but I don't like having to do that every time I drag and drop a folder/file.   I know about the setting to make everything "snap to grid" so it will stay organized in the "Show View Options":  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KFpvh.png" alt="enter image description here"  However, it only works for that specific folder and does not work across the whole Finder like I want it to. Is there any way to make it apply across everything in Finder?  Also I tried clicking "Use as Defaults" but that only applies to newer folders created I think.  <answer50511> The following steps applied "Snap to Grid" even for strongpreviously created folders/strong.   strongTested on:/strong  ul li10.6.x/li li10.7.3/li li10.8.x/li li10.9.x/li li10.12.5  ol liGo to any folder control /li liControl click on the empty space/li liClick on Show View Options/li liIn the "Sort by" drop down bar select "strongSnap to Grid/strong"/li listrongAt the bottom of the window click on the "Use as Defaults" button/strong/li /ol/li /ul  strongNOTE:/strong Because this will become the strongdefault setup for ALL Finder windows/strong you may consider manipulating the Icon size, Grid spacing, Text size, Label position, Background, etc... accordingly.  strongALSO:/strong If folders do not appear to have snapped to grid on a previously created folder, strongRelaunch Finder/strong or you could try to strongtoggle/strong the "Icon size" down and back up too refresh the current window.  <answer198224> strongUpdate for 10.10:/strong When you are in the "Show View Options" Menu, the strong"Snap to Grid"/strong setting has been moved to the "Sort By:" drop down bar.  <answer199202> Just highlight all the folders you want to clean up, and press clean up selection. It's that easy.  <comment57923> The key may be as simple as Relaunching Finder. <comment58835> @Nathan Did you have any luck after trying the answer above, or is it still not functioning? <comment58873> It worked, thanks! Sorry, I just forgot to come back and click the accept button :) <comment58875> @Nathan No problem I am just glad it worked for you. :â€“) <comment135710> works in 10.8 and 10.9 to, tested <comment146383> Worked great. Thanks a lot. Quick easy fix. <comment177786> works in 10.10 as well. <comment202026> 10.10.2, "Snap To Grid" is in "Sort By" dropdown instead of "Arrange By" <comment238655> OP has already said *"I do realize I can right click and select "Clean up", but I don't like having to do that every time I drag and drop a folder/file."* <comment257088> Works on 10.11, too. <comment290590> On `10.11.4` you don't need to click the **Use as Defaults** option.
