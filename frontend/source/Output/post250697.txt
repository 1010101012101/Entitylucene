Stop process from preventing sleep on OS X <body> I run a MacBook Pro with OS X 10.11. I've noticed the machine hasn't slept well last night. There were events logged every couple of seconds in system.log throughout the entire night that the lid was closed.  I think it might be that two processes are preventing sleep while on A/C.  precode# pmset -g System-wide power settings: [...] sleep                10 (sleep prevented by UserEventAgent, UserEventAgent) /code/pre  Can I stop these processes (or any other process) from preventing sleep?  <answer250701> codeUserEventAgent/code suggests an input device was in active use. This may be a faulty mouse, keyboard, or other input device like a gamepad.  Try disconnecting all your externally connected devices and seeing if this behaviour continues.  Another cause may be a pet or vibrations causing a device to register movement.  Is strongWake for network access/strong enabled? See System Preferences  Energy Saver for this setting. Waking for network access will occasionally wake a sleeping Mac to examine and maintain the network environment.  Alternatively, consider using a third party tool to help put your Mac to sleep despite power assertions.  <answer261107> In my case it was because I was running the iPhone emulator that comes with XCode. Closing the emulator down removed codesleep prevented by UserEventAgent/code.  I only had one occurrence of codeUserEventAgent/code though. When I ran codepmset -g/code I got this:  precode~$ pmset -g System-wide power settings: Currently in use:  [...]  sleep                10 (sleep prevented by UserEventAgent) /code/pre  <comment311414> I don't have any input devices connected. BlueTooth is also off so there is no chance a neighbor's device is causing it. No pets either, and no vibrations (at least not possible to have had vibrations on the desk for 8 hours straight). <comment311417> Have you updated to OS X 10.11.6? <comment311418> What two processes do you think are preventing sleep? <comment311419> Yes 10.11.6 is installed. <comment311420> UserEventAgent is running in two separate processes: one under normal user account, and the other under root. <comment311421> The setting "wake for wi-fi network access" is OFF. <comment311422> What is the result of running `pmset -g assertions`? <comment311423> `pmset -g assertions` shows that everything (including PreventSystemSleep) is set to OFF (zero). The only value set to 1 in that output is UserIsActive. The last line from that output is: "Idle sleep preventers: IODisplayWrangler" but I'm guessing it's unrelated. <comment311424> I'd recommend running [EtreCheck](https://etrecheck.com/#download) on your Mac. Then posting the resulting report into a [Gist](https://gist.github.com). It's a bit too long to post here. And then updating your question with a link to the Gist. There are all kinds of plugins, launch daemons, etc, that could be causing this behaviour. <comment311425> Also, you mention that there are events logged every couple of seconds in the system log. Could you give us a sample of some of them? They might help point us in the right direction. <comment311431> The event I see most often is `date time hostname airportd[60]: SecTaskLoadEntitlements failed error=22`. This has been going on for the past few days, and it is thus unrelated to the problem with lack of sleep that started only yesterday.
