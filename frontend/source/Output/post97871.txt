How can I systemwide check if a keyboard shortcut is in use or has been registered? <body> How can I query OS X to know if an application has registered a shortcut?  I could inspect every app I have or that is running at least with KeyCue and go through the Keyboard Shortcuts section of System Preferences, but there must be some other method using the shell.  <answer105250> precode/usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c "Print" ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.symbolichotkeys.plist /code/pre  Will do it for you. Then you can edit the individual keys from there.  The details are extracted from: http://reviews.cnet.com/8301-13727_7-57337941-263/tackling-keyboard-shortcut-woes-in-os-x/  You can modify the above file as per: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4850  However note the file is binary and you cannot use a text editor, you have to use the command codedefaults/code, or the command codePlistBuddy/code.  codedefaults/code can be used if you know the individual keys you want to modify.  codePlistBuddy/code is more user friendly.  <comment123745> I think it depends on which version of osx you are using.  I am going to post osx 1.8.5 and once you specify which version of osx you are running I can update the answer. <comment123746> I think you should also change the title of your question to mention it is keyboard shortcuts you are asking about, when I came across your question I thought you were talking about file shortcuts or ln's. <comment124165> Thanks for the plist reference. This way I found some useful documentation about the plist self, http://hintsforums.macworld.com/showthread.php?t=114785. <comment124166> If that is the answer to your question, you should put it in answer format and tick it as self answer. NP by the way.
