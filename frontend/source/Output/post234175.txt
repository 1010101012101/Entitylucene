OS X El Capitan download button is grayed out <body> I'm currently running OS X Yosemite 10.10.5 and trying to upgrade to OS X El Capitan. I'm in the App Store on the OS X El Capitan page: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/os-x-el-capitan/id1018109117?mt=12  However, the download button is grayed out and there's really no way for me to upgrade. See image below:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1XsvX.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  How to solve this predicament?  <answer234176> Just restarted the machine and that solved the issue. Now it's downloading.  <comment286293> Are you signed into the same Apple ID that 'bought' the current OS? If not, sign out from the Store menu & back in with the correct ID.
