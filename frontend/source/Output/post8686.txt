Is there a free QR code reader for Mac? <body> Is there a QR-Code reader application for Mac OS X? I'm using Mac OS X 10.6 and an iSight.  <answer8688> No free app that I'm aware of, but for a few dollars/euro you can download QuickMark from the Mac App Store, here's the link  <answer8718> There is an Adobe Air application you can download called QR Reader - works on any platform that has Air installed, and a bunch of online services you could try too - QRGen looks pretty neat - you upload an image of the QR code and then it processes it for you.   Hope that helps.  <answer27610> strongOnline encode/decode:/strong  http://www.patrick-wied.at/static/qrgen/ (based on ZXing)  QR Lab http://www.onlineqrlab.com/  <answer128878> I just discovered QR Journal, which works fine for me. The latest version requires OS X 10.8/10.9 but there is a legacy version available which works with 10.6.     Now desktop users with an iSight (or iSight compatible) camera can read QR codes. Found a QR code in a magazine or catalog? Simply hold up to the iSight camera to scan, store and browse to. Received a QR code in an email? Just drag it into QR Journal to read it.   <comment9257> Since someone down-voted this, it would be helpful if they commented to say why.  The app I've linked to does exactly what the OP asked for. <comment9260> I think it's because the poster asked for a free app.  QuickMark does look good and reasonably priced though. <comment9262> My mistake, you're right.  I read the question and not the title. <comment10221> I tried QRGen but it didn't manage to resolve the QR Codes which I uploaded. But I think your answer is still acceptable as there could be quality issues with the QR Codes I took pictures off ;) <comment10229> Have you tried QR Reader as well? Might work better. I've tried QRGen with pictures taken on my iPhone 4 and it worked 4 times in a row. Maybe you are right about the resolution issues. Hope you can get it worked out. Cheers. <comment102291> http://www.onlineqrlab.com/ is not working at the moment <comment170534> I'd be inclined to download since it doesn't work reliably. <comment264394> Sadly, for my purposes, my MacBook Pro's camera can't focus near enough for the QR codes to be readable. :(
