I have an iPhone 6S <body> Hello I have been searching for ways to update my apps &amp; download without having to use a credit card which I don't have and I don't have the "none or Paypal" option in the payment section and I don't know what else to do. Is there any way without having those options that I can update my apps or even download any??  <answer223263> ol liWalk, drive, or hitch a ride to a store that sells iTunes Gift Cards/li liand buy one with your cash money/li liEnter Code # from card into iTunes/li liPurchase Software/li liHappiness!
