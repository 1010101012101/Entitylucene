Home folder name changed but terminal prompt is still showing last name <body> I changed the name of my home folder in 2 ways. First I change it using the instructions from the official codeApple/code website:   sudo mv /Users/old_name /Users/new_name  and then I also changed it going to codeSystem Preferences/code  codeUsers &amp; Groups/code  codeAdvanced Options/code.   My problem is that the prompt on the terminal is still showing me the last name I had  precodename-mbp:~ old-home-folder-name$ /code/pre  why?   Is it possible to make changes have effect also on the terminal?  <answer148982> What the terminal prompt is showing you is not the home folder name, but the user name.  The folder is displayed after the machine name, in the ~ highlighted below:  precodename-mbp:~ old-home-folder-name$ Folder   ^ ^ User name /code/pre  You can type the command codepwd/code ("print working directory") to see which folder it is currently in. Or you can type the command codeecho $HOME/code to show you what Terminal thinks your home directory is.  <comment175468> possible duplicate of [Why is my host name wrong at the Terminal prompt when connected to a public WiFi network?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/40734/why-is-my-host-name-wrong-at-the-terminal-prompt-when-connected-to-a-public-wifi)
