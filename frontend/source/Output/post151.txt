Is there a image editor like Windows' Paint for OS X? <body> I tried out several image editors mentioned on this site but I tested some of them like (Pixen and Seashore) I was very disappointed. These apps were so simple and was too low level.  What do you suggest for image editing in OS X (I prefer free stuff)?  P.S: I was use GIMP in Linux and also know it was released for OS X too, but I want find new good applications.  <answer159> I think it’s too subjective. Anyway, probably the two candidates are:  1) You don’t have Photoshop experience (or want to get far from it): Acorn is for you.  2) You know Photoshop and have some experience with it: Pixelmator will make you feel more at home.  <answer168> Pixelmator is a great alternative to Photoshop and similar to paint.net on windows  <answer169> You could try Paintbrush (free). As quoted from its website :  emPaintbrush is a simple paint program for Mac OS X, strongreminiscent of Microsoft Paint/strong and Apple’s own now-defunct MacPaint. It provides users with a means to make simple images quickly, something which has been noticeably absent from the Mac for years./em  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/aIVL0.png" alt="paintbrush"  <answer235> You said that you already know strongGimp/strong. I use that at times on my Ubuntu box and my Macbook. Also, Seashore on the Mac for really simple stuff.  Here are a couple of links to open source options.  ul lihttp://www.osalt.com/graphic-applications/li lihttp://www.opensourcemac.org//li /ul  <answer269> h2Acorn ($49 or free with reduced features)/h2  Acorn is what you want.  <answer747> I use Pixen for the lightweight jobs.  img src="https://i.imgur.com/BN9xY0m.jpg" alt=""  <comment82> I think this is too subjective as it stands. <comment83> @Chealion I don't think so because I really want some good app, when I was use XP I can do my job only with paint but I can't find such a simple app in os x. it's really strange for me that there is good & free & simple application for editing image in os x! <comment91> ìn: If you think the question is too subjective, don't answer it. <comment92> @Am1rr: Ug, can't edit to rephrase the question. Try asking for an alternative to GIMP for OS X or a native port of GIMP. <comment94> @Josh it better change to ALternative to paint. because GIMP was not so simple <comment96> The author has changed the question. <comment97> the Pixelmator problem is that it's not free, it's cost about 50$ i need free one. <comment107> @Am1rr3zA It's a lot more useful now instead of just a list of image editing applications question. (Where we could copy and paste from the 2 or 3 that are on Super User) <comment135> I said in my question I use Seashore but it's was so bad. <comment192> Perhaps you should clarify the Free part in your question. it’s not mentioned. <comment261> I like this one, but it's better if it's also free :P <comment376> Free version info: http://flyingmeat.com/acorn/acornfree.html  "You can use Acorn 2 without paying a single cent. How awesome is that?  Here's how it works: when you first download Acorn, it runs in "trial mode" for a couple of weeks. If you decide not to purchase it after 14 days, the trial will end and Acorn will disable some advanced features, but will continue working for your image editing needs. You can still open images and crop, filter, rotate, add layers, add text, touchup and just have fun with your images. All without paying a single cent, and completely guilt free." <comment849> ++... seashore is simple and powerful <comment6499> Lots of alternatives: http://alternativeto.net/software/microsoft-paint/?platform=mac <comment6501> This is actually the best answer. Funny how things turned out here. <comment230412> url for free version is dead
