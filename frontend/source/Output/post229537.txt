Mac Pro + Dual 27" Cinema Displays brightness & brightness control <body> Hardware:  ul liMac Pro 4.1 (circa 2009)/li liAMD Radeon HD 7950 3072 MB graphics card/li /ul  I have just connected dual 27" Cinema Displays.  Both work, lots of display space ;-)  Two problems (perhaps related):  ol liF1 &amp; F2 keys only adjust brightness on the primary display./li li2nd display about (purely estimated) 92% of the brightness of the primary display and just a bit too dim to feel comfortable.  While perhaps just the difference in ages and use of the 2 displays, I wonder if something else might have gone awry?/li /ol  Any way to adjust brightness of both displays from my keyboard?  Any other adjustment I can make to the brightness of the 2nd display.  <answer229539> Just discovered a solution to Problem 1.  Control + (F1 or F2) adjusts the brightness of the secondary display.  Still working on problem #2  <comment280035> Problem 2, I'd get a colorimeter for. Might just be profile. I've a similar rig to yours & my 2 'identical' screens need different profiles. <comment280037> @Tetsujin -- Thanks for the suggestion.
