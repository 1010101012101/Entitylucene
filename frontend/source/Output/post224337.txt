How do you copy a single word from an SMS? <body> I have received an SMS with an unlock PIN for an app. I now want to copy &amp; paste that code into the app.  When I press on the message, I only get the option to copy the whole message. How can I only copy the PIN?  <answer224338> Sadly, you can't select a single word from a received SMS.  You're going to have to copy the whole SMS to a note (Or to the "reply" input), then select the part you want from that note.  That said, if the sent code is numeric, a user emcan/em directly copy it.br iOS will interpret it as a possible phone number, and allow several options when the number is touched &amp; held down.  <comment272071> Oh, cool. Thanks for that additional information :)
