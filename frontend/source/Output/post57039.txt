How make Safari download PDF files instead of opening them in-page? <body> Firefox downloads my PDF files straight to "Downloads", Safari opens them "in-page".  I need PDF files to save to a file, not to open.  Is there a setting make Safari download PDF files instead of opening them in-page?  <answer57045> From this article:     Go into the Preferences and simply un-tick the option Open “safe”   files after downloading.        img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/sZ4yw.png" alt="enter image description here"   <answer57058> Open up a terminal window: kbd⌘/kbdkbdspace/kbd and type Terminal. Hit enter when its highlighted. When you get to the terminal prompt, type the following command:  precodedefaults write com.apple.Safari WebKitOmitPDFSupport -bool YES /code/pre  You won't get a response at the command line, but once you restart Safari it will no longer open them in the browser.  To take it a step further while you're there, you can keep it from opening them once they are downloaded with this one:  precodedefaults write com.apple.Safari AutoOpenSafeDownloads -bool NO /code/pre  This last command achieves what the other answer suggests.    <answer59181> When you click on a link to a PDF, hold down the control key. A menu pops up. Select "Download Linked File as..."  <answer59230> You can make Safari on the Mac download ANY files (mp3, mp4, jpg, pdf and more) by doing the following.   ol liOpen the file (movie,music,etc) in Safari. That normally comprises of clicking the link to the pdf/movie/music etc./li liClick on the url of the browser (in this case it would end in ".../xyz.pdf"./li liHold option down and press Return(or Enter)./li /ol  The file you are viewing downloads to the Downloads folder on the mac.   I've tested this with almost all file types possible. Very very useful little feature that unfortunately too few people know about.  <answer77303> Better yet, you can just hold down alt when you click.  <answer80711> None of the right-click stuff that should be working is working properly for me (I have a very fussy link). But I have found that if you are looking at the document in-page, if you hover towards the bottom of the window you should get a black control bar... the disk icon will save the pdf to disk.  <answer80714> Press print and then click on PDF, and then save as PDF.   <answer97466> Safari automatically opens many files in the browser window. If you want to download any of those files follow these steps:  1) Click on the codeFirefox/code menu and select codePreferences/code  2) In the window that opens click on the codeApplications/code tab  3) In the column named codeContent Type/code scroll down to the type of content you are trying to download (or type the file type in the search field)  5) When you find it, click on the action popup (to the right) and change it from codePreview in Safari/code to codeSave file/code  6) Try the pasting the URL of the file you want to download into the browser again and it should now start to download (or ask you where to save it!)  <answer175694> Holding option while clicking on a link will automatically download the target instead of opening it.  <answer209121> Open the pdf right click -- view/open in preview the file will open in preview save the file  <answer229858> simple. after you open the pdf page, click File then click Export as PDF  <answer241757> Right click on the pdf link and click &lt; Download Link File .  <comment65519> Tried it.  Doesn't work. <comment65542> Doesn't work. :( <comment93332> This option is for something different -- it controls whether downloaded files are opened automatically or not. <comment252207> You lost me at `Firefox`. <comment252311> Can you elaborate a bit, right now it's difficult to understand what the procedure is <comment253162> Provides a work around, but does not answer the actual question of whether or not a setting is available. <comment297080> Welcome to Ask Different.

Still there after all these years. Thanks Gavin/Jawa. <comment332689> This does not work on MacOS Sierra.
