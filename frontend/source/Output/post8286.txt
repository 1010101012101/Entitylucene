Seeing the desktop while in Unity mode in VMWare Fusion? <body> When I run VMWare Fusion in Unity mode, is there any way to see the desktop or access the files on the desktop? Or must I switch into Single Window/Full Screen mode?  <answer8296> You can view the Desktop as a folder in Windows Explorer.  <answer8307> You cannot view the windows desktop as the "Desktop" in Unity (As @mankoff said, you can open it as a folder). The intention of Unity is to emRun Windows apps "side by side" with Mac apps/em. This means the Mac desktop is emthe/em desktop.  I remember there was an option to "Show taskbar in unity" in a older version. Unable to find it in version 3 (did not look for long, anyway I think this is not very useful)  BTW, the way I use VMWare is only for application installs. All my data still stays on my mac (in a special folder if required) but not inside the VM. Helps me back them up, email them if required (even when the VM is suspended). So I never felt a need to emsee/em the desktop.  <comment8954> +1 for using the Mac folders in VMs. <comment8955> `Show Taskbar in Unity` is found under the `View` menu. Also `Show System Tray in Unity` option is present. (I have VMWare Fusion 3.1.2) <comment8991> @koiyu I see it now. Missed it perhaps because I never felt the need for the view menu in the recent days (got Fusion 3 in Dec), the VM is almost always in Unity. <comment249864> note that shared folders under Fusion are maddeningly slow (try using Visual Studio with a non-trivial project stored in a shared folder).
