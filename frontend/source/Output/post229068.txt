Line In Headset's Microphone Not Receiving Input <body> I'm using Windows 10 (32 bit) with Boot Camp on an early 2009 iMac.  I recently got an X2 from Ovann (http://ovann.com/c2223.html) and looks like this (http://phongvu.vn/gallery/avatar_upload/products/storage/32083_ovann-x2-proo.jpg)  I've tried this on OS X and on Windows and checked the recording devices; it seems that whenever I talk or test the microphone it doesn't get any input.  <answer233216> I've solved it! The only thing I needed to do was find a good line-in to USB adapter and then use it.   The one I got was this one.  <comment279388> Then check it in OS X & see what happens... <comment279509> Plug a known good input into the line in and see if that works. Right now, we don't know if it's the X2 or the line in jack that's problematic. <comment285040> It's helpful if you provide details about the line-in to USB adapter
