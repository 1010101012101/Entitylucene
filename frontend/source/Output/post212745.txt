iCloud Photo Sharing - Not receiving invitation <body> I previously had an iCloud Photo Share album and then the pictures would stop appearing on my stream when the other member added new ones. We then removed me from the Stream to re-add. When we tried, I do not receive the invite. We tried my phone number and Apple ID. When I send the same person an invite to a "test" stream, they get the invitation right away.   I have other photo streams with other people and have not ran into any issues, just with this one person. They are able to send invites to other people for other albums as well. I am on iOS 9, they're on 8 but we had this issue when we were both on 8 as well.   Has anyone else experienced this?  <answer212746> I've never experienced a similar issue, but these 2 steps won't hurt:  ul liMake sure both your iPhone and the other member's iPhone have iCloud Photo Sharing AND iCloud Photo Library turned on./li liMake sure you have the same settings set up on your Mac/iPad if you use any./li /ul  Also, if your shared iCloud Photo Album has more than 5,000 photos, you will need to make a new album to continue sharing.  Here's a great site for everything related to iCloud Photo Library: https://tidbits.com/article/15584  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WOst1.png" alt="Tap on &quot;Photos &amp; Camera." img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fVBZQ.png" alt="Make sure &quot;iCloud Photo Sharing&quot; is turned on."  <answer216321> The Apple store was unaware of why this was happening. They ended up getting a new phone, signing into their iCloud and everything started working again.  <answer239292> The person who can't send the invite should check if mobile data is enabled for photos app Maybe when they sent the invite to you, they didn't have wifi and mobile data was disabled.  but had wifi when they sent one to another person.   It happened to me. I couldn't receive and send invites. Once mobile data is enabled, the notification appeared that someone invited me and asked if I want to join. Now I can send and receive invites and all works as expected. My iCloud photo library is not enabled, Only iCloud sharing is.   <comment257289> Still did not work. I'll have to contact Apple. It's weird because they get my invites and I get invites from other people just not this one person. All options are the same.
