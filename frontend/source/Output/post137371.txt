How to fix unresponsive touchscreen on iPhone? <body> My iPhone (4S, iOS 7.1.2) never fell in water also never fell on floor but sometimes the touch screen stops responding (buttons still work). The problem disappears again by itself but I would like to fix it. How can I approach this?  <comment163227> Does this problem occur with any app or only with specific ones? Did you already try to restore your phone (via iTunes)? <comment163229> Also, see http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/1822/how-can-i-recalibrate-the-touchscreen-on-my-iphone?rq=1 for potential solutions
