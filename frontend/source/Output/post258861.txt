Siri shortcut for external keyboard <body> I have an external bluetooth keyboard attached to my macbook pro. I don't have function "fn" key on my external keyboard. The shortcut to call siri is codefn + space/code. How am I supposed to call Siri now?   Also I don't wish to change this shortcut.   <comment323712> If you don't want to change the shortcut, then you'll have to change the keyboard. <comment323719> You could use a keyboard remapping program to map the Fn key to an available key on your bluetooth keyboard, although at that point you might as well just change the shortcut.
