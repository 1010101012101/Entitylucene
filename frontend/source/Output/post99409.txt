Do apple developer program allow Pakistani developer to sale inApp purchases? <body> I am an independent application developer from Pakistan having a local bank account and VISA credit card. I am planning to enrol in the Apple Developer Program as an individual to sell my apps.  I have seen that Google Play does not allow Pakistani application developers to sell paid applications and inApp purchases since there are some issues with bank transfer, etc.  I have read the Apple Developer Guideline but did not find such restriction based on region.  Can anyone please confirm that what is their policy? Can I enrol in the program and access all the features?  <comment116946> Once again: you should be asking Apple directly. Or asking your colleagues/friends in your country if they have experience. Apple's policies are their policies to set out and enforce, if you want an authoritative answer, ask them.
