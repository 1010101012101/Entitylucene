Mid 2010 MBP not powering? <body> I have a slightly battered Mid 2010 MBP that's all of a sudden not powering on, I'm still getting a green light on charger when plugged in etc.  I'm unsure if the dc-in board has failed and needs replacing. Also tried SMC reset and also have removed the battery, but still not able to get the MBP to boot.  Can anyone suggest any other options I can try?  <comment335700> Unfortunately I have the exact same issue. Tried removing the battery, SMC/PRAM reset and still nothing! Suspect my logic board is dead :( Did you by any chance face random restarts before this happened?
