Easy way to take a screen shot that's NOT color corrected? <body> My displays are color calibrated every other month or so with a hardware calibration tool. When I take a screen shot of a profile aware app, such as photoshop or lightroom or some web browsers, I don't want the screen shot to be adjusted for my monitor. Is there an easy way to do this besides my current approach:  ol ligoto system preferences, display, color calibration/li lichange the profile to a generic monitor one/li listart the color aware application (most seem to require a fresh startup to deal with the change)/li litake the screen shot/li lichange my profile back/li lirestart the application/li /ol  To address @barryj's assertion that color profile only matters if I'm using a camera to take a picture of the display. Here are two screen shots of the same image, one with the default color profile applied to the monitor, and one with my custom profile applied, just to show you how much of a difference it really makes.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WTpXG.jpg" alt="side by side comparison"  <answer13609> Try opening up the screenshot in "Preview" and then under the "Tools" menu select "Assign Profile..." and change the profile of the image that way.  If that works, you should be able to automate the process with either a folder action and AppleScript to Automator.  <answer30942> The fact that the monitor's profile gets embedded is the only way the OS can preserve the appearance of colors in your photos. If you open a photo in Photoshop, take a screen capture (let's say for now via the built-in OS tool), then open this screen shot in Photoshop (and preserve the profile in the file) and compare both side to side, then you will see that the colors are visually similar even though the numbers for each pixel is different from one to the other.  This is all normal behavior. The colors you see on your screen on a calibrated and profiled monitor is actually raw values sent by the OS to the graphics card which then "assigns" the monitor profile to the values in real time so that the colors look like they should on the monitor. This is the simple explanation of course, there is much more going on in the background.  In the color management world there is only 2 options when you wish to play around with colors and profiles: assign or convert colors. When switching from one color space to another (i.e. from RGB to CMYK), your only option is convert since the laws of physics apply here. Within the same color space, if you assign profiles (or remove them, i.e. assigning nothing) you preserve the numbers while sacrificing (to various degrees) the appearance of the colors. When converting, you preserve the appearance of the colors while sacrificing the numbers in the file.  In your case, you need to convert the screen shot to a device-independent profile like Adobe RGB, or a device-dependent but easy to play with like sRGB. You can do that in Photoshop or Preview, as long as you do convert and not assign. Removing the profile is not really helping, since the numbers will have no meaning...  <comment14463> By 'take the screen shot' do you mean via software such as the built-in mac screenshot, or with a camera? Changing the profile will only have an effect if you are physically taking a picture of your monitor with a camera. <comment14466> taking a screen shot with an app, either built in screenshot or skitch or similar. <comment14467> so changing the profile will have no effect on your screenshot. If you want to test - take a screenshot, then change the profile, and take another of the same screen image. Display the two results side by side - they'll be the same. <comment14468> @barryj, I wish that was the case, really I do. I wouldn't be asking this question if that was the case. The screen image being captured is *clearly* the "after correction for your display" pixels. <comment14469> I stand corrected - that seems a bit crazy to me. Sorry to have contradicted you. <comment14470> Perhaps this would work - supposedly removes colour profiles: http://imageoptim.pornel.net/ <comment14471> nope, that removes an embedded profile, these screen shots don't have one. <comment26166> For the record, to make this work you seem to need a profile that is effectively the negative of your calibration... so if the monitor is weak in red and the calibration increases the red 10% you would need to assign a profile that does the opposite in order to get back to "un corrected". Creating such a profile appears to be quite difficult and time consuming. <comment26821> I've tried to recreate your problem unsuccessfully on my machine using both Preview and Photoshop. When you say that you are changing your profile are you doing it in system preferences here: http://cl.ly/1D24181x1U0t003b2D1e <comment26823> @samuel yes. Both displays have a profile set in the Display system preferences. <comment35475> I posted this question on the TechSmith (Snagit) community site to see if we can help answer it... http://feedback.techsmith.com/techsmith/topics/is_there_a_way_to_take_a_screenshot_that_is_not_color_corrected <comment35533> Assigning in this case is lost time. There is no objective way to be certain the numbers are interpreted correctly by the OS. Converting is the only solution. <comment35539> When you change the profile in the display prefs you "install" it in the LUT table (look-up-table) of the graphics card. This make the monitor show colors as interpreted through this specific color space, which is useless since all monitors are different, even for the same company/model. Age, lighting environment, settings, etc. makes every monitor different. Thus hardware calibration and profiling is the only way to know for sure how a monitor shows colors.
