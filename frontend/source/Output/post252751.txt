How to enable iTunes Match? <body> Today I got a message that my iTunes match subscription was cancelled because the payment information was invalid. That's because Apple removed ClickAndBuy support which was the only payment option in my country apart from credit cards (which I do not have) and gift cards. No big deal, I just bought a gift card and now I want to re-enable iTunes match, but it seems as if Apple has forgotten that it even exists. On my iPhone with iOS 10 there is no mention of it whatsoever, but on iTunes the Account info page shows a 'Renew' button, which takes me to the old iTunes Match subscription screen. Clicking the big blue subscribe button however doesn't seem to do anything other than asking for my password. I'm at a loss here, how do I get Apple to take my money and give me my music collection back?  <comment314493> What exactly happens after you enter your password? <comment314501> They immediately ask again, after which the status bar on the top shows loading activity for a second or so. Then, nothing. I'm still on the same page.
