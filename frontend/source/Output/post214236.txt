Xcode comment selection shortcut not working on European keyboard <body> I have an Apple keyboard (Norwegian) with numeric keypad and I can't get the Xcode shortcut for comment selection (cmd + /) to work. I have to change to Input source = US every time I want to comment out a block.  When I change from US to Norwegian input source the Xcode - Editor - Structure - comment selection shortcut disappears.  Does anyone know why changing input source from Norwegian/Swedish/German (I guess all European languages) have this effect.  What is the "European" shortcut for comment selection ?  Are Europeans not allowed by Apple to comment select..!? ;-)  Any ideas would be much appreciated !  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LmZC2.png" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lUwfv.png" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qrkgz.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer214243> You can fix this by going to strongSystem Preferences/strong  strongKeyboard/strong  strongShortcuts/strong, then strongApp Shortcuts/strong. Click the strong+/strong button and select Xcode from the top drop bar. Then set the strongMenu Title/strong to strongComment Selection/strong. Next select the keyboard shortcut box and press the desired keyboard combination, then click OK.  It seems that the Norwegian keyboard's encoding of the strong//strong character does not work in shortcuts, so you should use something else than the /  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xgCT3.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer256312> This worked for mebr/br/  For xcode 8 - br/br/ sudo /usr/libexec/xpccachectl br/br/  restart your computer  <answer273919> I have the same Problem with the German keyboard. It works if I press shift+cmd+/. Probably because without the shift it's cmd+7 and the "/" is activated when you press shift.   <comment258624> Unfortunately i tried this, and it does not work, nothing change.  Xcode - Editor - Structure - comment selection shortcut is still blank <comment258626> @karlml Make sure that **Comment Selection** is correctly spelled and capitalized. Then, restart Xcode. If it is blank, try using the shortcut anyway. If it doesn't work either, use a different key combination <comment258627> Ok, this is very odd. If I changed to CMD + * it works... and I get cmd* in the menu  Why can I not use cmd+/ ? (I also had to add the same key combination for Uncomment Selection) <comment258631> @karlml I think it is something to do with the encoding. Maybe the **/** is a different character on the Norwegian keyboard. There are 3 Norwegian keyboards with seemingly the same input. Try the PC one <comment258636> Hmm, well it looks the same, and it types the same, and if I type // in Xcode with that button, the code is certainly commented out.  But maybe ISO standard have it recognised as something else, or apple have the keyboard mapped wrong, who knows.  Thanks <comment258638> I guess you should change the answer to specify that you should add another shortcut. <comment324745> not sure though if it wasn't just restarting computer that helped me; in my case "Editor - Structure - Comment Selection" was always disabled whether i had any code selectet or not <comment324882> @igrek its possible as xcode is having a lot of problems and some times just restarting it fixes the issue. how ever in my case it never worked unless i executed this command.. <comment326986> ok, thanks, I had it reproduced couple more times and the command definitely works. No need to restart a computer, you only need to restart xcode
