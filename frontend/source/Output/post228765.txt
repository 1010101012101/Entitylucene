Force Google Chrome use single process <body> Across the internet I found an interesting solution of how to make Chrome consume less memory and this is - forcing the application use single process for all the tabs. Unfortunately the instruction was made for Windows users. What should I do to try this feature in OS X? Will it actually help? And if not, what would you suggest to free more memory?

For that you need to enable the Debug menu in Safari.  ol liOpen Terminal and type in the following command and hit kbdreturn/kbd  precodedefaults write com.apple.Safari IncludeInternalDebugMenu 1 /code/pre/li liOpen the Safari app. (If you had Safari opened, you need to quit and open it again.)  You will see a emDebug/em menu, just check the emDisable Per-Tab Web Processes/em item.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pflaS.png" alt="Safari hidden debug menu"/li liIt will ask to quit Safari, click the button and open Safari again.br em(It will close all tabs, so make sure you don't have anything pending)/embr img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/RSXth.png" alt="Restart safari dialog"  /li liOpen the Safari app again.

In my opinion you must give some reasons why you want to alter this. What is your system setup for example. <comment279008> You could build your own version of Chrome that just does this using the Chromium project https://www.chromium.org/Home
