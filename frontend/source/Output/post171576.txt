Spotlight fails to load after Time Machine restore - crashes continuously <body> Problem description: After having made the mistake of running a Unix command that altered more files than I intended and possibly damaged the file system, I decided to restore to a previous state with Time Machine.   Evidently, something was corrupted with the latest backup, since the system said it couldn’t restore every time I tried to use it. But I succeeded with the second newest backup.  Since the restoration, the Spotlight icon has disappeared from the corner of the menu bar, and cannot be activated with keyboard shortcuts. The same problem exists whether I start in safe mode or from a fresh account.   The .app file still exists in CoreServices, and indexing appears to continue, as I am able to conduct searches through finder windows. I have tried emptying all the caches, restarting SystemUIServer and the menubar itself.   I have never, to my knowledge, instructed an application or the computer to hide Spotlight from the menubar. And though I doubt this is the issue, it is interesting that when I select in Onyx the option to hide it, and then deselect it, there’s a short little flash in the corner where the icon should be as if it tries to start for a moment but for whatever reason crashes.   strongIt appears from the console that every second it is trying to load when this happens:/strong      file:///Users/SRF/Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports/Spotlight_2015-02-11-163022_MacBookPro.crash      2/11/15 4:30:46.173 PM    com.apple.xpc.launchd[1]    (com.apple.Spotlight[1951]) Service exited due to signal: Trace/BPT trap: 5      2/11/15 4:30:46.173 PM    com.apple.xpc.launchd[1]    (com.apple.Spotlight) Service only ran for 0 seconds.
