wiping old phone <body> I just got a new iphone today.   I set it up and restored the old information onto my new phone.   I went back into my old phone to erase everything on it and it keeps telling me the icloud password is invalid.  I know it isn't because I used the same password to get into my new phone.  How do I erase the old phone?  <answer233395> Apple made it so there is no way to erase a phone without knowing iCloud password. It's a way of intimidating thieves, I believe.  <comment285257> Have you tried logging into iCloud on the web and resetting your password there?  You'll have to use the new password on the new iPhone, of course, but it might be just what the old iPhone needs to allow you to log-in and erase it.
