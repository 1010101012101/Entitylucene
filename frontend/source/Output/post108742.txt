Mail keeps setting "Save drafts on the server" checked <body> I open "Preferences" in Mail, uncheck "Store drafts on server" and save (Gmail account). However, when I open the preferences again, the "Store drafts on server" (or whatever it says in English version) is checked again. It really pisses me off. How can turn it off permanently?  I use OS X Mavericks.  <answer108767> Are you using Mavericks? This is probably related to the MANY Gmail related problems that have cropped up since it's release.   You are in luck though, as Apple has just released an update to solve many of said problems.  http://www.macrumors.com/2013/11/07/apple-releases-mail-update-for-mavericks-to-address-gmail-issues/  <answer110208> Another good option that fixed the problem for me is as follows:  ol liQuit Mail.app./li liLog into Gmail in your favorite web browser./li liClick on the gear menu and select strongSettings/strong./li liClick on the strongLabels/strong tab./li liUnder strongSystem Labels/strong, next to strongDrafts/strong, click on strongshow if unread/strong and uncheck the strongShow in IMAP/strong box.

I'll try the update and see how it works. <comment127497> The update has not helped. <comment129850> Answers on Ask Different need to be more than just a link. It's okay to include a link, but please summarize or excerpt it in the answer. The idea is to make the answer stand alone. <comment135117> Had the same problem. This fixed it for me, thanks! <comment141663> Any solution for the same problem but not using Gmail as the e-mail service?
