Can I replace characters in AppleScript? <body> I'm working on an AppleScript to mount our Active Directory Home Shares and I've come up with the following part that looks at the logged in users "SMBHome:" and it gives me the users home share but the slashes are in the wrong direction "\" and need to change them to "/".  So far the AppleScript is:  precodeset username to do shell script "whoami"  set homepath to do shell script "dscl '/Active Directory/CAMPUS/All Domains/' -read /Users/" &amp; username &amp; " |grep SMBHome:" /code/pre  When run this gives me an output of  precode"SMBHome: \\\\server\\share\\username" /code/pre  I'd love to have the next step replace the back slashes with forward slashes and remove:  precode"SMBHome: \\" /code/pre  With a final outcome of:  precode//server/share/username /code/pre  Is this possible?  Thank you!  <answer201213> There are two approaches to solving this problem. One is to use JavaScript for Automation (either by putting your AppleScript into an Automator workflow and then using a separate Run JavaScript action, or by re-writing the entire script in JXA), while the other is to use the codesed/code and codecut/code command line utilities via codedo shell script/code.  Here's the JavaScript approach:  precodevar string = "SMBHome: \\\\server\\share\\username" // this would be your 'homepath' variable var corrected = string.replace(/\\/g, '/').replace('SMBHome: ', '') /code/pre  This script uses the built-in JavaScript codereplace/code function to match and replace text using Regular Expressions.  On the other hand, you could also use codesed/code and codecut/code in your AppleScript, like so:  precodeset init to do shell script "echo ' " &amp; homepath &amp; "' | sed 's/\\\\/\\//g'" set corrected to do shell script "echo " &amp; init &amp; " | cut -c 10-" /code/pre  This uses codesed/code for the RegEx, then codecut/code to trim the first bit of the path from the string.  In both cases, the codecorrected/code variable contains the final, modified string. I should note that, while the desired behavior can be accomplished in pure AppleScript, it can be rather tedious.  <answer201218> Thanks for the reply @aaplmath, I actually just found the needed addition which is what you have and it does the job!  precode| grep SMBHome: | cut -c 10- | sed 's/\\\\/\\//g' " /code/pre  Thank you for your input!
