Managing out-of-control mDNSResponder process <body> About a month ago, I started experiencing an issue where my MacBook's mDNSResponder process goes haywire; it starts sending and receiving an absurd amount of packets, which both slows down my computer and destroys my data plan (I am generally restricted to using mobile data for internet). Given that I have no idea what causes the process to go out of control, is there anything I can do to prevent it from causing too much damage (e.g. restarting the process if it's receiving too many packets)? hr I took my laptop in to the Genius Bar, and I was advised to create a separate user account with admin privileges and access everything on my original account from there via Finder (the logic being that the process seemed to only act up on my account). That seems like a terrible solution which isn't even guaranteed to work IMO, so I'd really appreciate any input. Thanks!
