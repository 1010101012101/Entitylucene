Multiple kindle books open at the same time <body> How can I open several instances of the kindle reader at the same time, so that I can have a different book open in each one?  I found this:  Multiple Kindle Windows on PC, Mac  Which suggests using multiple cloud readers, but I want to use the desktop version.  <answer187420> I haven't tested this specifically with Kindle, but it works for most apps that don't normally open a second instance...  In Terminalbr codeopen -n/codebr (note the space after -n)  then drop the Kindle app onto the Terminal window to auto-fill the path to it &amp; hit kbd Return⏎ /kbd   back in Terminal, kbd Opt ⌥ /kbd kbd ↑ /kbd then kbd Return⏎ /kbd will repeat that command &amp; should open a second instance.  <comment222572> the kindle app starts but then it closes, it seems to detect that there is another instance running and then decides to close down to make sure that only one instance is running
