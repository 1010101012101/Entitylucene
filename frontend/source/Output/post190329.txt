Unable to change clock separator <body> I am using OS X Yosemite 10.10.3. In the codeLanguage &amp; Region/code preferences, I clicked kbdAdvanced/kbd and set my clock format to kbd0-23/kbdcode:/codekbd08/kbd. However, the clock in the menu bar and in the codeDate &amp; Time/code preferences is displayed with the code./code separator instead of code:/code. The dot seems to be the default for my language format (which is wrong, we use code:/code). Furthermore, if I modify the contents of codecom.apple.menuextra.clock.plist/code, they are overridden as soon as I restart codeSystemUIServer/code or relogon. For example:  precodedefaults write com.apple.menuextra.clock DateFormat -string 'H:mm' killall SystemUIServer defaults read com.apple.menuextra.clock /code/pre  results in  precode{     DateFormat = "HH.mm";     FlashDateSeparators = 0;     IsAnalog = 0; } /code/pre  How can I change the clock separator?  <answer196024> I had the same problem, I solved it by go to Language &amp; Region and choose the region that has the same clock separator (I chose Australia) and then you can go to Advanced and customize your own dates and times format. Hope it helps  <comment234065> With this approach the day, month, etc. names are not in the correct language.
