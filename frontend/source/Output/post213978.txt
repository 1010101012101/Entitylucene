Software to capture screen video and export to cross-platform format? <body> I work as a developer, and it's invaluable to sometimes be able to take short video clips to send to clients/end users when supporting or explaining how a feature works. I've seen Windows applications allowing them to very quickly and easily take video footage from a section of screen, and save it to an mp4 or cross-platform format.  Apple QuickTime has good functionality when it comes to this. You can quickly and easily highlight the portion of screen you want to record, then save a video - however the resulting formats are usually .mov, which is not ideal for Windows users.  What I need is a video format that can be sent to users regardless of what operating system they're using. 80-90% of these users will be using Windows, so .mov is not good. Many of them won't have QuickTime, and it would be extremely unprofessional for me to expect them to have to get a proprietary app to play it.  So are there any free, open source or other apps to easily video screenshot content, then save it to .mp4 or even .avi? This is a process I'll potentially be doing on a daily basis, so having an 'all in one' solution would save a huge amount of time. Having to manually do a conversion from .mov to another format would be slower and far less efficient. However if there is no other solution I'll have to accept that. If that's the case, what's the fastest/easiest conversion tool?  <comment258306> Have you tried converting it with Handbrake or ffmpeg?
