Safari Extension for right click menu: Open in Google Chrome? <body> Is it possible for an extension to add items to the right click menu in Safari?  If you enable developer mode, there is a menu item called "Open Page With..." and Google Chrome is a choice if it's installed.  Can the Open Page With... menu get added to the right click menu, so I can use one less step when viewing a page in Chrome?  Right now I'm required to load the page in safari, then choose the Chrome option, whereas I'd rather just right click on links and send them to Chrome quickly.  I would make it myself if I knew how!  <answer32909> h2Open in Chrome Service/h2  You can make a Service in 10.6 or 10.7 using Automator that will open a selected URL in Chrome.  Here's how:  ol liOpen strongAutomator/strong img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xEpeZ.png" alt="Automator Icon"/li liWhen Automator asks you to strongChoose a type for your document/strong window, select strongService/strong img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HKSBo.png" alt="Service Icon"/li liChange the "Service receives selected" drop-down to "URLs" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/cCtVL.png" alt="Service options"/li liAdd a strongRun AppleScript/strong action (found under the Automator Library, or just search) by dragging from the left pane to the right/li liCopy the code below to the text field (replacing emall/em the existing text)/li listrongSave/strong and give the service a name (it will be added automatically to the services menu)/li /ol  Code:  precodeon run {input}     set theURL to input     tell application "Google Chrome"         if not (exists first window) then             make new window             set URL of last tab of first window to theURL         else             tell first window                 set newTab to make new tab with properties {URL:theURL}             end tell         end if         activate     end tell end run /code/pre  This will open any selected URL in Safari or other application in Chrome, either in a new tab in the most recent window, or a new window if there is no open Chrome window. To access it, right-click and under the Services item at the bottom of the menu, you should see an item with the name you assigned.  emOne important caveat/em: OS X seems to be a bit picky/buggy about passing link to this sort of service. It works fine if you have text selected as a URL, but it only seems to work on some links. If I discover a better method, I'll update this post with it.  You may also need to restart Safari for the service to appear.   <answer58147> Sorry to bump this old item, but I was looking for a solution and came up with this one that is working great for me.  Want to open the active webpage in a browser other than Safari on your Mac?   It's simple if you have the developer mode enabled.   ol liGo to Settings - Keyboard - Keyboard Shortcuts tab/li liClick the + to add a shortcut. /li liSelect Safari on the Application drop-down/li liCopy the Menu Title letter for letter from Safari's Develop - Open Page With menu.  " Examples: on my machine, Chrome = Google Chrome (22.0.1215.0) â€” /Applications", Firefox = "Firefox (13.0.1)" /li /ol  Note: you will have to update this when updating any of the browsers. The developer menu ties the menu options to the version number reported by the Finder.   ol liSelect your own keyboard shortcut for the alternate browser. I use control+option+command+browser first letter, so Google Chrome = G. I used F for Firefox and O for Opera. control+option+command is not the default for any Safari features as far as I know (for any letter)... /li liFrom any Safari page, simply push the keyboard shortcut and the page will open in the desired browser. /li /ol  Enjoy! E  <comment37621> why not assign the menu item to a keyboard shortcut? it'd be more convenient and faster <comment37625> Didn't think of that, will have to experiment.  It will still require clicking a link to load the page in safari first <comment37627> found this link but it doesn't work: http://projects.skurfer.com/posts/2011/chrome_shortcut/ <comment37628> Thank you, this works for me.  Now if you could tell me how to get that service to the very top of the list, because it's in the middle, and you're right, on some links it doesn't appear.  If I right click your username I can see it, but if I right click my username the option is not available.  Weird <comment37629> Yeah, I can't figure out the rhyme or reason to how it responds to links (I suspect it's just buggy behaviour). To change the order in the menu, you could re-save it with a space or special character in the name so that it would at least pop to the top of the sub-menu. I don't know of any way to get it out of the Services sub-menu however. <comment66914> problem with this is Chrome version changes pretty quick so you will have to modify your shortcut frequently which is not so convenient. <comment95915> Can I use your script to open just Facebook links in for example in Facebook app on Mac?
