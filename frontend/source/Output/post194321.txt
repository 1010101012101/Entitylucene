Modify Trackpad Right click via command line without logout <body> Is it possible to toggle the the preference setting under Trackpad labeled Secondary Click without logging out and in, so that I can toggle two-finger right-click for the builtin trackpad?  I found the command  codedefaults -currentHost write NSGlobalDomain com.apple.trackpad.enableSecondaryClick -bool true/code  But that doesn't seem to work. Toggling the checkbox does also seem to change code~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.driver.AppleBluetoothMultitouch.trackpad.plist/code when system preferences is closed, but using codedefaults/code to change that doesn't help either.   I'd like to toggle it multiple times in one session without going through system preferences, so logging out and back in isn't preferable.  <answer194324> I think you would need to reload the kext for it  codesudo kextunload /System/Library/Extensions/AppleUSBTopCase.kext/Contents/PlugIns/AppleUSBTrackpad.kext/code to disable it.   Change codekextunload/code to codekextload/code to re-enable it.  Now create a script from above so you can run it with one click.  Sorry, that was for the external trackpad.  For the internal that would be to unload:  precodesudo kextunload -b com.apple.driver.AppleUSBMultitouch; sudo touch /system/library/extensions ; exit /code/pre  <comment231743> When I run `kextunload`, i get the message `(kernel) Kext com.apple.driver.AppleUSBTrackpad not found for unload request.`, which seems to mean that the kext wasn't loaded in the first place. Loading the kext after this runs without comment, but doesn't seem to change anything. I'm using 10.9.5 if that helps
