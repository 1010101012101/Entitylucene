How to manually create a working .webloc file? <body> So I created a .webloc file using a .vncloc file as a template (standard xml/plist format), but instead of opening in a Safari window, it is downloading the html of the website into a file.  My goal is to eventually write a cronjob that keeps the URL of a server with a dynamic IP address up to date in the file (in dropbox) so that I can just double-click it anytime and get the correct server page.  The contents of the file look like this:  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt; &lt;!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"&gt; &lt;plist version="1.0"&gt; &lt;dict&gt;     &lt;key&gt;URL&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;string&gt;http://**ipaddress...**:**port...**/&lt;/string&gt; &lt;/dict&gt; &lt;/plist&gt; /code/pre  How do I get the .webloc file to actually open and display in Safari, as if I were to have entered the URL myself?  <comment215057> Oh yeah, and if I create a webloc file by dragging the URL to the desktop, it's not in this xml/plist format and contains weird characters, which makes me wary about maintaining it via script. <comment215061> webloc files written by Safari have a data fork and a resource fork, which is binary (the "weird characters"). See [this](http://stackoverflow.com/a/146630/2654989). Google Chrome creates them [here](http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome/trunk/src/chrome/browser/ui/cocoa/location_bar/autocomplete_text_field_cell.mm?pathrev=90627) (search that page for WriteURLToNewWebLocFileResourceFork). That said, I tested creating a webloc with your XML above, substituting this site's address. It opened correctly in both Chrome and Safari. Are you sure your webserver is sending the correct headers? <comment215270> I haven't checked the headers. I thought about that, but I figured that if the site loads fine when you type the URL into the location field, shouldn't it load file in the browser if you open the .webloc file?  I'll check the headers.  That's got to be it, but why would behavior be different between location field and .webloc file? <comment215271> No idea. The behavior should be identical. What version of Safari? Did you test in Chrome or Firefox just to see what happens? <comment215301> Safari 7.1.  Didn't think to try to open the .webloc file in another browser.  Not sure that *should* work, but I tried it using FireFox and got an XML parsing error.  It didn't like the parameters at the end of the URL string.  Perhaps I need to make the special characters in the URL XML-safe.  The web page opens fine in FireFox though by typing it in the location field, if that's what you meant. <comment215313> OK, checked the header. Looks good. I've got print "Content-type: text/html\n\n" at the top. (It's a perl cgi.) <comment215314> Hold on... It's not downloading at all! It's opening a new Safari page (empty) and then bounces me out to the finder, where it opens a new finder window and selects the .webloc file I had double-clicked from the actual desktop. Huh. Weird. Nothing in the console. *scratches head* <comment215519> Try substituting a different address in the string field. If that works, you know the problem is with the URL provided or the website. If it doesn't work, then I'm at a loss, because as I said above, I created one with this site's address and it worked fine in both Chrome and Safari for me. <comment215541> Good call. Yeah, this page's URL works fine.  I wonder what more/different headers I need...
