Cannot boot from external DVD <body> I have changed my internal DVD with Crucial m4 SSD and I have put the DVD in to an external case.  I'm trying to update the SSD firmware and install Mavericks but I can't boot anything except MAC OS installation DVD.  I have tried to  ul liboot the official Crucial update DVD: it hangs/li liinstall Windows 7: it hangs/li liinstall Windows 7 on bootcamp: it hangs on windows boot/li liinstall windows XP: it doesn't boot/li liboot Hirens 15.1: it boots Mini Windows XP, but I cannot start DOS programs/li /ul  Also, I have reset the SMC and NVRAM, no success.  Any Ideas why I cannot boot anything else than MAC OS? What is wrong: the DVD drive, the EFI or something else?  <comment132071> You say it hangs, but how long did you wait for installation before terminate ?  I had a similar problem: the installation was stopped saying 1 second before proceed (seemed to be hanged). I had to wait for half an hour and finally, the installation process rebooted and continued. <comment132085> Then I see the "press any key to boot from DVD ..." I press any key and it hangs .. I was waiting for it for 5 minutes and no progress .. When I try to boot the Crucial update CD when the linux kernel starts loading  it freezes after several loading dots (Loading vmlinuz.gz ..........) <comment132190> Any ideas anyone ? <comment132205> Did you check your DVD ? Did you try to make a bootable USB drive ? Are you SSD and other drives without errors ? Which model do you have ? Is it compatible with Mavericks ?
