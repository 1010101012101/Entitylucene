I uninstalled an app. How do I get it back? <body>    strongPossible Duplicate:/strongbr   How can I find out which apps I have already downloaded on my iPhone?       The knowledge base mentions that you get to reinstall the app for free... emonce you find it again on the store/em, which is no easy task. There are dozens of apps, all alike the one that was installed.  Is there a way to have a list of apps you have bought? At what point of the purchasing process does this dialog appear? Does a price tag appear for already purchased items? If so, does this message appear after you single tap on the price tag, or do you need to risk a double tap?  img src="https://km.support.apple.com/library/APPLE/APPLECARE_ALLGEOS/TS1702/TS1702_2.jpg" alt="link text"  <answer3574> On strongiTunes/strong, under strongiTunes Store/strong  strongAccount/strong  strongPurchase History/strong, you've got a list of all your iTunes Store purchases.  If you already bought an app, it still appears with the price on the Store. Last time I checked, I had to risk re-buying to see it was free since I already bought it.  Hope that helps!  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/T0Hv3.png" alt="quick links itunes store"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ltKUR.png" alt="alt text"
