Text automatically replaced by text <body> When I type anywhere on my mac "test" it will be replaced with codeecho "test". $ swag. "yolo"/code. I have an example uploaded to YouTube: https://youtu.be/H057jnDtsvc  I know that I used it somewhere one time in a part of code but I had deleted it.  I also checked my System Preferences → Keyboard → Text  <answer199216> If it's just in a single app (TextEdit, Mail, Stickies, and so on) you may try to look for a substitution settings:   e.g. codeEdit &gt; Substitutions &gt; Text Replacement/code  <comment238675> Can you edit the question to make it clearer? <comment238683> Anywhere? In a text editor or word processor? In a web-browser location field? _Anywhere?_ <comment238687> Avoid asking questions in an answer.

With everywhere, I mean everywhere where I can type. In an editor, browser, Notes, Word, etc. <comment240311> I had something similar, check this out:  http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/197408/os-x-unknown-ghost-text-expansion-automatically <comment240312> Thanks @TrentMcClenahan, I use Dash and there was this snippet what appears when I used test.
