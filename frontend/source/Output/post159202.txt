Homebrew default compiler <body> I have read similar topics here, but unfortunately these solutions does not help me.  I would like to recompile all installed software (or at least some formulas) from Homebrew using codegcc/code from codeHomebrew/code.  strongIs it possible to  force codeHomebrew/code to use specific compiler (eme.g. codegcc/code/em) and compiler options (eme.g. std library to use for linking/em)?/strong  I have tried to set all kinds of environment variables, but it does not help :/ ?   precode0/&gt; env | grep CC HOMEBREW_CC=gcc CC=/usr/local/bin/gcc 0/kpykc&gt; echo $PATH /Users/kp/kpykc/devel/bin:/opt/ros/indigo/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/opt/X11/bin:/usr/texbin 0/kpykc&gt; ls -la /usr/local/bin/g??-?.? lrwxr-xr-x  1 kp  admin  31 Nov 24 16:23 /usr/local/bin/g++-4.9@ -&gt; ../Cellar/gcc/4.9.2/bin/g++-4.9 lrwxr-xr-x  1 kp  admin  31 Nov 24 16:23 /usr/local/bin/gcc-4.9@ -&gt; ../Cellar/gcc/4.9.2/bin/gcc-4.9 0/kpykc&gt; ls -la /usr/local/bin/g[c+][c+] lrwxr-xr-x  1 kp  admin  22 Nov 11 23:54 /usr/local/bin/g++@ -&gt; /usr/local/bin/g++-4.9 lrwxr-xr-x  1 kp  admin  22 Nov 11 23:53 /usr/local/bin/gcc@ -&gt; /usr/local/bin/gcc-4.9 /code/pre  Also tried to use this solution.  The reason for doing that is that I want to compile strongsome code*/strong with gcc and link against libraries installed from brew. But it seems that gcc can't link to libs built by clang. On other side it lacks support of some C++11 features which are required by the strongprogram*/strong i would like to compile.  So only solution that I see, is to recompile all needed libs with gcc.  Thank you for help.

I have updated codeEigen/code to codeHEAD/code version from codeHomebrew/code. I suspect my problem is also connected with this bug. But it should be fixed in codeHEAD/code, I think so.  <comment187129> Which OS - note the issue is not necessarily the compiler but the C++ std library you link with - also which programs have this issue clang now has good C++11 features <comment187467> Thanks for clarifying, anyway this adds to question "how to force homebrew use specific compiler and compiler options, e.g. std library to use"
