MacBook speakers off, red light coming from the headphone jack <body> This morning, I was using my Late 2008 MacBook when I found that audio wasn't working. The volume icon in the menu bar was grayed out and System Preferences said that my output was set to Digital Audio instead of Internal Speakers like it normally is (and Digital Audio is my only option).img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FQqRA.png" alt="Sound preferences stuck on Optical digital-out"  More surprisingly, the headphone jack has a glowing red light (I had no idea it could do that!).  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/OoWqk.jpg" alt="Red light headphone jack in Late 2008 MacBook"  Why is this happening? Can I do anything to fix it?  <answer261283> You should be able to restore normal audio by selecting strongInternal Speakers/strong or strongLine Out/strong in the strongSystem Preferences  Sound/strong panel.  The light is because the headphone jack is also a TOSLINK port:     TOSLINK (from Toshiba Link) is a standardized optical fiber connector system. Also known generically as an "optical audio cable" or just "optical cable", its most common use is in consumer audio equipment (via a "digital optical" socket)   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7GpID.jpg" alt="TOSLINK cable"  <answer261290> I'm going to quote: https://superuser.com/a/37804  Personally, I've had success emgently/em using a toothpick to nudge the stuck pins.

The red light is probably because its a   Mini-TOSLINK port.           There is a metal prong in the jack and sometimes it can be bent,   causing the digital audio to be turned on when it shouldn't be.         .           The problem is there is a switch in the jack that tells it if you have a mini headphone plug or an optical plug plugged into the     headphone port. The problem is when you remove the plug, the jack     doesn't know it and keeps shining the red light to talk with the     optical. This disables the internal speakers and you see digital out     instead of internal speakers in the speaker conrtol panel. Plugging     and unplugging the speakers may get it working right for awhile but it     won't last forever.         And, for the brave hearted,           I slid a paperclip in, and pushed out a little metal on the side.   That did the job, and I have internal sound again. And the     digital red light, is now off.      <comment327214> Internal Speakers and Line out are not an option in System Preferences. Only Digital Audio. <comment327228> Sorry to hear that. Do you have any other output options in the Sound panel? <comment327229> I installed [Soundflower](https://rogueamoeba.com/freebies/soundflower/) so I see those virtual outputs. But otherwise, no, just Digital Audio. <comment327236> Have you seen [Macbook Pro - Sound doesn't work and there's a red light coming out of my headphone jack](http://superuser.com/questions/37777)? Do any of those answers help? <comment327243> Have you tried resetting the SMC and NVRAM? Doing that should get rid of the problem assuming it's a software issue <comment350296> Same problem on MacBook Pro mid 2012. Reboot → same problem. Reset NVRAM → same problem. Reset SMC → same problem. <comment350297> I am running Yosemite 10.10.5, without any funny software touching the audio output. Upon the happening of this problem I noticed that the process `coreaudiod` was running at 84 % CPU and my MBP was heating like a fool and breathing the same way.
