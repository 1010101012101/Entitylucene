Lost 3 GB memory from iPhone 4s after update to iTunes 11.4.018 <body> My storage on the iPhone, which I had cleared to 6 GB of free space (I have NOT downloaded 8.0.2) suddenly, after iTunes software update, went down to 3 GB of free space! This happened emjust/em with iTunes software update on my computer, followed by a sync.  supiPhone 4s with 16 GB capacity. iOS 7.0. I downloaded latest iTunes version to my computer 11.4.018./sup  <answer147612> For my phone - the space was being taken up by the download and unpacked iOS 8, which was waiting to be installed. Once I installed the software - the "missing" space appeared again, and the bar displaying my drive capacity was reflecting correctly.    I would check that first - to see if it already downloaded the update.  The link will say "Install Now" on the Settings  General  Software Update page in iOS.    Regards,   Ed  <answer147632> Ed, Thanks! Looks like iOS 8.0.2 emwas/em downloaded with iTunes even though I didn't request it.    Where it used to ask if I wanted to download iOS 8.0.2, it NOW says "Install Now" as you pointed out.  (Also, it no longer says I need 5.8 GB of space, even though I only have 3 GB left.That must be because it ALREADY used 3 GB downloading iOS 8.0.2.)  I appreciate the thoughtful replies.  <comment173965> The iTunes it self is 340 MB, so how big is your library ? <comment173967> @Buscar Could you clarify the link between the size of iTunes and the aforementioned situation? <comment173971> i have the same problem. I lost over 3gb of space sicne the update and cant find anything to remove <comment173975> Not clear to me which file is using the 3 Gig? the iTunes it self ? check the Settings  General  Usage ?
