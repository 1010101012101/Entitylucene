Prevent terminal tabs from auto-renaming <body> I like to name my tabs when I'm using Terminal so I can keep track of what's inside of them. I do this using the inspector.   Unfortunately, whenever I ssh into a machine, my tabs get renamed. Is there any way to prevent this from happening? Perhaps there's some kind of shell script I could run in my bash profile to prevent this?  <answer215524> You can setup a new or change an existing profile in the settings of codeTerminal/code.  Choose your new or the existing profile and click on codeWindow/code and uncheck all the options at the codeTitle/code segment.  Edit: For shells which change the promt via shell variable codePS1/code you have to deal with it as long you connected the the given host without changing the promt on the remote session. To change this in a bash you will find something like   precode# If this is an xterm set the title to user@host:dir case "$TERM" in xterm*|rxvt*)     PS1="\[\e]0;${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}\u@\H: \w\a\]$PS1"     ;; *)     ;; esac /code/pre  in your code.bashrc/code.  If you comment out this block your local title will not change but your promt may be looking awful.  Maybe there are other lines where the shell variable codePS1/code is set. Maybe you have to comment out these too.  Edit2: Also you have the ability to give the local codePS1/code to the remote session. To do so you invoke codessh/code with  precodessh -o SendEnv=PS1 user@host /code/pre  But for this you have to edit the codesshd_config/code. There you have to add codePS1/code to the list of codeAcceptEnv/code. This requires root access. Maybe not really a solution.  <answer215538> Using iTerm2 you actually have an option for that: Just uncheck emPreferences-Profiles-codeYour Profile/code-Terminal-Terminal may set tab/window title/em. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/VsqX7.png" alt="Fancy description"
