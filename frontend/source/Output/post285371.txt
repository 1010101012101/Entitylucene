Which kind of USB device attached - equivalent for the full functionality of lsusb on macOS? <body> Neither 1) System Information, 2) codeioreg -p IOUSB -w0 -l/code, 3) codesystem_profiler SPUSBDataType/code nor 4) jlhonora's "lsusb" for macOS (codebrew update &amp;&amp; brew tap jlhonora/lsusb &amp;&amp; brew install lsusb/code) tell me strongemwhich kind of USB device/em/strong is attached like the Linux command codelsusb/code:       DESCRIPTION lsusb  is  a  utility for displaying information about USB buses in the system strongand the devices connected to them./strong     Use case: I want to know what kind of USB device is attached (e.g. USB 2 or 3) - not which type of port the device is connected to. Per this answer on askubuntu:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NtUhk.png" alt="USB ?"  <answer285372> This may take a bit of extrapolation, but use the value from "Speed" in codesystem_profiler/code  For example, looking at the Logitech USB receiver (for my mouse and second keyboard):  precode$ system_profiler SPUSBDataType | grep Logitech -A5           Vendor ID: 0x046d  (Logitech Inc.)           Version: 12.01           Speed: Up to 12 Mb/sec           Manufacturer: Logitech           Location ID: 0x14200000 / 3           Current Available (mA): 1000           Current Required (mA): 98           Extra Operating Current (mA): 0 /code/pre  Looking at the "Speed" value, it tells me that it's a USB 1.1 device.  Doing the same lookup for my Seagate FreeAgent Go USB disk, I get the following:  precodesystem_profiler SPUSBDataType | grep Seagate -A5               Vendor ID: 0x0bc2  (Seagate LLC)               Version: 1.48               Serial Number: 2GE7WLWG               Speed: Up to 480 Mb/sec               Manufacturer: Seagate               Location ID: 0x14320000 / 23               Current Available (mA): 1000               Current Required (mA): 100               Extra Operating Current (mA): 0               Capacity: 500.11 GB (500,107,861,504 bytes) /code/pre  It tells me it's got a speed of 480Mb/s which is a USB 2.0 device.    You don't have to output all that extra data, I am just using it for illustration purposes, instead you can just narrow it down to the line containing the speed value:  precode$ system_profiler SPUSBDataType | grep Seagate -A5 | grep Speed               Speed: Up to 480 Mb/sec /code/pre  For reference, USB speeds/specs are as follows:  preUSB 1.x - 12Mb/sec USB 2.0 - 480Mb/sec USB 3.0 - 5Gb/s USB 3.1 - 10Gb/s/pre  <comment359847> brilliant!
