How can I open port 443 in Mac OS X 10.6? <body> I have a local apache running on my macbook pro and I need to run a SSL website on the local host. I have everything configured in Apache, but can't open port 443 on mac. I tried to add ipfw rule to allow 443 but it doesn't work.   <answer17736> make sure 443 accessible from local and configured.  precode$ netstat -an|grep 443 /code/pre  allow 443 in ipfw  precode$ sudo ipfw add allow tcp from any to any 443 /code/pre  <comment19384> I did this, doesn't work. it shows me when I do ipfw list, but on nmap it doesn't show 443 <comment19404> @Stewie: Does it show up in the netstat output?  If not, the firewall doesn't matter, because nothing is listening for connections on port 443. <comment24994> Have you simply disabled the firewall entirely and made sure the server is really listening on that port? I've been shocked how many times that's been my problem. <comment45855> @Stewie nmap won't necessarily find all open ports, depending on how secure your system is.
