Scrolling PDF documents in Safari is too sensitive? <body> In Safari, I use two finger dragging with my trackpad (on a MacBook) to scroll through websites. I've noticed that whenever I try viewing a PDF document, (i.e. the URL in the address bar ends with code.pdf/code) the scrolling sensitivity is very different than the normal Safari scrolling sensitivity. It scrolls way too fast (i.e. it's too sensitive).  My guess is that it's a problem with the Adobe Reader plugin which doesn't implement scrolling using the same algorithm as Safari's. Is there any way to fix this? What about using a different plugin for PDF documents besides Adobe Reader?  <answer51477> Safari can open PDFs using Preview without the need for Adobe Reader to be installed. In my experience, Preview in Safari is faster and smoother than Adobe's Reader plug-in.  See this question for how to disable the Adobe plug-in.
