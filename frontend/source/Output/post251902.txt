Why is the bottom row on Apple keyboards just a little bit taller than the rest of the keys? <body> I just noticed this...  The bottom row of keys on Apple keyboards are just a tiny bit taller than the rest of the key rows. Why is that?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LzxKp.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  The blue and red lines in the image are to compare the sizes of the key rows.  <comment313239> Not sure if everyone can read the minds of the designer lol. The thumb is larger than the other fingers and the bottom row is mainly used by the thumb. <comment313241> More specifically, the space bar is the most used key in that row and that's used almost exclusively with thumbs (whereas the other keys are sometimes use with thumbs, but just as often they are used with other fingers). Same reason the bottom row of the Num Pad is larger, whereas the arrow keys are not.
