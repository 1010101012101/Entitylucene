How to deactivate Adobe CS6 install on a damaged/corrupt mountain lion OS hard disk? <body> I have tried running the disk utility repair tool on my Mac OS HD to no avail.   So I moved on to backing as many files (Documents, iPhoto Library, Desktop Data etc...) as I could through my Windows installation on Bootcamp using MacDrive.   Although, I am ready to erase and format the HD, I am still wondering how I would re- install my CS6 suite (Desktop Application; not Creative Cloud) onto the formatted system without running into any activation/re-licensing issues.   Please note that I do have the original .dmg file (If not I could always download that from the original download portal).   However, from what I have read (http://forums.adobe.com/message/4867168), it seems like it is quite important that I deactivate and re-install on the cleaned system.  And there is no way I can open any of these applications since I cant get the disk to boot.   Any suggestions or workarounds?  Note: I do have a windows bootcamp with HD access to my Mac OS.   <answer98134> from http://www.adobe.com/go/activation img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kDeZv.png" alt="Deactivation problems"  So you might be best contacting them.  <comment115165> Are you using Creative Cloud or is it a disc install? <comment115167> Its a full desktop app install; not creative cloud. I have updated the question to reflect this. Thanks for pointing out. <comment115168> I have lost activations due to drive failure, if you read the TOS you should be allowed at least two activations. 1 for main the the other for a backup machine. As far as I can tell you are only allowed these two activations, both are used and neither is deactivated your SOL. I'd suggest calling Adobe, and plead your case, though I have not had much luck doing so in the past. <comment115170> @hoss Thanks for the info. I'd have imagined adobe having a plan in place to handle such scenarios. So essentially, If I did lose my activation due to a bad HD, Im left with a single activation and will not be able to load it on to a second computer? <comment115171> you will have to read the TOS or EULA http://www.adobe.com/go/eulas and http://www.adobe.com/go/activation to know for sure, but if you are granted two activations and have used one you should be able to install one more time. <comment115175> @hoss You are correct. I was told that I will be allowed 2 installs at the time of purchase. But at the end of it all, I am still bound to lose one activation. Is there no way of salvaging this? Thanks! <comment115176> Aha.....Thanks! Bad link though. <comment115177> When I had this problem (computer replaced under warranty) they reset my activations without a problem. <comment115178> oops, link is fixed now. <comment115196> Thanks again Hoss. The chat guys sorted it out for me! <comment115283> No worries. Glad you got it sorted.
