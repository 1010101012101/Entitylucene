How to set inbox sync time range in Mail? <body> When I setup an email account in Mail seems like Mail insists on downloading the tens of thousands of emails I have between now and years way back. How do I tell it to sync only in a specific time range like 3 months for example?

Yikes that's bad news... <comment133089> However, gmail has a workaround to prevent too many downloads over IMAP.
