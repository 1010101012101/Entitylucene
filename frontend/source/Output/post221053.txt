Disable video preview/quicklook in Finder <body> Playing video within QuickTime or "Finder preview" crashes my OS X (10.9, Maverick).  I simply want to disable this feature, even if it means disabling all filetype preview (picture, video, mail, pdf...)  Is there a way to disable preview in the finder (right pane) and quicklook (space bar) ?  Is there a daemon (com.apple.*), kernel extension that I can disable or a preference (plist file) that I can edit to achieve this ?  <answer221065> You can turn off the preview pane in Finder windows (column view) by going to Veiw: Show View Options (âŒ˜+J) and unchecking Show Preview Column. This will disable video auto-play but I think your real issue is with a corrupted QuickLook or QuickTime preferences file. To find out if the root cause is as I surmise, create a folder on your desktop and move these files from /Library/Preferences (if you have them) into itbr com.apple.quicklookconfig.plistbr com.apple.QuickLookDaemon.plistbr com.apple.quicktime.plugin.preferences.plistbr com.apple.QuickTimePlayerX.LSSharedFileList.plistbr com.apple.QuickTimePlayerX.SandboxedPersistentURLs.LSSharedFileList.plistbr  then restart &amp; see if the problem persists. Let us know the results please.
