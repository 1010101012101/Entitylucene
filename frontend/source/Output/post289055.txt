copying xcode installations from one machine to another <body> I have installed 3 different versions of Xcode we use on a mac.  Can I just copy the /Applications/xcode* directories that I created from the mac and put it on other 10 macs I have? I dont want to go through the hassle of downloading and installing it again.  Has anyone done this successfully?  NOTE: I saw another question on copying to an external drive. I am NOT doing that. Just copying from one machine to another and keeping the installations in /Applications folder  <answer289093> You can copy the Xcode application from /Applications folder of one machine  to another machine. No problem , it will work. But i recommend you to copy the xcode to desktop(or some other folder otherthan /Applications ) of the second machine initially and then move to /Applications folder.  <comment365112> @shallowThought Thanks. Have you successfully done that before? <comment365114> I think I was wrong. I do copy stuff on the same machine. It will probably not work on another machine. At least not without downloading all simulators and other stuff. Sorry. <comment365204> Please explain the rational of "_But i recommend you to copy the xcode to desktop(or some other folder otherthan /Applications ) of the second machine initially and then move to /Applications folder_" <comment365242> @Aadu Thoma: yes, could you let me know why that is needed? <comment366543> Technically i don't know , but i had tried that before and worked for me.
