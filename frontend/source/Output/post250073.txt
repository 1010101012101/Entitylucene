MacBook 2016 randomly turns black every couple of minutes with external Display attached <body> It seems like a reset and is happening a dozen times per hour. It happen via HDMI on my Dell U3415W and on a low resolution projector (1024x768px), i used the original Apple adapter but also the Minix.    Sometimes when it returns i have heavy artifacts on the display and have to unplug/plug the hdmi again for normal operation.  <answer269487> This issue was fixed with macOS Sierra 10.12.2 (16C679)  <comment310708> This shouldn't be happening. Did you contact Apple about this? This might be a defect with the onboard or external graphic card. <comment310762> not yet, will try that and update this post <comment329284> I have had this problem with 2 different MacBook 2016's and numerous Dell monitors, all connected by HDMI via Apple's Digital Multiport Adapter. <comment344411> I've updated to Sierra 10.12.3 and the problem remains. It goes black even more often
