Trouble setting up Profiles, Messages, etc, on macOS Server <body> We got a Mac Mini to setup for out small office. I was hoping to seize upon the nice features that macOS Server provides; Profile Manager being one of the larger targets. However, I have not been able to use the Default Configuration Profile or Remote Managment with any Mac in the office.  Browsing to https://my.mac.lan/mydevices allows all the users to log in and download the .mobileconfig files, but the install of remote management fails with this error:  precodeThe profile “Remote Management (com.apple.config.my.mac.lan.mdm:12E23681-D132-4FC1-81AD ED501D47A222)” could not be installed due to an unexpected error. &lt;MDMResponseStatus:-1202&gt; /code/pre  The Default Configuration Profile will install on all the machines, but the Jabber server, mail, contacts, calendar, etc, don't work. For example when you go to turn jabber on in messages, you will get this error:  precodeMessages can’t log in to user@my.mac.lan because your login ID or password is incorrect. /code/pre  Which is not true, for any of the users.  There is one thing I just noticed in System SettingsProfiles, that the name of the profile has the hostname.local from when I installed Sierra, not the hostname I setup. I am very confused.  Thanks for your help.
