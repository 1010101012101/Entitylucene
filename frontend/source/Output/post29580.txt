How do I make Spotlight stop indexing my Backup drive? <body> I have a 2TB external drive I use for Time Machine. At random intervals, it will decide to spin up and my entire UI freezes until it's finished. This is emincredibly/em annoying.  It appears that this is due to Spotlight indexing. They suggest adding the Backup drive to Spotlight's blacklist, so I did:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8ItHM.jpg" alt="fffffffuuuuuuuuu"  Am I stuck having to live with constant beach ball attacks?  strongUpdate: I've already tried mdutil. It doesn't work./strong  precode$ sudo mdutil -E -i off /Volumes/Backup/Backups.backupdb/ Password: /Volumes/Backup/Backups.backupdb:     Indexing enabled. /code/pre  If it's impossible to disable indexing, I would settle for making the backup drive never spin down.  <answer29581> Do it from emTerminal/em via emsudo/em (info courtesy this page):  precodesudo mdutil -a -i off /code/pre  You'll also need to supply your admin password.  Similarly, to turn back on:  precodesudo mdutil -a -i on /code/pre  strongNote:/strong Set the items for Spotlight to show at strongPrefs/strong  strongSpotlight/strong  <answer29598> Create an empty file on the root of that drive, named code.metadata_never_index/code.  This Mac OS X Hints article says more.  <answer29600> Here's the man page for mdutil:  precodemdutil(1)                 BSD General Commands Manual                  NAME      mdutil -- manage the metadata stores used by Spotlight  SYNOPSIS      mdutil [-pEsav] [-i on | off] mountPoint ...  DESCRIPTION      The mdutil command is useful for managing the metadata stores for mounted volumes.       The following options are available:       -p  Spotlight caches indexes of some network devices locally.  This option requests that a local          caches be flushed to the appropriate network device.       -E  This flag will cause each local store for the volumes indicated to be erased.  The stores will          be rebuilt if appropriate.       -i on | off          Sets the indexing status for the provided volumes to on or off.  Note that indexing may be          delayed due to low disk space or other conditions.       -s  Display the indexing status of the listed volumes.       -a  Apply command to all volumes.       -v  Print verbose information when available. /code/pre  I would use:  precodemdutil -E -i off [the mountpoint for your backup drive] /code/pre  <answer211616> Apply it to the volume, not a directory:  codesudo mdutil -i off /Volumes/TimeMachine//code  Substitute codeTimeMachine/code with the name of your backup volume, of course. For example...  precodeJohns-iMac:~ john$ sudo mdutil -i off /Volumes/Time15/ Password: /Volumes/Time15: 2015-10-27 12:37:18.436 mdutil[56686:26121199] mdutil disabling Spotlight: /Volumes/Time15 -&gt; kMDConfigSearchLevelFSSearchOnly     Indexing and searching disabled. /code/pre  Which does leave the subdirectory reporting as "enabled", but (until proven wrong I understand) the setting at the volume level will override.  <answer229789> I finally found you cannot disable Spotlight to index codeBackups.backupdb/code.   Apple Support. OS X El Capitan: Spotlight preferences     If you add a Time Machine backup disk to the privacy list, you will   continue to see messages that Spotlight is indexing your backup disk.   This indexing is necessary for Time Machine to function properly and   canâ€™t be disabled. Spotlight does exclude from searches any items you   store on your backup disk that are not part of a Time Machine backup.   <comment33949> You probably should include a command for turning it back on. <comment33950> `mdutil` also refuses to turn off Time Machine indexing. <comment33951> @daviesgeek, good point - I thought it would be reasonably obvious (and was covered in the article) <comment33967> Did you try it? Because mdutil says `Backups.backupdb` is still being indexed. <comment33969> I've already stated that mdutil leaves `Backups.backupdb` enabled no matter what. Did you try it? <comment34041> Yes.  On a flash drive, a camera flash-card and two .dmgs.  It works on all of them. <comment34200> it appears that Time Machine backups are a special case. <comment37596> "Your entire UI freezes" doesn't sound right. It's true that anything that accesses the drive  will have to wait for it to spin up, but the Spotlight indexer is a background process which the UI shouldn't be waiting for. Is it possible that there is something *other than Spotlight* which is using the drive? <comment37736> @Kevin I agree, it makes no sense. But it isn't limited to any particular app, and frequently occurs when doing something that has _nothing to do with the backup drive_ whatsoever. The drive simply decides at random intervals that it needs to spin up, and whatever I am doing freezes until it completes. <comment119434> You shouldn't turn spotlight off for your main drive unless you know the consequences, such as App Store upgrades will never work again, email searches won't work (if using Apple Mail), etc. Spotlight is a real nuisance but required by the OS for a number of things. <comment177540> Did you (or anyone else) ever find a solution to this problem? <comment178141> @Hemm no, I had to resort to ejecting the drive when I wasn't backing up to keep it from freezing my UI. Pretty lame.
