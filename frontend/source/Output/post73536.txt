Can an iPhone act as an audio source to a Mac? <body> Is there a way to pull the audio from an iphone phone call to a mac either via bluetooth or USB? In other words, use the mac and a cellular phone hybrid?  I'd like to be able to record a phone call or voice mail to the mac.    I realize i could do this many other ways including using an true phone hybrid, but I'd like to keep the amount of equipment i have to take when traveling.  I'm sure i could also use a TRRS Y cable from the headphone/mic jack into my mac, but i'd also like to keep it in the digital realm.   <answer73537> Yes, you can do it, but you would require some professional paid apps for it like blue phone elite or phone amego.
