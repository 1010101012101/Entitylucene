Force Samba service to start before Apache <body>    I'm trying to use a Apache-based application which depends on NFS and   Samba shares to access files on a remote server (the application will then use WebDAV to access the files).      I wanted to drop the use of NFS because I'm having issues I can't fix,   but I'm told NFS is guaranteed to start before Apache, and Samba is   not.   The question is: how can I force codelaunchd/code to either wait for Samba to start (preferred) or to wait a ridiculous amount of time before starting Apache (like 120s or so).  Is code&lt;key&gt;Provides&lt;key&gt;/code and code&lt;key&gt;Requires&lt;key&gt;/code valid on a .plist ? Can edit Apache and Samba to add a new dependency between them?  If not, how can I achieve a similar effect?  Thanks in Advance.
