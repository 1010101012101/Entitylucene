Outlook 2011, displaying error messages <body> I am trying to set up a new account on Outlook 2011. I have filled all the details in but nothing seems to happen and the account has a yellow ball next to it on the accounts window. There are no error messages and bottom right of the Inbox window says (without ever changing)  precodeconnecting to "Account 1" /code/pre  If there is an error I'd like to see it, but Errors and Progress windows show nothing. How can I debug this?  <comment244890> Could you provide a little more information regarding the kind of account you are connecting? Is it a POP/IMAP account, Exchange, Office 365, etc? <comment244899> It's an exchange server. Thanks <comment245113> Things you'll want to check: Try recreating the account (or, build a new identity - recommended) to see if the behavior persists. If it does, is there something special required by your mail server, such as a nonstandard port, full username required, VPN, etc. to access it? You can also enable logging for Outlook by going to Outlook - Window - Sync Errors - Gear icon (upper-rgiht of Sync Errors window) - Turn on logging for troubleshooting. This will log info into your console which you can then check to see what the issue is. <comment245115> If you can, go ahead and rebuild the identity, then turn on logging first before creating the account. Add the account in, capture the log data, and post it here for review. :) Note that output will show up in the general Console window.
