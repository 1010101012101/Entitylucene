Needed: easy program for inserting symbols and Unicode characters <body> On MacOS 10.11 I am constantly going to the Emoji &amp; Symbol viewer to bring in arrows and other kinds of symbols:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1R1Ij.png" alt="enter image description here"  Problems with this interface include:  ul liIt it bound to the current program, rather than operating system level. So you need to make the window appear for each application you use./li liIt doesn't allow searching by Unichar/li liIt doesn't let you see the entire character set/li /ul  I'm looking for a program that keeps my favorite symbols all in one place in a floating window and lets me easily insert them into the current application. Does such a program exist?  <answer216675> Ultra Character Map should do what you want:  <answer217178> h1UnicodeChecker/h1  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pMWP5.png" alt="app screenshot" title="CC 2.0 by-nc / by â˜ƒ"  UnicodeChecker is an excellent app showing each of the possible Unicode characters. Search the more than 110,000 characters by name with a press of Command+F. Frequently updated to keep up with changes in the Unicode standard.  Use the codeFavorites/code menu to quickly access your frequently-used characters.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3YeC7.png" alt="favorites screenshot"  <comment261892> @TomGewecke Open for business now... :[) <comment262498> Even better!
