Eclipse STS re creates folders every time it is opened, may be due to file permissions <body> Ok, i have asked this question two times in stackoverflow two times, here and here.  I haven't gotten an answer, but after rethinking the problem i think it may be because of files / folders permissions, ok this is what it is happening.  Environment: eclipse STS 3.8.2 which run over java 1.8 and the SO is macOs Sierra.  when i open the IDE for first time it creates a folder in my home user called strong.eclipse/strong and inside a folder with the name strongorg.springsource.sts_3.8.2.RELEASE_562342862_macosx_cocoa_x86_64/strong. The IDE uses this folder to save configuration, plug-ins and so on, ok latter when i close the IDE and open it again, the IDE creates a new folder like the first but it changes the name like this strongorg.springsource.sts_3.8.2.RELEASE_562342586_macosx_cocoa_x86_64/strong and saves the configuration there, so all the previous configuration it is lost.   This leads to have a emfresh/em environment every time i open the IDE, so every plug-in installed it is lost. I have tried to copy and paste the content of one folder to another but the IDE ignores the files in there.  <answer263400> I was also facing the same issue. To resolve it I did the following steps.  ol liExtract the tar/zip file anywhere you want./li liDrag the STS.app file to "Applications"./li liNow you will see the STS application in launchpad also./li liNow you can start STS by clicking on this STS icon from launchpad/spotlight search./li /ol  It should resolve the issue.  <comment326007> Hmm - do you think this is a bug in eclipse how it saves settings or a bug in how STS asks the editor to save config? Either way, this looks like a bug and not something you can configure your way out of. I wonder if you were to sym link the newer folder when you discover it so your settings "persist" <comment326010> Hi,  i tried the previous version and the behavior it is the same, which did not happened in other mac. <comment330325> Thank you, it worked, i also commented your answer in the others posts.
