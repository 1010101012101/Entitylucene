In App Purchases Review Status <body> I have an app up for review that includes IAPs. The App has had the status of codeIn Review/code for three days now. When I went to the IAP page in iTunesConnect, I noticed that all my IAPs had been changed to codeDeveloper Action Needed/code. When I clicked on each of the IAPs, the english language was highlighted and they were marked as coderejected/code.  I went ahead a made a small change to each of the IAPs description and now all of them are in codeWaiting for Review/code. Today marks day two of the IAPs with the codeWaiting for Review/code status.  Is there something I need to do to get the review going? I have had no feedback from Apple and I am hesitant to upload a new binary, as that will push the review out for another week.  <answer225496> Yes, it takes time. Your in-app purchase should be approved before submitting your app to review. See Average App Store Review Times for waiting times.  <comment274441> Hello @Graham Miln I have a problem can you help here <comment274457> Feel free to [ask a new question](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/ask) to attract help.
