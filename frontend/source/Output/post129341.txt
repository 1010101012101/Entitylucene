New mac - installed tmux but can't use mouse in for pane switching <body> I have the required setw / setg setting for mouse in my .tmux.conf but they aren't working.  I've done codetmux source-file .tmux.conf/code  I can use tmux and split windows with my remapped keys and other settings that I have such as remapping the power key ARE working.  <answer129342> Turned out I was using tmux with the basic mac terminal app.  It emmostly/em worked but a few things didn't.  The mouse functionality is an example.  The answer was that I needed to download and use iterm2 as the actual terminal app to use tmux with.  Once I did this my tmux mouse settings worked fine with it.
