Sending invitation from Outlook to iCloud calendar for all-day events <body> I sent myself (i.e. to my home iCloud account) invitations from my (work) Exchange account for several multi-day all-day events.  However, when the invitations arrived, the calendar on my iPhone and Mac treated it as a series of 24-hour events rather than all-day events.  Is this a problem with Outlook or with iCloud? Can I fix it? I noticed that I could not modify the event I was invited to in the calendar.
