Executing program through Terminal <body> I have Sage (math program) and I want to execute it through terminal.  I know I can go to the directory and execute it with -   precodeopen Sage.app /code/pre  But would I really want to do is simply type sage in terminal and have it run. I believe this is a fairly simple task, but I just don't have any idea! Thanks.  <answer55802> You need an strongalias/strong. Typing codealias sage='open /PATH/TO/Sage.app'/code will create an alias which will do exactly what you want, run the program just by typing codesage/code. The problem is that this will only last until you close that terminal window (bash). So, you need to create that alias each time you run a new bash. To do so, just:   ol liCreate or modify a text file called code.bash_profile/code in your home directory./li liAdd codealias sage='open /PATH/TO/Sage.app'/code on it/li liSave the file/li liLoad the file once by typing code. ~/.bash_profile/code/li /ol  Remember that it will be case sensitive, so if you type codeSage/code (instead of codesage/code) it won't work.  <answer55804> You need to create a shell script named codesage/code containing:  precode#!/bin/bash open /Applications/Sage.app /code/pre  I suggest creating a codebin/code directory in your home folder, and storing any scripts you create there. Save the script there with the name codesage/code, then execute codechmod u+x sage/code to give your user permission to execute the script.  Now, the last step is to tell bash that it should include any scripts found in code~/bin/code in your path. To do this edit code~/.bash_profile/code. You can do codenano ~/.bash_profile/code or use any text editor you like. Add this to the file:  precode# Prepend ~/bin to the PATH variable export PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH" /code/pre  Save and close code.bash_profile/code, restart bash, and you should be able launch Sage.app by typing codesage/code.  strongEDIT:/strong An alias, like the other answer said, is probably a cleaner approach (1 less file to keep track of) if you don't need the logic of a script and just want to launch the app.  I've gotten used to doing it this way as most often I find myself passing a lot of parameters that don't change to an executable, but 1 or 2 that might. So I write the script to accept just those parameters and insert them in the right places when calling the executable. Just something to keep in mind.  <comment64047> Please try to avoid recommending the creation of new folders within the user's home directory, many people might want to keep a clean sorted home folder, and would prefer other solutions, like just using /bin (for example) <comment64055> @XAleXOwnZX - creating a new folder under home is much cleaner than writing to /bin - If you use command line binarieies and scripts you need a directory that you can write to without affecting other users <comment64056> /bin is a great place for scripts meant for all users or the system in general, but user-specific scripts should really reside somewhere within the home directory. Creating a ~/bin folder makes them much easier to manage and backup. Also, I think it's too much of an assumption to assume that the OP has privileges to write to /bin or /usr/bin. <comment64058> at least make a hidden folder _
