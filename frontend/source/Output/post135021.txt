Cannot open Super Crate Box <body> After downloading Super Crate Box from the website www.supercratebox.com, the following dialog box appears when I try to open it.img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0mnbC.png" alt="enter image description here"  Using OS X 10.9.3 on a 2013 MacBook Air. I have tried using different browsers to download the file and saving it in different locations.  <answer135208> That file is corrupt and is damaged on the server. Send their tech support an email with this info and ask if they have noticed the issue.  <answer135300> Try uncompressing the file with a different app. When I used the otherwise great Keka, I would get these same kind of errors after uncompressing apps. I recommend The Unarchiver as I have not heard of this problem happening with it.  <answer141558> I was finally able to fix this after searching and searching other programs that had this error. I used the command codexattr/code to remove the extended attributes on the file.   precodesudo xattr -rc Super\ Crate\ Box.app/ /code/pre  The program then opens and runs as it should!  <comment160017> try the version from iTune store. <comment160365> The download from the site today is corrupt - everyone that downloads it now gets the same error. <comment223950> Doesn't work. Although it allows the app to launch, it breaks the save feature.
