My Mid-2015 Macbook Pro no longer rapid charges my Nexus 6P over USB, why? <body> The USB3.0 ports on my mid-2015 Macbook Pro always charged my Nexus 6P "rapidly" (as reported by the phone), meaning at 2100mA+ or so. However, a couple months ago (around January/February), this stopped happening. The Nexus 6P now charges "slowly", at a paltry 100mA, as measured with the Ampere app.   Looking at the system report, one finds that the Nexus 6P is only requesting 500mA from the MBP, with no extra operating current either.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/44LaW.png" alt="No extra operating current requested by Nexus 6P."  What changed?  h2Possiblilities/h2  ul liCould it be the phone? Not likely - I tested with a friend's Nexus 6P. Same slow charge rate. And besides, the phone charges rapidly from the wall charger just fine. I could possibly cross post this to the Android Stack Overflow./li liCould it be the USB cable? Not likely - I tried two brand new USB3.1 cables, both of them this cable recommended by Benson Leung. This model of cable used to charge my phone rapidly./li liCould it be a hardware issue with the laptop? Possibly. I have not tried charging from another Macbook PRO, but I will try this with a friend's. Regardless, both of my USB ports charge the phone at the same speed./li liCould it be a OS update or setting that changed? This is what I'm hoping. Are there hidden USB settings I can access? A console command I can set to change the way OSX handles its USB ports?/li /ul  <comment332275> Happened to me too a while back, with my mid-2014 rMBP. Let me know if you have a solution.
