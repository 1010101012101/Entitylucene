Securely remove files from an NTFS drive? <body> I have an external NTFS drive, and I want to securely remove some files from it. SRM is no longer available in Sierra. I tried to install SRM with Homebrew, and did install it successfully, but when I apply the command to an external drive I get an error: "Segmentation fault: 11" What can I do?  I do not use software like Paragon NTFS to enable write on the drive. Instead I do this in Terminal:  precodesudo nano /etc/fstab /code/pre  Add the following line to nano, replacing “NAME” with the label of your NTFS drive:  precodeLABEL=NAME none ntfs rw,auto,nobrowse /code/pre  kbdCtrl/kbd+kbdO/kbd then the Enter key, then kbdCtrl/kbd+kbdX/kbd to close nano.  <answer275879> Use gshred. Install homebrew if not installed from www.brew.sh. Then do   precodebrew install coreutils /code/pre  to remove files, do  precodegshred -u &lt;file1&gt; &lt;file2&gt; /code/pre  <answer275883> You can use coderm/code with the code-P/code option which will overwrite the file prior to deleting it.  From the man page:     Overwrite regular files before deleting them.  Files are overwritten   three times, first with the byte pattern 0xff, then 0x00, and then   0xff again, before they are deleted   It's not a DoD 7 pass wipe, but fairly secure nonetheless.  So, your command would be:  coderm -P /path/to/foo.bar/code  And it will do a triple overwrite before removal.  <comment347113> What software do you use to write to the NTFS drive? <comment347115> Actually I don't use software. I did option 3 on this website: https://www.howtogeek.com/236055/how-to-write-to-ntfs-drives-on-a-mac/ <comment347130> Is this secure removal? How many passes is it? <comment347143> 3 by default. Check the parameters "man gshred". "-n N overwrite N times instead of the default (3)" <comment347144> Well it is as secure removal as srm - good enough in most cases if the file  system  overwrites        data  in  place. <comment347145> If you need to remove "really" secure, overwrite the whole hard disk with random data. Never use tools on mounted filesystems. There are too many ways this can go wrong. <comment347147> On current hard drives, a few passes are sufficient for high security wipes due to the high data density. Keep in mind that the drives have a lot of electronic inside that remaps data, so if you have _really really_ important data on the drive, you should really physically destroy it if you want to securely remove the content.
