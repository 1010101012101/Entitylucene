How to activate TLS 1.0 in Adobe Acrobat on Mac? <body> I've an issue with filling out an interactive PDF in Adobe Acrobat, so I was suggested to do the following steps in order to fix/activate the authenticate process:     ol   liClick on Edit in the Toolbar/li   liClick on Preferences at the foot of the menu./li   liIn the Categories on the left hand side click on Internet and then Internet Settings./li   liInternet Properties opens and in the tabs at the top click Advanced./li   liScroll to the bottom and you should see 'Use SSL 2.0 Use SSL 3.0 etc. Make sure TLS 1.0 is ticked./li   liOnce ticked click apply and OK at the bottom of the box and it is all done./li   /ol   Unfortunately these steps are for Windows.  So my question is, what are the equivalent steps for OS X to enable TLS 1.0?  I'm using Adobe Acrobat Reader DC 2015.008.x, but at the point when clicking 'Internet/Network Settings...' it opens Network in System Preferences equivalent to Internet Settings in Windows, so this setting may be not specifically to Adobe it-self.  <comment242697> I don't think you will find any browsers on OSX that don't have TLS enabled by default. <comment242703> @nfechner It's actually not for the browser, but this is required for interactive PDF to fill out the form securely using Adobe Reader. <comment242753> Which Acrobat version are you using? <comment242759> Adobe Acrobat Reader DC 2015.008.x, but at the point when clicking 'Internet/Network Settings...' it opens Network in System Preferences equivalent to Internet Settings in Windows.
