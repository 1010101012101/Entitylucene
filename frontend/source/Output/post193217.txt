How to change the hostname for the Xcode service on Mac Server <body> I needed to change the hostname of the server I have setup after I started the Xcode service. My server is currently named as follows...  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Cj8TS.png" alt="I have my server configured like the following image."  Except, to view the Xcode service I still need to enter the old hostname (with hyphens), I have tried rebooting the computer and the service, no luck.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/egun2.png" alt="enter image description here"  How do I change the hostname that is displayed in the "Status" field?  <answer193275> It is easiest in the Terminal. SSH into the server and then at the command line :-  precodesudo scutil --set HostName new_name /code/pre  You will be asked for your password and then the name will be changed.  <answer193773> This ended up just being an inconsistency in the UI.  I was trying to give my server the computer name codeServer Mac 1/code with the hostname codeServerMac1/code.  But it seems like the wizard that allows you to type in the hostname field totally ignores what you typed when you click Save and instead takes the computer name field as the hostname. It then replaces spaces with '-'.  I ended up entering the computer name as codeServerMac1/code and now the hostname is also codeServerMac1/code.
