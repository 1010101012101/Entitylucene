Why do I get this every time I want to see my pictures and what can I do? <body> Why does this error appear? I've been trying to download them but I can't. It's been a month. I can only see the pictures I took with the camera and not the one I saved to iCloud.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qrCV6.png" width="280"   <comment373176> Are you able to sign into [iCloud.com](http://icloud.com)? Select photos and see if your pictures are there
