Change Connected Servers <body> I have two Synology Diskstations in my list of Connected Servers. Disk station-5 and Diskstation-8 (see image). Now I want to change the user name for these connected servers and I want these connected servers to connect when I boot my laptop or desktop. I simply cannot get it done. Every time the servers are not connected and when I try to connect the old user name appears. Anyone ?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/r3Bjm.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer204484> Make sure the password is cleared in your login Keychain. Open the Keychain Access utility (spotlight  Keychain Access). IN the left hand panes, select strongKeychains  login/strong and strongCategory  All items/strong. Now search for strongdiskstation/strong in the top right to filter the results.  sDelete the offending keychain entries./s  Change the username and password for these entries so as not to disrupt anything else going on with those servers.  <answer204548> After deleting the keychain entries with the old user name you may use several methods to mount your shares automatically:  ol liLogin Items:  ul limount the two shares with the new username/password and save the new password in the keychain/li liopen System Preferences - Users &amp; Groups - your current user - Login Items/li lidrag the two shares to the list/li /ul/li liauto_mount:  ul licheck this question and answer and probably several others here at apple.se /li /ul/li /ol  <comment246470> that helped !! But now the disk station is not "automatically" connected. What I want is that the disk stations connect when I boot the laptop/desktop. How can I arrange that ? It used to do that ... <comment246480> Which kind of protocol do you use to mount your shares? afp, smb or nfs? <comment246545> AFP. This always worked. <comment246553> I have deleted the disk stations from my keychain. Now I can connect again to my disk stations with this new username. But I still have to "click" every time on the disk stations (shared servers) in finder to reconnect them when i want. How can I have the disk stations connected automatically and stay connected ? <comment246686> You can add them in System Preferences  Users & Groups  Login Items (for your user account) <comment246704> ad 1. If I try to add the shares to the "login items" list I have to add all the folders on my disk stations ??? <comment246706> If I try to add the shares to the "login items" list I have to add all the folders on my disk stations ??? <comment246713> @JanScherders If you have several shares on one disk station it depends you. If you need a 2nd or a 3rd share immediately then yes. But after mounting the 1st all other shares on the disk station are also available via Side Bar - Shares - diskstation-x - ... <comment246717> Adding one share should add the server as a connection. Probably the thing to do originally (I'll edit my answer) was to have you *change* the username/password in the Keychain, not delete. That was shortsighted of me.
