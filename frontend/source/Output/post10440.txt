Using TextEdit for HTML <body> I feel stupid for not being able to answering myself this...  Is there a way to open a HTML file in TextEdit emwithout/em it rendering the file but just showing it as source (and possibly edit it)?  <answer10441> Use the kbd⇧/kbdkbd⌘/kbdkbdT/kbd key combination to render the document you're viewing as plaintext instead of WYSIWYG.  <answer10443> It is in TextEdit help - search for HTML     If you open an HTML file and don’t see the HTML code, TextEdit is displaying the file in the same way a browser would. You can choose to display the file’s HTML code instead.      To display the code in an HTML file:      Choose File  Open.      Select “Ignore rich text commands.”      Locate the file and click Open.      To always view the code in HTML files,   choose TextEdit  Preferences, click   “Open and Save,” and then select   “Ignore rich text commands in HTML   files” below “When Opening a File.”   So it seems you have to choose before opening the file.  <comment10969> Thanks, but this just strips fonts etc. from the file, but does not show the html source (tags etc.). <comment10975> Looks like you can make that a permanent setting TextEdit - Preferences... and then click the 'Open and Save' tab and you'll see a checkbox to check to turn on 'Ignore rich text commands in HTML files' when opening a new file. <comment10976> Until now, that's the best I thought you could get with TextEdit. <comment10977> Yes I meant that you have to choose that in preferences or on opening file - so both before/on opening and not when you have it open <comment10978> Yes, and I appreciate it. I didn't downvote you! <comment10979> Thanks, great! It's a bit like choosing the way the file is encoded. <comment10981> @DaG: down votes don't really worry me. :)
