Oops, I broke my MBR, what do I do? <body> I installed Mavericks a couple weeks ago and discovered to my dismay that last night, I couldn't boot into my windows install via bootcamp. I'd encountered this problem before, and without entirely understanding it, I fixed it using gdisk, and the directions located here.  So naturally (and foolishly) I looked up that page and followed the directions, and bam. I can't get into either Mac or Windows.  Presumably then there's a problem with my guid partition table or my MBR, or both. I'm using the apple internet recovery tool and the terminal won't let me run the version of gdisk I had previously downloaded. It gives me "Illegal instruction 4" when I try.  I have maybe 4 partitions: 1. mac osx, 2. mac recovery, 3. a 15 gb partition for storage, and 30 gb windows partition.  I've posted the results of gpt show and diskutil list. Past that, I'm a little lost. I've got a windows box I can install ubuntu or some other recovery tool on, but people were saying ubuntu will write to disk and ruin things. Suggestions?  precode-bash-3.2# gpt show disk0       start       size  index  contents           0          1         MBR           1          1         Pri GPT header           2         32         Pri GPT table          34          6                   40     409600      1  GPT part - C12A7328-F81F-11D2-BA4B-00A0C93EC93B      409640  146496248      2  GPT part - 48465300-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC   146905888    1269536      3  GPT part - 426F6F74-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC   148175424       1472            148176896   29284352      4  GPT part - EBD0A0A2-B9E5-4433-87C0-68B6B72699C7   177461248   59514880      5  GPT part - EBD0A0A2-B9E5-4433-87C0-68B6B72699C7   236976128       2015            236978143         32         Sec GPT table   236978175          1         Sec GPT header -bash-3.2# diskutil list /dev/disk0    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *121.3 GB   disk0    1:                        EFI                         209.7 MB   disk0s1    2:                  Apple_HFS Macintosh HD            75.0 GB    disk0s2    3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s3    4:       Microsoft Basic Data MACINTOSH H             15.0 GB    disk0s4    5:       Microsoft Basic Data BOOTCAMP                30.5 GB    disk0s5 /dev/disk1    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:     Apple_partition_scheme                        *1.2 GB     disk1    1:        Apple_partition_map                         30.7 KB    disk1s1    2:                  Apple_HFS Mac OS X Base System    1.2 GB     disk1s2 /dev/disk2    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:                            untitled               *524.3 KB   disk2 /dev/disk3    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:                            untitled               *524.3 KB   disk3 /dev/disk4    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:                            untitled               *524.3 KB   disk4 /dev/disk5    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:                            untitled               *524.3 KB   disk5 /dev/disk6    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:                            untitled               *524.3 KB   disk6 /dev/disk7    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:                            untitled               *6.3 MB     disk7 /dev/disk8    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:                            untitled               *2.1 MB     disk8 /dev/disk9    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:                            untitled               *1.0 MB     disk9 /dev/disk10    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:                            untitled               *524.3 KB   disk10 /dev/disk11    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:                            untitled               *524.3 KB   disk11 /dev/disk12    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:                            untitled               *1.0 MB     disk12 /code/pre  <comment143546> Did you try simple things like Safe booth, or single user mode or recovery mode "cmd-r" <comment143551> don't have an immediate answer for you on this; however, officially with bootcamp, you should not have 4 partitions only the OSX, Recovery and Bootcamp, anything else will indeed cause issues.
