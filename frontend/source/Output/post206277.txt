How can I automatically add music from a playlist into a folder? <body> I am switching from the default music player on my iPhone to using Spotify to play music. The recent updates have meant that I can't use the music player in the same as I used to and I much prefer Spotify in general.I still want to use iTunes on my Mac to organise playlists.  What I need to set up is essentially a reverse smart playlist. I have 2000 songs in my iTunes library but I only want 500 of those on my phone. Is there a way to have the songs that get put into my smart playlist (that gets synced to my phone) getting automatically copied into a folder in Finder and have that as the 'Local File Source' in Spotify? Or would I just have to do this manually?  Hopefully that makes sense, and any kind of help would be awesome!  Thanks  <answer214776> You could use an AppleScript to copy the music to a specific folder. iTunes and the Finder both support AppleScript.  Use the included strongScript Editor.app/strong in OS X to create your script. A starting point for your script is below:  precodetell application "iTunes"      -- Get the recent purchases smart playlist     set myPlaylistFiles to file tracks of playlist "Recent Purchases"      -- With every local song/track     repeat with i from 1 to number of items in myPlaylistFiles          set localTrack to item i of myPlaylistFiles          set myPathToTrack to location of localTrack          -- Add copy to folder code hereâ€¦              end repeat  end tell /code/pre  Feel free to ask more questions about finishing this AppleScript.
