MacBook HD "Other" all of a sudden almost full <body> As you can see in the below image, my HD "Other" category is almost full. A couple of days ago, I randomly kept getting a popup saying that my disk was almost full. Then I went in and noticed the issue in the image. I ran the repair disk utility and got all my software up to date, to no avail. Haven't found any help on Google. Any ideas?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mbcJR.png" alt=""  <answer42853> Not sure whether you've already found this, but there are a number of other people having the same issue on the Apple Discussion Groups. There seems to be quite a lot of good information in that thread so I recommend reading it through, but the consensus seems to be that its hidden local backups/snapshots that's causing it.  A few people also used DaisyDisk to find, then delete, hidden space on the hard disk.  <answer42865> I've also noticed on my copy of Lion that it lists anything as "Other" that it doesn't identify to be part of OSX's categorisations. For example I have 25GB of mkv files in my Movies folder, but OSX only sees as me having 7.46GB of movies...  <answer44410> I had a similar issue and finally found the cause of the problem. My mail app had issues connecting to one of my email accounts and I found it was storing all of the error messages (900+ GB worth).  Check to see if your having the same problem:  ul liOpen finder/li lipress command, shift, g/li litype      ~/Library/li lipress go/li lilocate &amp; check the size of your mail folder (mine was 900+ GB!!!)/li lidelete files/li /ul  Hope that helps!  <answer44889> Have you tried booting up from the recovery partition and repairing the disk in Disk Utility? That just solved a similar issue I was having.  <answer44891> Could it be that you have a bundle image on this drive that is always mounted?   Although not full these can only be shrunk when unmounted - and therefore it might just keep growing...  <answer65902> Try this delete unnecessary (old) mobile device backups:  ul liIn iTunes, go Preferences/Devices and view your device backups/li liDelete unneeded copies of device back ups. /li /ul  Depending on the number of iOS upgrades you did in the past this will regain a bunch of GBs.    <answer66289> Try OmniDiskSweeper, to see a hierarchical view of your entire HDD (or partition) based on the files and folders size.     OmniDiskSweeper is really great at what it does: showing you the files on your drive, in descending order by size, and letting you delete them easily!   And itâ€™s free.  <answer82933> This also can be a temporary situation.  I've been doing a lot of restoring of Time Machine backups to new machines and for a handful of minutes to a several hours after the restore is done, this tool reports other when in reality a good chunk of space should (and will eventually) be shown to be music, apps and movies.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NpYn5.png" alt="enter image description here"  The picture above looked very similar to yours when I first checked. Unlike spotlight, which shows indexing progress and will incrementally refine search results as new space and files are indexed, System Information takes a momentary snapshot. If you leave that window open and come back in a day - it won't have changed, but if you quit and re-open it, you should see the categorization completed and a truer representation of space.  So, I would also suspect that sometimes the process storing this data could be buggy and a reboot/reinstall/other might be needed to clean things up and re-start the process that determines which file type is using space.  <answer122421> I have been manually backing up files from a dying MBP and noticed 49GB+ of images in strong~/Library/Container/com.apple.Preview/Data/strong folder. Some of these images were over 2 years old. I'd recommend digging through the folders inside the containers and see what other applications have created copies of your files.  <answer228791> I know this is thread is old, but I was experiencing the same problem on my Macbook Pro on El Capitan. Using OmniDiskSweeper was awesome but I found the high quality transcoded media files from Final Cut Pro X were massive, so I did a huge project clean up and it gave me an extra 200gb of free space.  <comment48741> Interesting... Just had a look on this page. Never knew that I had 13.54 EB (1 Exabyte = 1,000,000 TB) of movies and videos... <comment48755> I second the recommendation of DaisyDisk - it's a fantastic product. <comment51203> Yeah, didn't help though <comment51204> I don't use mac mail, but I will check other folders though, thanks! <comment77522> 229 GB are used with "other", do you really think deleting a few mobile device backups of 5-10 GB (for large ones) help here? <comment95588> possible duplicate of [How can I figure out what's slowly eating my HD space?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/5353/how-can-i-figure-out-whats-slowly-eating-my-hd-space) <comment95609> @Mark I'd say no - one is more about what process and other tools can measure things. This could be a temporary issue or a bug or a call for other tools. Let's leave both open for now. <comment284396> How does this improve on other answers - it might be better to edit them <comment353558> Possible duplicate of [How can I figure out what's slowly eating my HD space?](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/5353/how-can-i-figure-out-whats-slowly-eating-my-hd-space)
