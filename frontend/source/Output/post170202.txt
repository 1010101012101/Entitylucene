Mac Pro, Yosemite 10.10.2 <body> Can't rename LV (Logical Volume) Name:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pl53L.png" alt="enter image description here"  I cannot change LV Name neither in Finder or via Terminal. The name looks strange, thanks to my 2.5 years daughter. I have no idea how she changed the name, but it happened. If I try to rename simply in Finder, the message is that I should use either smaller number of symbols or avoid using commas et cetera. This message appears even if I try to use a single symbol like 'd' as a new name.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FKKME.png" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KAwaS.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer170210> Try to rename it issuing this command on the terminal as a privileged user:  precodediskutil CoreStorage rename (uuid of the logical volume) NewName /code/pre  <comment200075> Changing the name in the first place was easy - a 2-year-old could do it ;-) Select HD, hit Enter, lean on keyboard; renaming ends when Enter is hit again, or anything else is clicked on. Random, but easy to do.
