Will installation of macports automatically install or update OpenSSL? <body> I am a mac user and want to stay with the system-provided version of OpenSSL, which is OpenSSL 0.9.8y. I am wondering if installation of macports will automatically update my OpenSSL or install another version?  Also, how can I check the version of the OpenSSL library on my mac instead of the version of the OpenSSL command? Do they always have the same version? Thanks!  <answer135247> MacPort will only install binaries you asked him to install using codesudo port install/code.  To know your openSSL version, just type codeopenssl version/code.   <answer142158> MacPorts will not replace your system-provided version of OpenSSL. If you install OpenSSL using MacPorts, it will do so in a separate prefix (by default code/opt/local/code).  To check the version of the OpenSSL library, run code/path/to/openssl version/code where code/path/to/openssl/code is the path of the OpenSSL binary that corresponds to the library you want to check, e.g. code/usr/bin/openssl/code for the system OpenSSL in code/usr/lib/libssl.dylib/code and code/opt/local/bin/openssl/code for the MacPorts OpenSSL in code/opt/local/lib/libssl.dylib/code.  You can also check the OpenSSL library version directly using  precode$&gt; strings /path/to/libssl.dylib | grep -E '^OpenSSL' /code/pre  e.g. for MacPorts:  precode$&gt; strings /opt/local/lib/libssl.dylib | grep -E '^OpenSSL' OpenSSL 1.0.1i 6 Aug 2014 /code/pre  and for system OpenSSL:  precode$&gt; strings /usr/lib/libssl.dylib | grep -E '^OpenSSL' OpenSSL 0.9.8y 5 Feb 2013 /code/pre
