Open terminal using a keyboard shortcut <body> I am using Alfred and hence I don't have any use for the kbdCmd/kbd+kbdSpace/kbd keyboard shortcut. I want to invoke terminal using that shortcut. Just like in Ubuntu, when you press kbdCtrl/kbd+kbdAlt/kbd+kbdT/kbd, is there a way to start terminal like that in OS X Mavericks?  P.S. I don't want to use Alfred to start the terminal. I just want to press kbdCmd/kbd+kbdSpace/kbd and I want the terminal to appear just like it would in Ubuntu.  <answer120300> h2strongKeyboard Maestro/strong/h2  You can do this with Keyboard Maestro, using a macro such as this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/inxMl.png"  h2Alfred/h2  You can set up a custom hotkey to launch an app using a workflow:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NTU2K.png" width="400"  Go to the workflows tab, create a new workflow and add a hotkey and a 'launch apps' with Terminal selected as the app to launch.  h2KeyRemap4MacBook/h2  You can use KeyRemap4MacBook with a private.xml such as this:  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt; &lt;root&gt;   &lt;vkopenurldef&gt;     &lt;name&gt;KeyCode::VK_OPEN_URL_Terminal&lt;/name&gt;     &lt;url&gt;file:///Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app&lt;/url&gt;   &lt;/vkopenurldef&gt;   &lt;item&gt;     &lt;name&gt;Activate Terminal with ⌘Space&lt;/name&gt;     &lt;identifier&gt;ActivateTerminalWithCmdSpace&lt;/identifier&gt;     &lt;autogen&gt;       __KeyToKey__       KeyCode::SPACE, VK_COMMAND | ModifierFlag::NONE,       KeyCode::VK_OPEN_URL_Terminal     &lt;/autogen&gt;   &lt;/item&gt; &lt;/root&gt; /code/pre  h2Automator Service/h2  You can create a service in Automator:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MKU7w.png" alt="Open Terminal"  …then in System Preferences → Keyboard → Shortcuts → Services you can assign a keyboard command to run it.  <answer140215> 5 months late, but I think this bit is useful.  As far as an automator solution goes this is probably a little better. Instead of running finder just use an applescript. ie add action "Utilities Run AppleScript". Run this script:  precodeon run {input, parameters}      tell application "Terminal"         do script " "         activate     end tell      return input end run /code/pre  This will not only open terminal, when run multiple times it will open multiple windows. Then just add a hotkey for it in services (under keyboard), as explained in George Garside's answer.  <answer242274> If you want to use iTerm (iTerm2), do the same as @tlane's answer, except use this for the AppleScript:  precodeon run {input, parameters}     if application "iTerm" is running then         tell application "iTerm"             create window with default profile             activate         end tell     else         tell application "iTerm"             activate         end tell     end if      return input end run /code/pre  <answer259130> You can do this very easily with BetterTouchTool:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jsrzH.png" alt="btt-snapshot"  As the "Specific Application" to open the selected/active folder with, I chose Terminal.  Thus when I use the keyboard shortcut specified (I use option-'), the emcurrent Folder/em is opened in the Terminal.  <answer270763> The closest I've come with macOS strongemas-is/em/strong and no mods or 3rd party software:  ol likbdCmd/kbd+kbdShift/kbd+kbdu/kbdbr Opens the strongemU/strongtilities/em sub-folder in /Applications/ (where Terminal.app lives)/li likbdt/kbdbr Selects the strongemT/strongerminal.app/em/li likbdCmd/kbd+kbdOption/kbd+kbdo/kbdbr strongemO/strongpens/em the Terminal.app and closes the finder window./li /ol  This has worked since day one with every OSX release.  With a slight modification to codeSystem Preferences &gt;&gt; Keyboard &gt;&gt; Shortcuts::Services/code, this is a close runner up, but it requires that you select a folder first: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uX350.png" alt="enter image description here"  ...for example from the Finder at login you could    ol likbdCmd/kbd+kbdUp Arrow/kbd and your home directory code~//code would open in the Finder, then/li likbdCmd/kbd+kbdUp Arrow/kbd again to the /Users/ directory. Now your user home directory code~//code should be selected (if in list or icon view, not column)./li liIf you then hit your custom "Services" key combination (e.g. kbdCtrl/kbd+kbdOpt/kbd+kbdCmd/kbd+kbdt/kbd) to launch a "New Terminal at Folder" the Terminal.app will launch at your home directory code~//code/li /ol  Lastly, in an effort to get something as close as possible to launching a Terminal.app window from the Finder with kbdCtrl/kbd+kbdAlt/kbd+kbdt/kbd... Since the kbdOption/kbd key is kinda equivalent to the kbdAlt/kbd key... using the "Services" custom key combo to launch a "New Terminal at Folder" you could also create an alias of your home directory on the desktop. If you rename the alias kbdSpace/kbd, then from the Finder it's:  ol likbdSpace/kbd to select your code~//code alias, then/li likbdCtrl/kbd+kbdOpt/kbd+kbdt/kbd to Open a Terminal there./li /ol  ...and you end up with a little home living on your desktop which has an arrow pointing to it:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yl9OW.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <comment140314> Can't it be done natively like in Windows and Linux? I am asking because KeyBoard Maestro and alfred are not free. <comment140315> @Morpheus Added a method using KeyRemap4MacBook which is free <comment140316> should keyremapformacbook be open all the time for this to run? <comment140317> @Morpheus The app doesn't need to be open — it adds a daemon. <comment140318> @Morpheus Added Automator method <comment140319> @grgaside, automator is not working but keyremap is working. SO thanks! <comment213169> error when saving: `Expected end of line but found "script"`
