How to find the source of a sound on an iPhone? <body> In the last few weeks my iPhone occasionally makes some kind of notification sound.   It's not any of the built-in sounds, and I've gone through all the "Sounds" settings just to make sure.  It's a two-step tone on a marimba or something like it, but not the built-in one.  It happens about once every 10 minutes.  How do I figure out which app is causing the sound?   There is no other notification.  It's infrequent enough that it's hard to tell whether killing any particular app fixes it,  and I use enough apps that killing them is impractical.  <answer54120> Try disabling sound notification permissions for all apps that you don't need sound notifications for in your notification settings (Settings  Notifications, scroll down to Apps and disable from there)  <answer103262> I just went through this. I had a sound which was incredibly infrequent (1-4 times a day), not a standard sound, and seemingly random.  It was driving me batty. Here's my process:    hr  Get the iPhone Configuration Utility (near the bottom). This will let you look at recent log entries from your phone's console log --- analog to Console.app.   When your phone is connected, in the left sidebar a "Devices" section will appear. Select the phone, and then in the top-tabs, you'll see "console" at the far right (see here for a screenshot).   The next time a sound occurs, take note of the time, then plug it in, and save the console log to a text file.   Open the saved log file in your editor of choice. You'll want to focus on the time the sound happened -- for me, I only knew the time down to the minute, but it sufficed. I think my job was made easier by the fact that my phone was idle at the time.  Here's what I saw in my log:   precodeSep 25 15:24:28  CommCenter[68] &lt;Notice&gt;: Release assertion for reason: operation queue is empty Sep 25 15:24:28  backboardd[28] &lt;Notice&gt;: MultitouchHID: device bootloaded          Sep 25 15:24:28  backboardd[28] &lt;Notice&gt;: MultitouchHID: detection mode: 6-&gt;6    Sep 25 15:24:28  configd[55] &lt;Notice&gt;: network changed: v4(en0:142.244.166.94, pdp_ip0) DNS Proxy Sep 25 15:24:28  wirelessproxd[66] &lt;Warning&gt;: CoreBluetooth[WARNING] &lt;CBCentralManager: 0x17e88250&gt; is disabling duplicate filtering, but is using the default queue (main thread)  Sep 25 15:24:28  kernel[0] &lt;Debug&gt;: launchd[4555] Container: /private/var/mobile/Applications/DF67F833-5955-4E49-8101-87B804F5C04C (sandbox) Sep 25 15:24:30  locationd[52] &lt;Notice&gt;: need a scan, count, 0, 0, lwatchdog, 0.0, interval, 60.0, needWatchdog, 1 Sep 25 15:24:30  locationd[52] &lt;Notice&gt;: scan result, count, wait, 1, retry, 0, error Sep 25 15:24:30  locationd[52] &lt;Notice&gt;: scan result, count, wait, 1, retry, 1, error Sep 25 15:24:30  locationd[52] &lt;Notice&gt;: scan result, count, wait, 1, retry, 2, error Sep 25 15:24:31  mediaserverd[45] &lt;Warning&gt;: 15:24:31.746 [0x379e000] Sub_AudioSessionSetActiveWithFlags: WARNING translating CMSession error: -16980 Sep 25 15:24:34  locationd[52] &lt;Notice&gt;: loc watchdog expired, count, 1, 3          Sep 25 15:24:34  locationd[52] &lt;Notice&gt;: scan result, count, wait, 2, retry, 0, error Sep 25 15:24:34  locationd[52] &lt;Notice&gt;: scan result, count, wait, 2, retry, 1, error Sep 25 15:24:34  locationd[52] &lt;Notice&gt;: scan result, count, wait, 2, retry, 2, error Sep 25 15:24:37  backboardd[28] &lt;Notice&gt;: ALS: SetDisplayFactor: factor=0.0000   Sep 25 15:24:37  kernel[0] &lt;Debug&gt;: AppleMultitouchN1SPI: updating power statistics Sep 25 15:24:37  backboardd[28] &lt;Notice&gt;: MultitouchHID: detection mode: 6-&gt;255  Sep 25 15:24:37  kernel[0] &lt;Debug&gt;: ALS: AppleARMBacklight::setBacklightEnableGated 0 (set level to 0x1d7) /code/pre  The key line here is this: codeSep 25 15:24:31  mediaserverd[45] &lt;Warning&gt;: 15:24:31.746 [0x379e000] Sub_AudioSessionSetActiveWithFlags: WARNING translating CMSession error: -16980/code. That's the audio system starting to play the sound.  Looking a little further back, this line shows the last launched application: codekernel[0] &lt;Debug&gt;: launchd[4555] Container: /private/var/mobile/Applications/DF67F833-5955-4E49-8101-87B804F5C04C (sandbox)/code.   A reasonable assumption is that this is the culprit. I'd be interested in hearing anyone provide an easier way to map the application UID (codeDF67F833-5955-4E49-8101-87B804F5C04C/code) back to an actual name. For me, I started opening applications at random, looking for the culprit hash. About 10 applications later, I'd found it: Downcast.app. Quickly digging into the settings, I found my culprit: A feed update notification sound was enabled.   hr  Ugly, but it worked for me. Best of luck to those tearing their hair out trying to find something similar.   <comment61944> Is there any way you could record the sound? It's hard for us to guess after the sound without hearing it :-) Is there any notification visible in the notification center? (Swipe from top to bottom on your iPhone) <comment61955> Do you have the GMail app installed? When a new mail arrives the app notifies with a sound but without any visual banner. <comment62021> Davide,  that was it!  Thank you!!  Damn Gmail app. :)  I'm surprised Apple allows background sound without some sort of indication where it came from. <comment62022> Sounds like it would work but is quite painful.  I found my particular issue thanks to Davide's comment.    But I'll accept this answer or any better answer on how you would find such a problem generically. <comment62087> The GMail app is really weird, in regards to notifications. I too took a while the understand from where that damned noise came from :)
