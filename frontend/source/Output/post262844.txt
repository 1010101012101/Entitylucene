Which app was removed by iOS 10 update? <body> When updating from iOS 9 to iOS 10 on an iPhone 6S Plus, I noticed an app icon disappearing from a custom folder with all the iOS native apps inside. I couldn't remember which one it was, and some serious googling didn't reveal anything, either. I have a sneaking suspicion that it has something to do with HomeKit/Home.  Does anyone know for sure?  <answer262846> You're right Christian, I didn't even notice it but the gamecenter app has been removed.br It is stated under gamekit in the IOS 10.0 releasenotesbr brApparently it won't be missed by many :)  <comment329287> Thank you :) Great resource you linked to, how could google not come up with that in the first place ...
