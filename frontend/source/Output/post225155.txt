Can I turn off IPv6 and just use IPv4 on my iOS device? <body> I'm trying to use TeamViewer but have a problem when trying to access the network with IPv6 via GSM.  Can I somehow turn off IPv6 and use only IPv4? I am using an iPhone 6 Plus with iOS 8.3.   <comment273303> You can use ipv4 to connect if you have the external ip. You can turn ipv6 off in your router? <comment273304> Mr Robot. Thanks :) . I mean turn off on handset itself, as that exact GSM Network proxy don't allow session on IPv6.
