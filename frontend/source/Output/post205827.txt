Is there an app to modify the dock? <body> I want to modify the dock so Apps open with double click, and one click just switches to the selected app if its open.  I'm using Yosemite 10.10.5  <comment248672> Really? There isn't any utility to modify this? <comment248749> You can just double click. Has the same effect as a single click... <comment249326> No, what I want to do is that they don't open by mistake with 1 click. It happens to me a lot that I want to select an open App and click on a closed App by mistake, and it usually happens with Apps that take a lot of time to open. <comment249366> Doubleclick is not possible. Some tricks that might help: Enlarge your dock, remove icons from dock, change mouse speed. Replace your Dock (example: http://brawersoftware.com/products/ubar)
