regenerate public key <body> I tried to google my question without any answer that works...  I have an strongid_dsa/strong private key, but "lost" my public one.  When I generate a new public one with codessh-keygen -yf .ssh/id_dsa &gt; .ssh/id_dsa.pub/code, ssh starts asking me for password instead of passphrase.  It might be related to xattr on that file? If yes, didn't find how to set proper xattr on id_dsa.pub.  Any idea how to regenerate my public key ? (excepted generate a new keypair ^^)  emThanks for the time you spent reading me/em ;-)  [edit]   hope this will help   output of codessh -v someserver/code  precodeOpenSSH_7.3p1, LibreSSL 2.4.1 debug1: Reading configuration data /Users/***/.ssh/config debug1: /Users/***/.ssh/config line 53: Applying options for aliasname debug1: Reading configuration data /etc/ssh/ssh_config debug1: /etc/ssh/ssh_config line 20: Applying options for * debug1: Connecting to ftp.some-server.com [213.186.some.ip] port 22. debug1: Connection established. debug1: key_load_public: No such file or directory debug1: identity file /Users/***/.ssh/id_rsa type -1 debug1: key_load_public: No such file or directory debug1: identity file /Users/***/.ssh/id_rsa-cert type -1 debug1: identity file /Users/***/.ssh/id_dsa type 2 debug1: key_load_public: No such file or directory debug1: identity file /Users/***/.ssh/id_dsa-cert type -1 debug1: key_load_public: No such file or directory debug1: identity file /Users/***/.ssh/id_ecdsa type -1 debug1: key_load_public: No such file or directory debug1: identity file /Users/***/.ssh/id_ecdsa-cert type -1 debug1: key_load_public: No such file or directory debug1: identity file /Users/***/.ssh/id_ed25519 type -1 debug1: key_load_public: No such file or directory debug1: identity file /Users/***/.ssh/id_ed25519-cert type -1 debug1: Enabling compatibility mode for protocol 2.0 debug1: Local version string SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_7.3 debug1: Remote protocol version 2.0, remote software version OpenSSH_6.0p1 debug1: match: OpenSSH_6.0p1 pat OpenSSH* compat 0x04000000 debug1: Authenticating to ftp.some-server.com:22 as 'aliasname' debug1: SSH2_MSG_KEXINIT sent debug1: SSH2_MSG_KEXINIT received debug1: kex: algorithm: ecdh-sha2-nistp256 debug1: kex: host key algorithm: ssh-rsa debug1: kex: server-&gt;client cipher: aes128-ctr MAC: umac-64@openssh.com compression: none debug1: kex: client-&gt;server cipher: aes128-ctr MAC: umac-64@openssh.com compression: none debug1: sending SSH2_MSG_KEX_ECDH_INIT debug1: expecting SSH2_MSG_KEX_ECDH_REPLY debug1: Server host key: ssh-rsa SHA256:********************** debug1: Host 'ftp.some-server.com' is known and matches the RSA host key. debug1: Found key in /Users/***/.ssh/known_hosts:2 debug1: rekey after 4294967296 blocks debug1: SSH2_MSG_NEWKEYS sent debug1: expecting SSH2_MSG_NEWKEYS debug1: rekey after 4294967296 blocks debug1: SSH2_MSG_NEWKEYS received debug1: Skipping ssh-dss key /Users/***/.ssh/id_dsa - not in PubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes debug1: SSH2_MSG_SERVICE_ACCEPT received debug1: Authentications that can continue: publickey,password debug1: Next authentication method: publickey debug1: Offering RSA public key: /Users/***/.ssh/github_rsa debug1: Authentications that can continue: publickey,password debug1: Trying private key: /Users/***/.ssh/id_rsa debug1: Trying private key: /Users/***/.ssh/id_ecdsa debug1: Trying private key: /Users/***/.ssh/id_ed25519 debug1: Next authentication method: password /code/pre  <answer276501> The DSA key is not used because of   precodeSkipping ssh-dss key /Users/***/.ssh/id_dsa - not in PubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes /code/pre  you should really use RSA or some other key type. DSA is not recommended, because it has fixed size 1024 bits which is not enough nowadays.  If you really have to use it, you can add to your code~/.ssh/config/code  precodePubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes +ssh-dss /code/pre  as described in the official documentation for legacy altorithms.  <comment344448> post the exact output you are getting. <comment347993> I added the exact output in case of no one would have noticed it ^^ but it seems I'm alone on that subject <comment348144> Thank you very much for this, it finally solved my issue. At the same time, I discovered I can have a main config with `Host *` which is really great
