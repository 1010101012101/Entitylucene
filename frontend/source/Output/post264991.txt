Can't unmount smb <body> I sometimes can't unmount a smb-share.  The strange thing is that Terminal reports that the share is mounted, but when I use "umount", then Terminal says the share is not mounted.  Typically it is after a long day working in Photoshop on an smb-share on Win 2012 server. I'm not 100% sure it is only after working in PS, but it seems to be the case. I have tried different solutions, also from this site, but none of them work.  The error prevents Mac from closing down. Mostly it hangs on a black screen with spinning "wheel" (not beach ball), but once is a while I get the "can't eject share because an application is using it" The buttons, eject and cancel are greyed out.  precodeLast login: Wed Dec 14 15:27:11 on ttys001 rilimacq0xzf8jc:~ ril$ ls /Volumes Macintosh HD  Servershare rilimacq0xzf8jc:~ ril$ sudo umount -f /Volumes/Servershare Password: umount: /Volumes/Servershare: not currently mounted rilimacq0xzf8jc:~ ril$  /code/pre  I have tried a few different share-path-syntaxes with same result. e.g:  precodesudo umount -f /Volumes/Servershare sudo umount -f /Servershare sudo umount -f Servershare /code/pre  It has been going on since 10.10 through 10.12.2  Any good ideas?
