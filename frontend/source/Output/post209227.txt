How can I report spam about my Apple ID <body> I received a spam email that pretends that I have to validate my Apple ID account information.     Our automated system was recently unable to validate your details and therefor we require you to complete a short validation process. Please proceed to the link below in order to avoid any interruption to your Apple services.   Where can I report this to Apple?  <answer209232> h1Phishing &amp; Other Suspicious Emails/h1  Apple offer the e-mail address strongreportphishing@apple.com/strong for this purpose:     h2Reporting Suspected Phishing Attempts/h2      If you receive what you believe to be a phishing email purporting to be from Apple, please send it to strongreportphishing@apple.com/strong, a monitored email inbox, which does not generate individual email replies.      Forwarding the message with complete header information provides Apple with important information. To do this in OS X Mail, select the message and choose Forward As Attachment from the Message menu. For other email applications or webmail based services, consult your providerâ€™s support information to determine how to forward messages with complete headers.
