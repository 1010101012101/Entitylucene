How to export Contacts version 9.0 data or .abbu file to .csv or other usable spreadsheet format <body> In the newest Apple Contacts version 9.0, how do you export all contacts or an .abbu file to a .csv file or other usable spreadsheet format? Dragging and dropping to Numbers does not work. Exporting to Vcard does not work...only exports a small handful of vcards out of over 4,000 and data is not usable in Numbers, Excel, or Outlook/Windows Live Mail.

If there's no entry of some sort in one of the contacts, while other contacts do have this entry? <comment230365> Correct. For example if one contact has an image and another does not the row on the one that does not gets shifted so that the each cell is under the wrong column. <comment230551> Sadly, this is true. As soon as you start using images, columns get shifted, even when there are no more images.
