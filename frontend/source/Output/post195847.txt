Mail.app crashes, after Exchange server rebuild <body> Our Exchange server was rebuilt following a hardware failure and this has resulted in the mailbox ID changing. Mail.app doesn't like this, and crashes as soon as it tries to check for new messages:  precodeProcess:               Mail [1174] Path:                  /Applications/Mail.app/Contents/MacOS/Mail Identifier:            com.apple.mail Version:               8.2 (2102) Build Info:            Mail-2102000000000000~1 Code Type:             X86-64 (Native) Parent Process:        ???

I have tried removing the 'Envelope' index files and rebuilding but with the same result. I don't want to completely wipe everything unless I absolutely have to, as I don't want to lose my local cache of messages (especially as they are no longer available on the server).  <answer195881> Buscar has the gist correct, though I would add a step: backup your ~/Library/Mail folder (OPTION-Drag it to the desktop) then delete the account.  One that is done add it back. If your old mail has vanished when the new account has been established just import the backed up mailboxes sitting on the Desktop.  <comment233849> hopefully you have archived mails, if so delete the email account. now make a new one (or recreate the old one). based on this message "once an account is created, the root folder id shouldn't change on the server'" <comment234068> Thought there may have been a more imaginative solution but this was what I ended up doing - unfortunately importing .mbox files back on to Exchange loses the original sent/received date and time. Something to look out for if this is particularly important to anyone.
