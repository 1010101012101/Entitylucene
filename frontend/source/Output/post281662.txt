Can't Ping Mac from PC <body> I have a PC running Windows 10 and a Mac running macOS 10.12.4 both connected to a common home WiFi network.  hr  h2Mac network settings/h2  strongFirewall:/strong disabled strongIP:/strong 192.168.1.18 strongSubnet:/strong 255.255.255.0  hr  h2Windows network settings/h2  strongFirewall:/strong disabled strongIP:/strong 192.168.1.14 strongSubnet:/strong 255.255.255.0  hr  h2Ping Results/h2  Mac-Mac (other) = success Mac-PC = success PC-PC = success PC-Mac = fail  hr  When monitoring codetcpdump/code via terminal on the Mac it is showing that the computer is receiving the ping, but the PC is not receiving a reply.  <comment354406> @klanomath How can I check for an echo reply? <comment354409> @klanomath  Nothing shows up in terminal after entering that command and starting a ping. When I ping the Mac from an iPad I do see activity in terminal <comment354410> Then - after entering `sudo tcpdump -nni en0 icmp` (or en1/2/3) in the Mac's Terminal - open a second Mac Terminal window and enter `ping -c 3 192.168.1.14`. To stop tcpdump'ing simply enter ctrl-C! <comment354411> @klanomath The ping to the PC in the new terminal window is successful and the original terminal window shows an ICMP echo reply in the log <comment354412> I would reboot the router/access point then. <comment354413> @klanomath reset all AP and router - still no response when pinging the Mac from the PC
