Set volume control for each app individually <body> I'm capturing video with Final Cut Pro and I'm hearing the sound of the recording.  I would like to use the computer for other things while capturing.  How can I disable the sound for a specific application?  Please don't give solutions for paying apps.  <answer193699> I think SoundBunny is an app which works for this.  Link: https://www.prosofteng.com/sound-bunny/ However it is paid $10 but there is a free month trial which you might be able to capture your video in time in that month. I haven't tried the app myself but it seems ok from the screenshots.
