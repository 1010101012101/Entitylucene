Parsing time from the CLI in Sierra adjusted for the timezone <body> precode$ date Fri Nov 25 16:44:07 SGT 2016 $ date -j -f "%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S" "2016-11-12T01:46:00.000000Z" +%Y%m%d%H%M Warning: Ignoring 8 extraneous characters in date string (.000000Z) 201611120146 /code/pre  I'm in +8 hours so when I parse that UTC string with .000000Z, I want the resulting time to be code201611120946/code, not code201611120146/code.  I tried .%Z but that didn't work, so I am little stuck how to get this date parse to work.  <answer262367> Yes, it's possible in dateutils:  precode$ dateconv 2016-11-12T01:46:00.000000Z --zone Asia/Singapore -f '%Y%m%d%H%M' 201611120946 /code/pre  If the offset isn't known by name but rather you want 8 hours (or any other time interval) added to a UTC stamp you can use codedateadd/code  precode$ dateadd 2016-11-12T01:46:00.000000Z +8h -f '%Y%m%d%H%M' 201611120946 /code/pre  <comment328713> Please consider mentioning that you are associated with `dateutils` and that it is not part of macOS. <comment328721> Yes, that's correct, if someone could put a disclaimer in: I am the author of the software (dateutils) and it's not part of MacOS and hence has to be installed manually.  My reply solely exists because hendry privately contacted me to make me aware of this question. <comment328729> Your comment is enough of a disclaimer. Thank you for sharing this project and your work; it is appreciated!
