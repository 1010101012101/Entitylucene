Connection Apple TV to the analog audio stereo speakers <body> I have a projector with HDMI connection and speakers with analog audio jack.  I've bought Apple TV and I'm going to connect the projector with HDMI.   However, I'm afraid I need to buy an adapter for the Apple TV optical audio interface to connect the jack of my stereo.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GGHb3.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Could you give me more info about it ?  <answer57016> Yes, you will need to buy an adapter.  The Apple TV only offers digital audio and video outputs.  <answer57021> Depending on the projector, it may have a pass through for audio, so that may be an alternative to an adapter.  <answer73542> HDMI to VGA + Audio: http://store.apple.com/us/product/H9139VC/A/kanex-atv-pro-hdmi-to-vga-adapter-with-audio-support  Digital Coax / Optical Toslink to Analog Audio: http://www.amazon.com/Digital-Optical-Toslink-Analog-Converter/dp/B004C4WPXA  I like the HDMI solution - it's an unpowered device; however it's considerably more expensive.  Maybe try dx.com for a slightly cheaper alternative (search hdmi vga audio).    <comment65470> Does your stereo support toshlink or mini toshlink? <comment65471> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TOSLINK <comment65488> The projects only has RCA audio outputs. I'm afraid I need an adapter as well from RCA to stereo output jack. Correct ? <comment65492> Yes, but RCA to 3.5mm adapters are very cheap, whereas going from the digital out on the Apple TV will require an active adapter, adding to the cost and complexity. Check out [Monoprice](http://www.monoprice.com) for good quality cheap adapters. <comment65499> But if I just want to listen to music with airPlay, I have to switch on the projector everytime? <comment65661> [Similar question][1] was asked earlier.     [1]: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/43003/can-i-direct-the-audio-signal-from-apple-tv/43025#43025
