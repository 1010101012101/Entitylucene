Webpage bookmark on desktop <body> I'd like to have a bookmark for a webpage, shown on my desktop that, when clicked, opens that page. I know there are workarounds (applescript etc.) but is there a direct approach?  I'm using Google Chrome on OSX 10.9.4  <answer150676> Open the webpage in your preferred browser, then click on the website's icon on the left of the URL bar and drag it to your Desktop.   This creates a shortcut.  Applescript to create a webpage shortcut seems like the hard way.  <answer150678> Easy in Safari, idk in Chrome.  Open bookmarks from the icon top left, to show the sidebar; find appropriate bookmark in the list, drag to desktop. Doesn't work from menus, just from that list.  I can't imagine Chrome being much different.  <answer150696> Most Mac OS X browsers will allow you to drag a website's favicon to your Desktop to create an icon that you can double click to open the site.  However, this will open the link in the Default browser as specified codeSafari -&gt; Preferences -&gt; General -&gt; Default web browser/code regardless of which app created the desktop icon.  To force opening the link in a specified, browser you need to create an AppleScript.   For Chrome:   precodedo shell script "open -a 'Google Chrome' http://example.com" /code/pre  For Firefox:  precodedo shell script "open -a Firefox 'http://example.com'" /code/pre  For Safari:   precodedo shell script "open -a Safari http://example.com" /code/pre  Pay attention to the different quote methods. "Google Chrome" needs to be wrapped in quotes, a \ to escape a space doesn't work in this context. Firefox needs the URL to be quoted.    Save the script as an AppleScript application.  <comment177329> I meant an applescript that creates a new tab/launches chrome with a website prompt.
