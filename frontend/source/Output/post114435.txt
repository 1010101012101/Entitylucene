How do I troubleshoot personal hotspot mode failing to issue IP addresses? <body> When I turn on the personal hotspot, I cannot get a DHCP network address on my computer. I've tried with 2 different computers and an Android phone. They can connect to the network router but not my iPhone, which won't give out an IP address.   img src="https://i.imgur.com/qyGxJpB.jpg" alt="image"  It just says "the connection is limited" and I get a 169.* address on my computer.   precodeWireless LAN adapter Wi-Fi:  Connection-specific DNS Suffix  . : Link-local IPv6 Address . . . . . : fe80::5c88:c538:f588:efe%4 Autoconfiguration IPv4 Address. . : 169.254.14.254 Subnet Mask . . . . . . . . . . . : 255.255.0.0 Default Gateway . . . . . . . . . : /code/pre  When I connect via USB cable, it does not work either:  img src="https://imgur.com/PqV2G7x.png" alt="imgur"  After I reset network settings (Settings  General  Reset  Reset Network Settings), I was able to briefly get an IP address, but I was not able to ping any servers, like Google's public DNS server. I received a phone call while the hot spot was turned on, and I believe that is what allowed me to get an IP address, but I'm not sure why. Subsequent disable/enable cycles failed to get an IP address.  precode$ ipconfig Windows IP Configuration Wireless LAN adapter Wi-Fi:     Connection-specific DNS Suffix  . :    Link-local IPv6 Address . . . . . : fe80::5c88:c538:f588:efe%4    IPv4 Address. . . . . . . . . . . : 172.20.10.2    Subnet Mask . . . . . . . . . . . : 255.255.255.240    Default Gateway . . . . . . . . . : 172.20.10.1  $ ping 8.8.8.8 Pinging 8.8.8.8 with 32 bytes of data: Request timed out. /code/pre  I even tried to connect via Bluetooth, but that didn't work either.  precode$ ipconfig     Windows IP Configuration Ethernet adapter Bluetooth Network Connection:     Connection-specific DNS Suffix  . :    Link-local IPv6 Address . . . . . : fe80::b09b:4eb7:6091:ac17%5    Autoconfiguration IPv4 Address. . : 169.254.172.23    Subnet Mask . . . . . . . . . . . : 255.255.0.0    Default Gateway . . . . . . . . . : /code/pre  I have an unlocked iPhone 5 with latest iOS on MetroPCS.   h3Reference/h3  http://support.apple.com/kb/TS2756. I have not restored/reset the entire phone. Would rather not have to.  <answer116672> I am going to take some time to do a summary of networking and troubleshooting to try to help you out.  When your phone is running a Personal Hotspot it starts up a couple services on the phone's OS one being a DHCP service. DHCP might seem familiar two you because it is what is the part of every network that gives out the IP address.  A network has two sides to it, internal and external. In our modern day there are external IPs that look like this 2001:0db8:85a3:0042:1000:8a2e:0370:7334 and internal IPs that look like this: 127.0.0.1 or maybe you have seen 192.168.1.1  If you see a IP address on your computer(s) with 169.... this usually means that the DHCP service is not reachable. This could have several reasons and in this case I am going to assume that your Windows computer does not have the correct driver to speak with the iPhone's DHCP service. If you connect your iPhone via USB the driver is different than Bluetooth or WiFi.  We should be able to assume that the iPhone's network is fine if you can surf the web on your iPhone. Now getting that network over to your Windows computer is a matter of connecting the iPhone via USB (or WiFi or Bluetooth) and making sure that the driver is installed correctly. This should be the case as long as you have the latest version of iTunes installed on the computer and the iPhone shows up in iTunes as an available device.  The error message you get of "Connection in limited" is to my understanding the Windows version of "self-assigned IP address" which results from the computer not understanding the DHCP and/or DNS settings from the device it is getting network activity from.  Please verify all of these things and if you notice anything else out of the ordinary and I'll update my guide to help more.  <answer117389> Found it! I went to a MetroPCS store and they looked at the phone. They enabled hotspot for my account, but it still would not help. They gave me a phone number to call, I called tech support, and was told:  ul liTurn off LTE. Settings  Cellular  Enable LTE (Off)/li liTurn off/on Personal Hotspot./li /ul  Now it works! It only works on 4G.  I don't know if having the hotspot feature ($5/m) enabled on your account is relevant or not. I thought all data was combined, and since it is an unlocked phone, how could they know?  <answer265169> i had the same problem earlier on and it was soo frustrating!   Anyway i got it fixed (posting here using my revived laptop!) and the following was what worked for me:  Start  Control Panel  Windows Firewall  Allow a program or feature  remove Bonjour  reboot computer and watch the magic unfold.  P.S This was a solution posted by kind humans in another forum but it took me long to find it..Just thought i could share it on this forum as well to hopefully make the search easier for others.  cheers, hope this would solve your problem too! :)  <comment134107> Two ways to narrow this down. 1. Connect other devices (android, iOS, computer) to the hotspot to see if it's not handing out DHCP properly. 2. Debug your computer(s) to make sure no firewall is blocking DHCP and or other network configuration issues. That would need more details since there's not a log on iOS that shows easily what's happening with hotspot operation. <comment134108> 1. I already mentioned I tried connecting two different computers to the phone. 2. There is no firewall on the wireless network. Plus I can connect to the wireless router. <comment134110> Hope you have already done the restart phone basic step. If yes, try creating hotspot again. <comment134120> @Chloe I know, but you still need to keep changing one thing until you arrive at a workable setup. <comment134141> @iDev Yes I've tried over several weeks and I've reset the phone several times between that time, mainly because the Siri keyboard microphone key was grayed out. <comment134156> Have you taken it to Apple? There might be a hardware fault that isn't clearly visible to you. <comment134172> Please describe a bit more of your network and how you are trying to connect. Ideally turn on Personal Hotspot and connect your iPhone via USB to your computer. Please make sure that all other networking devices (ethernet cables) are removed from your computer. I would even say turn of bluetooth on phone and computer if it has it. Does your iPhone now show a blue status bar at the very top showing that it has a connection? What DHCP status do you now get on the computer? <comment134316> @AndrewU. That's a great idea. I tried to connect via USB but it did not work. http://imgur.com/PqV2G7x <comment134569> @Chloe have you tried Settings - General - Reset - Reset Network Settings? <comment134633> @Harv Thanks I tried Reset Network Settings, but it didn't work. Still can't get an IP address from the phone. <comment134636> @Harv I reset, and WAS able to get an IP, but cannot ping any servers like 8.8.8.8. I first tested with an Android which reported a failure. I retried with a PC and briefly got an IP, but after a few disable/enable cycles, it stopped working again. I updated question with additional info. <comment134826> @Chloe it seems like your computer doesn't have USB set up as a network connection method. The screenshot you posted shows that you have several options but not USB. With that in mind retry my steps but instead of relying on USB, try Bluetooth and see if you get pair the devices and go online that way. <comment136521> I showed in the question that I already tried USB and Bluetooth PAN, and that I tried on multiple computers (different Windows versions) plus Android. <comment136784> I wasn't just trying to tell you how to fix it but to give you clues and the process that is usually invisible. On the other computers, was the latest iTunes installed? On the other hand your question is "How do I troubleshoot..." and that is what I am trying to answer. Seeing as how I spent just as much time writing my responses as you did yours I would appreciate a bit more cooperation <comment136785> @Chloe with all the troubles we have gone through to try to help you out, it might be time to restore the phone. But the last thing that comes to my mind is double checking with your provider that your contract supports Personal Hotspot <comment136797> That's my next step: take phone & laptop to MetroPCS store and make them fix it. <comment136798> That's not my suggestion but that will hopefully get a resolution. Best of luck, we are here for you if you still have troubles <comment332988> That doesn't explain why the Android phone would not get an IP address from the iPhone. Android doesn't run Bonjour. <comment332992> It turns out having the $5/m hotspot feature is unnecessary. It works with LTE with version 10.2 of iOS now. I just tested it. There must have been a bug in iOS. <comment342190> This worked for me too, my iOS 10.3 or provider won't allow LTE tethering via USB but works through WI-Fi...
