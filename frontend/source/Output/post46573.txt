VMware Windows and resizing the desktop <body> So I install two Windows 7 VMs through VMware fusion 4. The desktop resizes very nicely in the first: Windows senses the resizing and uses smaller icons.  In the second VM Windows simply magnifies its desktop to a rather ugly one: the desktop uses more real estate, but it's just a magnified image of a low-resolution desktop.  I'm not aware that I have changed any setting related to the desktop. How can one intentionally get the former behavior?  <answer46577> Sounds like you might not have VMware Tools installed in the second VM. Do you see the VMware Tools icon in the taskbar tray?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/N1Akj.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  If not, you can select "Install VMware Tools" from the "Virtual Machine" menu (mine says "Reinstall" as I already have it installed)  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/P302O.jpg" alt="enter image description here"
