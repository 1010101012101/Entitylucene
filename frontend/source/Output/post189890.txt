Terminal find, rename by deletion <body> Mac will append a ' 2' (note the space) to the end of a file/folder that is  a copy of another file/folder inside the same directory... I was wondering if anybody knows how to batch remove/rename this ' 2' from a directory of folders from Terminal.  <answer189912> Use codefind/code to locate files like this way:  precodefind . -name "* 2" -exec rm -r "{}" \; /code/pre  This command will search for files and folders from where your are code./code with name code"* 2"/code and delete every result code-exec rm {}/code.  If you want to rename directories:  precodefind . -name "* 2" -type d -exec rename 's/ 2/-copy/g' {} \; /code/pre  As other command, locate only folders with name code"*.2"/code and rename it replacing code2/code with code-copy/code.  If you don't have coderename/code installed, you can also use  precodefind . -name "* 2" -type d -exec bash -c '[[ -x "${0/ 2/-copy}" ]] || mv "$0" "${0/ 2/-copy}"' {} \; /code/pre  (The code[[ -x/code part tests whether a file/folder already exists).  <answer189968> Well, just in case anybody else comes up with this same question... I found a simple resolution.... if you have Homebrew  precodebrew install rename /code/pre  ...  precoderename -s " 2" '' * /code/pre  turns Music/Tom Petty 2 into Music/Tom Petty.  Likewise, if you wanted to add something to your directory names with a similar ending like ' 2', you could...  precoderename -s " 2" '-blob' * /code/pre  ... codeMusic/Tom Petty 2//code      becomes     precodeMusic/Tom Petty-blob/ /code/pre  <comment225406> but, what if you are trying to rename ( not delete ) directories ( not files ). <comment225408> I update my answer. It will delete both files and folders. <comment225410> The OP wants to *rename* files/folders, not only delete them <comment225411> How do you want to rename the files? Just remove the trailing " 2" or something else? <comment225412> @patrix read carefully: "how to batch remove/rename". This usually means one or another, isn't it? <comment225414> see Ken's first comment to your answer :-) <comment225415> the 'remove' part of my question referred to the ' 2' at the end of the dir name... not the entire directory ( or file ) it is more of a batch rename for directories ( not files within directories ) <comment225416> Ok, updated again. <comment225417> yes, I want to remove the trailing " 2"... for directories inside of a directory ie... Music/Tom Petty 2/ ... ( not files or the files within the renamed directory )
