Forticlient: SSL VPN timeout <body> I'm using Forticlient to connect to a customer's VPN. It used to work on my MacOS, but it suddendly stopped with apparently no reason. After that I never managed to make it work again on my computer, even it it connects fine with every other device I try (Android, Linux, Windows, another MacOS).  I tried uninstalling and reinstalling several times, but it still fails to connect. I tried removing every single file accessed by the app (checking with codelsof/code) but still fails. Enabling debug I found the following:  precode20170720 08:27:22.523 [sslvpn:INFO] unknown:0 current uid: 0 20170720 08:27:22.525 [sslvpn:INFO] unknown:0 get current proxy auto config settings 20170720 08:27:22.530 [sslvpn:INFO] unknown:0 use tty:/dev/ttys006 20170720 08:27:22.533 [sslvpn:INFO] unknown:0 connecting to 1.2.3.4:10443 - 10443 20170720 08:27:22.533 [sslvpn:DEBG] unknown:0 tcp connect 1.2.3.4:10443 timeout -1 20170720 08:27:22.542 [sslvpn:INFO] unknown:0 shuting down the running tunnel 20170720 08:27:22.542 [sslvpn:INFO] unknown:0 the tunnel is shut down  20170720 08:27:22.542 [sslvpn:EROR] unknown:0 connect failed 20170720 08:27:22.542 [sslvpn:INFO] unknown:0 tunnel shutdown -2 20170720 08:27:22.543 [sslvpn:INFO] unknown:0 sslvpn starts to clean up 20170720 08:27:22.547 [sslvpn:INFO] unknown:0 sslvpnd terminated /code/pre  How's possible it returns emtimeout/em right after trying to connect?  I have no firewall enabled on the Mac (10.12.5), I just installed some objective-see apps but none should interfere with network connections.  What else can I check to understand why the connection returns timeout?
