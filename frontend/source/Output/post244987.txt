Using a MacBook Air as a monitor to a AV video receiver? <body> I have a AV receiver I use for FPV, I would like to use the high quality screen of my Air as a monitor for that receiver, would I be able to? I uses the tricolour RCA output.   FPV first person view   <comment301977> I don't know what "FPV" is but it really dosen't matter in this context.  How do you propose to get the RCA signal **into** the Macbook Air?  Video capture?  If one existed, it would need to be USB.  By the time you get it all set up, you would have a $1000 "monitor" where a $300 dedicated display would work much easier. <comment301985> Could I use an iPhone? with something like http://www.apple.com/uk/shop/product/MC748ZM/A/apple-composite-av-cable, then just get a female connector for the receiver? <comment301989> You said tri-color which is RGB - that's *composite* video  Besides that adapter is for iPhone **out** to a receiver; not a receiver **into** an iPhone.  You will need a video capture device. <comment301993> I am pretty sure I could use thunderbolt as video input to  target display mode? <comment301994> You know of an MBA that can go into Target Display mode?
