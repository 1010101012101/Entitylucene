Remap specific Keyboard Key + Mouse Scroll command for one application, but not System? (LibreOffice/Calc) <body> In macOS, I want to use (kbd⌘/kbd + kbdemMouse Scroll Up/Down/em/kbd) for the System-wide Zoom: br emSystem Preferences  Accessibility  Zoom  Use scroll gesture with modifier keys to zoom/em.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FrHaa.png" alt="enter image description here"  This keyboard mapping conflicts with LibreOffice Calc's "smart zoom" that also uses kbd⌘/kbd + kbdemMouse Scroll/em/kbd, which I use frequently.  When the System Zoom is active, it will take precedence over LibreOffice's zoom. brThe problem is that the System Zoom pixelates the view, and for LibreOffice I'd rather use the built-in zoom.  h3Remapping?/h3  Is it possible to rebind the LibreOffice "smart zoom" to kbd⌃/kbd + kbdemMouse Scroll/em/kbd instead? Didn't find anything apparently so in LibreOffice emCalc  Tools  Customize  Keyboard./em  I know it's possible to change the system-wide zoom to use another modifier key (⌃ or ⌥), but I'd really like to use ⌘.  h3As for creative solutions.../h3  If the LibreOffice itself doesn't allow for this remapping, maybe there is a smart way to intercept the specific event kbd⌃/kbd + kbdemMouse Scroll/em/kbd inside of Libreoffice, and send the event kbd⌘/kbd + kbdemMouse Scroll/em/kbd to LibreOffice emONLY/em and not to the macOS System?  Could this be achieved with an application, AppleScript, LUA or something like that?
