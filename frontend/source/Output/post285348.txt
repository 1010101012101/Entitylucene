In TextEdit, if I type two `-` it is converted to one longer `-` <body> I use TextEdit to edit my text.  If I type in a double code-/code, it is converted to one longer code-/code.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/EYcpH.jpg" width="550"  How to avoid this?  <answer285352> Go to Edit → Substitutions and disable Smart Dashes.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Z0UWc.png" width="590"  You can disable this globally in System Preferences: Keyboard → Text. Disable ‘Use smart quotes and dashes’.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/81zOc.png" width="600"  To only disable the dash substitution globally whilst leaving smart quotes enabled by adding the substitution to System Preferences: Keyboard → Text. Add a new entry set to code--/code for both ‘replace’ and ‘with’ to disable the substitution. This works because entries here override the OS regardless of whether substitutions are enabled.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ga2p6.png" width="560"  To disable the dash substitution globally without this workaround, you can disable NSAutomaticDashSubstitutionEnabled:  precodedefaults write -g NSAutomaticDashSubstitutionEnabled 0 /code/pre  <comment359827> I have to admit, I turn off auto-correct-type features in every program I can.  I don't like a program trying to pretend it knows what I want more than I do... <comment359831> @Ghotir I like the autocorrect features. Double-tapping the - key is much faster than ⇧⌥-. <comment359832> This can be set globally in system preferences <comment359834> @grgarside I was't trying to imply my way was the only (or best) way.  Your mileage may definitely vary.  :) <comment359835> @Ghotir Sure, just giving an alternative opinion! <comment359838> @John Indeed, edited answer <comment359899> I recommend turning off smart quotes too <comment359911> I'm puzzled how this very elementary question solved by simply looking a the Edit menu would rank such importance <comment360429> I  noticed this in Notes as well!
