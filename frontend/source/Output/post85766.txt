Is there a hand tool for xcode's storyboard (scrolling without scrollbars, PDF style)? <body> I guess the title says it all. I was looking for a way to e.g. hold down a modifier key and "grab" the storyboard so that I can stop trying to aim for the scrollbars every time I want to scroll freely with a mouse.   I found this key chart http://cocoasamurai.blogspot.se/2011/03/xcode-4-keyboard-shortcuts-now.html but it didn't help.  <answer85775> It depends on what type of mouse you're using, but on my magic mouse, I can scroll the storyboard in any direction by dragging one finger over the mouse.  You can also move it around with the command key and arrow keys:  ⌘ →   Scroll right  ⌘ ←   Scroll left  ⌘ ↓   Scroll down  ⌘ ↑   Scroll up  Note that you'd have to give the storyboard focus first, by clicking in a blank area.  <answer85777> Smart Scroll will help you here. Though it has many features, one of it is grab and scroll, which is exactly what you need.  <comment98856> This is about a development tool and so would be on topic in StackOverflow it is also on topic here but I suspect there are more Xcode users on SO so try migrating it to there. <comment99042> Thanks, didn't know that, pretty handy. Unfortunately I have a logitech mouse :) <comment99043> That looks interesting, thanks. I'll have to check it out further <comment155372> Actually, it's primarily about how multitouch and mouse let a window to scroll. Yes, the tool is for developers, but there is no code here so it's fine to ask here. <comment229978> The grab feature had uneven sensitivity on the two axes and didn't feel right, but its vector scrolling is more comfortable anyway. Very good app.
