What do the various iTunes Match icons in iTunes mean? <body> Enabling iTunes Match adds a new default column to song lists in iTunes that displays several new icons:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1yZlU.png" alt="enter image description here"img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/IGNEm.png" alt="enter image description here"img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bwdx5.png" alt="enter image description here"img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9tEWM.png" alt="enter image description here"img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8K1QJ.png" alt="enter image description here"  What do each of these icons (as well as no icon at all) mean?  <answer31260> Apple's iTunes Match: Understanding the iCloud Status icons KB article explains.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pdP6H.png" alt="enter image description here"  So, your icons in order are:  ol liAvailable for download/li liWaiting/li liError/li liDuplicate/li liIneligible/li /ol  If you're having problems, take a look at the Troubleshooting iTunes Match article.  <comment35838> And what does no icon at all mean? <comment35839> Does "duplicate" mean that there is another copy on the machine that _has_ been uploaded to the cloud? <comment35840> I'm not sure what no icon means, but I believe that Duplicate does mean that there's already a copy in the cloud. <comment35841> I think I see what no icon means: the song is on your machine "already" — i.e., it's in the cloud, but is present on the machine too. This can be a bit misleading though as the version "already" on the machine many not be the 256kbps version that's available in the cloud. <comment35848> In fact, there seem to be three "versions" of no icon: (1) Matched = iTunes found a match, even though you didn't purchase it through iTunes; (2) Purchased = you purchased this track from iTunes (for both of which, as mentioned, the version in the cloud may be better than the one you have); and (3) Uploaded = with indicates songs that iTunes could not find a match in its database but which you have uploaded to iCloud.
