Can't delete Windows 10 generated partition from Mac <body> Tried to follow the instructions for installing Windows 10 here, but they didn't work for me, and now I can't delete the partition that was created.  Is there a way to delete or merge this partition with Macintosh HD from Terminal?  <comment323428> Please add the following to your question by editing it: the output of `diskutil list`, `sudo fdisk /dev/disk0` and `sudo gpt -r show /dev/disk0` entered in Terminal. <comment323438> Also, please include the model/year of your Mac. The process of installing Windows 10 can vary significantly depending on the model and year of a Mac.
