Where does the OneNote Importer for MacOS store imported notes? <body> I started a OneNote import of Evernote notes, using the OneNote importer for MacOS, but have so many Evernote notes that I began to run out of disk space. I closed the importer mid-import. The files taking up space during import are still there. Where are these files and how can I delete them?  <comment364460> I'm voting to close this question as off-topic because as written it does not appear to be about Apple hardware or software.
