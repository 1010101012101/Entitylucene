Preventing files from being renamed when camera uploads to Dropbox is enabled <body> Is there any way to prevent files from being renamed when camera uploads to Dropbox is enabled in Mac OS X?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dcjUS.png" alt="enter image description here"  By default all imported image files are renamed into their timestamps:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/BkWQZ.png" alt="enter image description here"  I think to keep the original filenames:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/BlsjL.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer164506> With current version of Dropbox client you can't. If you want your photos to be uploaded to Dropbox and not renamed you have to rely on different solution than Dropbox.app  You might go to their forum though and request this to be available.
