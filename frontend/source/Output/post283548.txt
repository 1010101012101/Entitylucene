Applications Folder Permissions <body> I am in quite the peculiar situation. Whenever I am trying to update the program "Sketch" it gives me the following warning:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/tixpm.jpg" alt="Picture 1"  However the application itself is in the applications folder:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/22Iyz.jpg" alt="Picture 2"  My account also should be an administrator  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rIapI.jpg" alt="Picture 3"  And admins do have read and write permissions  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4Dgzl.jpg" alt="Picture 4"  So I thought, maybe I should add the explicit account with read and write permissions because for some reason macOS might not see me as admin? I don't  know, tbh. However I seem to be unable to add myself (the explicit account) to the applications folder permissions anyway (which I also do not get since I, as admin, should have god status and shall not be hampered in my devious plans by missing permissions).  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xl9t6.jpg" alt="Picture 5"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/UImmx.jpg" alt="Picture 6"  Also yes, I have restarted the thing. To no avail sadly.  I hope this is not a duplicate, however I couldn't find a question similar. Maybe I am just bad at looking, though.  <comment357535> What does ls -l@ show? <comment357541> @Mark hi, I have no idea if I am doing this wrong but when I navigate to the applications folder (cd ./Applications) and then type what you suggested (ls -l@) it sadly simply does nothing. However I noticed, that terminal shows grey brackets around the line I put the command in question.

That worked. Thank you very much. Shall I delete this question now, or what do I do? <comment357555> @Mark nvm, got it
