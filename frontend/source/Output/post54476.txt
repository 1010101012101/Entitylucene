Nvidia MCP79 SATA controller caps link speed <body> Why is my SATA controller capping the link speed? This is what it says in my System Profiler under the Serial-ATA page:  precodeVendor:                 NVidia Product:                MCP79 AHCI Link Speed:             3 Gigabit Negotiated Link Speed:  1.5 Gigabit Description:            AHCI Version 1.20 Supported /code/pre  The link speed is as expected (3 Gigabit), but I don't see why it is negotiated into a 1.5 Gigabit link speed.br The drives attached to the SATA interface are a codeHitachi 320GB 5400rpm/code hard disk drive and a codeMATSHITADVD-R UJ-868/code superdrive.    I have a MacBook Pro 5,3 with Snow Leopard 10.6.8. My question is why the negotiated link speed is lower than the actual link speed.  <answer54549> Because devices connected are SATAI devices. How can you connect to a device at 3Gbps if it doesn't support it?
