How can I turn off Bluetooth with only keyboard actions? <body> A trackpad in another room was interfering with my ability to use my laptop's native trackpad, such that I could not click on anything. I wanted to either turn off bluetooth or disconnect the offending device.   I used Finder to get into Bluetooth settings but then I was stuck. I could not figure out a keyboard shortcut to get to the button to turn off bluetooth nor to disconnect the connected trackpad.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wAq3h.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer191490> Go into the Finder, type codecommand + shift + u/code and open Script Editor by selecting it and typing codecommand + o/code. In a new script, type (since you can't highlight to copy)  precodetell application "System Events"     click button "Turn Bluetooth Off" of window 1 of application process "System Preferences" end tell /code/pre  and then type codecommand + r/code to run the script. The trackpad should now be disconnected.  <comment227393> hah. I wrote a script that did this exact thing once. I'll share it with you. <comment227468> Perfect! Does exactly what I need and gives me a good template for similar simple scripts, as I haven't done any AppleScripting before.
