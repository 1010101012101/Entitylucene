Visual tool for browsing LMDB files <body> I am looking for a program that works on Mac OS X 10.10 and can open and display an LMDB file (Lightning Memory-Mapped Database). Ideally, gratis, can also edit the file, and supports large files, like HDFView for HDF4 and HDF5 files.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NSWST.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment247814> I haven't found any solution so far. <comment247815> So I am still interested if someone has any idea.
