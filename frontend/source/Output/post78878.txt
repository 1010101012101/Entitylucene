iCal and Google Calendar Syncing <body> Is there a way to sync my iCalendar to my Google Calendar? I use the iCal application as my primary calendar resource, and I need to share that data via GoogleCalendar with my colleagues and I cannot figure out how to do this. I am able to get the data from my GoogleCalendar to show up on my iCal, but I cannot do the reverse (I want data created on the iCal to upload/sync directly to the GoogleCalendar).. I have OSX Lion and iCal 6.0  <answer78890> To do so just:  ol liOn strongiCal/strong go to strongPreferences / Accounts/strong./li liIn the panel on the left, click the strong+/strong button to add an account./li liFill in the information, being:/li /ol  strongAccount Type:/strong Google. Although you can either use emAutomatic/em or emCalDAV/em, and the System will emdetect/em the proper account type.  strongEmail Address:/strong The email which you are using to log into the Calendar. The em@domain.com/em part should be written too.  strongPassword:/strong Well, the password for that account. If you are using em2-Step verification/em you must use an application-specific password.  Doing this, by strongdefault/strong, will sync any calendars that appear in strongMy Calendars/strong on the web, as well as the strongContact's birthdays and events/strong.  Adding additional calendars, or removing any of them from syncing, you must go to the Account Sync Configuration Page, and select the calendars you'd like to be displayed. After doing so, refreshing iCal will display the new configuration.  <comment91275> I was able to do this alreadym but that is not my goal- completing this step does not make the content already on my iCal sync to my googlecalendar- that is my goal. Any ideas? <comment148731> The "Contact's birthdays" is not shown in Google Calendar (neither in Account Sync Configuration Page). That is exactly the one I'm missing in google. Any idea how to solve?
