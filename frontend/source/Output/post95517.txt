How can I disable any external traffic to my port 80? <body> I don't want others on the same network (or any network!) to be able to access my machine at port 80, where I have dev websites.  I've tried adding this rule to codeipfw/code:  precodedeny tcp from any to any dst-port 80 in /code/pre  which works, but it also stops me from being able to access my web root whenever I get a new IP (switching to a new wireless network, for example) until I refresh my network interface.  Is there a rule that I can add into codeipfw/code or (since it's apparently deprecated) into codepfctl/code that disallows any external traffic to port 80?  strongEdit:/strong bmike's answer is just perfect. Here's what I've done, for others to see:  precodesudo ipfw add 00100 allow ip from any to any via lo0 sudo ipfw add 90100 deny tcp from any to any dst-port 80 in sudo ipfw add 90100 deny tcp from any to any dst-port 443 in sudo ipfw add 90100 deny tcp from any to any dst-port 3306 in /code/pre  This allows all ports locally, but disallows any incoming connection to 80 (Apache), 443 (https), and 3306 (MySQL, which I already have restricted to localhost, but I still added this just to ensure it).  <answer95518> You'll want to be sure you have an allow rule with a lower number than the deny rule.  So perhaps:  precode00100 allow ip from any to any via lo0 90100 deny tcp from any to any dst-port 80 in /code/pre  This puts the allow very low (make sure you don't have any deny rules in the 0-99 rule number range) and puts the general deny rule at a very high number (presumably you won't be allowing anything on port 80 higher than 90101).  If you are not defining a rule file to load all the commands in one shot, have a look at this answer for a slightly different take on restricting ports: How do I use ipfw to allow LAN access but deny Internet access?  <comment113495> This is perfect. Thanks bmike!
