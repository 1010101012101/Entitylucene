How to add Spotlight comments to the bundled OS X apps? <body> I'd like to add a Spotlight comment to TextEdit.app. Is that possible?  What I've done:  ul liOpen Finder/li liBrowse to /Applications//li liSelect TextEdit/li liPress kbd⌘/kbd + kbdI/kbd (Get Info)/li liClick the lock icon to unlock the dialog/li liClick on Spotlight comment text field/li liNothing happens. Even cut, copy and paste options are disabled in the context menu./li /ul  This seems to be the case for all the other OS X bundled apps as well (Font Book, iChat, iCal, …)  I emcould/em create an alias of the app and give comments to it, but are there any other ways?  <answer17183> You need to have write permission for the bundle. After you open the lock:  ul liSelect 'Read &amp; Write' permission for 'everyone'/li liAdd your comments/li liRestore the permissions/li /ul  <comment18675> Duh, someone needs to slap his face. Thanks! <comment18676> :-)  You're welcome. <comment18679> You could also try to set them as root rather than changing permissions. Something like `sudo xattr -w com.apple.metadata:kMDItemFinderComment "shazam" /Applications/Text\ Edit.app` should do the trick <comment18719> @bmike, say, first time I'd like to flag a comment as *"Not a comment — This was posted as a comment but it does answer the question. It should possibly be an answer."* if I could :-D <comment18737> I didn't have time to test it well - xattr isn't the best documented or stable command on OS X so I wanted it as a comment. If I can test I'll answer this later, but feel free to answer it yourself with xattr - your thanks is all the reward I need. <comment76642> You could also [run Finder as root or use xattr](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/64412/how-can-i-have-spotlight-comments-actually-get-indexed-by-spotlight/64416#64416).
