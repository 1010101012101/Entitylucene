Is it possible to create photo events from the Camera Roll photo's on an iPhone? <body> I see that the Photos app let's me create Albums, but is it possible to create and manage Photo Events on the iPhone without iTunes or iPhoto* on a Mac/PC?  *I say emiPhoto on a Mac/PC/em because the iPhoto iOS app doesn't appear to allow it either:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uxre2.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment79246> Actually, I believe the iPhoto app does allow it. <comment79389> @AceLegend - how? - please elaborate on your comment, and post it as an answer! <comment79391> That's the trouble. I believe I saw someone do it somewhere, but I am not positive. I do not have the iPhoto app, therefore I can not verify this claim. Just thought I would throw it out in case anyone else has used this app.
