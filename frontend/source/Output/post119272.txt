How can I stop Mission Control rearranging windows when I drag a window and press CTRL+number? <body> I have a setup with 4 Desktops/Spaces. When I click kbdCTRL/kbd + kbd2/kbd the focus moves to that desktop. When I want to move an app from desktop 1 to 3 I drag the window a bit and press kbdCTRL/kbd + kbd3/kbd (or 2 or 4 — these are Spaces/Desktop numbers). For some reason, the apps in other desktops move randomly from their desktops (rearranging the whole layout by moving other apps between desktops). Am I doing something wrong or is this some kind of bug?  I’m on Mavericks 10.9.1.  <answer124704> Go to System Preferences → Mission Control and make sure that the checkbox for strongAutomatically rearrange Spaces based on most recent use/strong is strongdisabled/strong.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jhbLo.png" width="782"  I am able to reproduce your scenario perfectly with this checkbox enabled and disabling this checkbox causes the spaces to be fixed in their position regardless of the switching of window position.  <comment145811> On the mission control preferences, is the second checkbox checked ? <comment146038> That's it, so much win. I am VERY gratefull <comment146040> Yep, grgarside also mentioned the same solution.
