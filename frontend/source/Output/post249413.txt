Macbook Pro Retina (Late 2013) won't detect startup disk, internal flash storage. Bad flash SSD? <body> I was working on my mac when it froze and I had to hard reboot. Then the file with the question mark came up. I tried the fixit advice by pressing command, option, and P&amp;R only for a new black screen with a circle with a cross through it. I then booted up internet recovery but disk utility could not detect my startup disk, the flash storage. I was able to connect an external hard drive and install OS X to it and it boots fine so I am guessing it is a bad flash SSD? Is there anything else I can try so I don't have to take it to Apple? I did use Apple Diagnostics and it came back "there might be something wrong with storage"
