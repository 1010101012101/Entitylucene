2nd SSD as main boot disk, what do I do with old filesystem? <body> Hello StackExchange!  After a couple years of using my macbook pro, performance has deteriorated with each update to OSX. I've tried a few things to improve it, and with no results, I decided to get a 128G SSD and a drive caddy for the CD drive, and install a clean install on it.    Using the SSD as my main boot drive, and wahla, great experience. Now, I just need my old stuff. Migration assistant isn't ideal because:    A) the SSD is 128G, and the HDD is 500G. Lots of applications.br B) I don't want to blindly copy over batches of filesystems, mostly because it's likely that I will copy over whatever caused performance deterioration in the first place (most likely my tinkering).    So, my questions are:br What's the best way to access and organize the files and applications on my HDD?br Can I just copy over specific applications? How do I copy their settings?br Are there things I should remove from the HDD? Like the old User Account?  Thanks in advance.  <answer176896> If you want to put your most-used files on the SSD and the less-frequently-used files on the HDD, you could make your own Fusion Drive. I'm paraphrasing the instructions here:  ol liTake a Time Machine backup of everything. strongTHE FUSION DRIVE-MAKING PROCESS emWILL/em WIPE BOTH DRIVES!/strong/li liMake a bootable OS X USB drive. If you can't, that's fine, but doing so will let Recovery HD live on the SSD. If you don't care about that, you can skip this step./li liBoot into your brand-new bootable drive (or Recovery HD, if you don't care if Recovery HD lives on the SSD or the HDD)./li liOpen Terminal and run codediskutil list/code/li liTake note of the identifiers (the "disk#s#" designations) of the drives you want to use as part of the Fusion Drive. If you're in a bootable drive, you can use the entire HHD, but if you're in Recovery HD, you'll have to only use the partition that is neither EFI nor Recovery HD./li liEnter the command codediskutil coreStorage create [arbitrary name that you won't have to look at anywhere but in Terminal] [the disk identifiers, separated by a space]/code/li liWhen that process is done, one of the last lines of the output should be codeCore Storage LVG UUID: [long string of letters and numbers]/code. That long string is your Logical Volume Group's UUID, and you'll need it for the next step./li liNow run the command codediskutil coreStorage createVolume [the UUID from the last step] jhfs+ "Macintosh HD" 100%/code/li liOnce that's done, your computer will officially have a single "volume" named Macintosh HD! Now you can reinstall OS X on it and restore it from your Time Machine backup, and it'll automatically migrate files between the SSD and the HDD based on the frequency of their use./li /ol  Good luck!  <comment209025> Exactly what kind of tinkering did you do? <comment209285> Not a bad idea. I'll look into this fusion drive.  However, I'm still looking into how to selectively migrate some of the old filesystem, such as a lot of development tools and applications that are installed. <comment209385> @mtronip If you want selective migration, you'll want to go into System Preferences  Time Machine  Options... and select the files you want to exclude from the backup.
