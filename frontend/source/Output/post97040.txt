one client makes packet loss to others <body> I have a D-Link 2640 modem in my room in an indoor area. When my friends connects to modem via wireless, I got a huge packet loss while pinging 192.168.1.1, and when he disconnects, everything works well. He's using ubuntu on Lenovo Thinkpad E530 and I am using Mac OS X on Macbook Air mid 2012.br What's the problem?br any idea to fix this?br thanks  <comment114105> Does your friend run any major network-traffic apps in the background (for example: a torrent client)? Could be starting some streams (and filling the airwaves) as soon as he connects.
