Can I assign Magic Trackpad 3-finger swipe up/down to scroll to top/bottom? <body> I have the trackpad on my Macbook pro set up to scroll to top/bottom on a 3-finger vertical swipe. As far as I can tell, that option isn't there for a Magic Trackpad.  It's very confusing to have both devices behave differently on the same gestures. Is there a way to fix this?  <answer3043> My Magic Trackpad did this right out of the box. I believe you should select "Swipe to navigate."  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Y9bYa.png" alt="alt text"  <comment2702> Yes, the setting is there but it doesn't seem to work in all applications. It works in Firefox (on most pages), but not in Chrome, for example. <comment2707> @Lizzan: That might be an application specific issue. I'm guessing it maps to the "Home" and "End" keys, perhaps Chrome doesn't recognize those? <comment2715> I would have thought so too, but it seems it's not that simple. "Home" and "End" work in Chrome, three-finger swipe doesn't. <comment2744> @Lizzan: it's because Chrome does not support the up and down 3 finger swipe.  It support left and right (back and forward).  You can't do it on a macbook touchpad either. <comment2929> Turns out it does work, but I was using Chrome most of the time to test it.
