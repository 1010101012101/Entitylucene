How can I sum values over a range of dates in Numbers? <body> I have the following formula   precodeSUMIFS(Daily Log::Income,Daily Log::A,"≥"&amp;A3,Daily Log::A,"&lt;"&amp;A4) /code/pre   that I want to sum income over the associated month.  As you can see, it's not doing what I am expecting it to—how can I effect what I need?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/VfaVZ.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer150811> It works by dereferencing the value of a cell directly to the condition  Example:  precodeSUMIFS(Daily Log::Income,Daily Log::A,"&gt;=2014-07-01",Daily Log::A,"&lt;2014-08-01") /code/pre  Referencing the cell could also be made possible with the same construct; by adding ampersand followed by the cell name outside the double quotes.  Example:  precodeSUMIFS(Daily Log::Income,Daily Log::A,"&gt;="&amp;A3,Daily Log::A,"&lt;"&amp;A4) /code/pre  <comment177466> Thanks; this didn't *exactly* answer the question, but it led me to it! Numbers doesn't understand the Unicode `≥` that I used; replacing it with the `=` composite fixed the issue :)  If you edit to include this information, I'd be more than happy to give you the tick.  (And welcome to Apple.SE!) <comment177478> Added according to the comment :) Thanks
