How to package and distribute a Keyboard Layout <body> I'm using Ukele to create a new keyboard for my language.   I can't find information regarding how to distribute it so that users can easily install and use it.  <answer207599> Keyboard layouts can be installed in one of the following locations: /Library/Keyboard Layouts/ ~/Library/Keyboard Layouts/ /Network/Library/Keyboard Layouts/  Also, perhaps useful:  https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/technotes/tn2056/_index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/DTS10003085  hope that helps  <comment250445> How does this relate to Ukele (the application the OP is using)? <comment250449> you could just provide a readme saying place "mylayout.keylayout" in /Library/Keyboard Layouts/  or you could try making an Installer Plug-in <comment250459> Well it sort of helped me, but not an answer and not a -1 at all @patrix as  I found this helpful:  "Keyboard layouts can be installed in one of the following locations:  `/Library/Keyboard Layouts/  ~/Library/Keyboard Layouts/  /Network/Library/Keyboard Layouts/`" <comment250484> Good to hear it helped you, but wouldn't the part you've wrote in the comment be more useful than a link to some overall documentation which may or may not contain the answer? <comment250504> It's from the same link @kipbits answered <comment250629> Check the Ukelele manual regarding .bundle format and Ask on the group devoted to Ukelele:  https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ukelele-users
