How to store all log messages from a facility? <body> I want to store all log messages of facility snafu, so I added one line to asl.conf and restarted syslogd. The final part of the file now looks like:  # save all mail, ftp, local0, and local1 messages  ? [= Facility mail] store  ? [= Facility ftp] store  ? [= Facility local0] store  ? [= Facility local1] store  ? [= Facility snafu] store /var/log/asl/snafu.asl  However, it is only the higher level messages that are now stored in snafu.asl. For instance, messages of level INFO are still ignored.  What is going wrong here?  <comment22443> What level of Mac OS X are you using. Older versions are plain syslogd - and newer use the apple logging daemon. You might be thinking syslogd when you need to hook into the newer daemon. <comment22486> I'm using Lion. What is this newer daemon you're talking about? Any reference is welcome...
