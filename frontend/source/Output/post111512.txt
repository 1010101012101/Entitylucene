How can I do text-to-columns in Numbers? <body> I've got a column where each cell in the column contains two different pieces of data separated by a known delimiter ", ". How can I split each cell in this column around the delimiter?  Given:  precodeCOLUMN1 ------- ABC, 123 FOO, 666 ROFL, 411 /code/pre  I want  precodeCOLUMN1    COLUMN2 -------    ------- ABC        123 FOO        666 ROFL       411 /code/pre  <answer111519> Just rename the file in question to end in ".csv" Then ("File"  "Open…") and Numbers.app did the right thing with the data for me.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ibt1x.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer111558> You can also replace the delimiters with tabs:  ol liCopy the cells and paste them to a new TextEdit document./li liReplace ", " with tab. You can insert a tab by pressing option-tab./li liCopy and paste the text back to Numbers./li /ol  <answer159988> You can do this directly in Numbers.  First, add two empty columns after the column with the data you want to split.  If the first piece of data you want to split is in cell codeB2/code and is separated by a space, then use this formula in the empty cell codeC2/code: code=LEFT(B2, FIND(" ",B2))/code If the data is separated by a comma, then replace code" "/code with code","/code.  In the empty cell codeD2/code, paste this formula: code=RIGHT(B2, LEN(B2)−FIND(" ", B2))/code  If your data is separated by a comma followed by a space, then use this: code=RIGHT(B2, LEN(B2)−FIND(",", B2)-1)/code  Hope this helps.  <answer187086> In Numbers 3 this worked for me by replacing commas with semicolons in the CSV-file:  Replacing  precodeABC, 123 FOO, 666 ROFL, 411 /code/pre  with  precodeABC; 123 FOO; 666 ROFL; 411 /code/pre  and then simply opening the CSV-file with Numbers.  <comment236599> This is what most closely resembles the proper answer for the question above <comment339488> Don't try to paste into the header row or column. Paste into an ordinary data cell. You can then right click on rows and columns to remove empty headers and/or change data rows and columns into headers.
