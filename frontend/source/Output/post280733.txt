Is there any way to program a Cliclick macro without losing control of the machine? <body> I'm using Cliclick, together with JavaScript (Node.js), to automate some tasks which involve clicking inside the window of an App running a virtual machine. That idea works, but I also lose control of the machine because it is moving the mouse around. Is there any way to achieve the same effect, but on the background?  <comment353174> I'm confused as to how you'd envision this working. How can it click where it's supposed to without moving the mouse? Do you want it to move the cursor back to where it was after it clicks?  It seems like you're using a very roundabout method to accomplish automation. What're you trying to automate? Perhaps some other form of GUI or other scripting would work better? <comment353194> My guess is that OSX perhaps could have a way to send click events to the app without actually moving the mouse. In fact, I think AppleScript has that, but it didn't work. I'm trying to automate clicking on buttons in an Android VM (VOX) running a game. How else do you suggest me to accomplish this? <comment353206> I feel like whatever emulator you're using should contain something, but I'm not farmiliar with it. Did Applescript's `tell system events \n\t tell process VOX \n\t\t click at {x,y}` not work? <comment353241> @JMY1000 It didn't work, no idea why! It simply doesn't click. I can activate the process with that, though. Just not click. <comment353302> Weird. Not sure what else you can do then besides using the -r option.
