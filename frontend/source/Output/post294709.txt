Installing command line developer tools without admin rights <body> strongProblem/strong  I need to install the command line developer tools on my school machine, running El Capitan 10.11.16. (I'm trying to install Jupyter notebook, and it says that      the "cc" command requires the command line developer tools [...]   When trying to install, however, the install fails with an error message      Can't install the software.    after downloading everything. I figure this happens because I do not have admin rights on this machine.   strongQuestion/strong:   When e.g. installing Python modules, I can use the code--user/code setting to install them without admin permission.   ul liIs there any similar way to get the command line developer tools?/li liOr any other workaround for this?/li /ul  Thanks!   <comment372056> Possible duplicate: https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/173841/install-xcode-without-admin
