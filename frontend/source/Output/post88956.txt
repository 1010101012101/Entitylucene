Keyboard shortcut to correct spelling mistakes <body> Is there any way for me to get all of the words detected by the standard OS X spelling checker as mistakes, to be corrected to the first available choice using a keyboard shortcut?  E.g. I type codeaqcuired/code and several words/sentences later I look up from the keyboard and see the typo. Instead of reaching for the mouse or tediously navigating there with the keyboard for a manual correction, I'd like to just hit some key combination and get it to be fixed to the obvious correction codeacquired/code...  Any solution which is applescript based will also do, since I can easily trigger any applescript from the keyboard (using iKey).  <answer89065> I couldn't come up with anything better than this:  precode--delay 0.3 --activate application "TextEdit" tell application "System Events" to tell (process 1 where frontmost is true)     set wasshown to title of windows contains "Spelling and Grammar"     keystroke "w" using option down     if not wasshown then keystroke ":" using command down     tell (window 1 where title is "Spelling and Grammar")         delay 0.05         try             select row 1 of table 1 of scroll area 1         end try         click button "Change"         if not wasshown then click button 1     end tell end tell /code/pre  For the keystroke command to work, create code~/Library/Keybindings//code and save this as codeDefaultKeyBinding.dict/code:  precode{     "~w" = selectWord:; } /code/pre  Other methods weren't really usable when for example the word under the caret was not underlined.  Many words don't have any suggestions. I think it's easier to just press ⌘: and retype words manually, or to press ⌘; and double-click the suggested words.  Adding codechangeSpelling:/code to DefaultKeyBinding.dict didn't seem to work.  <comment104439> could you provide some details on what the script and the keyBinding are supposed to do?
