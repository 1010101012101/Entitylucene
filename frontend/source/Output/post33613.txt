Macbook Pro won't play any sound <body> This was working earlier today, but suddenly didn't work when I tried to play music in iTunes.  I open iTunes, select a track, click play, the track doesn't play. The play button toggles between pause and play, but there is no sound and the position status bar does not move.  So I dropped a little lower level:  precode$ afplay audio.mp3  2011-12-13 12:28:51.446 afplay[30725:903] AQMEIO_Base::DoStartIO: error -536870184 2011-12-13 12:28:51.519 afplay[30725:903] AQMEDevice::StartIO: error -536870184 Error: AudioQueueStart failed (0xe00002d8) [exited with 1] /code/pre  Tried restarting the coreaudio daemon.  precode$ sudo kill -9 `ps ax|grep 'coreaudio[a-z]' |awk '{print $1}'` /code/pre  Still nothing.  Failing applications:  ul liQuick Look in Finder/li liQuick Time/li liYoutube content in Google Chrome/li /ul  It would seem to be either some low-level issue, or hardware? Any way I can confirm?  <answer33688> meh. A reboot fixed it. What is this, Windows? I would still like to know what caused the problem, what other avenues I should have explored and how to resolve it without rebooting.  <comment38329> Is video playing? Because I had a similar problem on my Mid 2010 15" MBP before a software update fixed it. <comment38336> Video was working in that pictures were animated in QuickTime and Youtube in Chrome, but no sound. <comment38356> you can add the update as the answer, and accept it to finish of the question so it doesnt seem un solved, thanks
