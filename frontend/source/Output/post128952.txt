Can you please specify that how much apple paying for per app downloads <body> Can you please specify that how much apple pays per app downloads.  I want to know that how much amount apple pays for app download/device.  I know, it's not a programming related question, but I don't know where to ask it. I posted a question on the Apple support forum, but got no reply.  Thanks in advance for your reply!  <answer128954> It depends on the price of your app.   For each sale, Apple charges a 30% tax on the price paid by the user.
