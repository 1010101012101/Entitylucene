Binding a keyboard shortcut to shut down <body> I want to bind a gesture in BetterTouchTool to the shut down menu that is invoked by pressing the power button on my MacBook Air.  It's fairly simple to bind gestures to keyboard shortcuts, so what I'm really looking for is a way to bind a keyboard shortcut to the shut down menu. You can't use the power button in BetterTouchTool, so I need to bind it to a standard keyboard shortcut such as kbdCommand/kbd+kbdShift/kbd+kbdS/kbd.  <answer7860> You don't need to map the power button, that menu is already mapped to kbdcontrol/kbd+kbdeject/kbd  hr  Other useful shutdown/restart/logoff key mappings are below which might be of interest too    Prompt to save work and restart the Mac - kbdControl/kbd+kbdCommand/kbd+kbdEject/kbd    Prompt to save work and shutdown the Mac - kbdControl/kbd+kbdOption/kbd+kbdCommand/kbd+kbdEject/kbd    Sleep - kbdCommand/kbd+kbdOption/kbd+kbdEject/kbd    Sleep displays - kbdShift/kbd+kbdControl/kbd+kbdEject/kbd    If the computer isn't responding and you need to force it to power off, you can hold down the power button for 6 seconds, you'll lose unsaved work though.    These power shortcuts are listed on the apple support pages  <answer8641> While @Griffo's suggestion is useful, unfortunately the eject button cannot be used in BetterTouchTool.  In order to get it to work with BetterTouchTool, I did the following:  ol liCreated a new shortcut in codeSystem Preferences &gt; Keyboard &gt; Keyboard Shortcuts/code for All Applications with the menu title codeShut Down.../code and I chose my own keyboard shortcut./li liI then bound a shortcut key in BetterTouchTool to this new keyboard shortcut./li /ol  It works as expected. The only drawback is that there are now two Shut Down options in the menu: codeShut Down/code and codeShut Down.../code It's a minor annoyance which I'm not sure how to fix.  <comment8501> Nice, thanks. Where can I get the full list of such keyboard shortcuts? <comment8513> Any ideas how to get an eject button, if you ahve a non-mac keyboard? <comment8526> I think F12 will work as an eject button if you hold it for about 2 seconds but I don't know if it will work with these keyboard shortcuts. <comment70574> Another option would be to assign a shortcut to `tell application "System Events" to shut down`.
