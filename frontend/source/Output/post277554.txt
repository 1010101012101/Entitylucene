Macbook Pro touch bar - screen problems. Blink and black screen of death <body> I bought a Macbook Pro Touch bar, and I use a external monitor.. in less then a  month it starts to blink to a dark screen and now it's completing black, even if I reboot the computer the screen comes back, it only works with a external monitor. I've seen that this new Macbook pro has a strongLOT/strong of screen issues and I want to know if someone got this fixed because I use a Macbook so I can move, but what I have now it's a computer that only works with a external monitor.   I'm really sad and disappointed with apple this time. If you are looking to buy it, DON'T they support about it's been really terrible, looks like they don't what's happening yet.   <comment349330> If you take it back to an Apple Store they should be able to take back the broken one and give you a new one
