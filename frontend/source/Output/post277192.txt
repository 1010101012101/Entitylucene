Can't create admin user with Mac OS X El Capitan <body> My girlfriend did a mistake when she deleted her session login! But, she has only one session login. Now, we can't connect to the Mac because we don't have any access... So I booted to Recovery Mode, opened Terminal.app and tried to execute:  precodedscl . -create /Users/mynewuser /code/pre  But it doesn't work ... Terminal said : create: Invalid Path  precode&lt;dscl_cmd&gt; DS Error: -14009 (eDSUnknownNodeName) /code/pre  What can I do please ?  <comment348901> Can we try to clarify the problem before we look into possible solutions? By session login you mean a user account? And there was only one account on the Mac and it somehow got removed?
