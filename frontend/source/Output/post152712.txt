Can mount afp share via mount_afp but not via Autofs <body> Current system, OSX 10.9.5  I've followed the instructions in this MacWorld hint and by reading the Apple doc for Autofs and several other places but I can't get codeautofs/code to automagically mount a remote AFP share on my NAS box:  precode$ sudo ls -l /private/etc | grep auto -rw-r--r--   1 root   wheel     149 28 Jun 09:35 auto_home -rw-r--r--   1 root   wheel     256 24 Oct 13:39 auto_master -rw-r--r--@  1 root   wheel      97 24 Oct 13:39 auto_nas -rw-r--r--   1 root   wheel    1935 28 Jun 09:35 autofs.conf /code/pre  h3/etc/auto_master/h3  precode# # Automounter master map # /-                                  auto_nas    -nosuid  # this one is mine +auto_master                        # Use directory service /net                                -hosts      -nobrowse,hidefromfinder,nosuid /home                               auto_home   -nobrowse,hidefromfinder /Network/Servers                    -fstab /-                                  -static /code/pre  h3/etc/auto_nas/h3  precode/Users/USER/Shares/Public   -fstype=afp afp://USER:PASSWORD@nasbox.local/Public /code/pre  The permissions on the codeShares/code directory:  precode$ ls -al /Users/USER | grep Shares drwxr-xr-x    3 USER  staff     102 24 Oct 13:31 Shares /code/pre  I've put codenasbox.local/code in code/etc/hosts/code and can ping it fine. I update the automount (I've also rebooted, no dice).  precode$ sudo automount -vc automount: /net updated automount: /home updated automount: no unmounts /code/pre  and…  precode$ cd /Users/USER/Shares/Public cd:cd:13: no such file or directory: /Users/USER/Shares/Public /code/pre  but, if I use codemount_afp/code it mounts the directory fine:  precode$ mkdir /Users/USER/Shares/Public $ mount_afp afp://USER:PASSWORD@nasbox.local/Public /Users/USER/Shares/Public  $ ls -l /Users/USER/Shares/Public  total 3718056 long list of file follows… /code/pre  Would anyone know what part of the incantation I'm missing to get the magic to work? I've tried all the obvious stuff like making the codePublic/code directory prior to mount, and changing permissions to it and codeShares/code, using direct maps, indirect maps, wildcards… I've still not got this to work :-/  Any help or insight will be much appreciated.  <answer153677> Please create a folder codeShare/code in the User folder and change your auto_master to  h3/etc/auto_master/h3  precode# # Automounter master map # +auto_master                        # Use directory service /Users/User/Share           auto_nas /net                                -hosts      -nobrowse,hidefromfinder,nosuid /home                               auto_home   -nobrowse,hidefromfinder /Network/Servers                    -fstab /-                                  -static /code/pre  and  h3/etc/auto_nas/h3  precodeShared_Folder -fstype=afp afp://User:Password@ip/Shared_Folder /code/pre  enter codesudo automount -vc/code in Terminal with the output:  precode$ sudo automount -vc automount: /Users/User/Share updated automount: /net updated automount: /home updated automount: no unmounts /code/pre  Please regard the additional output: strongautomount: /Users/User/Share updated/strong  strongBoth files need a trailing empty line/strong or it won't work and you'll get the following error:br codeautomount[pid]: map /etc/auto_master: line too long (max 4095 chars)/code or codeautomount[pid]: map /etc/auto_nas: line too long (max 4095 chars)/code  (all tested and verified with a 10.9.5 client and 10.7.5 server)  <comment180945> Thanks, that worked. It was actually the trailing line that I was missing that seemed to make the difference, and I didn't get an error message without it, just silent failure. But now it works! Many thanks again. <comment185938> Why did you delete your comment in http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/158083/mount-network-share-afp-smb-for-multiple-users-fast-user-switching? <comment185939> @softandsafe because it was a totally wrong answer. i'm just working on a better one
