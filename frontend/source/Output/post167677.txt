How to disable a specific sensor within a .kext? <body> I have a Macbook Pro 13" Retina, mid 2014 with a "right palm sensor" that is malfunctioning. It thinks that the computer is overheating, and it therefore is causing the kernel_task to eat up 250% - 500% of the CPU and making the fan rev at its maximum 6200 RPM. The computer is not overheating, and I think I narrowed it down to being the AppleSMCLMU.kext. Is there a way that I can go into that kext and disable the specific sensor, as opposed to disabling the entire kext?   Note: I already had the logic board replaced, which has seemed to fix this problem with everyone else on the internet. Any help is appreciated.
