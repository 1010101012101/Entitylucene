Changing the Finder icon for an external disk formatted as ExFat? <body> I used this web page recipe - Create Your Own Custom Icons in OS X 10.7.5 or Later - for creating a code.icns/code icon set containing a set of icons for an external disk that has been formatted with the ExFat file system.  However, whatever I do, when I drag the code.icns/code file on top of the drive, it just shows a .png dummy icon:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lyOZ5.png" alt="Drive icon for ExFat file system"  If I erase the drive and reformat it as OS X Journaled, then repeat the process, the icon is shown correctly:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/A9Tv6.png" alt="drive icon for OS X Journaled file system"  Is there a trick where I can reassign the icon also for an ExFat drive? I plan on using this drive both on a Windows machine and on my MacBook so keeping it as OS X Journaled isn't really an option. I know there are custom software for Windows so that I can read and write OS X file system disks but that's not an option either since I plan on connecting this drive to computers where I cannot really expect the owner to install custom software to use the disk.  And the icon is not emthat/em important. It would just be a nice touch.  What I've tried:  ul liBasic code.png/code file (that works on OS X Journaled formatted drive)/li liFull code.icns/code file (that works on OS X Journaled formatted drive)/li /ul  So can it be done? If so, how?  This is OS X El Capitan 10.11.4 and the drive is a WD My Passport Air 1TB if if matters.  <answer237339> I do a "Get Info" on the drive. This brings up the info window. To add the icon, I drag and drop the code.icns/code file on the image shown in the upper left corner of the window.     When I refer to a "drive", what I really mean is a partition located on a physical or virtual drive. Since the partition is ExFAT formatted, the partition can also be referred to as a volume.    Maybe your code.icns/code file is no good. Maybe you should try one of mine. You can download the ones I use here. Or, you can try the free online tool I used to create these code.icns/code files. Go to iconvert icons.  When you drop the code.icns/code file, a copy of this file is renamed code.VolumeIcon.icns/code and placed in the root directory of the drive. For example, if I use a Terminal application window, I can show this file.  precodeSteelhead:~ davidanderson$ diskutil list /dev/disk1 /dev/disk1 (external, physical):    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:     FDisk_partition_scheme                        *4.0 GB     disk1    1:             Windows_FAT_32 UNTITLED 1              808.2 MB   disk1s1    2:                 DOS_FAT_32 UNTITLED 2              808.2 MB   disk1s2    3:               Windows_NTFS UNTITLED 3              808.2 MB   disk1s3    4:                 DOS_FAT_32 UNTITLED 4              808.2 MB   disk1s5    5:                 DOS_FAT_32 UNTITLED 5              808.1 MB   disk1s6 Steelhead:~ davidanderson$ mount | grep disk1 /dev/disk1s1 on /Volumes/UNTITLED 1 (msdos, local, nodev, nosuid, noowners) /dev/disk1s2 on /Volumes/UNTITLED 2 (msdos, local, nodev, nosuid, noowners) /dev/disk1s3 on /Volumes/UNTITLED 3 (exfat, local, nodev, nosuid, noowners) /dev/disk1s5 on /Volumes/UNTITLED 4 (msdos, local, nodev, nosuid, noowners) /dev/disk1s6 on /Volumes/UNTITLED 5 (msdos, local, nodev, nosuid, noowners) Steelhead:~ davidanderson$ cd "/Volumes/UNTITLED 3" Steelhead:UNTITLED 3 davidanderson$ ls -l .VolumeIcon.icns -rwxrwxrwx@ 1 davidanderson  staff  26582 May  5 15:50 .VolumeIcon.icns Steelhead:UNTITLED 3 davidanderson$  /code/pre  Here is a screen shot from my Desktop.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5TGQz.png" alt="enter image description here"  h2If you something goes wrong read this:/h2  There must be a cache of volume names to icons buried in OS X.

Does that work? <comment290630> I am not sure what you are doing wrong. I tested on my Mac and this works.   My procedure is a little different from what you are using. <comment290633> @IronCraftMan No, gives me the same incorrect image. <comment290634> @DavidAnderson You did this with an ExFat drive? <comment290635> Both fat and exfat. The test drive is a USB 4GB flash drive. MBR partitioned with 5 partitions. I don't think GPT partitioning would be different. How is your drive partitioned? <comment290636> I tried with the first icon in that `.dmg` file, the "arrow_left.icns" file, and it shows as that odd `.png` icon for the ExFat drive, but shows properly for the OS X Journaled drive. The drive is partitioned as a Guid Partition Map. <comment290653> @Lasse: If my update does not work, I give up! Be sure to read my answer all the way to the end. <comment290676> I will try your final steps when I come back home later today, out of the house right now so don't have the disk. I did relaunch Finder and restart my computer at some point but I'm not sure what else I did just before and after so I'll be sure to try your specific steps. Thanks for the effort, even if it turns out not to help me out! <comment361910> Welcome to Ask Different and thank you for your answer. :) Unfortunately, short answers such as this don't really provide enough detail or context to help many users. If possible, it'd be good if you could add some more info on why changing the drive's name will fix this? Do you know this from personal experience, or do you have another reference?
