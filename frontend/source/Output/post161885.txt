Interesting partition Map with missing HD space <body> I have the latest generation Macbook Pro running Yosemite, I bought this computer used I don't know if the last person attempted to install linux or what the story is but I believe my partition map is a little weird.    Here it is img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/OBeX7.png" alt="Partition Map"First off I expected to have only a disk0 I don't know what the disk1 is.  I expected the drive name "Apple_CoreStorage" to be called "Apple_HFS Macintosh HD" like it is on disk1 both of these disks also say that they are 320GB in size although my HD is only 500GB.   There are also 2 recovery drives but when I boot into recovery mode it says that it is loading it from the internet.  I don't know if that is how it works or if it is not recognizing either of these.    My Final problem is with disk0s5 img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/SzkPw.png" alt="Disk Utility" There are 180GB that I cannot access it is partitioned as disk0s5 I can remove the partition but then it is just mapped as free space.  I try to increase the size of my "Macintosh HD" after removing the 180GB partition but I am not able to.    I feel like both of these problems are deeply intertwined, maybe my map is fine I am unsure but it doesn't look right to me.  Any ideas would be appreciated thank you.  <answer161889> Disk1 is a "virtual device" which resides in disk0s2 (the Apple_CoreStorage Volume Group which actually contains a FileVault volume). You have only one 'physical device' indeed.  Disk0s5 is probably an old Bootcamp installation.  strongThe clean way (get rid of the 2 codeRecovery HDs/code):/strong  ol liMake a complete Time Machine backup of codeMacintosh HD/code./li liStart to codeInternet Recovery Mode/code by pressing  kbdalt/kbd kbdcmd/kbd kbdR/kbd /li liStart  codeTerminal/code and enter following command at the Terminal prompt:br codediskutil cs list/code.

I used the non dirty unrisky way and everything went well except now... No recovery HD is there at all.  There are plenty of resources online about that though, thank you <comment189156> @Xavier Before adding a Recovery HD with Recovery Partition Creator 3.8 check that you don't have a CoreStorage Volume with  `diskutil cs list`. I will add a description tomorrow. i have forgotten that. <comment189157> I already looked around I have no CoreStorage Volume.  I have 1 more question.  What led to the CoreStorage Volume to being created and what are the benefits of it?  Thank you <comment189162> Probably FileVault 2 was enabled. Your whole Macintosh HD volume was encrypted (=secure). Another purpose of CS is the creation of a FusionDrive.
