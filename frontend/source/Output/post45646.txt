TextMate 2 Bundle creation <body> In TextMate 2, how can I create a new Bundle?   I´m using a programming language which so far doesn't have a bundle (so no syntax highlighting, snippets and so on). TextMate 1 used to have a Bundle Editor, but where do I get started in TextMate 2?   <answer45647> The easiest way to do it is to copy an existing bundle, rename it, and edit it.  Here’s the official manual on that: TextMate Manual → Bundles.     h35.2 Editing Default Bundles / Items/h3      Some of the default items may not be to your exact liking, for example   the coding style in snippets may differ from yours, so you may want   other tab triggers, key equivalents, or similar modifications.      If you edit a default item the difference will be stored in   code~/Library/Application Support/TextMate/Bundles/code. These are then merged   with the default version so your changes will be effective even after   upgrading TextMate. All new items you create also end up in this   location.      Bundles or bundle items which you install by dragging them to TextMate   or double clicking will be installed in code~/Library/Application   Support/TextMate/Pristine Copy/Bundles/code. Editing these will also result   in only the differences being stored in code~/Library/Application   Support/TextMate/Bundles/code, meaning that if you later get a new version   of this third party bundle, you can safely install this one on top of   the old one (by dragging it to TextMate) and again your changes will   be preserved.      If you want to discard local changes then currently the only option is   to delete these from code~/Library/Application Support/TextMate/Bundles/code.   hr  Alternatively, here’s a more visual guide (lots of screenshots): strongHow to create a TextMate bundle/strong.  <answer61283> As of this writing, the beginning steps are:  ol liGo to strongBundles (menu)/strong  strongEdit Bundles…/strong/li liPress strong⌘N/strong to create a new bundle./li liThe bundle gets saved in code~/Library/Application\ Support/Avian/Bundles/code; you may wish to right-click on the saved bundle and choose strongShow Package Contents/strong to see what's inside your bundle./li /ol  Further info can be found e.g. here and here.  <comment70725> I believe this pertains to Textmate 1.
