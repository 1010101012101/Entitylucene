Change space on both displays? <body> I'm trying to work out how to get the best out of the new multi-display support in OS X Mavericks. I'm very used to my workflow when I was changing space on both displays with single gesture on my trackpad - I'm a programmer so I had text editors in one pair of spaces and engine editor in another pair - now I have to do much more to get the same result. I know that you can disable separate spaces for different displays, but that (for a reason I can't think of) disables dock and menu bar on my second display.  I'd like to have either one of  ol liSame spaces with menu bar and dock on both displays./li liSeparate spaces that can be changed simultaneously./li /ol  Can this be achieved? Using some third party software perhaps? I'm also not afraid of doing terminal magic or writing an applescript.  Thanks!
