OSX Forgets WiFi Networks When Updating <body> I have been remotely upgrading machines from OS X Mountain Lion 10.8.5 to Yosemite 10.10.5 recently. I've noticed that for each one, all saved Wi-Fi connections are lost during this update, causing a problem once the machine finishes its upgrade.  Is this a "by-design" occurrence? I cannot find anything on it when I google the issue, and it might be a minor inconvenience, but it's annoying nonetheless.  <comment346943> I'd wager that it is by design. If it's happening to all machines. It seems more then coincidental.
