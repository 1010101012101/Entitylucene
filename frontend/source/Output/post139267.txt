Run program if connected to specific wifi? <body> Is it possible to have a program starting automatically when I connect to a specific router, and having it stop when I disconnect from this router?  Basically I want a program to run while I'm at work (flexible hours, so I can't just have some sort of timer function) but not when I'm at home - or somewhere else.  I'm running: Macbook air OS X Version 10.9.4  <answer139271> You can use strongControlPlane/strong where you can set up rules to carry out tasks such as opening apps based on various criteria which includes connecting to Wi-Fi.     ControlPlane supports multiple contexts where a context is defined as a location or activity you are performing.  Using evidence sources you can create a set of rules that tell ControlPlane what context to apply to your environment.  When ControlPlane enters or leaves a context a set of Actions are performed.   <answer139272> You can use strongSidekick/strong which lets you perform 'actions' when changing location. The location is reported using the specific Wi-Fi, which means you can do things when the Wi-Fi changes.     Sidekick is an application that automatically updates your laptop settings based on where you are. Just install the app, configure the places that you frequent, (home, work, a coffee shop, etc.) and never fuss with your settings again!      img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/04CrW.png" width="500"   <answer164001> I've created sample daemon app for this purpose. You can find it on Github.  To make it run:  ul liCompile it using Xcode./li liMove codeNetwork Listener.app/code to code/Applications/code dir./li liMove code.networkConnected/code and code.networkDisconnected/code to Your code$HOME/code dir./li liMove codeNetwork-Listener.plist/code to code~/Library/LaunchAgents/code./li liMake code.networkConnected/code and code.networkDisconnected/code executable./li /ul  It will automatically run when You log in to Your account. If You want to test it run this in strongTerminal/strong:   precodelaunchctl load -S Aqua -w ~/Library/LaunchAgents/Network-Listener.plist /code/pre  Scripts receive strongSSID/strong name as arguments.  Feel free to change it for Your needs. In case of any problems let me know.   hr  Everything was created to show the possibilities, a lot of things can be improved.  <comment164238> What kind of program Yuo would like to launch/terminate? I can write You a daemon which will execute bash script and pass "SSID" on connect and also "SSID" of disconnected network. <comment164239> Nevermind, i see that George found better solutions :) <comment164240> @Mateusz 3rd-party software isn't always a better solution, just an alternative! <comment191963> @MateuszSzlosek, I'm also curious what your solution would've been. For my purpose, I'd prefer something less than another application, as I'd be using your solution to hook up my application. <comment192151> @rsaxvc I've posted Github link with my quick implementation. A lot can be changed but You'll get the basics :) <comment192154> Sidekick is currently $29.00 <comment328725> Thanks for the inspiration Mateusz, I've created an app similar to yours to execute my VPN connection scripts, on Github including a compiled app binary for those wo might need it: https://github.com/p2/WifiWatch
