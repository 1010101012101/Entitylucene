How to inspect TCP/IP packets <body> How can I inspect IP packets send through currently open TCP connections? I opened a codenettop/code utility in Terminal, which I think lists IP packet, but doesn't tell anything about their content, namely about TCP Data Stream. Any clues? I found the source and destination ports and some other data that doesn't look like http messages. I would like to see how stuff works for educational purposes.  <answer238045> You can inspect network packets with WireShark.  This software capture all packets through a network interface, although you can select only the protocol you want by applying a filter in its settings.  <answer238049> In addition, you can use the built in command line tool codetcpdump/code. You will need root privileges to use it (so execute it with the codesudo/code command) - e.g. to see all IP traffic going through your interface, without listening to all other hosts' traffic, you can run:   precodesudo tcpdump -i en0 -p -vv -A ip  /code/pre  If you want to limit the output of codetcpdump/code to only show traffic to/from a particular host or IP range, you can do:   precodesudo tcpdump -i en0 -p -vv -A ip and host 192.0.2.123 /code/pre  or   precodesudo tcpdump -i en0 -p -vv -A ip and net 192.0.2.0/24 /code/pre  Read more about codetcpdump/code by running codeman tcpdump/code in your Terminal.
