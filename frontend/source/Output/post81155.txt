Can I launch an iPad application in a different locale than what iOS uses? <body> My iPad 3 is configured in French for the family but I prefer my apps un-translated. Is it possible to force an application to launch in a specific locale? Is it feasible without a third-party tool?  <answer81172> The short answer is that this is, unfortunately, not possible with the default install of iOS.   It is always possible that there is a jailbreak hack that allows this, but that would probably fall under the "third-party tool" category.  <comment93619> too bad. i really don't want to jailbreak the thing but i'm lucky since it came out very recently. Any recommendations regarding the app or you don't know about this kind of things <comment93664> @samy, no, I'm sorry, but I don't have any recommendations. A little strange, but my network doesn't allow me to go to the iOS 6.1 jailbreak website so I can't even look around there for you. If you find something that works for you please be sure to update us.
