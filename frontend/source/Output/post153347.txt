I'll try to get the actual error. Not too familiar with this. <comment180495> Also, there is a bottle (binary) of cairo in homebrew that can be installed without compiling if you're on Mountain Lion or above that might save you some trouble. You can see homebrew trying it on the first line but most bottles don't support installing outside of /usr/local <comment180502> if you need more detailed output of what fails. Try to install it with `brew install -d cairo` <comment180528> Thanks guys!!! Will try it once I get home. Just for the record, I'm using python-igraph to build some graphs. So need Cairo if I want to plot anything. (R's igraph is working with cairo, but I don't think they are sharing the same library)
