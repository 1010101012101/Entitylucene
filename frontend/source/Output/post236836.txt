How much difference is made on battery life when keeping mobile data switched on along with WiFi? <body> What if I turn on Mobile Data whole day along with WiFi? In this way, How much more battery is going to be used up?  I have WiFi connection at my home.. But sometimes it stops working.. And it's annoying to go to Settings and manually switch mobile data on Or when I have to leave my place I need to switch on my mobile data..  I am sorry if my question isn't clear.. I can explain it further..  Thank you.  Using : iPhone 6, iOS 9.3.1  <comment289939> This should not use up much battery at all; if WiFi is on, it will automatically connect to that and ignore cell data (except for GPS). <comment289953> This depends, and we can't really give a quantitative answer. Best is to run experiments yourself.
