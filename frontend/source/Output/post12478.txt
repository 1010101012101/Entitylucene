How can I backup all my jailbroken iPhone apps saves before restoring to new firmware? <body> I have a jailbroken iPhone (3Gs, iOS 4.0.1, bb 5.13.04). I want to get jailbroken &amp; unlocked 4.3.1 , but I cannot do it in other way than restoring from custom pwned firmware, so all my saves and app data will be erased.  How can I back up all my app data and games saves to restore them after firmware upgrade?  Thanks in advance.  <answer12481> There is an insanely detailed step by step process on how to do this using the cydia app appbackup on http://applemonday.com/2011/04/jailbreak-data-apps-ios-appbackup/ which basically grabs all your app data and puts it in one folder for you to ssh into and get.  <answer12675> PKGBackup ($7 from Cydia) will back up all your settings to Dropbox.  <answer14670> There is a new app out there, called Datadeposit and it saves your data to your dropbox account whyle syncing it. Awesome! http://www.iphonehacks.com/2011/05/datadeposit-nifty-jailbreak-app-allows-you-to-save-iphone-app-data-in-the-cloud-dropbox.html  <comment13053> Marvelous! I'll try it, thanks <comment13253> Is there any other way? I've installed AppBackup but it crashes right after splash screen :( <comment13254> to be honest appbackup is just a method of going through the filesystem and grabbing specific files and then putting them back in their places, so let me do some more research, there are definitely other options <comment13255> I love the google search term "better than x" http://www.pragmatixconsulting.com/iphoneApps/User_Guide.html and a guide to go with it since it is paid http://www.theiphoneguru.net/2010/11/22/guru-guide-back-up-and-restore-jailbreak-apps-for-ios-4-2/ <comment13258> thanks for that, will write about my results <comment13279> Keep me updated! <comment13299> I'd better do it manually, thanks :) <comment13300> @hobs, Paul Lefebvre mentioned PKGBackup, it also was mentioned in your links, but it is a bit unsuitable for me. As I see, there is no free tool except AppBackup which doesn't work at my phone. Nevertheless, thanks for your advices! <comment13315> We could also do some research on what folders it backs up, or even use ssh and rsync to backup 100% of everything, but putting it back would be expected to be non-trivial. <comment13390> Yes, I have some experience regarding that, I were just searchin some tool to automatize this process... It seems that I have to do everything manually as I've done somewhen :)
