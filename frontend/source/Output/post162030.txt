iPhone 6 Plus Wireless connection problem <body> My brother bought an iPhone 6 Plus, and it has a small problem.  When it connects to a wireless network, it will disconnect, and reconnect within a couple of seconds about every hour or so.   He has made sure that the software is up-to-date, and that didn`t help.   WiFi settings are Its WPA/WPA2, AES. Other iPhones connect without a problem.  What would be causing this, and how can it be fixed?   <comment189325> and what are the WiFi settings ? <comment190071> try to reset network settings
