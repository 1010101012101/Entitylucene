Parallels windowed mode - make window larger <body> I'm using Parallels 7 with windows 7 in windowed view mode. The program i'm running in windows is fullscreened. I want to make the window larger, as it's very small by default. Dragging the edges gives me a larger parallels window, but the program is still the same size, with the rest of the window filled black. Is there anyway to actually enlarge the program?  I have parallels tools installed.
