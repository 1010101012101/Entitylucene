How to recover data from a partition overwritten by an OS X installer? <body> I'd like to begin by stating that I'm not a moron, it has been (a) really stressful day(s), today being the worst of them all. I had a 2009 MacBook with 2 partitions running Snow Leopard. The first partition has all my data and the second is basically empty.  ul liMistake 1:  I downloaded OS X El Capitan (.app) file and I wanted to make a bootable USB to make first (and then backup). I ended up using this guide: How to make a bootable OS X 10.11 El Capitan installer drive. The problem is, this guide asks you to rename your USB to "untitled" since you'll be using a copy pasted code in terminal and the poster's USB's name was "untitled". So I did the same but guess what the name of the drive is where strongall/strong my data is stored. That's right, its 'untitled'. Now, the partition is named "Install OS X El Capitan". But when I do try to install the os, it says the copy of OS could not be verified./li liMistake 2  I ended up erasing that partition. Why?  I'm a fuckin moron/li /ul  This is a shot in the dark, please help me out. I had some important files there.  <comment363311> Search for the recent question starting "bootable usb " but the answer is basically stop using hhe mac / drive and use another mac to access the harddisk and use something like diskdrill to get the data if you sre lucky. If you are not then off to your backup... <comment363312> Possible duplicate of [Data Recovery for Accidentally Erased Hard Drive](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/267247/data-recovery-for-accidentally-erased-hard-drive) Hint: [Restore from backup?](https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2927/restore-from-backup) <comment363321> /me adds this one to the "Data Darwins" on klanomth's link ;-) <comment363322> Please don't ask the same question twice.
