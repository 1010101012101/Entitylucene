Trying to Open an EML file in Outlook 2011 using AppleScript <body> I have a LAMP database that outputs emails as .eml files. Outlook 2011 for Mac will not open them in compose mode so the only way I can open them is to Forward. This is very time consuming. There is a button that should work that is Redirect but there are no CC or BCC buttons.  I need to create an AppleScript that just turns the .eml file into an editable email that can then be sent.   I have tried this code but it seems to have stopped working,    precode-- Resend Message v1.0 (2010-10-27) -- an applescript by Barry Wainwright  -- Restores the 'Resend' function that was in Entourage but never made it to Outlook -- when the script is run, with a sent message selected or open, a new copy of the  --    message will be created, with all the original recipients and attachements and  --    from the correct sending account. -- This script released under a Creative Commons Attribution, NonCommercial, ShareAlike 2.0 England &amp; Wales License. -- see  for full details  tell application "Microsoft Outlook"   try     set theMessage to item 1 of (get current messages)     if not («class wSnt» of theMessage) then error -98   on error     display dialog "This script acts only on already sent messages. Please select a sent message and run the script again." buttons {"Abort"} default button 1     return -99   end try   set theSource to source of theMessage   set theAccount to account of theMessage   set newmessage to make new outgoing message with properties {account:theAccount, source:theSource}   open newmessage end tell /code/pre
