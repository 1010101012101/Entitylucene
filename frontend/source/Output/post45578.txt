Can apps use different Twitter accounts on iOS? <body> Now that iOS has Twitter integration, and many apps use these credentials rather than asking you for the Username and Password, I was wondering if there was any way to tell each app which account to use.  For example, in strongSettings  Twitter/strong, you can sign on to multiple accounts. Now let's say I use 2 apps that both have Twitter integration. Is there any way App A could use one account on Twitter and App B could use my other account?  Furthermore, I notice that at the bottom of the Twitter settings page, it shows a list of apps that have access to Twitter. Is there any way to allow each application access to only a specific Twitter account?  I noticed that the Twitter app itself has a   <answer45582> Developers access your Twitter accounts through the Accounts framework.  When an app requests access to your accounts, it uses the coderequestAccessToAccountsWithType:withCompletionHandler:/code method. (The only supported account type is currently codeACAccountTypeIdentifierTwitter/code.) This grants access to all accounts of that type.  Therefore, unfortunately, apps can't request access to only a single account â€” you have to give access to strongall/strong of your Twitter accounts.  <comment51945> And which one of them will they end up using? <comment51946> Whichever they choose. The app can request "`accountsWithAccountType:`" which gives them a list of all your Twitter accounts. Usually they'll present you with a list of your accounts to choose which one you want to use.
