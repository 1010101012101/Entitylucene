Why does my command line prompt now beging with "vpn"? <body> I was just (unsuccessfully) playing around with setting up a vpn in OS X Server, and now all my new terminal prompts begin with "vpn" followed by my user name. Anyone know why this is the case and how I can revert back to my default prompt, without "vpn"?  <answer169501> As you were setting up the vpn it got changed.  That can be changed in System preferences - Sharing - Computer Name.  Use Edit to change the name to your liking.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GlvXp.jpg" alt="sharing"  First it shows the Machine name, then your user name.
