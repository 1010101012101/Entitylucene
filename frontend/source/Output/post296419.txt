Can a MacBook Air 2017 be used for programming Java or Python and also for Web development? <body> I'm planning to buy a MacBook Air 2017 8 GB RAM with 256 GB SSD. The reason I'm going with a MacBook Air is primarily for portability and Battery life, since I see that it gives at least 10 hours.  Is it good for performing the below activities? Please suggest. I have looked into MacBook Pro line as well, since, it is heavy, it would be difficult to carry around where ever i go.  strongMy Primary Work:/strong  I would like to do only programming on this laptop, by installing IntelliJ IDEA IDE, PyCharm and WebStorm etc. I primarily work on programming languages such as Java, Python and Node.js for web development (even though am very new to web development)... I would like to run couple of containers on this device.  <answer296423> As the MacBook Air is a great computer, I can say yes for your usage.   The other alternative is the MacBook Pro 13’’ without touch bar. More power, a way better screen (important when you spend hours on line codes).   <answer296432> To answer your question about the Air: Yes.    You may want to consider broader options as well. For MacBooks in general, the biggest advantage to doing development on a them is that you get XCode and the best possible experience when developing iPhone/iPad apps and Mac apps.   However in your case, it seems you're not doing mobile development, and price and/or weight are a concern since you're considering a MacBook Air.  if you're open to windows, take a look at something like the HP x360 which is well reviewed and has advantages over the MacBook air:  ul liMBA is limited to 8 GB of RAM, while the HP allows 16 GB. This can be significant for software development./li liMBA only supports old style USB 3. The HP supports USB type C 3 .1 that can charge the laptop or drive an external monitor./li liHP has a watch band hinge that allows folding the screen back to be like the tablet. Not a big use case but actually helpful sometimes./li liMBA resolution is 1440x900, while the HP resolution is full HD 1080p./li /ul  Price and battery life are very similar between the two in a 256GB/8GB configuration.  Of course, Apple consistently has the best support and ability to use their stores.  If you have a hard requirement to stay on the Apple platform, I would suggest reconsidering the MacBook Pro 13. In general it's better suited to be a development machine, and it's really not that heavy to carry around.  <answer296433> I would get a MacBook over a MacBook Air if you can afford it.   ul libetter screen/li libetter storage/li libetter CPU/li /ul  The MacBook has NVMe storage which is superior to older technology in terms of iops and energy savings - for containers and dev work and compiling open source code - I’m very happy with the 2015 MacBook and the newer ones are even better. Any CPU in them is great so don’t feel you need to pay for the m7/i7 if you’d rather spend money on storage or accessories or a better display. In terms of productivity, you could program on a raspberry pi or three if you feel you need more “containers” to run. Unless I’m virtualizing something heavy like Windows - I don’t miss MacBook Pro CPU and hardware with my MacBook. That being said - the Air is also over qualified for what you describe.
