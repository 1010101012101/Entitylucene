Applying Auto-Correct <body> I have my Keyboard set to Polish Pro and my preferred languages set to English (primary), then Polish.  I have 'Correct spelling automatically' selected and 'Spelling:' set to 'Automatic by Language'.  If I start typing a document in English, auto-correct works. When I start typing a document in Polish however, it does not automatically correct my spelling. The correct language seems to have been applied, but auto-correct isn't automatically happening.  I'm looking for any keyboard-shortcut solution, whether that's a shortcut to change langugages, show auto suggested words I can select, or pretty much anything where I can avoid having to use my mouse to correct my spelling.  <comment167094> Have you made sure that only English and Polish are check in system prefs/keyboard/text/spelling/setup? <comment167110> Yes, only those 2 languages were selected. <comment167159> Will Polish get autocorrected if that is the only language selected (so English is not checked)? <comment167197> No, even if it's the only word suggested.. https://www.dropbox.com/s/p4ihj5l7oy6dnzh/Screenshot%202014-08-13%2011.21.40.png <comment167256> Sounds like a bug which Apple has to fix.
