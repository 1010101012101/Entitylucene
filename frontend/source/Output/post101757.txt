Can an .ipsw firmware restore image's origin be verified? <body> Given an code.ipsw/code iOS firmware restore image, can its origin be verified (e.g. through checking a digital signature) to provide assurance that it is actually from Apple and it hasn't been tampered with?  <answer101758> All IPSW SHA1 hashes can be found on The iPhone Wiki - Firmware.  You can get the SHA1 of your downloaded IPSW by running the following Terminal command:  precodeopenssl sha1 &lt;path-to-ipsw&gt; /code/pre  The output can be compared to the relevant SHA1 provided on the wiki.  <comment119908> This is very useful information,  though I was hoping for some sort of digital signature.  However, based on further reading, it doesn't appear such an animal exists.  Thanks! <comment143325> Necropost, but I'd thought it would be relevant to share this website: http://www.icj.me/ios/all
