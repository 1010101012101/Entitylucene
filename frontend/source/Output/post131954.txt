Restoring Whatsapp history doesn't work <body> I just got a new IPhone and downloaded Whatsapp. Every time I open Whatsapp, a message saying that the history is being restored from ICloud is displayed and a few seconds later a window pops up saying that the history has been successfully restored. The problem is that it keeps doing the same thing every time I open Whatsapp, so I can't use the app at all.  What can I do?  <comment155126> has it actually restored it ? <comment155142> @Buscarì›ƒ: How can I tell? <comment155143> turn off wifi or icloud <comment155263> @Buscar: How do I turn off icloud? <comment155264> @Buscar: I have tried to open Whatsapp when on flight mode and get the same restoring cycle.
