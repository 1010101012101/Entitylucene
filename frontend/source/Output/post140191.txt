Can't log in, but no error message <body> Odd problem this morning.  I go to log in and it accepts the password, thinks for a second and then dumps me back to the login screen.  I don't get the "shake" from entering the wrong password.  It seems to accept the password, but doesn't ever log in.  I managed to create a new admin user through single user mode and I can log in with that user fine.  I can also ssh in as the "broken" user.    Any ideas on how to fix this so I can log in normally again?  I'm running 10.9.4 on 8 month old macbook pro.  <comment165226> Fix the Permissions (ACL) for that user. <comment165231> I have filevault enabled, so the resetpassword tool doesn't really work.  Do I need to disable filevault or is there another way? <comment165232> did not know that, yes do it <comment165236> Just did it.  No good.  Still have the problem. <comment165237> sorry it did not work, I would try the Single user and Safe mode next. <comment165241> Been through those hoops already too.  Looks like a reinstall is coming. <comment165243> @CJ-F Try to log in and note down the times of you hitting enter after the password and it kicking you back to the login prompt. Then log into the admin account and check the Console application in the Utilities folder for that time period. My guess is something is causing a critical part of the UI setup for your session to crash which is kicking you back to the login prompt. <comment165245> @CJ-F Something else to try. Given that you can log into the account using SSH. Check the ~/Library/LaunchAgents folder within the account. Is there anything new or unexpected in there? For the sake of testing you could rename that folder temporarily and try logging in. Rename it back if it makes no difference. <comment165246> Nothing in LaunchAgents.  The only thing that shows up in the Console is "Dock: This user is not allowed to access the window system right now".  Googling for that hasn't led me anywhere productive. <comment165250> And before you ask, I wiped the dock plist but still the same effect. <comment165294> It's refusing to let the Dock application talk to the window server??? Could you grab a few of the messages before and after that one and pop them on http://gist.github.com?
