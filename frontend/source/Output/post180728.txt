How to change keyboard type if that option is no longer visible in Yosemite? <body> I am using an EU keyboard layout and the button below the kbdESC/kbd key is code"/codedouble quotescode"/code on codeOSX 10.10.3/code  Suddenly that key is automatically changed to the code&lt; &gt;|/code key  I checked keyboard layout and it is correct.  I think the keyboard assistant (which asks you to press the button near the left shift) can solve this issue, but I can't find that utility. codeSystem Preferences &gt; Keyboard/code no longer shows codeChange Keyboard Type/code.   How can I find/open that codeKeyboard Assistant/code or make that codeChange Keyboard Type/code button appear again?  <comment214716> What is your keyboard layout name?  By "EU" do you mean "US", where the US flag would normally show at the top right of the screen. <comment214717> See if anything on this page helps:  http://m10lmac.blogspot.com/2009/12/fixing-keyboard-type-problems.html <comment214729> Thank you. You showed me the way. Deleting plist file let me open the Keyboard Assistant but it couldn't detect the correct "type" (where the left shift is narrow). So I requested plist file from my friend and used it. It solved the problem! <comment214746> Good news!  I am still curious what keyboard layout you are using -- I'm not familiar with one which has quotes on that key.
