Macbook Pro not detecting HDMI display <body> I'm trying to connect an external monitor to my Macbook Pro with an HDMI cable. Neither the Macbook nor the monitor give any indication that they detect each other. The monitor displays the status of its inputs and it says that nothing is coming out of the HDMI cable. On the Macbook, the codeSystem Preferences-&gt;Displays/code thing doesn't indicate the presence of a second display. When I hold the codeOption/code key to get the codeDetect Displays/code button and click on it, it still doesn't detect the monitor. I've verified with other hardware that the HDMI cable and the monitor both function. Is there anything else I can try?
