UNIX Script to Change Desktop & Screensaver in 10.8 <body> I'm setting up LaunchAgent .plists that start up UNIX bash scripts to automatically change the desktop and screensaver for various different users for a Mac image that will be deployed to multiple Mac types.  I've got the system working fine in 10.10 and 10.9. Works like a charm every single time. However, 10.8 is being evil. (We need to run 10.7-10.10).  Here's the script:  precodeosascript -e 'tell application "Finder" to set desktop picture to POSIX file "/Pony Files/Pony Backgrounds/7.0 Default Backgrounds/OSX08 - Default Large.png"' /code/pre  I get an Applescript Error -10000 (Which I cannot find an origin for) I've also tried this variant  precodedefaults write com.apple.desktop Background '{default = {ImageFilePath = "/Pony Files/Pony Backgrounds/7.0 Default Backgrounds/OSX08 - Default Large.png"; };}' /code/pre  Neither work in 10.8. Any ideas where I'm going wrong?  <comment226945> Mac OS error -10000 (errAEEventFailed): errAEEventFailed <comment226948> Hmm, I just tested the AppleScript part on OS X 10.10.3 using your file path (which, of course, does not exist here) and it returned the same error. So I would suggest to check and make sure that the image is reachable, demo (2 lines): set newDesktopImage to POSIX file "/Pony Files/Pony Backgrounds/7.0 Default Backgrounds/OSX08 - Default Large.png" --  tell application "Finder" to if (exists newDesktopImage) then set desktop picture to newDesktopImage <comment227436> Unfortunately, AEEventFailed is about as cryptic as AppleScript can be. AppleScript mostly deals with AEEvents (AppleEvents Events are redundantly redundant)
