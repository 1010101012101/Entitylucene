Numbers default colors <body> The default grays in Numbers don't suit my needs (the gray is too dark). Is there any way to adjust this pallette? I always find myself diving into the colors palette but this gets time consuming and leads to inconsistent colors across my documents.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pUfeG.png" alt="Numbers colors"  <answer179941> Yes, you can make infinite custom color choices. Click on the color swatch wheel below the color fill drop down menu:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/iUa8d.png" alt="COLOR PALLET"  <answer179957> You can replace the colours in the default palette. Once you have set a cell to your preferred colour, drag the new colour from strongCurrent Fill/strong to one of the palette slots:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/u1M0P.png" alt="Dragging custom colour from Current Fill to palette"  This will replace the colour in the palette:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bw39e.png" alt="Palette showing new colour"
