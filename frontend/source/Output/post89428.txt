Real Time Audio Visualizer <body> I'm wondering if this software exists for Mac.  Where it will use whatever sound is currently being outputted and visualize it.  I would even take using the microphone to receive the sound.  Is there stand alone software that can do this?  Or a way to route the current audio into iTunes or Winamp and use their visualizer?  <comment104948> The use whatever sounds is bit brought term? <comment105209> What do you mean by "visualize it"? Do you now what kind of visualization you're after? Peak power? Average power? Time-based spectrograph? Something else? <comment105211> @Buscarì›ƒ Anything coming out of my computer's speakers. <comment105212> @IanC. Really any sort of graphic representation that would be entertaining to watch. <comment105216> OK, lets see what we can do for you than. But need you to provide your hardware details including you graphics card. <comment105217> Any budget constrains ?
