Is there a way to stop an app creating its own space at the back of the stack when you maximize it? <body> Is there a way to stop an app creating its own space at the back of the stack when you maximize it? I like to have my apps in the same space always but they keep jumping around to the back of the spaces stack, any help appreciated!   I'm using macOS Sierra.  <answer255021> Full-screen windows always appear in their own spaces. This has been the case for a while. There is no way to change it that I am aware of.  The settings that affect which space an app can be in only apply to non-full-screen windows.
