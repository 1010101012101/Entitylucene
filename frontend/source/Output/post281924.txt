Command in $PATH not found <body> I've created a symlink using:  precodesudo ln -s ~/Applications/calibre.app/Contents/MacOS/ebook-convert /usr/local/bin /code/pre  I can see the command codeebook-convert/code in code/usr/local/bin/code.  Then I've added code/usr/local/bin/code in my $PATH. I can see it when doing codeecho $PATH/code.  code/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin/code  But I still can't use codeebook-convert/code from terminal and I get the error:  code-bash: ebook-convert: command not found/code  What am I missing?  <answer281954> To analyze problems like that it helps to   ul licheck whether the target of the symlink exists (codels -l ~/Applications/calibre.app/Contents/MacOS/ebook-convert/code)/li licheck whether the target is executable/li liverify whether the shell sees the file in question (codetype ebook-convert/code)/li /ul  Doing so made me realize that Calibre was installed in code/Applications/code instead of code~/Applications/code.
