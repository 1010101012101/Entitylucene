Howto Setup External Drive as a Networked Drive <body> I've got an external 1.5TB drive I'd like to connect to my iMac and use as a networked drive so other computers can connect to it's IP and read/write to the Drive.  What would be the best way to do this?  Specifics I'm looking for:  ol listrongWhat format?/strong (I'm thinking NTSF)/li listrongWhat software?/strong  (FUSE or something else?) /li listrongHow would you set it up/strong using that software for a quick and easy install?/li /ol  <answer7122> My suggestion would be to format the drive to the default Mac OS X filesystem, HFS+ journaled. Then share the drive over SMB:  ol liOpen System Preferences/li liGo into Sharing/li liCheck the box beside "File Sharing"/li liUnder "Shared Folders", click the + icon and select the drive you want to share/li liClick the "Options..." button/li liCheck the box beside "Share files and folders using SMB (Windows)"/li liCheck the box beside the user accounts you want to have access to the drive/li liClick Done/li /ol  Once this is done, all you have to do is to configure Samba on your Linux machine to connect to the shared drive.  You could also share over AFP instead and use netatalk on your Linux machine, but I've found that Samba is better supported.  <comment7588> Just to be clear, you're going to be connecting this drive to your iMac via USB/Firewire and using Mac OS X to share the drive over your network? <comment7593> That's correct @Kyle, and I also need to be able to connect to it from a Linux box. <comment7597> thanks for the suggestion!  I'll be working on it over the weekend and hit the answer after I get things going
