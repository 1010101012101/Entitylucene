What kind of connector do I need for my HDMI cable for Apple TV? <body> Apparently, there are five kinds of HDMI cable connectors. Which do I need for Apple TV? I was looking at buying this cable.  <comment122144> The more critical issue probably is to find out what kind of cable the one on Ebay is :-) <comment122153> It should say A/V in the spec, audio +video! ask your self why other HDMI cost $10 and up ? if your mac is MacBook air you will need thunderbolt to hdmi adapter.
