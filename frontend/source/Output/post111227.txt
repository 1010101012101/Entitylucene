How to transform an Apple Mac Mini intro a reliable Ubuntu Server? <body> This question is about what steps are needed for transforming an Apple Mac Mini into an Ubuntu server.  Here are some areas:  ul liinstalling Ubuntu and making it to be bootable from EFI by default/li lienabing CPU and fan control (by default it does not work)/li libe sure that it will power on after power failure/li liSSD configuring (assuming that the primary disk is a SSD and that you may have a HD as the second disk, nobody needs the DVD drive)./li /ul  <answer111228> First install coderEFInd/code, and boot Ubuntu installer after.   Enable "Boot after power failure" by adding next line to /etc/rc.local:  precode setpci -s 0:1f.0 0xa4.b=0  setpci -s 00:03.0 0x7b.b=0x19 /code/pre  Install mac fan control:  precodesudo add-apt-repository ppa:mactel-support/ppa sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install -y macfanctld applesmc-dkms /code/pre  For SSD tunning (you have to adapt to your config) here is my code/etc/fstab/code file:  precodeUUID=&lt;...&gt; /        ext4   noatime,nodiratime,errors=remount-ro 0       1 UUID=&lt;...&gt; /boot    vfat   defaults,noatime,discard    0   1 /code/pre  What is important to remember here:  ul licode/boot/code is the coderEFInd/code partition, as you can keep all in the same place./li liI added noatime,nodiratime to the / partition as this will lower the tear-down of the SSD./li /ul  Do noy add codediscard/code or codeext4discard/code to the list of options because instant TRIM will slow down your SSD too much.   The optimal solution is to run TRIM in a daily crob job, by running something like:  precode fstrim -v /  /code/pre  Other resources:  ul lihttp://www.frozenindustries.com/2012/11/04/ubuntu-12-04-lts-on-an-apple-mac-mini-late-2012//li /ul  <comment215295> Thank you for creating this answer. My question is whether or not things have changed for the current generation. I'm planning on installing Ubuntu onto a PCIe 256 gig SSD on my brand new mac mini.  I specifically do not understand what:  `setpci -s 0:1f.0 0xa4.b=0`  Does. Also, are the backticks included? Normally backticks are used to quote code, but it seems you double backticked this. Thanks in advance! <comment215631> The only issue would be the ability to power itself on after a power failure, this is what this line is supposed to enable. It depends on the chipset so you may need a different one. No back ticks needed.
