Powering macbook pro 2016 reusing old 87w magsafe wall power? <body> Would a hub capable of output charging via usb c but powered with a wall 85watt magsafe ( or magsafe2) solve our trouble?  I'd like to reuse the several magsafe and magsafe2 wall pwrs I own to power the new macbookpro 2016 (carries only 4 usbc).  Is there an hub powered by magsafe with an usbc power output?  Is this hub existing and reliable, hopefully from apple?  <comment362456> Welcome to Ask Different. Unfortunately, your question doesn't provide enough detail for us to help you. Reading [how to ask a question](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/how-to-ask) may improve your chances of getting a good answer. For now, can you please edit your question (there's an edit link below it) to add info such as what you mean by _solve our trouble_, because at present your question doesn't describe any sort of problem. Also, can you clarify _how_ it is you intend to power a hub from an 85 watt MagSafe adapter? Or is it just that you want to know if such a hub exists? <comment363028> Edited and hopefull more clear now. Reusing old magsafe through a hub to power the new mcbpro. This'd avoid to carry usbc power wall around and to reuse the old I own
