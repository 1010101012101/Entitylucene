Dropbox.com not accessible on Yosemite 10.10.3 <body> I've OS X Yosemite 10.10.3. Since sometime dropbox.com is not accessible on my mac. Now since few days dropbox in my finder doesn't sync. I uninstalled it and now I cannot install as dropbox.com doesn't connect. I have done all the updates since updating to Yosemite. The traceout shows that the second last hop blocks the connection. Could anybody please help me?  <answer189558> For some reason your connection time is very long.  Lets test it.  Open the Terminal app located in your Utility folder.  Now type codePing dropbox.com/code  It should come back with something like this      PING dropbox.com (108.160.172.232): 56 data bytes      64 bytes from 108.160.172.232: icmp_seq=1 ttl=51 time=19.474 ms   I have about 15 to 20 milli seconds (ms), you are showing few hundreds ms (500). that is definitely not good.  Based on your results you have a Ping (some Internet address) problem while your Internet speed is very good.  Usually that comes from the DNS (Domain name Server), not resolving the Internet address correctly/Fast.  ul liFirst lets clean your DNS cache, just in case something is stuck in there./li /ul  Use Terminal and run codesudo discoveryutil mdnsflushcache/code enter your password when asked. Now you should have a clean cache and can start over.  ul liNext would be to run a trace route (to Dropbox) to see where is it going and where it takes forever. In Terminal type codeTraceroute Dropbox.com/code and wait for it to finish (it takes few moments. The first line is to your router and it should be less the 1 ms (I have 0.7 ms). The following lines are other routes (you can see the names of the servers). I end up with 30ms to the dropbox./li liLets carefully check your Network settings step by step./li /ul  TCP/IP -Use DHCP  DNS- we discussed that (but take note how many you have in there and what they are)  Proxies- they should be all off  Hardware- Automatic (MTU-Standard 1500)  ul liLets see who is using your Internet. Turn off programs like Mail, Browser, Skype ect. to make that a short list./li /ul  Now type codelsof -i -P/code in Terminal and look who is still using your Internet.  ul liThere is a small application/Script that will evaluate all DNS servers around you and recommended which one is fastest for you to use. Give it a try, I use it and it does help with the DNS stuff./li liThe following is to just check the content of your Host file. Follow the instructions here to test your Host file setting./li /ul  <comment224737> Can you log in in to the Dropbox on-line version (without installing it on your Mac) <comment224769> No I can't. The website is unaccessible since months. I can login to my account from other mac and pc and my mobile. <comment224807> Could you show us the trace with the problem <comment224833> 20  ae13-sjc8-dr02.net.dropbox.com (108.160.174.234)  572.383 ms     ae11-sjc8-dr01.net.dropbox.com (108.160.174.230)  410.248 ms  508.492 ms 21  108.160.164.19 (108.160.164.19)  628.087 ms  408.700 ms     108.160.164.25 (108.160.164.25)  409.703 ms 22  * * * 23  * * * 24  * <comment224835> With Ping dropbox.com I getRequest timeout for icmp_seq 0 Request timeout for icmp_seq 1 Request timeout for icmp_seq 2 Request timeout for icmp_seq 3 Request timeout for icmp_seq 4 Request timeout for icmp_seq 5 Request timeout for icmp_seq 6 Request timeout for icmp_seq 7 Request timeout for icmp_seq 8 Request timeout for icmp_seq 9 and it goes on <comment224837> OK, "Huston we have a problem" :) <comment224838> Let s try to Ping google. com to test that. <comment224839> With Nettop I don't get any dropbox activity.

Could you hold the "alt" key and click on the WiFi icon and report the RSSI #, the Transmit Rate #? and the MCS Index # <comment224847> RSSI is 59 dBm,  Tx Rate is 39 Mbps, and MCS index is 5 <comment224848> I've taken my mac to our internet provider as well and the same problem persisted there <comment224849> wow...with those kind of numbers you should be getting speeding tickets :) so what is the problem with the Ping ? let me think...while having lunch <comment224850> ok, I have to go away for a while, you can check your DNS setting in the syst pref network, and add gooles DNS server 8.8.8.8 and move it to the top. DNS resolves the Internet addresses. <comment224851> Ok. I'll try that <comment224852> Its already added. <comment224923> Many thanks. Your last advice of testing the host file setting and the link worked. I have now access to dropbox website and also able to install it. Many thanks for all your time. <comment224926> I am unable to find out how to mark the question done. <comment225069> Just checking if you are still a happy user, now that you finally got your dropbox working. And if you could share with us what was wrong with your HOST file. <comment226092> Indeed I am a happy user since then. Many problems resolved. You are the best :-). There were dropbox addresses added in my host file, which I could simply delete as told by you [here](http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/129858/46541)
