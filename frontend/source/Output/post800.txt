How do I eject the Time Machine backup drive automatically after each backup? <body> How do I set Time Machine to eject my external Time Machine backup drive automatically after each backup?  <answer801> There might be a better way, but one solution might be to Applescript it.  I haven't yet found any way to run an applescript after a backup, but you could:  ol liTurn off automatic TM backup/li liSet up an applescript to run TM ul liSome googling turned up this line to force an immediate TM build: codedo shell script "/System/Library/CoreServices/backupd.bundle/Contents/Resources/backupd-helper &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1 &amp;"/code/li /ul/li liAdd a line to eject the disk afterwards. ul licodeeject disk somedrivename/code/li /ul/li /ol  If you want this to happen on a regular basis, you could attach it to a cron job.  <answer58675> ~/bin/timemachine:  precode#!/bin/bash  d="Time Machine"  # (change this to match the name of your backup drive) diskutil mount "$d" &amp;&amp; tmutil startbackup -b &amp;&amp; diskutil eject "$d" /code/pre  ~/Library/LaunchAgents/timemachine_eject.plist:  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt; &lt;!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC -//Apple Computer//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd&gt; &lt;plist version="1.0"&gt; &lt;dict&gt;     &lt;key&gt;Label&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;string&gt;timemachine_eject&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;key&gt;Program&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;string&gt;/Users/username/bin/timemachine&lt;/string&gt; &lt;!-- Replace "username" with your username.

I wonder if you could exploit that to achieve what you want? <comment17995> [Here is a similar idea at Mac OS X Hints](http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20100712085231232), using a python script. <comment114543> I love this solution, I further automated this process to mount and unmount work when I plug my drive and on a schedule.

The following change works though:  keyProgramArguments/key  string/Users/martin/bin/timemachine/string             /array
