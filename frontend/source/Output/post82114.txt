What are the “~orig” files in OS X? <body> In the code/etc/code folder of my system (OS X 10.8.2) I see a bunch of files named with the "code~orig/code" suffix (e.g codehosts~orig/code, codepasswd~orig/code, etc). What are these?  <answer82116> Those are the leftovers of OS upgrade.  The OS X upgrade saves previous configurations that's going to be changed.  The date of ~orig file should correspond with the OS upgrade.  <comment94695> Probably backups made by some program. Did you edit these manually or do you have something installed that modifies them automatically?
