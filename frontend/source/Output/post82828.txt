Shared Internet apply /etc/hosts <body> How do I make those who connect to me via a shared internet connection use my /etc/hosts file? I was thinking something along the lines of creating a DNS server, but I was hoping maybe there is a simpler solution?  <answer82842> You will need to install a DNS server. If you need a DNS server that automatically synthesizes answers from the contents of code/etc/hosts/code, use dnsmasq.  <answer92074> There's also Gas Mask that let you share some hosts through some file on the network, your users would have to install it and configure it to the right file.  <comment95500> Why dio you want to do this - a bit more info will help us to think what the solution is
