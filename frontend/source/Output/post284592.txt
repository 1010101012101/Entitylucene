Photos on El Capitan - not registering most recent import <body> I am trying to upload images from photos onto a website, but when I open the file box to select my photos, my most recent import does not show up, nor any of the pictures I thought I transferred from my iPhoto library. Does anyone know what I did wrong, or what I need to do?  <comment358888> Welcome to Ask Different.
