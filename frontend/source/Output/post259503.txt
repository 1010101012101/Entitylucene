Weird Artifacts on screen <body> I have been having an issue lately where after using my computer for awhile I will have these weird artifacts on the screen.  What I find even more weird is that they show up in screen grabs, I have had this problem before where the GPU started failing and I would get artifacts on the screen but the screen grabs would not pick them up.  What is causing this, is it still the GPU failing?  My computer specs are as follows OSX 10.11.6 Mac Pro (Mid 2010)  Processor 2x3.46 GHz 6-Core Intel Xeon  Memory 32GB 1333 MHz DDR3 ECC  Graphics NVIDIA GeForce GTX 680 4096 MB  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0DPEU.png" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mejj1.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment324689> General rule for screen captures is - if they're clean, it's the screen; if they're also affected, it's the card. I'd say run AHT, but unless that's a specific Mac-flashed card you won't be able to see the screen at boot. https://support.apple.com/HT201257 <comment324826> It is Mac-flashed, so I will check this out and see if anything useful comes of it
