Is there a browser that has a "tab history" to easily traverse lots of tabs to the Nth one before the current tab? <body> Sometimes I have scores of tabs open in Safari, and while working on one tab I need to refer to another tab (or several other tabs) and return to the one I was working on. Sometimes it is time-consuming to find the tab I had been working on, and I am hoping that there is a way to spend less time getting back to work after doing a little research.  strongIs there a feature that would allow me to traverse my tab-switching history?/strong   Eg, while Command + Left Arrow would navigate to the previous page in the current tab, perhaps Option + Command + Left Arrow would switch to the tab I had in focus before switching to the tab I am in now.  <comment202567> This can find tabs from a search term, not quite what you asked for, so not posting as an answer - http://hea-www.harvard.edu/~fine/OSX/safari-tabs.html <comment202568> This shows how to set up keys to call specific tabs http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20070730145747991 Between the two, there may be a way to drop back & forth through the order of 'last in front'
