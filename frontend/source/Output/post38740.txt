Batch conversion of xlsx to xls via CLI? <body> I'm trying to convert a bunch of xlsx files to xls (because some other softwarecode&lt;cough&gt;/codematlabcode&lt;cough&gt;/code can process xls but not xlsx on the mac).  I've tried unoconv but it has issues (which apparently stem from pyuno's shared object not being 64-bit-compatible -- even trying to override this with   precode$ VERSIONER_PYTHON_PREFER_32_BIT=yes ./unoconv /code/pre  still dies, this time with codeFatal Python error: Interpreter not initialized (version mismatch?)/code which I'm surmising has to do with a mismatch between the python used with OpenOffice and the one shipped with MacOS X).   I'm using the Microsoft-provided "Open XML Converter" in the meantime, but I'd really like to figure out a way to do it with FOSS tools and via the shell.  Any ideas?  Oh, I'm running on Snow Leopard if that makes any difference.  <answer38758> I've not tried this with .xls(x) files per say, but I have used LibreOffice to batch convert .doc(x) files to .pdf using the codeconvert-to/code option.  OpenOffice has the same options, afaik.  Check the codehelp/code option for your app.  In my case it was:  precode/Applications/LibreOffice.app/Contents/MacOS/soffice -help /code/pre  In particular, for my switch to .pdf files, I did something like this:  precode/Applications/LibreOffice.app/Contents/MacOS/soffice -headless -convert-to pdf:writer_pdf_Export *.doc /code/pre  The code-headless/code flag just prevents the whole GUI from loading.  There is likely a similar output file extension and filter (the codepdf:writer_pdf_Export/code) for your .xls(x) case.  <comment43862> OK, thanks-- OpenOffice 3.3 doesn't have seem to have the -convert-to (and -headless claims to be recognized, but still causes the GUI to fire up).  LibreOffice does the trick (though it still seems to be spending time firing up a bunch of stuff in the background).  I used this command line: `$ /Applications/LibreOffice.app/Contents/MacOS/soffice --headless --convert-to xls 'test 1873.xlsx'` <comment43870> The LibreOffice icon will show up in the dock, but I don't' get it loading a bunch of stuff.  Also, for my install, the options aren't long options - they only have one `-` character, not two.  That is interesting about OpenOffice not having these options.  There is probably a way to define a macro in OO and then call that macro from the command line, but I'm unsure. <comment44021> I get it loading stuff (lots of disk spinning and time elapsed) and actually switching visual focus to the space (virtual desktop) where I have OO pinned -- not intolerable, but not what I would have hoped for "headless".  Oh, this is on LibreOffice 3.4.5 OOO340m1(Build:502) <comment44138> Interesting.  I'm using LibreOffice 3.3  330m19(Build:401).  Not sure what has changed, but at least it is working for you now :).
