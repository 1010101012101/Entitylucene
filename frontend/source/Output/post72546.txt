Problem getting notifications of direct messages in Twitter <body> For the past few days, I have not been getting notifications when I receive a direct message on my Twitter account. strongI keep changing the notification settings to the way that I want them, but they keep resetting back to default./strong I have tried uninstalling the app and reinstalling it.  I have tried installing the app from the App store and from the Settings menu on my iPhone 4.    Any help to the situation would be greatly appreciated.  <comment89382> You might be better off emailing Twitter: https://support.twitter.com <comment104453> try your "other" twitter account! <comment105808> Let us know if you have additional data, but this looks more like an isolated failure where we need to guess what you've done to troubleshoot this...
