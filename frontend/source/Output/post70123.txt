access and recover leopard time machine backups in mountain lion <body> I will be upgrading a MacBook Pro (late 2008) from leopard to mountain lion soon with a a complete wipe by booting and installing from a self made mountain lion USB stick.   That MacBook Pro has created quite a lot time machine backups during its leopard time onto a separate external drive.  Will I be able to access these old leopard time machine backups in mountain lion, after doing a clean (wipe) install of mountain lion?  Do I need to to do take any precautions or do anything special to make this possible? Are there any obvious pitfalls?
