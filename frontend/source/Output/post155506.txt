trying to restore contacts in yosemite with time machine <body> ok -- so my wife lost her contacts on her macbook pro (and icloud as well), but we use time machine -- i was trying to look around for help in how to restore ALL her contacts using time machine -- is there a file somewhere that contains all the contacts on the system that by replacing it with a full batch of contacts would replace the empty one i have how???  thanks  keith  <answer155507> As far as I can ascertain, all the data is stored in ~/Library/Application Support/AddressBook/  Might be safest to zip the existing structure (if any) &amp; copy the backup in its entirety to that location, rather than try pick bits out of it. I'm uncertain what checksumming/history it might keep in each file.   Also, I'm not sure how much iCloud might want to argue with that change :(  <answer209745> To add to what @n1000 said above, some more details:  ul liconnect your time machine backup drive/li liyou may need to login as root to get access to that Library folder/li lichoose Finder-Go To folder- &lt;path-to-library&gt;, where &lt;path-to-libary&gt; is something like "/Volumes/MyTimeMachineDrive/.../Users/keith/Library"/li liin there you can then browse to Application Support-AddressBook (I forget the details of where exactly it is)/li licopy the AddressBook back to your MBP and change ownership on it (if you are root) so that it can be read/written to by "keith"/li lire-login as "keith" and move the AddressBook to same location on your MBP "/Users/keith/Library/Application Support" (I think)/li liyou will be asked to overwrite - go ahead if you want to turf the old AddressBook/li liopen your contacts and voila! all should be well after that.../li /ul  strongPlease note/strong that I had to do the the above because I had to restore contacts from a time machine backup drive of an old MBP to a new one (and the old MBP was dead, so I could not simply export contacts from it...).  <answer209758> If you have removed contacts in Contacts and want to restore them and have Time Machine backups.  ul liOpen up the Contacts app./li liEnter Time Machine by using the drop down Menu "Enter Time Machine" in the TM menu bar./li /ul  You can now browse through previous contacts, select and restore them.  When you restore, the contacts app will ask you if you want to add #n cards to Contacts.  As far as I know this has always been possible in previous OS X versions. Although I just tested this to make sure on El Capitan.  <comment183132> ok -- it's just that on my macbook pro with yosemite installed, i can't see anything that looks like "AddressBook" in the folder called "Application Support" -- that's why i asked specifically regarding yosemite (10.10) of OS X <comment244296> @keith The ~ stands for your home folder, i. e. /Users/keith/. Normally Library is invisible. You can paste the path given in the answer after pressing cmd + shift + g in Finder. Once you are in that Folder, enter Time Machine.
