iChat: Very slow transfer speeds/Port Restricted <body> I have a 12mbps connection, so I know that my ichat transfers should be super fast.  When I receive files from some people, my transfer rate is about 1k/sec, which is horrible.  Why would this be happening?  Do I need to do something with my router?  In the Connection Doctor it says Router Type: Port Restricted.  <answer13829> You'll want to use these two documents to forward the appropriate ports on your router:  ul liUsing iChat with a firewall or NAT router (apple.com)/li liZyXEL Q1000Z: How to create a custom Application Rule (qwest.com)/li /ul  If you have specific questions about port forwarding on your router, you could try asking over at Super User.  <comment14723> You'll probably need to modify your router's NAT settings.
