El Capitan - Enable Tap-to-click on login screen <body> I want to enable Tap-to-click for my trackpad on the login screen of my MacBook Pro with El Capitan 10.11.6 (15G1004).  I tried everything proposed on this old question but nothing has worked.  Could you help me please?  <answer252888> Type the following in the terminal and reboot device after that.  precodedefaults write com.apple.driver.AppleBluetoothMultitouch.trackpad Clicking -bool true defaults -currentHost write NSGlobalDomain com.apple.mouse.tapBehavior -int 1 defaults write NSGlobalDomain com.apple.mouse.tapBehavior -int 1 /code/pre  I've tested them on my Macbook Pro 15" 2015 running code10.11.6/code  Source: https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles/blob/master/.macos  Mathias Bynens posted a similar question a few years ago. He wrote the above file on Github.  <answer283072> I just tried this and it worked on Sierra but should work on older versions too...

Does it require a restart or logging out or something like that? <comment314751> Sorry, for the missing information. It requires a logout. <comment314778> Thank you @varunyellina, but unfortunately it's not working for me. :(  Is there something I can check to figure out where is the problem? Is that command meant to edit any configuration file on the system? <comment314782> They did work for me. Just to confirm, I did further testing and they don't seem to be very reliable. I'll update the answer with proper results. <comment314795> Neither this is working for me (the updated answer with the Bynens code)... :( <comment314799> Hope you rebooted your device. <comment314801> Yes, I did twice... I opened the terminal, logged in as root with `sudo su` and then pasted the 3 commands, then `reboot` from the terminal itself. The second time I repeated the process but rebooted from the system menu.  Did you typed the commands as root or did you use `sudo`? <comment314877> I typed the commands without sudo as a regular user. <comment314907> I've just tried without sudo but doesn't work.
