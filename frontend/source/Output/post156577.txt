Want to play a game on my mac after losing my iPad? <body> So recently I lost my iPad and on it was Clash of Clans. I was wondering if I could continue playing it on my Mac with the Game Center account I used on it? And if so, how? I was pretty far in the game and I really do not want to wait until I get a new apple device.  Thanks.   <answer156580> Clash of Clans is not available for OS X so you won't be able to play it on your Mac.  <answer176749> you can play Clash of clans on you mac or windows , you just need to download the emulator for it.  here is the link from you can download the emulator of your choice:http://techapple.net/2014/05/3-best-android-emulators-for-mac-os-macbook-run-and-install-android-app-on-your-mac-os-x-macbook-airpro/  but i prefer: Droid4X because its free and it will give you full access like you have on android device.
