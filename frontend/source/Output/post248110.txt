Installing KEXTs properly in 10.11 <body> I just want to verify the following holds true for installing kexts in 10.11 via the shell and that there are no other steps missing:  precodesudo cp -R some.kext (/System)/Library/Extensions/    # Add or remove /System based on location of kext on this and next ones sudo chown -R root:wheel (/System)/Library/Extensions # maybe add: `sudo chmod -R 755 (/System)/Library/Extensions/` sudo touch (/System)/Library/Extensions /code/pre  As I understand it, it may be useful to also do the following as far as the kext caches go in current OS releases:  precode# For /System; not sure of location for /Library centric kexts: sudo rm -R /System/Library/Caches/com.apple.kext.caches sudo kextcache -u / # or /Volumes/"Whatever volume name" /code/pre  Fix disk permissions  precodesudo /usr/libexec/repair_packages --repair --standard-pkgs --volume / # Fix Homebrew folder if you use it: sudo chown -R "$USER":admin /usr/local /code/pre  Reboot:  precodesudo reboot /code/pre  *NOTE: the process seems to have changed over the last couple years from this (especially with regards to the kext caches) and I would like to receive verification.  <comment306263> You may need to disable SIP (partially, at least). See http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/208478/how-do-i-disable-system-integrity-protection-sip-aka-rootless-on-os-x-10-11 <comment306272> Yeah, I very much dislike SIP anyway.  As an advanced *nix user, it is more of a curse than anything.
