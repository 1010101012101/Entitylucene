How to export Google API keys automatically on every login for Chromium in Sierra? <body> I have tried writing launchd.conf, but it is not working.  I have edited Info.plist, but no luck! Writing launchctl &lt; /etc/launchd.conf in .profile not working either!  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/C5D0w.png" alt="enter image description here"  How can we do this without exposing keys in .profile?
