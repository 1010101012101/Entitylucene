imagemagick's convert jpeg to pdf rotates even pages 180° <body> When I use imagemagick's convert jpeg to pdf tool:  precodeconvert *.jpeg output.pdf /code/pre  an output PDF emis/em created, but what I've noticed is that the even pages get rotated by 180°.  What's even stranger is that if I open the even pages with Preview, rotate them 90° right and then rotate them 90° left, and then save it and run the codeconvert/code command again, the page emdoesn't/em get rotated 180°.  Is there anything I'm doing wrong over here?  <answer283447> It seems like the scanner I used to scan the documents I was trying to make PDFs of was saving the images with an orientation property. These were the two properties:  strongOrientation: 1 (Normal)/strong  strongOrientation: 3 (Rotated 180°)/strong  So, although it emlooked/em as though the images were upright, every second image would technically be flipped 180°, which is the property that imagemagick would use.   Removing this property from multiple images should be possible on macOS using a tool like ExifTool.
