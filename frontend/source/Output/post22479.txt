How do I delete a locked, invisible file in the Trash? <body> On an external disk (that contains a clone), the /.Trashes/501/Users/myusername/Desktop folder contains (within some subfolders) a locked invisible file that I cannot delete. The whole folder starting with 'Users' is visible in the Trash in my Dock.  I have tried:  ol lisecure empty trash (it asks whether I want to delete locked files and I say yes)/li liempty trash via Cocktail/li lilaunched Terminal as root and went down to the file (admin user alone cannot cd into ./Trashes)/li lifiles has these properties: -rw-------@ 1 myusername  myusername  4635 Mar  3  2010 int10923.ris/li lirm asks me whether I want to override override rw-------  myusername/myusername sappnd,arch,schg,hidden for int10923.ris? /li liI say yes, and it answers: Operation not permitted/li lia get info on the file (in the Dock trash, first enabling viewing of invisible files for the Finder) shows it as locked but unchecking the box, it immediately re-checks itself, it permissions are myusername Read &amp; Write, everyone No Access, trying to change that immediately reverts back to its previous state/li litrying chflags nouchg or chflags dump on the file changes nothing (with Terminal running as root) /li /ol  <answer22483> ol liThe file could simply still be open by something. Use codelsof &lt;file&gt;/code to see which process is hogging it, if any./li liOtherwise codesudo rm -rf /.Trashes/501/Users/myusername/Desktop/code should get rid of it/li liIf that didn't work, try removing all the flags it's complaining about first: codechflags nohidden,nosappdn,noarch,noschg &lt;file&gt;/code/li /ol  <answer22485> In order to modify a file that has the codeschg/code and/or codesappnd/code bits set, you must be started up in Single-User mode.  See codeman chflags/code for more information:     As discussed in codechflags(2)/code, the codesappnd/code and codeschg/code flags may only be   unset when the system is in single-user mode.   <answer22505> I am basically using the FEmp2, you can take a quick look at http://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/38723/femp  <comment24982> Did you try sudo rm [filename]? <comment24991> Thanks, 3. did it, I should have googled these flags a bit more, unfortunately, man chflags has no mentions of nohidden,nosappnd,noarch, and noschg. <comment24992> I had to launch the whole Terminal.app as root which brings sudo powers (and that did not solve it), removing the flags manually was what was needed. <comment25010> Well...it was worth a shot. <comment25016> `no***` flags are just the negation of the `***` flags, which are documented on the manpage. <comment25092> Problem was I was just scanning the man page for commands and not reading much of the prose around it. As I came with the advice of chflags nouchg to the man page, I just focussed on that list starting with 'nouchg' without reading the paragraph on top of it. <comment25093> As I said above, launching Terminal as root and running chflags nosappnd did work.
