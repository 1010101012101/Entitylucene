iCloud thinking iCloud site/iCloud Manager is modifying documents <body> I'm having a problem whereby when my (Windows) laptop is logged into iCloud, either via the web site or via the iCloud manager software, Pages on my iPad constantly pops up a spurious "synch" dialog for the document I am editing, as though my laptop has simultaneously modified the document.  Has anyone else experienced this and do you have a solution?  I hadn't noticed this problem prior to the iOS 5.1 update.
