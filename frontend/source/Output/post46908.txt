Customize Lock Screen <body> When I lock my screen, sometimes it shows my iTunes library, other times it shows a screensaver, and other times it shows photos.   I don't want it to do any of these things, I'd like it to just show a black background or maybe a picture.  Is there a way to customize it?  <answer46909> One option is to use the Lock Screen 2 app for macs to customize your lock screen. It costs only $1.99 (on sale now, regular $4.99) and you can make it look and behave identical to your iPhone/iPod-Touch/iPad lock screens. Here is a more detailed review of the app.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LNh4v.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer46910> This is a system preference, and you change it in the Desktop &amp; Screensaver pane of... strongSystem Preferences/strong.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/TPFZ4.png" alt="enter image description here" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/VO1sg.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment53698> I didn't know it was a screensaver.  I'm used to Windows, where the Lock Screen and screensaver are two different things. <comment53706> @bassplayer Album art won't show up if you pick a screensaver other than the “iTunes Artwork” one. <comment53708> dude honestly, the simplest google search would have told you about this... <comment53754> Oops (gulp), for some reason I thought we were talking about the iPhone. Sorry about that.
