Where is `defaults -currentHost write domain key value` written to? <body> When I use codedefaults write domain key value/code the information is written to code~/Library/Preferences/domain.plist/code.   When I use the code-currentHost/code flag, it has a higher priority then when I just use codedefaults/code without a specified host.   But where is the value actually written to? It is consistent between system startups, so it must be somewhere on the disk...  <answer247924> If you use code-currentHost/code with codedefaults/code it acts on code.plist/code files in:  precode$HOME/Library/Preferences/ByHost/ /code/pre  As an example, I did not have a codecom.apple.finder/code emplist/em file at that location and when I executed the following command, one was created at that location.  precodedefaults -currentHost write com.apple.finder GoToField "/foobar" /code/pre  hr  precode$ defaults -currentHost read com.apple.finder GoToField /foobar $ /code/pre  hr  Note the full file name contains a UUID however you do not need to include it when code-currentHost/code is used, the normal naming is all that's needed as shown in the command line above.  Example: code$HOME/Library/Preferences/ByHost/com.apple.finder.6966D045-28DC-544A-97C2-98CDB668DC8B.plist/code
