What would cause a CLI utility to ignore arguments except when invoked directly? <body> Okay, so this just happened:  precodeiMac:bin nreilingh$ tree --version . |____tree iMac:bin nreilingh$ which tree /usr/local/bin/tree iMac:bin nreilingh$ ls -l /usr/local/bin/tree lrwxr-xr-x  1 nreilingh  admin  29 Oct 14 22:02 /usr/local/bin/tree -&gt; ../Cellar/tree/1.7.0/bin/tree iMac:bin nreilingh$ pwd /usr/local/Cellar/tree/1.7.0/bin iMac:bin nreilingh$ ./tree --version tree v1.7.0 (c) 1996 - 2014 by Steve Baker, Thomas Moore, Francesc Rocher, Florian Sesser, Kyosuke Tokoro  /code/pre  I installed tree via homebrew, and whenever I invoke it, it ignores command line arguments. When I execute the binary directly, it doesn't. How is this possible?  <answer210973> Maybe codetree/code is defined as a function or alias in your code.bashrc/code or code.profile/code file?  Check output of code\tree --version/code  <comment254718> Or try `command tree --version` <comment255645> holy crap, you're right. I had a one-liner function for tree in my `.profile`
