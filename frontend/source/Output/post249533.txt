XCode: code signing entitlement file in command line <body> I would like to be able to build an IPA file with a given Entilements.plist file using command line. I can do pretty much anything, but I do not find a way to pass a code signing entitlements file using the command line (whereas I can do it in Xcode 7.3 UI). Any idea how to do that ?  <answer250957> I managed to have it working by calling:  precodexcodebuild ... CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY="" CODE_SIGNING_REQUIRED=NO" /code/pre  and then:  precodecodesign --entitlements .../Entitlements.plist -s signing_identity /code/pre
