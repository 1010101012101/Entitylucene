What's the best way to use IRC on the mac? <body> Question in the title basically. Not sure what else I can say!  <answer13847> The most popular IRC client on the Mac platform is undoubtedly Colloquy (free).  It has a sleek interface and is extremely configurable.  You can find others here: http://osx.iusethis.com/tag/irc  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5IZPK.png" alt="Colloquy"  <answer35316> Colloquy is nice, but I think X-Chat has always been much, much better. http://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/11070/x-chat-azure  <comment14758> ‘Best’ according to which criteria? Do you have a list of features that you consider essential or desirable? <comment14761> The included styles aren't great. I recommend a [a nicer looking one](http://john.albin.net/software/introducing-succinct-for-colloquy). <comment14764> I think I actually stopped using IRC purely because Colloquy looking so bad. Now I have that theme and I have got rid of some of the useless buttons (seriously, I dont need to change encoding that much) it is a joy to use.
