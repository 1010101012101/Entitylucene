iPod touch 3rd generation takes a very long time to send iMessages <body> My iPod touch 3rd generation takes a very long time to send iMessages. I recently sent a iMessage to my friend, it took about three hours to send. What's going on and how can I fix it? I did try turning my iPod off and back on again.  <comment173779> It's probably an issue with your internet connectivity. <comment173782> texts normally mean SMS messages - do you really mean that as a iPod touch does not connect to phone networks and so can't and SMS <comment173790> What version of iOS are you running?
