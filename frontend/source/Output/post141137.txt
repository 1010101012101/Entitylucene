iPhone Sensor Data <body> Can iPhone sensor usage data (Accelerometer, Gyro, GPS, etc,) be exported to a computer for further analysis?   <answer141503> There are probably a few different iOS apps that will do what you are looking for.  An example is Sensor Data from Warefront Labs.  ul ligathers data from the accelerometer, the gyro (on supported models) and the GPS./li lican export to CSV/li lican stream over UDP to another computer for realtime capture/li /ul  <answer159006> There is a lot of Apps can do this, I have tried sensorLoc, which can save sensor data into csv files, and send to computer through email or UDP. It is free.  <comment166363> Could you expand a little on your question? Are you hoping to find an app that does this? Are you wanting to develop an app to do this yourself? <comment166551> No I want to transfer directly from my iPhone to PC. I would be using that data for analysis. I would prefer if the data is stored as .csv file. <comment166556> I don't think there is a way to do this using just the phone on its own. I think you'd need an app to gather the data and send it somewhere. <comment166557> Oh, so you know any app which can me to do this.
