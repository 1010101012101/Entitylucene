“Untitled” item on my MacBook Pro desktop <body> I just installed macOS El Capitan, and now I see there is an codeUntitled/code item on the Desktop:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mDyOd.jpg" alt="Untitled"  This item contains the following directories:   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kwYfY.png" alt="Contents"  I’ve never seen anything like this on the codeDesktop/code before. When I look through the Finder, I don’t see this item.  What's the issue here?  <answer294378> This is just your system hard drive. You didn’t provide a name when you formatted it, and so macOS gave it a default name of codeUntitled/code.  You can rename it by right-clicking it in the strongFinder/strong sidebar under the heading emDevices/em, or by opening strongDisk Utility/strong and right-clicking it there. Then simply choose codeRename/code.  You can also hide hard drives from your desktop by going into the menu bar strongFinder/strong → strongPreferences/strong → strongGeneral/strong and emunchecking/em codeHard disks/code under the heading emShow these items on the desktop/em.  <comment371567> Okay, gone, thanks a lot. Just before you go - is it something normal? <comment371568> Yes, that is just standard macOS behavior on fresh installs. <comment371694> Yes it is normal and yes it is your internal disk. (just to pile on and strenghten the position)
