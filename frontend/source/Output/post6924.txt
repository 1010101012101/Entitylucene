Why has Snow Leopard screwed up my Safari and my desktop's ability to stay organized <body> Ever since I installed snow leopard I get multiple safari crashes per day. And my desktop refuses to stay organized (by date modified)?  <answer6928> Sounds like you did an upgrade, perhaps with the help Migration Assistant?  Best way to deal with it?  Back up your data, and either i) create a new account, pulling your data back in, but with a fresh library and settings or, better yet, ii) reformat, re-install OS and create your account again, from scratch.  Pull the data in manually.  Upgrading, and/or migration assistant, often doesn't go well when automated.  Just the nature of the beast. If you're not entirely comfortable doing this, get a pro to do it.  Trust me.  <comment7296> More info? What's the machine? How old? What kind of software is installed? Additional info would be helpful. <comment7299> What version of Safari? Be sure to run Software Update from the Apple menu to make sure that everything's updated. My Safari crash issues were fixed in an update. <comment7321> OK it does go wrong sometimes but I suspect rarely not often <comment7343> @Mark.. this is based on my experience as an Apple-certified technician.  :-)  I am an ACTC, I do Mac consulting for a living.  Your experience with migrations may be completely different... my experience has been that if you don't do it manually, problems are almost inevitable.
