How do I take a screenshot of the keyboard viewer with modifiers (e.g. Alt Gr, Shift)? <body> I am used to working on a US/CA English keyboard, but I'm currently based overseas and the keyboard that my workplace got for me has a completely different layout (ISO European). It's especially difficult for me to remember where the symbols are that are being modified by the codeAlt Gr/code and codeShift/code keys, so I thought I'd make a screenshot of the OS X keyboard viewer. I know that I can take a picture of an application window with the codeApple + Shift + 4 + Space Bar/code shortcut, but I can't seem to get the modifier key to "stick" so that I can take a screenshot of the keyboard layout with the modifier. How do I do this?   <answer247533> You should be able to use Applications/Utilities/Grab.app for this kind of thing, it offers more kinds of capture including timed.  <comment305452> Maybe a Timed Screen Capture with Grab? <comment305464> Worked perfectly. I was able to capture the window with the modifer key pressed, without having to used timed capture. Thank you! <comment333870> Thank you, this helped me too. Whenever I pressed the command key, the keyboard viewer would revert to qwerty layout, so I couldn't capture the actual layout using Cmd+Shift+3, 4, or whatever. Using Grab instead solved  the problem.
