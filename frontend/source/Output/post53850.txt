Does my MacBook DisplayPort support video input? <body> I have been reading through all these resources here and here, but I couldn't find an answer.  My question is simply: can the DisplayPort on a MacBook take a video input source?  More Details:  I have:  ol liMacbook Pro Model 6,2 (Mid-2010) that has a DisplayPort output/li liA camcorder that has HDMI output and NO FireWire outputs. /li liA HDMI to DisplayPort adapter./li /ol  I want to know if its possible to use my camcorder like a webcam, i.e, to capture live video for the purpose of streaming. As a primary test, I should be able to connect the camcorder and do a capture using iMovie.   Would this be possible? I am pretty sure input through USB won't work. And from what I have seen there is no easy way to convert the HDMI video stream into FireWire. So, any suggestions?  <answer53851> No, it does not, I fear: the DisplayPort is an output only.  <answer85392> So if the DisplayPort does not support input, how then does the built-in iSight camera on the external monitor work so well through the DisplayPort connection?  <comment61821> This is true, mini display port does not support video in. <comment98410> If you are not answering the question you should consider posting your own question or write a comment.
