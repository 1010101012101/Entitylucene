Where do I get a product key and ISO for Windows 8 Boot Camp? <body> (Please note that this is a hypothetical question as I do not yet own the computer mentioned in this post, but will be getting it next year for school)  Next year, I am going to buy a MacBook Pro Retina for school. The IST course I will be taking requires Windows for Android development. Where would I download the ISO for installing Windows 8, and where would I buy a product key? I'd like the Pro version too because I want to use remote desktop from my iPad when necessary (I already know how to do this)  <answer112087> Microsoft has a Student store that sells Windows 8, downloadable, with key for $69. Presumably from your post, you would qualify for academic pricing.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QEvrz.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment131703> note that is is an upgrade and this will not work for the OP- the OP needs a non upgrade version witch I think is System Builder which MS hides <comment132088> But you can do a clean install from the upgrade disk. http://lifehacker.com/5984278/
