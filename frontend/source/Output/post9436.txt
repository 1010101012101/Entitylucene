Showing the taskbar in Parallels Coherence mode <body> I just installed Parallels 6 and upon launching it for the first time, it started up in coherence mode and I saw the taskbar overlayed the Mac OS X UI. After a few seconds, though, it disappeared. I tried enabling the relevant settings I found related to this, but I was never able to get the taskbar to appear again.  How can I show the taskbar in Parallel's Coherence mode?  <answer9679> ol liSwitch to Coherence view./li liHold kbdoption/kbd and click the Parallels button in the Mac OS X system tray./li liNavigate to View  Show Windows Taskbar./li /ol
