How to install g++ or c++ without paying for xcode? <body> I need to install node.js on my new Mac and it requires having c++ or g++ compiler installed. How do I get one without paying for xcode?  <answer13753> You could get gcc for MacOSX from Apples Open Source site: http://opensource.apple.com/release/developer-tools-40/ It doesn't come with any instructions though.  (I think gcc is suitable, please feel free to correct me if I'm wrong).  <answer13755> You can still download Xcode 3.x for free with a free developer account. Xcode 3 comes with the GCC 4.2, LLVM-GCC 1.5 and LLVM 1.5 so everything you need to compile C++, C and ObjC code.  (Remark: LLVM 1.5 can't compile C++ code, so you have to switch back to LLVM-GCC or GCC for this.)  <answer13767> The Mac comes with software DVDs--one of those has Xcode. You can install it from there.  <answer21487> Just to be complete - Xcode 4.1.1 is free on the App Store but it requires Lion which implies a recent hardware purchase or paying for the upgrade.  <answer37644> h2OSX GCC Installer/h2     Downloading and installing the massive Xcode installer is a huge hassle if you just want GCC and related tools.      The osx-gcc-installer allows you to install the essential compilers from either pre-built binary packages or helps you create your own installer.   First mentioned here by Dancek  <answer54145> XCode does NOT come with the latest GCC and G++ (it comes with 4.2), so you still need to do your own install if you want the latest features. Macports and GNU do NOT provide sufficient instructions. So, it remains a mystery.   You can download XCode or find it on your install CD. That will give you you the older GCC/G++. Once you have that, you can download the latest GCC.  US, Tampa: http://mirrors-us.seosue.com/gcc/  BUT, how do you install??  All I know is..  ol liUnzip the folder. It should be named    gcc-4.6.3  OR  gcc-4.7.3   etc./li liCreate a new folder ADJACENT to the gcc-4.6.3 folder, called     buidgcc (the   buildgcc   folder and   gcc-4.6.3   folder  live in the same place. Possibly in the folder     Developer/usr    )/li liOpen a terminal (Applications-Utilities-Terminal)/li liNavigate to the   buildgcc     folder that you created strongTerminal Commmands/strong cd ..      brings you UP 1 level(note space between  cd  and  ..  ) ls         tells you what files &amp; folders are in the folder you're in cd/foldername         lets you navigate into a folder/li liIf you're in the    buildgcc    folder, type:  ../gcc-4.6.3/configure WAIT.   Then type:   make WAIT a very long time. /li /ol  Sorry. Here is where I'm stuck.  <comment14607> Xcode is a free download for all members of the iOS and Mac Developer Programs. <comment14612> It's only XCode 4 that you need to pay for - if you're not a paying developer. XCode 3.2.6 can be downloaded for free. <comment14615> XCode 4 is less than the price of a latté. <comment14618> And what exactly is supposed to build GCC without GCC? <comment14628> @Ian C. - Stop shopping at Starbucks, then. <comment14664> @Ian C. in the mist of *off-topicness*, I'd like to point out (as someone who speaks a semi-decent italian) that the coffee you're referring to, is spelled *caffè latte*, and is also sometimes incorrectly spelled latté or lattè. ;) Regarding the price of Xcode, although I agree with the *-should not affect you-* cheap price of Xcode, the OP asked for a free way to get C++ compiler, which, cheap or not, is a valid question. I still think that Xcode and dev tools are a hell of a package for under 5 dollars. But to each his own. <comment14666> This is pretty much the fastest way to get Xcode installed, albeit at the cost of getting a -possibly- outdated version. Since Apple curiously doesn't offer "upgrades", your (also free, as correctly pointed out in JustSid's answer) Xcode 3.x download will be a full 4GB++ package. <comment14667> @JustSid unicorns, clearly. <comment14675> @ Martín Marconcini: Ohh, I see. I always wondered why they shipped my iMac with a unicorn, now it makes perfectly sense. <comment14686> Oops, I didn't realise that they don't also provide the binaries for it onthere. <comment14688> @Martin: http://theoatmeal.com/blog/apps :) <comment14738> For the unknown reason I can see only "Bundled Software" disk in the package and it didn't seem to contain xcode when I've tried to install.. So I've gone with the download solution. Anyways, thanks! <comment18378> This is the best way to bootstrap the latest GCC from open source if you can't or won't get a free Xcode 3 download by enrolling as a free Apple developer. <comment80420> Note that that Xcode has become free again see the Mac App Store - most of these answers are now out of date <comment80421> Macports does supply instructions on how to install - I have done it often <comment91900> Note that only Xcode 4.1 (I think) on Lion had to be paid for all other versions are free wether from App Store or Developer downloads
