How do I paste an url from an image? <body> I want to post an image on a website, but it requires the image's url, which I don't know how to. By the way, I'm on an iPad... could anyone help?  <answer223548> Just use an app like "Imgur"   https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/imgur-awesome-images-gifs/id639881495?mt=8  Use Upload feature to create and share your own pictures as url.  <comment270922> Is the image on your iPad or an online image? <comment270923> it is from photos <comment270924> It doesn't have a URL in this case because it's in your local device. You have two options, Either there is an option on the website that enables you to upload a picture instead of using URL, or if there isn't you can upload the image to a storage service like DropBox or GoogleDrive. You can then have a URL for your image.
