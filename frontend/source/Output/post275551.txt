Downloading iOS music from iTunes onto iPad without being erased <body> My dad bought me ed Sheeran new album on his iTunes so now we want to get it on my iPad. I have my own Apple ID account but I haven't bought any music.   How can I download the album my Dad bought to my iPad without deleting anything on it?  <answer275554> I think you can download it on your computer, then sync with iTunes your music by activating codeManually manage music and videos/code on your device's options.  That will allow you to just drag and drop music to your device without deleting anything on it.

I haven't tried this so I don't know if you can purchase music and then give the song to someone else who uses a different Apple ID. <comment346726> So doing this won't erase any data on my iPad even though it's a different device and iTunes apples id?
