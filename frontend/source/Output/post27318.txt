Simplest way to prevent iTunes from automatically launching when iPhone/iPad is connected <body> When I connect my iPad or iPhone to my Mac iTunes automatically launches. What is the simplest way to prevent this from happening?  <answer27320> ul liConnect the iPhone/iPad/iPod device to the computer/li liInside iTunes, click on the device and then click on the ‘Summary’ tab/li liScroll to the bottom of the Summary tab selections until you see “Options”/li liClick on the checkbox next to ‘Open iTunes when this iPhone is connected’ – wording will be slightly different if your device is an iPad or iPod or whatever/li liClose iTunes/li /ul  <answer27322> The simplest way is to un-tick the codeAutomatically sync this.../code box* on the Summary Screen for the device in iTunes when the device is connected:  img src="https://i.imgur.com/CliPy6P.png" alt="Open iTunes Tick Box"  ul liThis is per device./li /ul  Alternatively you can just remove the iTunesHelper service under your Login Items which will disable it irrelevant of the tick box state.  <answer144299> If you are using Apple's iTunes on Windows 8 or Windows 10, you can disable iTunesHelper by executing the following instructions:  ol liRight click the task bar/li liSelect the Task Manager  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NIHTh.png" alt="enter image description here"/li liClick the Startup tab/li liClick the iTunesHelper app/li liClick the Disable button/li liClose the Task Manager  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HJROq.png" alt="enter image description here"/li /ol  You can also right-click the iTunesHelper app and select Disable from the context menu.  <answer149194> From the iTunes menu at the top go to strongiTunesPreferencesDevicesPrevent iPods, iPhones and iPads from syncing automatically/strong. Check the box at the bottom of that window. Click OK, quit iTunes.  That will stop iTunes from launching when you connect the phone stop automatic syncing.  <answer226344> Unfortunately, the option mentioned in the other answers is no longer present on iTunes. Instead, the OSX solution is now similar to the Windows one:  ol liOpen strongSystem Preferences/strong/li liSelect strongUsers &amp; Groups/strong/li liSelect your user profile if not selected already/li liGo into the strongLogin items/strong tab/li liSelect and remove strongiTunes Helper/strong from the list/li liLog out and back in, or restart OSX/li /ol  <answer240244> For all those who strongnever/strong use iTunes and do not have that 'Summary' panel (not sure why this happens, perhaps iTunes version too old)  I just disabled execution for iTunes altogether.  So, open terminal and codesudo chmod -x /Applications/iTunes.app//code - never see iTunes again.  <answer271239> If you NEVER use iTunes and simply want to charge your devices without seeing the annoying pop-up every time, you can simply strongrename the iTunes app/strong.  h3Solution for Mac:/h3  ol liMake sure your iTunes app is off./li liOpen Terminal and enter:     codecd /Applications/iTunes.app/Contents/MacOS &amp;&amp; sudo mv iTunes iTunes_off/code /li liEnter your admin password and you should be all set./li /ol  h3UNDO/h3  If you need to UNDO this later, all you need to do is strongrename it back/strong, i.e.:     codecd /Applications/iTunes.app/Contents/MacOS &amp;&amp; sudo mv iTunes_off iTunes/code   P.S. This is a similar to @YemSalat solution from Jun 1 '16 (+1), except for this one is a bit more obvious if you come back 6 months later.  P.P.S. If you update iTunes it may restore the original functionality.  <answer278602> Here is one additional hint to prevent any system app from launch on iPhone/iPad/Camera connection:  ol liLaunch app "Image Capture" by typing its name in Spotlight by codeCtrl+Space/code/li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/UGww4.png" alt="Image Capture app screenshot"  ol start="2" liIn bottom left corner use combo box to select "No application"/li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/BvGn1.png" alt="Combo box screenshot"  <comment31382> +1 and accept for the Login Items bit. <comment159784> This option seems to have changed in iTunes 11.2. There's now "Automatically sync when this iPad is connected" (or 'iPhone'). Disabling that option prevents auto-sync even when iTunes is manually opened, so the login item removal seems the most appropriate if you wish to retain that functionality. <comment211381> This plus the other answers seem to end the problem if you're in 2015.
