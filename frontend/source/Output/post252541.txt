How do I escape the git commit window from OS X terminal? <body> I am just learning git and the terminal and I wanted to make a test commit but I cannot seem to be able to escape the text editor window to save the commitimg src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hXLZK.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer252553> It looks like you're inside the codevi/code editor. Typing code:wq/code and pressing enter should do it, i.e. save the commit message and exit.   code:/code enters the command mode, codew/code is for "write" (save) and codeq/code is for "quit".  You may need to hit escape before code:wq/code to exit the insert mode (codevi/code is a mode based editor).   If you want to exit without saving hit escape, code:q!/code and enter.   git opens your default editor so you can edit the commit message. You can change the default editor, even to graphical text editors (such as Sublime Text). See here for example.
