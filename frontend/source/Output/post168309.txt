Configure Skype proxy setting? <body> I would like to use Skype's proxy setting on Mac. However, when I click "Change",  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Zkyup.png" alt="enter image description here"  it just takes me to strongSystemPreferences - Wifi - Advanced - Proxies/strong.  What am I supposed to do to set up a proxy for Skype? I wish to do this because others can resolve and attack me with booters very easily thanks to Skype.  strongI would like a method that does not require an additional application. Please do not post links to apps which attempt to route the connections on a per-app basis. It should be possible to do this without one./strong  Preferably, I would like a proxy "just for Skype". Not for the entire OS to use.   How can I configure a proxy to be used by just Skype?  <answer169042> You can set up a Proxy in OS X of your choosing and let Skype use it.  Skype works with HTTPS and SOCKS types of Proxy.  Alternatively without setting up a Proxy and in order to protect your privacy in Skype you can simply use the Skype feature to Hide your IP.  Open Skype- Preferences - Advanced.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9UXhb.jpg" alt="Skype"  <answer169322> You cannot set a proxy "just for Skype". The Skype developers have not programmed that option and therefore it does not exist.  Mac OS X and for example Windows only allow you to set a system-wide proxy.  Unless the developer of an application allows you to set an application-specific proxy, you cannot set a proxy without a third party application.  <comment197536> try http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/54557/is-it-possible-to-have-per-app-network-vpn-proxy-settings or http://superuser.com/questions/410142/how-to-route-traffic-through-a-specific-socks-proxy-on-a-per-app-basis <comment197537> already saw that, those are all really ugly applications and i'd prefer to do this the hard way lol <comment197538> Always helps if you mention what you already looked at. Saves a whole lot of wasted google time <comment197539> Apologies :) i will edit the question <comment198501> I would like a proxy "just for skype". Not for the entire OS to use. How can I configure the proxy to just be used by skype? <comment198612> AFIK that can not be done, other than setting the whole system to that connection (proxy). As soon you set up a proxy you can tell Skype to use it. <comment369990> And as usual, the Windows version of Skype has all it needs to use a sp√©cific proxy, but the mac version does not. Why did Microsoft **NOT** implement that "basic" functionality in the mac version?
