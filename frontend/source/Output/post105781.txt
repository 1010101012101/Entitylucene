iPhone 3GS Bricked after restore <body> I was given an iPhone 3GS that my friend bricked. He pulled the plug during the middle of the restore. Whenever I tried to restore it again, i get error 3194. I have tried using SHSH blobs for both 6.1.3 and 4.1. I have stitched them and tried using TinyUmbrella's TSS server. redsn0w's just boot feature doesn't work, neither does iBooty's. I have tried quite a few things. Any other ideas on how to make it work?  <comment124366> The obvious would be to connect it to iTunes and let a clean, factory restore give it a go. Perhaps is that something you're avoiding? <comment124382> I just want to double check... You did try DFU mode, right? You don't explicitly say that above. <comment124400> Yes I have tried DFU mode... And just doin a plain old restore results in error 3194... Maybe I should also mention the apple store could not fix it <comment124411> I have also tried using Sn0wbreeze's baseband preservation mode with iOS 4.1... that didn't work either. <comment131091> Anybody have any ideas? <comment132667> Did you figure this out? 3GS won't take IOS7 and I was wondering if it was rejecting because of that. I ask because I want to reformat mine for my niece but Im not sure whether it will take. <comment132775> I was not trying to put iOS 7 on it-6.1.3 because that's what apple was signing at the time
