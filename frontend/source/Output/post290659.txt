Can't change file permissions with "Panic Transmit" FTP client <body> I'm trying to change permissions for files and folders using the "Transmit" FTP client (from "Panic") and the "Apply" button is disabled so I can't save the new permission settings.  This is a screen shot:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3UQEC.png" alt="the inspector screenshot"  BTW - This is a new problem, the older version I had works great and it seams to be only with folders/files created by Transmit. Support is very slow, so I'm trying my luck here...  <comment366936> If this is a local folder can you change the permissions directly through Finder? If it is a remote one, can you change it using the ftp client in Terminal? Did you try to logout/login again in Transmit? <comment367130> It's a remote one. can using terminal. logout/in didn't help. it seams to be only with folders/files created by Transmit. <comment367136> https://www.panic.com/transmit/support.html <comment367168> maybe you can read the question before you comment...
