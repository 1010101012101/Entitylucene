Not able to log into the LINE VOIP service using a MacBook Air via wifi at home <body> I have a MacBook Air with Corei5 and it is connected to web through a netgear wifi router at home.  I am able to connect to the web without any problems but I am just not able to log into LINE using home wifi.  I have tested at the Apple Store and was able to log in, just not able to do so at home.  Connecting to LINE using a window-based laptop through home wifi has no issues.  I have tried to reboot, re-connect to wifi but nothing seems to help.    <comment96136> Has anyone found a solution to this question?
