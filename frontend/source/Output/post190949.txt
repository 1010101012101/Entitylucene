Send/receive SMS (text messages) and place/receive calls from an iPad <body> I'm looking for a solution to receive/place calls and SMS over the cellular network.  For now, my best solution would be Skype, but i can't receive SMS with it. Is there an equivalent ?   Thanks.   Edit: it might be important : I'm in France, not in the US.  <answer190962> Google Hangouts would do it. You'd have to get a Google account, and a Google Voice number, and then you can send/receive calls and texts with it.  If you had an iPhone i think you could also use the iPad to place/receive calls using the iPhone cell connection.  I don't think this is what you mean though  <answer191323> There are many free and paid services out there that let you send and/or receive SMS messages via your web browser; some of them such as Skebby also have mobile apps available. You'd certainly have to do your research to find out which ones were reputable, though (and I make no such claim either way for Skebby, which I've never used... was just one of the first ones I found.)  <comment226780> It seems like Google Voice is only available in the US (or at least the Google Voice Number is), am I right ? <comment226850> I'm in the U.S. and I can not view it as outside of US people view it. <comment227630> @Rogue, you probably could use a proxy server to set it up... <comment227637> I did, to test it. I Got an US Phone number, it works but my french friends pay a lot more when they Call / text us Phone numbers <comment227790> @Rogue the cost we can't help :)  are most or all of your friends on smartphones? Does something like Line/WhatsApp/Viber/etc make sense? Google hangouts itself has messaging also <comment227799> I don't mind paying, but i do mind making my friends/family pay a lot ! Theses messaging app do make sense, but i'd need to have a regular phone number for pro contacts <comment227803> @Rogue i agree with all you said :) maybe split, free apps with family, but a number just in case for outside contacts  only you can say if that works
