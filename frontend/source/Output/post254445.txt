MacBook Pro does not switch to battery <body> I have a MacBook Pro (15-inch, Mid 2010, MacBookPro6,2) which does not switch to battery power when the power adaptor is removed. It simply goes off. However the battery is reported as 100% charged. I can only use the MacBook with the power adaptor plugged in.  When plugging in, the LED shows orange for a few seconds, then switches to green. When I remove the power adaptor for more than a few seconds, the clock resets to Jan, 1 on the next reboot.  The battery is two or three years old but it is not the original one. It is possible that it has degraded over time but even then I would expect it to deliver power for at least a few minutes, so I think the problem is something different. Also the battery worked as usual a few days before.  I tried a SMC reset (kbdshift/kbd-kbdctrl/kbd-kbdoption/kbd-kbdpower/kbd) which did not fix the problem. Is there a way to find out whether the SMC reset was in fact executed?  Anything else I can do?
