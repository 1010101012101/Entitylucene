Python Imaging Library (PIL) Decoder jpeg not available â€” how to fix? <body> I've got error which is generated by PIL when I trying to process jpg-images: codePython Imaging Library (PIL) Decoder jpeg not available/code.  How to fix this problem?  <answer59719> PIL is missing codelibjpeg/code library.  To install it:  ol liGo to http://www.ijg.org/files/jpegsrc.v8c.tar.gz/li liUnpack this package and codecd/code to the unpacked folder codecd ~/Downloads/jpeg-8c/code/li liCompile it:pre ./configure make /pre/li liThen install: codesudo make install/code/li /ol  But PIL still can't find library. Now you need to reinstall it:  ol liUninstall pil (if you instlled it with pip, just type codesudo pip uninstall pil/code)/li liDownload PIL, unpack it and move to source folder./li liNow open setup.py in your code editor/li liReplace codeJPEG_ROOT = None/code with codeJPEG_ROOT = libinclude("/usr/local")/code/li liEnjoy! Now it works!/li /ol  <answer59742> You could also install it from MacPorts. They have PIL for several versions of Python.  precodepy-pil @1.1.7 (python, graphics)     Python Imaging Library  py24-pil @1.1.7 (python, graphics)     Python Imaging Library  py25-pil @1.1.7 (python, graphics)     Python Imaging Library  py26-pil @1.1.7 (python, graphics)     Python Imaging Library  py27-pil @1.1.7 (python, graphics)     Python Imaging Library /code/pre  Check out the site for how to install MacPorts, then just type codesudo port install py-pil/code (or one of the other versions, such as codepy27-pil/code). Wait a while and you should have a working PIL, assuming you use the version of Python for which the PIL was installed.  <comment130673> works perfect.. +1 for wonderful answer
