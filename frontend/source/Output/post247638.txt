Connecting MacBook Air external display without using onboard display <body> My MacBook Air display crushed but rest is ok. The apple authority advised to change the display, but I would like to use external display option. Since the onboard display is gone, is there any way to connect up external display like plug and play sort of thing?  <comment305609> Have you tried? <comment305810> Yes, all monitors are plug and play, just plug an hdmi cable into the air and the monitor.
