What is the proper 3rd party cable type for fastest charging and data transfer with new MacBook Pro? <body> What is the proper name/number of the proper cable to get the fastest charging and data transfer for the new MacBook Pro?   Obviously it came with a wall charger and a cable but I am looking to purchase a 3rd party cable/adapter and I am finding it very confusing between all the USB-3, USB-C, USB 2.0 Type-C, Thunderbolt 3...  Which cable and wall charger is the right kind/type to get the fastest charging and data transfer? If you could recommend or link to some it would be appreciated.   <answer267979>    What is the proper name/number of the proper cable to get the fastest   charging and data transfer for the new MacBook Pro?   h3Charging/h3  Charging has more to do with the adapter than it does with the cable.  The new MacBook Pro uses an 87W/61W (15" and 13" MacBook Pro respectively) power adapter.  So, if you use a 60W power adapter it emwill/em charge, but slowly emregardless of the cable/em.  To get the maximum speed, you need a charger equal to or greater than the specified power adapter rating.  As of the time of this writing, there are no USB-C power adapter greater than 61W available.  Unfortunately, you have to use the Apple supplied power adapter until 3rd party adapters are released onto the market.  That said, the 87W power adapter will work just fine on the MacBook Pro 13" (61W).  Any USB-C cable will be able to handle up to 100W of power.  My recommendation is to get a good cable from a reputable manufacturer.  I have always had good results with Anker products  h3Data Transfers/h3  If you have a USB-C cable (it conforms to the USB 3.1 specification) it will handle transfer speeds of 10Gbs.  Period.  If it's a USB-C cable, that's the maximum you will get.  If you have a Thunderbolt device (storage) then you need to get a Thunderbolt 3 cable.  Belkin makes a high quality Thunderbolt 3 cable.  The data transfer rate is 40Gbs.  While it emuses/em a USB-C connector, and carries the USB signal, unlike a USB cable, it also carries the Thunderbolt signal thus the price difference.  strongImportant:  You will not get higher data transfer rates by plugging in a USB-C type Thunderbolt cable into a USB-C device.  You will get USB-C speeds of 10Gbs/strong  h3What cable do you get?/h3  The question is, emwhat are you connecting?/em  If you are connecting a USB device, then get the USB cable.  If you are connecting a Thunderbolt device, then get a Thunderbolt cable.  Regardless, both cables will charge at whatever rate your power adapter can deliver and will transfer data only as fast as your device will allow.  <comment336325> Thunderbolt 3 will offer fastest transfer (something like 40Gbps) <comment336327> Thanks. So that would be "Thunderbolt 3 to Thunderbolt 3," correct? And what is the next down the line? Isn't there one that does about 5Gbps? What is a USB 2.0 Type-C Male to Male? Or USB-C 3.0? I can't make sense of it all!!! <comment336332> @NoahL is correct ***if, and only if*** you are connecting to a Thunderbolt device.  If you are connecting to USB, your max throughput will be 10Gbs if USB 3.1 and 5Gbs if USB 3.0,  I've written a good primer on [USB-C/Thunderbolt](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/265917/using-a-usb-c-dock-with-older-macbook-pros/267009#267009) on this site for a different question.  Please review. <comment336335> According to Apple: The Apple 61W (for 13-inch models) or 87W (for 15-inch models) USB-C Power Adapter <comment336337> I was using the 15" model specs...but I also can't find a charger with greater than 60W with USB.  Leave it to Apple to come up with a requirement 1W above what's on the market. <comment336347> Sizzle, you're confusing terms. USB: USB-A is the classic connector and has a few different protocols including: 2.0,3.0,3.1. USB-C is the new version of USB. It uses THE SAME PORT as Thunderbolt 3. However, Thunderbolt is not the same as USB. USB-C has a transfer rate of 10 Gbps. Thunderbolt 3 has a 40Gbps transfer rate. Let me know if you have any questions. <comment336445> One wire says "USB-C 2.0 Type-C Male to Male"...is that referring simply to the data speeds? <comment340790> "Any USB-C cable will be able to handle up to 100W of power" is not a true statement. There are plenty of USB-C cables that are only rated for 3 amps. <comment340791> @WavyCrab - You are incorrect.  USB-C implements the USB 3.1 specification which calls for ***up to 20V, 5A and 100W for power and charging***.  If you have a *USB-C cable* (not a charging cable with USB-C connectors - big, big difference), you have a cable that conforms to USB 3.1 Specs which means - it *will* handle up to 100W. <comment340952> Interesting. I've seen several USB-C to USB-C cables that advertise as 3.1 speeds but only support 3 amps. Are these just non-complaint cable? Example https://www.amazon.com/Belkin-USB-IF-Certified-USB-C-Meters/dp/B00WJSPCSG ("This USB-C cable supports up to 60W/3A of power and can be used for charging and powering USB-C devices") <comment341031> @WavyCrab - 60W at 3A is 20V.  It's within spec.  If it's USB-IF certified - technically, it guaranteed to be certified within spec.
