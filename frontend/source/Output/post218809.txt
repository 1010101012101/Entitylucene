How do I use GCC on El Capitan? <body> I installed gcc via homebrew with no errors.  precodebrew install homebrew/versions/gcc49 brew unlink gcc49 &amp;&amp; brew link gcc49 /code/pre  But when I try to run gcc, clang is used instead.   precode~$:gcc --version Configured with: --prefix=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/usr --with-gxx-include-dir=/usr/include/c++/4.2.1 Apple LLVM version 7.0.0 (clang-700.1.76) Target: x86_64-apple-darwin15.0.0 Thread model: posix /code/pre  Edit:  precode~$:type gcc gcc is /usr/bin/gcc ~$:type /usr/bin/gcc /usr/bin/gcc is /usr/bin/gcc ~$:echo $PATH /usr/local/sbin:/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.5/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/Library/TeX/texbin /code/pre  <answer218817> Instead of invoking using codegcc/code you need to call codegcc-4.9/code. Alternately you could create an alias for codegcc/code to point to codegcc-4.9/code(although that is risky).  <comment264540> Would generally advice against the alias. It can cause no end of trouble if you're trying to use Xcode or something that expects and standard Apple dev environment with `clang` as the `gcc` complier and you've got an alias like that. <comment264541> Thanks @Ian, updated the answer as per your comments.
