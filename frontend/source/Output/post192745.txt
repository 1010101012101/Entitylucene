Yosemite Server and Client profiles with 802.1x authentication configuration <body> I am managing a small team of MAC users in our work environment and am trying to incorporate them into our strict network environment. We are using 802.1x user based network authentication on all our devices and this causes a lot of issues for the mac users when their password is forced to change.   At the moment the MAC machines are bound to the domain and the users log in using their network credentials, however 802.1x authentication doesn't apply automatically.  Somebody suggested to install the OSX Server app from the app store and use it to deploy profiles which should somehow allow this. But I cannot find any good help guides or documentation on setting this up.  We have a Yosemite OSX server installed on one device. All user devises are Yosemite OSX desktops and a couple of Yosemite Mac Books.  Does anybody have any good information resources that can be followed on setting this up?  I have configured the server with a basic directory instructions for which I found on the Yosemite Server walk-through videos on youtube but not sure what needs to be done next. Any help and suggestions are appreciated.  Thanks  <comment236577> How many Macs do you have to set up? Less than 10 - do it by hand, less than 50, server would seem a good start, less than 500 - check out bushel.com. What specifically do you need to happen "automatically" when you say "802.1x authentication doesn't apply automatically"
