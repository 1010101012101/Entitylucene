Password prompt before OS is boot <body> My Macbook previous OS is Mavericks,one day, i use find my iphone to lock my macbook and the Computer started to prompt me enter password(not the lock my mac Firmware password, i removed it right after the first Firmware password prompt) before the OS start to boot(It's like asking for password on BIOS if it were a PC).Then i upgraded to Yosemite and it's no longer ask me for password before system start booting up. The question is how i can get back the old password prompt, or is it just me confusing that the password is prompt before system start.  <answer162139> strongTo re-enable an EFI password:/strong  ol liBoot into Recovery holding kbdCommand/kbd+kbdR/kbd at the startup chime/li liFrom the menu bar, select strongUtilities  Firmware Password Utility/strong/li liEnter a Firmware password and quit the Utility pane. /li /ol  Note that you’ll only be prompted for this EFI password if you attempt to boot the machine strongdifferently than you would normally/strong.

Is Filevault enabled? <comment189485> The EFI i mention is firmware. The password is same as the login password i normally uses.Also the interface look the same to me, just like the one i would enter when i login after the computer goes to sleep.
