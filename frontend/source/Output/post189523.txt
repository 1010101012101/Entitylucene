How to prevent keychain passwords being seen with iPhone passcode? <body> Via codeSettings/Safari/Saved Passwords//code it is possible to view all saved passwords by simply entering the 4 digit passcode on ones iPhone.  Is it possible to still be able to use Keychain passwords and autofill, but prevent access by the 4 digit code (e.g. requiring the full Keychain/iCloud password), so that someone who knows your phone code is not able to access all of your internet passwords in plain text?  EDIT: it is possible to set a different 4 digit code as the "Keychain pin" via turning on codeSettings/iCloud/Keychain/Advanced/"Approve with Security Code"/code, but the phone 4 digit code is still used for accessing the saved Safari passwords as above... It would be great if there was a way to always require the "Keychain pin" instead.

So, if you have hardware with touch ID capability you could use that for your everyday login and reserve a more complex passcode (even the same as your iCloud one, like you mention) for protecting your keychain in case of theft, etc.  <answer197780> Simply use an alphanumeric passcode.  <comment224801> This is an excellent point.  I just submitted feedback to Apple, everyone else reading should as well... Several people know my 4 digit passcode for various reasons, that doesn't mean the need to be able to lookup my bank password, and read it in plain text. http://www.apple.com/feedback/ <comment225073> Another good reason to use something like 1password or equivalent. I don't save any passwords in the browser. <comment233341> @Tyson - [others ought to get an auto-notify] I'm not going to go right through this procedure myself, because I don't want yet another password/code to have to rememberâ€¦ but - `Settings/iCloud/Keychain/Advanced/"Approve with Security Code"` below that is 'Change Security Code' which starts by asking your Apple ID p/w.. I cancelled at that point, but someone might want to investigate further... <comment236298> iOS has had the alphanumeric passcode capability since iOS 4. iOS 9 introduced six-digit numeric passcodes.
