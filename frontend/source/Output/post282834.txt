How do I turn off auto capitalization in macOS El Capitan? <body> How do I turn strongoff/strong auto capitalization in macOS El Capitan? For certain things I do not want it and it's very annoying. For instance, dictating in a spreadsheet.  In numbers, I cannot select a bunch of fields and lowercase the letters.  <answer282871> System Preferences → Keyboard → Text and disable Capitalize words automatically.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DS40V.png" alt=""  <comment356879> ive seen that answer before, but that option does not exist on latest version of el capitan.
