iOS frame rate drop without maximum device utilization <body> I am making an iOS game using Unity. I am testing some shaders that I have made for the game, and in some cases the device will run at under 30 FPS but not have 100% device utilization.  Sometimes a test will start at a higher device utilization %, and then over time go lower, even though the test is simply rendering a plane with a material on it.  For example, a shader test I just ran on an iPad 4: Device utilization 85% Renderer utilization 85% Tiler utilization 1% Core Animation Frames Per Second 12  This test is using barely any CPU, and is only rendering 4 triangles (2 big planes covering the screen).  Does anyone have any ideas why this could be happening? Usually the renderer utilization goes up to 100%... pretty stumped, being a graphics rookie.  Thanks for the help!
