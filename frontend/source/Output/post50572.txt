Google Chrome confirm close <body> Many a time and oft I get confused between emclose tab/em (kbd⌘/kbd+kbdw/kbd) and emclose/em (kbd⌘/kbd+kbdq/kbd) in Google Chrome, closing dozens of tabs at once.  How do I specify a close prompt before closing multiple tabs on Chrome (version 18.0.1025.168)?   I have tried codechrome://flags//code, and the wrench menues but found no such option.  <answer50573> That is not currently possible but you could do cmd+shift+T a number of times, until you have all your taps restored.  <answer50575> Enabling "Warn Before Quitting" should prevent that from happening. You can find that option in the Chrome menu in the menubar.  When enabled, you need to hold down kbd⌘/kbd+kbdQ/kbd for a bit before it actually quits.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/J5PMC.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment57963> Where is this done? <comment57964> As I said, in the "Chrome" menu in the menubar. <comment57965> +1 Works. Sorry, too little coffee for this time of the day. Thanks! <comment57966> Screenshot for extra clarity :)
