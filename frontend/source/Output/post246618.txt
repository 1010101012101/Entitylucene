batch rename pdf files by content <body> I have a big pile of pdf's and I would like to batch rename them by content. (They are all searchable). And I'd like to do so using command line interface.  They are all payslips so they have a constant form, and I'd like to rename by date.  Currently they are named: payslip100 .. payslip308   The string for renaming would be the date component in  codePayment Date:   15/4/2016/code  I have installed pdfgrep using home-brew and am searching using codepdfgrep -HC 15 "Payment Date:" paySlip.pdf/code  which returns codepaySlip.pdf:Payment Date:   8/7/2016/code  hr  I have attached my final working code in a reply.  <answer246841> After some efforts I have come to a useful result !! sed syntax is quite confusing and I am quite happy to exist in a state where it works without knowing quite why.  precode#!/bin/bash for file in *.pdf do     # return file name and date in form "Payment Date:   8/7/2016"     date=$(pdfgrep -C 15 "Payment Date:" "$file")     echo $date      # now replace / with - to make naming file easier     date2=$(echo "$date" | sed 's,/,-,g')     echo $date2      # use date string to rename : YYYY-mm-payslip-dd-mm-YYYY.pdf     new=$(echo "$date2" | sed 's,\Payment Date:\ *\(.*\)-\(.*\)-\(.*\),\3-\2-\payslip-\1-\2-\3.pdf,')     echo mv "$file" "$new" done /code/pre  I used pdfgrep which was installed using homebrew (found on another answer I can't find right now).  I needed to change "/" for file name. Using the forward slash as sed syntax is not necessary, and can be replaced by other characters. Hence using "," instead of "/" https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17379293/replace-forward-slash-with-double-backslash-enclosed-in-double-quotes  I found there were variable spaces in $date which necessitated the code..Payment Date:\ *\.../code  I added year and month to start of file name for organising purposes.  <comment304182> How do you perform search on PDFs? <comment304183> I've just noticed that I can search the pdf's content using mdfind, which will give me the list of files containing a particular string.  `mdfind annual -onlyin ./`  But grep will not output any results from the same search.  `grep annual *.*` <comment304184> So please update your question with the command you run and its results for a number of files. Then we can add commands to rename the files. <comment304187> This is a long shot. What are the results of- `grep --binary-files=text 'Payment Date:'  file.pdf`? Where `file.pdf` is a single pdf file that you want to search. <comment304192> `grep --binary-files=text 'Payment Date:' file.pdf` does not help. I'm thinking of trying pdftotext which I can apparently install using home-brew. http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/155250/trying-to-convert-pdf-to-text-for-free/155356. <comment304253> Don't use `/` (unless you want to specify folders), use e.g. `_` or something similar instead. <comment304517> @patrix, are you referring to payment date format? the slashes are already used in the pdf <comment304543> Filenames are not allowed to contain forward slashes, because they are used to separate directories in a path name. Running `mv foo.txt bar/whatever.txt` will move the file to the directory `bar` (or fail it this directory doesn't exist), it will *not* rename the file to `bar/whatever.txt`.
