Hotkeys for switching directly to open app? <body> Instead of using cmd+tab to switch between open apps, is there a way to create hotkeys for selecting the running instance of emacs/firefox/whatever? (Preferably opening them if they aren't running.)  I do not mind using Karabiner. Answers using built-in OS X functions preferred to third party software which again are preferred to those using software that costs anything.  <comment186490> Have you searched this site for answers? <comment186491> Googled, but that would return AD answers if they existed. <comment186503> Use the search filed on this site for` app  hotkeys` there will be enough results to set you on the right path
