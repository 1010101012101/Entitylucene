Trackpad and USB mouse frozen <body> my girlfriend broke her trackpad of her MacBook white 2009 and now she's using a USB mouse. This does not work properly and gets often stuck. Do you think the sto issues are related? DO you have any suggestion on how to fix this?  <answer176247> There is every possibility the trackpad is still generating data, even if only randomly.  The only two alternatives I could think of would be    ul liGet it fixed, or /li liDisconnect it/li /ul  <comment208091> Thanks! I'll try to disconnect it as soon as I get an Y3 screwdriver. <comment208092> Wish you luck :)
