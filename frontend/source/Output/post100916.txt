FN key to program X keys <body> I have a problem. I have a MacBook Pro and a Xkeys 80. Xkeys basically records shortcut keys like a macro. But it is not sensing the push of the FN key. I use a program called controller mate to program the Xkeys and they are of no real help on the issue. I was wondering if anyone has any ideas how to go about putting the FN key on a different key or the unicode so that I can get the Xkeys to grab it as a key press. I know this sounds weird and I understand in my head what I am saying just not how to describe it. Any ideas will be greatly appreciated.  <answer100924> It probably won't help, but you could try using a private.xml like this with KeyRemap4MacBook:  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt; &lt;root&gt;   &lt;item&gt;     &lt;name&gt;test&lt;/name&gt;     &lt;identifier&gt;test&lt;/identifier&gt;     &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::F1, KeyCode::FN&lt;/autogen&gt;   &lt;/item&gt; &lt;/root&gt; /code/pre  See the source for the key code values and predefined settings.
