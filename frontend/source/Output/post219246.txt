Full screen problem <body> Whenever I use a full screen app, it first blacks out my other monitors and then whenever I click on another monitor it closes the full screen app and goes to windowed mode.  I would like it to just go fullscreen without my other monitors going black and I would like to be able to click on things on my other monitor without it closing the full screen.  I am running the latest version of El Capitan.  Thanks in advance :)  <answer219247> The only way to prevent this is to have "Displays have separate Spaces" checked in System Prefs  Mission Control  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zqhUF.png" alt="enter image description here"  This then requires that you have at least one more Space than you have monitors, or it has 'nowhere to go'  It has downsidesâ€¦     ul lithat either Space can then be on either screen, so you lose the ability to spread your work over 2 monitors  /li lithat the Dock &amp; menu bar can be on either screen/li /ul  Personally, I don't think Apple quite thought through how Spaces &amp; full-screen work if you have more than one monitor, the end result being that either setup is a compromise.  My own solution is to never use full-screen &amp; also not use 'separate Spaces'  <comment265166> I tried this and it did not work for me. <comment265167> Those are your choices, I'm afraid. <comment265606> Is there maybe an app that makes this better?
