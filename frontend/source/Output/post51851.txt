what is "translate" and why does it want access to my keychain? <body> I use Entourage for my email accounts but I keep getting a pop up saying br "translate wants to use your confidential information stored in "[my email account]" in your keychain.br Do you want to allow access to this item?"  By always allowing I found the location through keychain - /usr/libexec/oah/translate but I can't locate it through finder.  I am worried that this might be malware, does anyone know what it is?  <answer51853> It looks like code/usr/libexec/oah/translate/code is Rosetta, an Apple program to allow programs developed for PowerPC architecture to run on the newest Intel Mac.  So I don't think it's a malware, just Mac OS using Rosetta to run Entourage.  <answer147426> /usr is a hidden folder, so that's why you normally can't see it. I use iTweaX to show these, but I'm sure there are other methods.   I just today got this same thing in Entourage, so I scanned the libexec subfolder with ClamXav, just to be careful. It showed no viruses. After I did a hard restart of the Mac, all seems to be back to normal in Entourage. Unfortunately, I still have no idea what suddenly caused these keychain requests to appear, after years of using Entourage.  I also just ran across this in Apple Support Communities: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/2123451?tstart=0   FWIW, I'm running MacOS 10.6.8, and Entourage 2004 11.4.0, on a 2007 MacBook.  <comment59271> Are you using Entourage 2004?
