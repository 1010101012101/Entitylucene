Terminal lagging macOS <body> h3Environment:/h3  ul liMacBook Pro Retina Early 2015, /li limacOS 10.12./li liMemory used now: 5/8 Gb, but lags occur after restart too. /li liIn the 'worst case' at one time these apps are running: terminal, safari, sublime, calendar, telegram messenger, iTunes. /li li/.bash_profile/li /ul  h3Problem:/h3  Not every time, but very often I have a lag when switching to terminal window. It shows in round colourful circle (average loading) and I'm not able to do anything in that time.  I know about iTerm 2, but would be nice to fix default Terminal app.  <comment324264> Welcome to Ask Different.  We are going to need some more details...like what are the specs of your particular machine...memory, available drive space, what applications you have loaded, etc. <comment324266> @Allan Thanks! Did I miss something? <comment324267> You confused 'memory' with 'storage' <comment324269> @Allan sorry, in Russian it's the same word:) <comment324276> Da.    Ничего :-)     (I don't speak Russian....I just have lots of Russian friends) <comment324278> What about in Safe Mode or in a different account (create a new account for testing)? <comment324308> @Allan Haven't tried yet. Will add results in few days. <comment324309> @Tetsujin i've mentioned Allan instead of you, sorry. Now information is correct.
