Using Apple Developer as proof of sales between two companies <body> We are currently negotiating with a company where that company will use our technology (image recognition) to create an iOS app. We will receive a Royalty based on sales and we do not know the company enough to feel that we can trust them. Neither me nor my co-workers at our start-up are Apple developers.   We want to specify in our licensing-agreement that they should show us their sales via documents from their Apple Developer account. What are the possibilities / do you have any input on what kinds of documents we should specify?   I give the three ideas I am thinking of so far:  ol liInclude us as receivers in apple-emails if they are generated on a monthly basis on sales./li liSend us PDF from sales-reports from Apple./li liGive us special login-password once a month to check./li /ol  Is there any better that I am not aware of?  All the best Duran  <comment187075> what is it they are proposing as monitoring and reporting? How long is the agreement duration? What happens if you pull the plug on them ? <comment187077> I do not really understand the first question. They will summarize everything in a spread-sheet besides the solution via Apple Developer reports. This will be the only monitoring and therefore I want to find something good. The agreement is 5 years. I can't pull the plug. It's a licensing an they have the right to use out technology for the app during the licensing.
