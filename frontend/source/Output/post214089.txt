Is there a way to hide the unread count badge in El Capitan depending on the time of the day? <body> I know how to turn off the unread count badge for the mail icon using the codeNotifications/code preference pane from codesystem preferences/code but I would like to know if it is possible to have it turned off for example from 8 in the morning until 17 and otherwise on?  I don't want to be disturbed by email during the day but I want to be reminded at the end of the day or at the beginning.  <comment262236> There is an option in Do Not Disturb to set the time, but unfortunately only for banners and alerts to be hidden. I would love to see this too as I donâ€™t see the point in turning off _some_ of the notifications. <comment262251> Completely agree with you.
