Using the apple wireless keyboard with an iPad with PC/Mac-like keyboard commands <body> I have jailbroken iPad2 (iOS5.1.1) and an apple wireless bluetooth keyboard that I use for typing on the iPad. Although the keyboard is a joy to use, I can't use it for much else other than typing documents and creating notes.  I'd like to be able to use some kind of keyboard shortcuts to move around/switch between apps, use shortcuts like codeCmd+k/code or codeCtrl+k/code in the browser and so on.  Is this somehow possible? And if so how?  <answer86909> BeeKeyboard is a tweak available via Cydia that adds the ability to create custom keyboard shortcuts. I'm not sure if it can do app-switching shortcuts, but you can install a plugin called BeeSafari to add some browser shortcuts.  <comment100401> I can't comment on Jailbreak-based solutions, but iOS itself only responds to a small subset of computer-based commands. It should work well with things like kbdcmd/kbd + kbdB/kbd to make an item bold-faced for instance, or kbdopt/kbd + e to add an accent mark above a letter. Generally any commands you can use in Pages on a Mac to modify your text you can use on an iPad. You may get more fully-featured answers though from someone with a jailbroken device.
