What's wrong with my launchctl config? <body> I'm trying to auto-run SickBeard on login  codepython /Applications/Sick-Beard/Sickbeard.py/code  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt; &lt;!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC -//Apple Computer//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd &gt; &lt;plist version="1.0"&gt; &lt;dict&gt;   &lt;key&gt;Label&lt;/key&gt;   &lt;string&gt;com.sickbeard.sickbeard&lt;/string&gt;   &lt;key&gt;ProgramArguments&lt;/key&gt;   &lt;array&gt;        &lt;string&gt;/usr/bin/python&lt;/string&gt;        &lt;string&gt;/Applications/Sick-Beard/SickBeard.py&lt;/string&gt;        &lt;string&gt;-q&lt;/string&gt;        &lt;string&gt;-d&lt;/string&gt;   &lt;/array&gt;   &lt;key&gt;RunAtLoad&lt;/key&gt;   &lt;true/&gt; &lt;/dict&gt; &lt;/plist&gt; /code/pre  When I run codelaunchctl com.sickbeard.sickbeard.plist/code it gives me the message:     launchctl load com.sickbeard.sickbeard.plist  launchctl: no plist was   returned for: com.sickbeard.sickbeard.plist launchctl: no plist was   returned for: com.sickbeard.sickbeard.plist nothing found to load   <answer46372> You might want to add the -F flag to force codelaunchctl/code to load the .plist. Also, make sure that the .plist is in the paths codelaunchctl/code searches. If your .plist is somewhere else, you may also add the -D flag and specify the domain. From the manpage:       -D domainbr                          Look for plist(5) files ending in *.plist in the domain given. Valid domains include "system," "local," "network" and "all." When providing a session type, an additional domain is available for use called "user." For example, without a session type given, "-D system" would load from property list files from /System/Library/LaunchDaemons.  With a session type passed, it would load from /System/Library/LaunchAgents.     Make sure that you thoroughly review all information contained in the manpage - you can really wreck things if your call is not properly configured.  <answer46380> I'm assuming the paths to the python script and its parameters are valid, otherwise you'd most likely be seeing errors in the Console instead.  The last time I saw that error was because there were spurious characters in the plist, e.g. extra spaces, causing syntax errors and therefore making it fail to load. If you run codeplutil -lint/code on your plist, this will check the syntax for you and also handily report back the line on which the error occurred.  codeplutil -lint com.sickbeard.sickbeard.plist/code  If that doesn't help, the (OSX) How To Start SickBeard at Login or boot on OSX thread on the sickbeard forums has a slightly different plist to yours (sickbeard running from code/usr/local/code as opposed to code/Applications/code - so it could be a permissions thing) and also some people with seemingly the same problem as you  <answer65904> As I discovered the hard way, you must execute the command using codesudo/code as well as passing the full path of the code.plist/code file as follows (in your case):  precodesudo launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.sickbeard.sickbeard.plist /code/pre  The path may be different for you, but you must locate the file to find out its location and pass it as I quoted to the codelaunchctl/code command.  <answer89433> The message codenothing found to load/code means sometimes that the config is overriden by an other config. You force the loading by using the option "-w" when using codelaunchctl load or unload/code.  If you have to force the load or unload of a plist file, it means that you have a config which overrides the plist. This overriding is created when you use the "-w" otherwise no override will be added to the overrides file. To prevent this case, edit the file below, search the job label that you want to remove the override, delete the necessary lines:     pico /var/db/launchd.db/com.apple.launchd/overrides.plist   For example, delete this line      precode&lt;key&gt;com.mydomain.myjob&lt;/key&gt; &lt;dict&gt;         &lt;key&gt;Disabled&lt;/key&gt;         &lt;true/&gt; &lt;/dict&gt; /code/pre  then you could use: codelaunchctl load or unload /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.mydomain.myjob.plist/code without the need of "-w" or "-F", you should not have the message codenothing found to load/code  <comment52995> I assume you meant "launchctl **load** com.sickbeard.sickbeard.plist" in your command line? Otherwise you'd get a completely different error ;-) <comment53023> Thank you for your help. It seems that copying and pasting brought an extra character which was hidden. I've retyped the whole XML with nano and it worked just fine. <comment109014> Thanks, never knew about `plutil -lint` before. Very handy! <comment146574> Just found this posting, but checking out Console output helps alot with the debugging as well.
