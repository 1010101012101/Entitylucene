How can I get the dev name associated to a Volume name? <body> I am creating a bash script to unmount my usb drive after the backup is done. To unmount the drive I use the command:  precodediskutil unmount disk4s1 /code/pre  But sometimes when I plug my usb drive it gets a different dev name, as disk3s1, or disk2s1. I need add a line in my script before unmount the disk, to get the dev name associated to my volume name.  What command could I use to get the dev name given its volume name?  <answer239920> precodemount | grep /Volumes/foo | cut -d ' ' -f1 /code/pre  or  precodemount | awk '/Volumes\/foo/ { print $1 }' /code/pre  <answer240155> You can just use the volume name with diskutil though, there's no need to get the identifier:  precode$ diskutil unmount VolumeName Volume VolumeName on disk1s1 unmounted /code/pre  <comment294654> Perfect, it works very well! Thank you! <comment294659> Thank you!. This is my bash code to unmount myvolume working perfect now :   devname=$(mount | grep /Volumes/myvolume | cut -d ' ' -f1);  osascript -e 'do shell script "diskutil unmount '$devname'" '
