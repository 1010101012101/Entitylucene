Ipad Mini iCloud Drive: completely empty <body> Most of the files in my iBooks app in my MBP are pdfs or epubs. I have a first generation iPad Mini and I want to sync all of my documents in iBooks to iBooks in the iPad. I have read everything on how to do it, followed the steps accordingly, and I am still not able to do it.   I enabled iCould Drive in my mac, and in my Finder I can see the iCloud tab, under which is iCloud Drive, Desktop, and Documents. If I went directly to iCloud Drive, under my Preview directory I could see all of my pdfs from iBooks. Then I double checked on icloud.com to see if all of my files were uploaded and they weren't, so I created a new folder called Books and dragged every file from iBooks into that folder. They were all uploaded to iCloud.  I then opened the iBooks app on the iPad mini assuming they were all going to be there so I could download them, but they weren't. Then I went to the iCloud Drive app in the iPad and it is completely empty. It says 0 items and nothing shows up. However, as previously stated, if I log in to icloud.com and I see my files that are in my iCloud Drive, I can see all the books, along with everything else in my iCloud. I have signed out of the iCloud account, enabled iBooks and everything else in my iPad, I don't know what else I should do.  <comment328825> Have you tried syncing the documents through iTunes?
