Recover deleted header files in Xcode <body> I accidentally run this buildstripheaders and IT DELETED ALL MY .h files from my xcode projects. I don't have a latest backup. Is there a way to get my header files back or recreate them?   <comment261259> That's why you should **always** back up, especially when doing something that will delete files. Whether it's a Time Machine, HD clone, or just coping some files to a secondary location, a backup always helps. I'm not sure how it works, but could it have moved them to trash, instead to just deleting them? <comment261263> What is buildstripheaders ?
