How to merge files after using split command from terminal? <body> I've split a large file with the split command from a Terminal and copied it from a USB-stick to my MacBook.  This results in couple of files named 'xaa', 'xab', 'xac'.  How do I merge them together again from within a Terminal?  <answer43586> precodecat xaa &gt; newfile cat xab &gt;&gt; newfile cat xac &gt;&gt; newfile /code/pre  Basically using a single '' operand send the output to a new file.  using a double '' operand makes it append the contents to the end of an existing file (and also out of interest create it if it does not already exist.  If all your files are definitely in a neat alphabetical order, then you could use:  precodecat x* &gt; newfile /code/pre  or  precodecat xaa xab xac &gt; newfile /code/pre  in case the filenames aren't in alphabetical order.  <comment49526> You can also do `cat xaa xab xac  newfile` <comment49527> but of course, this sounds logical! :-) thanks! <comment49562> It _is the mac way_ after all. <comment52411> @bmike More like _the Unix way_, am I right?! :)
