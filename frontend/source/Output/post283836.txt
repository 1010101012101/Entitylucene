Using AppleScript to batch convert .pages to pdf <body> I am needing to convert about 100 .pages documents to either pdf or docx. With the AppleScript script below, I am able to open .pages documents from the folder that I select. However I receive the following error when trying to export.  strongQuestion:/strong What is causing the error and how do I fix it?  strongError Message with personal information replaced:/strong     error "Pages got an error: Can’t make alias \"Macintosh   HD:Users:Path:To:File:foo.pages\" into   type document." number -1700 from alias "Macintosh   HD:Users:Path:To:File:foo.pages." to   document   strongLine of code producing the error:/strong  precodeexport this_file to exportFileName as PDF /code/pre  strongScript:/strong  precodeset exportFileExtension to "pdf" set this_folder to (choose folder with prompt "Pick the folder containing the files to process:") as string tell application "System Events"     set these_files to every file of folder this_folder end tell repeat with i from 1 to the count of these_files     set this_file to (item i of these_files as alias)     set this_info to info for this_file     tell application "Finder"         set {fType, nExt} to ({file type, name extension} of file this_file)         set documentName to the name of this_file         set exportFileName to documentName &amp; "." &amp; exportFileExtension     end tell     if nExt contains "pages" then         tell application "Pages"             open this_file             export this_file to exportFileName as PDF             close saving no         end tell     end if end repeat /code/pre  strong###Update###:/strong I have added this script to github with the hopes of it benefiting others as it continues to be improved. Contributions appreciated.  <answer283848> Replace the line of code producing the error with the following:  pre class="lang-default prettyprint-override"codeexport front document to file (this_folder &amp; exportFileName) as PDF /code/pre  There were two issues here:  ul liexport takes a document, so you need to pass it the document as opened by Pages./li liYou gave the file name, but not a containing folder to put the file with this name, so concatenate this with the containing folder path so Pages knows where to export to./li /ul  <comment357928> Thank you. I was able to successfully export using the changes that you suggest. However, my code opens all 100 files before executing and does not close them. <comment357933> @BrianWilson, Re: your comment... change `close saving no` to `close front document saving no` <comment357940> hmm. Now  `set this_file to (item i of these_files as alias)` is **causing error message:** `error "Can’t make «class cpkg» \"Macintosh HD:Users:Path:to:file.pages:\" of application \"System Events\" into type alias." number -1700 from «class cpkg» "Macintosh HD:Users:Path:to:file.pages:" to alias` <comment358052> Thanks for the help in answering the original questions with followups. The code is still very buggy, but the original problem has been solved. As a service to humanity, I am putting the script on github. [link](https://github.com/bountonw/UsefulScripts/blob/master/AppleScript/pagesToPDF.scpt) <comment358053> Here is a better [link to github](https://github.com/bountonw/UsefulScripts/tree/master/AppleScript). I have included a text file so it is not necessary to download the .scpt file to see what is going on. <comment358067> Yes, indeed :) Never touched AppleScript before the major copy/paste from multiple sources exhibited here. I'm not using fType, but I am using nExt. can I just `set nExt to (name extension of file this_file)`? Regarding naming conventions, agreed. This is from the multiple sources that I copied from. I will clean that up. Thank you. <comment358072> Done. Thank you.
