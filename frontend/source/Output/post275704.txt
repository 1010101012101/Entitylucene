How do I change the default mapping for Emoji Text Replacement in Messages on OSX? <body> I like that Messages uses text replacement to change code:)/code into an emoji. However, I hate the default mappings. I want to change the emoji that is mapped to those text replacement strings.   For example, code:)/code currently gets replaced by code/code. But I would prefer to it be code/code. Similarly, code:(/code gets replaced by code/code, but I would prefer code/code.   Aside from creating my own text replacements in codeSystem preferences &gt; Keyboard &gt; Text/code, is there a way to change this? I don't want to enable a universal text replacement because I sometimes use text emoticons in applications that don't support emojis.
