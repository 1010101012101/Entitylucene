Can I change the button "m" with space bar? <body> My space bar won't work so I want to use the m button as space bar. Is there a way to do that? Maybe with the Automator using an apples riptide or something?   <answer225996> I have used KeyRemap4MacBook with success before. (It has been renamed to Karabiner since)  http://lifehacker.com/5882684/the-best-keyboard-remapper-for-mac-os-x  This article gives a bit of an overview on it. The only downside is that it doesn't allow you to remap a key through the interface, you will have to do that through editing an XML file but it isn't too difficult to do.  <answer226006> To make this work you have to use a third party tool: Karabiner.  I propose to use one of the option keys though: usually one of both is rarely used and you can use kbdM/kbd as normal key.  ol liDownload, install and open Karabiner/li liOpen in the menulet Karabiner - Preferences/li liEnter "Space"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vav6F.png" alt="enter image description here"/li liEnable the chosen keycode and close the window./li /ol  <comment274352> I will give it a shot <comment274353> Great, let us know how it works out for you to see if this software is worthwhile to solving a problem like this!
