iPhone calendar app for multiple gmail accounts <body> I have the gmail app which lets me sync my work and personal gmail accounts. I want to be able to sync both google accounts with a calendar app as well. The default calendar only supports one. I installed calenmob and its really nice but also only supports one google account. Is there a calendar app that will let me sync 2 google accounts?  I am using an iPhone 5 with iOS 6.1  <answer82294> You don't need any third party app to add different calendars to the built-in app. Just open the iOS preferences, go to emMail, Contacts, Calendars/em and add another account of your choice. In your case, just add another Google account.  <answer102471> I have a work gmail account and a personal gmail account and I can only see one calendar at a time on my iPhone. They are both entered, and I get email from both accounts, but I cannot see calendar events from both calendars. So I use CalenGoo app.  <comment94846> What do you mean with "the default calendar only supports one"? Just create a second Google account in the preferences and it will also show your work calendar in the calendar app. <comment94894> @cyphorious that worked thanks (sorry I am new to this phone) <comment94973> OK. In this case I post it as an answer again. <comment120635> Can you explain what CalenGoo is and what makes it work for you?
