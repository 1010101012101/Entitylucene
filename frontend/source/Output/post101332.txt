Can't change displays refresh rate <body> I'm using OS X 10.8.3 and I want to change the refresh rate of my display, but I can't. When I go to codeSystem Preferences-&gt; Displays/code, I have two options for resolution: codeBest for Display/code and codeScaled/code. The first one is default. A little bit lower, I see the codeRefresh Rate/code option at code60 Hertz/code. When I click it, I can see there is also a code75 Hertz/code item there, but it's greyed out and unavailable. If I change codeResolution/code to codeScaled/code, then I'm presented with a list of resolutions I can pick. For some resolutions, code75 Hertz/code is available, but then another problem arises - the entire screen becomes stretched, so there's no point of using code75 Hertz/code with it.   How do I change the refresh rate without stretching the screen from a Mac Mini MD387 and display LG E2242T?  <answer101337> To use that refresh rate you would have to lower the resolution to a maximum of 1280x1024. See the manual, page 29.  <comment119346> What kind of hardware are you using, both as computer and as display? <comment119348> Mac Mini MD387 and display LG E2242T <comment119384> but the screen becomes stretched if i pick this resolution or lower or any resolution else except 1344x1008 <comment119422> What are you using to connect to the mini? HDMI?
