Mac AppStore Resume Issue <body> I'm using Mac App Store on Lion, But there is a problem with download resume. After every system restart I can't resume my previous downloads and I have to download them from the beginning, I also checked and I have no AppStore directory at this path ~/Library/Application Support/ AppStore store the temp files at a directory in  /private/var/folders/s1/ ... /com.apple.appstore/ But after restarting the computer and opening the AppStore it deletes all the contents of this directory, and I have to start the downloads all over again. I also tried restarting AppStore in debug mode but it didn't work. I'm wondering if someone have a solution for this issue.  Regards  <comment66897> Have you considered letting the download complete? <comment66898> How much HD space is available? <comment66903> @bmike If I let it it will be completed, But my connection bandwidth is low so I want to be able to resume downloads later. <comment66904> @orange There is 16GB available. <comment66910> The system will attempt to resume the download if it have confidence in the package - nothing was corrupted and the disconnect was clean. Something is changing - perhaps on the server end to prevent that nice resume from happening. You may not be able to control this, sadly. <comment66916> @bmike I'm sure that is not the case because since I updated my computer to Lion, I couldn't resume any downloads after system restart. <comment67040> @TRI try freeing up some more space. Make sure there's a minimum of 20% free disk space. <comment68060> @bmike That's not the case my computer storing previously downloaded data even after system restart, but instantly deleting them when I open Mac AppStore.
