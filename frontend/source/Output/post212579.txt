Where is load presets option in Terminal preferences? <body> I have El Captain installed. I want use external color scheme and for that I am following this video but I don't find Color Presets option in terminal. My El Captain's terminal looks very different from Yosemite's.   <answer212580> The person in that video is using iTerm2, a free third party terminal replacement. You can get it here:  http://iterm2.com/  <comment256673> So, is it fully functional as terminal? <comment256685> Yes, you can do everything you do in Terminal and more with iTerm2
