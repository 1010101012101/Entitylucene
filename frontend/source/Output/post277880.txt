After inactivity, mac requires click to undim <body> I recently updated my mac to Sierra, and recently I noticed something a bit strange. After I've left the machine inactive for a few minutes the screen will dim - all normal. The strange part is that when I wiggle the cursor to keep it awake, it still stays dim. I have to click the mouse to get the machine to go back to an awake state. The cursor does move on the screen, despite having little effect.  Any ideas? My first thought would be a setting in the Energy Saver preferences, but I don't see anything useful. I read in a different question (Mac mini won&#39;t wake with USB mouse after macOS Sierra upgrade) that this feature was removed a while back, but I don't think this is the case as I regularly use this feature on my iMac which is also running Sierra.
