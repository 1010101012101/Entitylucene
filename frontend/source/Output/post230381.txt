Safari sort not the same as finder <body> When I pull up finder, files are sorted according to date:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MJ69g.png" alt="Finder sort"  But when I'm in Safari, and need to choose a file to upload, there's a bunch of files at the bottom of the picker that says "no date". This seems like a bug. Can anyone tell me how to fix this?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ecl2C.png" alt="Safari file picker sort"  <answer230779> I found the answer. I didn't realize it, but you can actually click on the header (in Safari picker), and make more choices that way. So I did that, and chose "Date Created".  That fixed the sort problem.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/RCfni.png" alt="New sort"  <comment281183> There are four different date fields that files can be sorted by. <comment281224> Yeah, but no matter what sort I use, those "no date" files still show up under no date. <comment281237> In fact, even if I remove all of the columns, the one remaining one - on the far left where it says "today" or "no date" remains (you can't edit or delete that one).  And the sort remains the same. In Finder, the files show up sorted correctly by date. When picking a file in Safari to upload, there's an increasing number of files that don't get sorted at all, and remain under the header "no date".
