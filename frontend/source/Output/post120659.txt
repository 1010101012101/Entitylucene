Can't use Alt+N in Terminal <body> I installed Zsh the other day but didn't like it so I promptly removed it. Since doing so however I'm no longer able to type kbdalt+n/kbd to get a code~/code character, whilst it works everywhere else.  Yes, I know I can use the kbd~/kbd key, but kbdalt+n/kbd has become so ingrained in my muscle memory that it's starting to annoy me more.  Any ideas?
