What does the Delete key do on the English QWERTY keyboard? <body> I have a French AZERTY keyboard with a Backspace key (that can be modified with Fn into Delete) and to my surprise I saw on the Apple Store that the English QWERTY keyboard had a Delete key in its place, so I'm wondering if it's really a Delete key (erase right) that can be modified with Fn into Backspace, or not. Edit: If I try on the virtual keyboard with American layout, the key does erase left.  <answer16700> On the English QWERTY keyboards, the kbdDelete/kbd key functions as a kbdBackspace/kbd key, and can be turned into an erase right key with the kbdfn/kbd modified key.  <answer16703> The kbdDelete/kbd (delete forward) key, when standalone, is called kbdDel/kbd on both Mac and PC keyboards.  Of the 6 keyboards I have convenient here (1 each full size and laptop PC, 2 full-size and 2 laptop Mac), the delete-backwards key is called kbdBackspace/kbd on the PC keyboards and kbdDelete/kbd on the Macs.  (The kbdDel/kbd key is called that on all the keyboards that have it or a marker for it.)  Pedantically, the Macs are correct, as the concept of "backspace" doesn't include erasing but the kbdBackspace/kbd / kbdDelete/kbd key does erase.  <comment18232> Then I must ask: why is it labelled Delete ? <comment18233> I actually don't know; maybe ask it as a question here. ;) <comment18234> I can see that it wouldn't be labelled Backspace because thanks to the modifier key it can erase both ways. But I don't see why the label is different on AZERTY when the behaviour is the same.
