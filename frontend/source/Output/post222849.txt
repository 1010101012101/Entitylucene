Charge iPad 1 without wall charger <body> I have only the USB cable so can I charge it with my laptop or computer or any other way?  <answer222851> Yes, plug it in your laptop/desktop and it will automatically charge your ipad.   <answer222874> No, Most laptop usb ports will not have sufficient power to charge a full sized ipad. You will need a high-power usb port. However you should be able to charge from a desktop computer but it will take longer.  <answer222914> You might get a small trickle-charge by connecting to a Windows laptop, better if you don't run the iPad whilst doing so, but only a Mac is capable of recognising &amp; supplying the higher power requirement of an iPad.  Connected to any standard USB port on a PC, the device will claim it is not charging - though in practise it will emeventually/em manage to charge it, it will be very slow.  Your best bet, if you don't own a Mac, is to buy a dedicated iPad charger.  <comment270077> It does not work on any USB port. For all macbooks, it will. You have to check the mAH <comment270094> What computer do you have? Most Macs should be able to charge your iPad via USB.
