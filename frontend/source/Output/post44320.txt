How much RAM can I add to my macbook <body> I have a 2008 macbook with a 2.1 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo.  I am in the process of upgrading to Lion.  I currently have 2GB 667 MHz DDR2 SDRAM  What's the maximum amount of RAM I can put in and it have an effect?   <answer44321> Your Macbook supports up to 6GB of RAM.  Apple states that it's 4GB, but OWC continuously checks the max. supported RAM of Apple's computers.  See this list here:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/leMSj.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer44322> everymac.com is an awesome source for this kind of information. They've got detailed specs for all Macs.*  Yours is listed as strongsupporting a maximum of 6GB of RAM/strong. Technically, Apple says that this computer only supports 4, but it has been proven to actually support 6:     Apple officially supports a maximum of 4 GB of RAM but third-parties   have been able to upgrade the system to 6 GB of RAM using one 2 GB and   one 4 GB memory module.   You can buy a 6GB kit from OWC, a great company, for $120.  If you use a lot of apps and regularly run up against the edge of your available memory, everything you add will make a difference; the computer can take advantage of all of it. However, since you've currently got 2, you should consider if 4 will be enough or if you want all 6.  *In additon to Everymac, I recommend the app Mactracker for Mac and iOS (free). It has detailed info and specs for all Mac models.  <answer44324> It officially supports 4GB of RAM, but has been reported to actually take 6GB. Lion is a 64-bit OS, and will use all of the RAM you give it.  <answer44325> If I'm right and that's your MacBook Model then the maximum is 4GB.  And if it does have an effect or not depends how much free memory you have now. But usually it's a good thing to upgrade if you use the latest OS X versions.  <comment50365> I confirm by first-hand experience that the MacBook Late 2008 Unibody's support at least 8 GB of RAM (I haven't tried more). <comment50368> Nice, just bought the OWC 6GB kit <comment50399> I upgraded an old iMac to 6GB this way, it worked out great.
