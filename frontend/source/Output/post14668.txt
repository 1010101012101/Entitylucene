How can growl be used with syslog? <body> I have a shell script that logs messages to syslog using the 'logger' command. In my syslog.conf, I filter those messages to a specific log file. This is a portable solution that works across all unices. On OS X, I would also like to have these messages sent to growl. I have tried both of the following with no success:  precode*.*        |exec /usr/local/bin/growlnotify *.*        @127.0.0.1:23052 /code/pre  <answer14688> According to codeman syslog.conf/code, Mac OS X's codesyslog.conf/code can handle messages only by writing to a file, sending to a remote host's syslog, and send them to users' consoles.  hr  Your best option is probably to send to a file, and write a daemon or a periodically running script that consumes this file and calls codegrowlnotify/code with what it reads from the file, something like the following:  precode#!/usr/bin/env bash while read line do     /usr/local/bin/growlnotify "Your App" -m "$line" done &lt; /path/to/file echo -n &gt; /path/to/file /code/pre  Either keep this running all the time by wrapping in a loop, or start it every few seconds using a codelaunchd/code job and the codeStartInterval/code directive. codeman launchd/code and codeman launchd.plist/code can help you here.
