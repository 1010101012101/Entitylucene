OSX changing backgrounds- iphoto folder doesn't update <body> I have the background image on my OSX desktop set to change every x minutes- it chooses a random image within a specific iPhoto album.  However, when I remove photos from that iPhoto album, the removed pictures continue to cycle on my desktop.  How can I fix that?  <comment104976> Does it persist after rebooting? <comment105085> @the Yes. I've rebooted many times since I started pruning pics from that iphoto folder.
