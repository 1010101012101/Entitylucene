Finder Connect to Server Opens into VLC <body> I wanted to connect to an FTP Server using Finder's codeGo &gt; Connect to Server/code option.br So I try to do so like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/XvohX.png" alt="enter image description here"  But, when I try to do so, it opens in VLC and then VLC crashes.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5sOv9.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Anyone facing a similar problem? What can I do to open it in Finder itself? Do I need to change some defaults? If so, where?  <answer216116> I haven't used the "Connect to Server" menu command in years.  I go into Terminal and type either a command or codeopen/code and a URL that does what I want.  In your case, since codesftp/code is a command, try codesftp bang.bong.boom.ac.in/code  <comment261123> This is pretty cool! Doesn't solve the problem, but yes! Terminal based solutions are great. Being a Mac OS newbie, I guess I still have a lot to learn. Either way, there are situations when I'd like to have stuff in Finder. I'll wait for someone to suggest a fix before closing this question :) <comment261131> Nope, not a dupe. I don't want an alternate, I want to fix this. <comment261132> I'm sorry, but sftp is definetly **not supported** in the Finder. If you want to use it, you'll definitely need third-party-solutions as described in the linked answer. <comment261133> Oh is that so? Let me try ftp-ing then. I'll let you know if that works <comment261520> @Asmus yep, you're right. So, third party application it is. :/
