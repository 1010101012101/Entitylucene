Close an application window directly from Mission Control? <body> For example, you can close "Dashboard" widgets while holding down the kbdoption/kbd key. I can’t find a way to close windows and/or exit an application directly from Mission Control. Though I'm looking for a keyboard shortcut or builtin solution ideally, Third Party solutions are acceptable so long as the application is simple and non-intrusive.  Here’s a screenshot if it’s still unclear what I’m asking.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1fCiL.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Running macOS Sierra [originally asked Running El Capitan.]   Note: I see now that a similar question exists, but it’s five years old and still unanswered - hoping there’s a better solution out there…  <answer275150> You can use do this by using Better Touch Tool as suggested by Anthonin C's comment. However, if you have a trackpad or touchpad, you may find that using a gesture instead of a keyboard shortcut avoids the problems outlined in the question linked to by Anthonin C. If this is something that interests you, then you would:  ol liInstall BTT/li liAdd a new strongglobal/strong gesture /li liSet up a Touchpad Gesture (such as a 3 finger click)/li liSet the Predefined Action as emClose window below cursor/em/li /ol  This will then work from Mission control.  strongClosing apps/strong  By the way, if you're wanting to close an App rather than just a window, you can also do this via the heads-up display. More specifically:  ol liPress kbdcommand/kbdkbdtab/kbd to open the heads-up display/li liKeep holding the kbdcommand/kbd key once when you see the heads-up display/li liCycle through the apps by pressing the kbdtab/kbd key or the kbd~/kbd key/li liOnce the app you want to quit is selected, press the kbdQ/kbd key to quit the app/li /ol  strongNOTE:/strong - You could also use the heads up display to quickly navigate to an App and, once there, use the kbdcommand/kbd+kbdW/kbd keyboard shortcut to close the window. However, if you have multiple windows open you could inadvertently close the wrong window.  <answer275204> As I've suggested in my comment, using Better Touch Tool (free) is, according to me, the only way to achieve this. What you have to do after installing Better Touch Tool is :   ul liGo in codeTrackpad/code sections (or codeKeyboard/code if you don't have Trackpad)/li liIn the left sidebar select codeGlobal/code/li liClick codeAdd a new gesture/code/li liSelect a gesture (I personally use code3 Fingers Swipe down/code)/li liIn codePredefined Actions/code, search for codeClose Window Below Cursor (Works in Mission Control)/code/li /ul  You're set !  strongNOTE/strong : Even if the window is successfully closed in Mission Control, it still maintains the outline for the app  <comment345941> I know it's not the best but a way to do this is explained here : http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/25672/201567 Since I was already using BTT it's good to me. <comment346079> @AnthoninC. Thanks. Feel free to expound a bit and submit this as an answer. <comment346986> Please add an source. I think this looks dangerously similar to [this post](https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/closing-windows-in-mission-control.1183853/#post-14298833) <comment347003> @hrdy Thanks for pointing out the MacRumors post. I agree, both our answers are very similar. However, using BTT to achieve this functionality is the only way I'm aware of to do this, and it's been the workaround for many years (since OS X Lion was introduced in 2011 I think, maybe earlier), so I certainly don't claim to have come up with this approach first. In fact, I note the MacRumors post is from 2012, so it could be my original source. :) <comment347004> @hrdy Regardless, I'm happy for the OP to give Anthonin C the bounty as they mentioned BTT in their comment first. I just wanted to expand on it in case they never offered an explanation on _how_ to do it using BTT and because I wanted to make sure the OP was aware of the heads up display.  :) <comment347056> @Monomeeth Though I'm well aware of much of the information mentioned, the point of the reward system is to provide incentive, albeit somewhat trivial, to create a meaningful Q&A exchange in order to benefit the community as a whole . With that in mind, who mentioned what first in a comment is really not relevant IMO; the only basis upon which any OP should judge the merits of an answer is on how well it answers the question. While Anthonin gave a good answer, this one is substantively  better. That said, I thank you both for taking the time to give one! Cheers. <comment347093> @njboot Well, I have to say I can't really argue with that logic. And you're right, the OP should judge the merits of an answer on how well it addresses the question. :)
