The audio jack of my iPhone keeps cutting out <body> When I'm trying to listen to something on my iPhone, the audio keeps cutting out. I've had this problem quite a bit lately and there seems to be a sweet spot where it doesn't cut out.   It also means that the controls on my earphones, like those of apple earphones, dot work at all.   I've tried clearing out the audio jack and my earphones work fine in my iPod.
