Music app not showing albums/artists <body> I have been having an issue with the Music app since Apple debuted it. For some reason it "hides" some artists and albums from showing up in their respective tabs on that app. This includes the general Songs tab, as well. They are definitely on the phone, as I can search them and find them using the Search tab at the bottom.   The albums/artists that aren't being displayed have their info fully filled out in iTunes, and when I connect my phone to my Mac they show up just fine. They appear to be no different than the albums/artists that do show up in the app.   Can anyone point me in the right direction? It used to not do this before that Music app took over the iPod spot, so I'm not sure why it is happening.   I'm using iOS version 10.3.2 and iTunes version 12.6.1.25.   <comment360594> Please post screen captures to better present the issue
