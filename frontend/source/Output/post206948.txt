Can I view my home network's iPhoto / Photos library on an Apple TV (4th gen)? <body> I haven't seen it mentioned anywhere yet, but I'm curious if the new 4th Gen Apple TV allows you to view your iPhoto/Photos library from a computer on your LAN like you could before without using iCloud?  Previously, you could go to the 'Computers' icon on the Apple TV and view a shared iTunes library on another computer on your home LAN (as described here). Though it didn't connect directly to iPhoto/Photos, it was able to see your home collection via iTunes. I use this feature quite a bit when showing home pictures and videos to folks on my HDTV.  After seeing some of the reviews of the new 4th gen Apple TV, I see that you can still connect to your local iTunes library, but the option for viewing your photo library is no longer visible; I don't know if this is because of the reviewer not having a library switched on or if the feature has been removed.  Any idea if this is still possible? Frankly, it is a bit of a show stopper for me since I don't particularly care about the new app capability of the device and I refuse to upload my gigabytes of personal media to Apple's servers.  Thanks!
