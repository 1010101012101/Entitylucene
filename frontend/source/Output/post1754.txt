What is that circle that replaces the WIFI icon on my iPhone 2G sometimes? <body> It's probably the phone's way of showing me there is no WIFI connection. Is that it? Probably not since that would probably be a "no icon" thing.   Anyway, couldn't find it in the user's manual so here you go... question asked.   Thx  <answer1755> The circle indicates that you're on the cellular GPRS data network. The fact that it's visible also means that you don't have a wifi connection:  img src="https://www.blogcdn.com/www.tuaw.com/media/2009/06/securedownload12.jpg" alt=""  <comment1542> Awesome Kyle, thanx! <comment4393> 3G/3GS/4’s show a “E” instead of that, to indicate that they are on “E”dge network. <comment7160> @Martin: those newer models also show the circle if they are on plain GPRS without EDGE.
