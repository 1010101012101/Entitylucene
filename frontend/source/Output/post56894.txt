tmux on Mac, how can I enable vi mode for the command line <body> I want to be able to hit escape and then use vi navigation keys like b (back a word). I can do this in my regular terminal sessions by setting codeset -o vi/code in my .bashrc file.  However it's not working in tmux. I added codeset -o vi/code in my .tmux_conf file, but it only works for 1 "hit" then I get switched back into insert mode after hitting the key.  So if I press [escape] i can go back one word with [b] but then the next [b] just inserts the codeb/code character.  How can I make that 'vi' mode work in my tmux sessions the same way it does at my 'plain' bash shell.  <answer56895> Add codeset -o vi/code to the code~/.bash_profile/code file
