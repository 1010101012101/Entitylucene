Newest version of HomeBrew, versions no longer supported <body> I am having problems installing the old version of grails on my mac, with homebrew.  The spot where I get stuck is at the codebrew versions grails/code as it will say that versions is no longer used. I have executed codebrew tap homebrew/versions/code but the versions command do still not work. How in the newest version of brew can I install Grails 2.3.5?  precodeError: The `versions` command is no longer supported. You can use the homebrew-versions tap instead:   https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-versions Or use `brew log` to browse the git history. /code/pre  <answer180417> precodebrew tap homebrew/versions /code/pre  then:  precodebrew install homebrew/versions/grails23 /code/pre  codebrew search grails/code will show you all the available ones to install.  <answer282773> It seems to be very easy as of right now:  precodeuser@MacBook-Pro:~/% brew search grails         grails âœ”                                                                                                         grails@2.5 user@MacBook-Pro:~/% brew install grails@2.5 /code/pre  <comment214592> grails23 is not 2.3.5 <comment324569> I `brew search python` but don't get minor versions of Python. I'm trying to get 2.7.9 or later! <comment346437> `brew search grails` returns only 2 entries for me: `grails   homebrew/versions/grails25` <comment361957> This unfortunately does not work for uncrustify. It does not find old formulas.
