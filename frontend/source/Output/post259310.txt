Deleted every application by mistake and now my mac won't work <body> I have an iMac 2006 macOS 10.4 and by mistake I deleted all the applications including System Preferences. Now, when I enter Recovery mode it only comes up with Macintosh HD and when I click the arrow it goes to a white screen and flashes with a folder with a question mark, and a circle with a slash in it and the Apple logo.  Can someone help? What must I do to fix it?  <comment324425> Unless you have a time machine backup, you need to reinstall your OS.  See this [answer](http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/259215/119271) <comment324426> i dont have a time machine backup what can i do? <comment324431> Do you have the original disks that came with your Mac?  You need to reinstall. <comment324432> no I Dont have any disks or anything <comment324437> Then you best bet to go on [ebay](http://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&_trksid=p3984.m570.l1313.TR5.TRC2.A0.H0.Xos+x+lion.TRS0&_nkw=os+x+lion&_sacat=0) and find the original installation media.  Or attempt to install [FreeBSD](http://freebsd.org).  But, you hosed up your system.  Only a reinstall can fix it. <comment324439> Might consider to ask a friend to make a bootable USB stick with OSX on it. From that you should be able to startup (toggle at start up). If you google on this, you will quickly find out how to make a bootable USB stick with Sierra on it. <comment324459> @Arnoud Sierra wouldn't work on a 2006 PC. I tried installing El Cap on a 2008 MBA, but I could only go with Lion, because that MBA is too old <comment325225> Oops, sorry. Same trick with earilier version. Some disk images fly around on the net.
