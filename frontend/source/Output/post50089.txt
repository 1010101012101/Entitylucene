Suggestions for Multiple 24" LED Cinema Displays and MacBook Pro <body> I have two Apple 24" LED Cinema Displays and a mid-2010 17" MacBook Pro. I've used one display with the computer for a long time, but recently acquired the second display.  Given that I have these two monitors, what are my realistic options for using both with the same MacBook Pro? What is the current state of multi-monitor support? Moving to a Thunderbolt display is not an option.   <answer50094> I've looked into this in the past, and from what I know, you have a few options:  ol liI'd never really recommend it, you emcan/em get a usb adaptor that essentially adds another display port to your computer.  Make sure the one you pick is Mac compatible - there are some that exist./li liDualHead2Go is an interesting product that emulates a single double-wide monitor to your computer.  There are some catches:  ul liThere is a maximum resolution the device supports/li liIt works best if the monitors are the same dimensions and resolution/li liIt's currently ~$230/li liThe computer doesn't see the monitors separately, which means that when you configure/use it, it will act accordingly.  If you put the menubar on the external 'monitor,' it will stretch across both; maximized windows will be two monitors wide etc./li /ul/li liI can't find anything to back it up at the moment, but at one point I do believe I saw an ExpressPort/34 video card or a breakout box for a PCI card.  The only thing I can find now is XGP, but I'm near certain I saw a Mac-specific solution at one point./li /ol  Each has its benefits and drawbacks.  If you're not on a tight budget and your monitors will work for it, I'd recommend the DualHead2Go.  <comment57408> There's a Magma ExpressBox PCIe breakout box and ExpressPort solution available, but I was not familiar with AMD's solution. <comment57413> ewwhite, you should consider adding your comment as a solution.
