My iPhone suddenly will not play music on my Bose SoundDock <body> All of the sudden I am unable to play music from my iPhone using my Bose Sound Docking Station.  I've tried to call Apple but they want $29 just to listen to my problem. Is there a way I can reinstall an earlier version so I can play my music on my Bose?   I paid good money for the docking station and for it to just stop and not get any support from Apple is just not acceptable.  I have an iPhone 4 and a Bose SoundDock that has always worked fine.  It stopped working after my last software update to iOS 7.1.2; how can I remove the update and go backwards—is that possible? It has made my Bose obsolete. I am very disappointed.  <answer191275> You can't easily downgrade your iPhone.   This is discussed here on AD.SE. Searching on Google I see some people claiming it can be done, but I can't and won't confirm myself because of the bricking risks involved.  Good news is, from threads at the Apple forums, it looks like you just have to pair your iPhone and speaker again.  In your phone go to Settings  Bluetooth and press the (i) to the right of your speaker from the list of known devices. A new screen will appear, press codeForget This Device/code.  Next, follow this instructions from Bose to pair your iPhone again:     Bring your Bluetooth® music device (phone, MP3 player) close to the SoundDock 10 system      Turn on the Bluetooth® feature in your music device. For details on using this feature, refer to the owner's guide for your device      In the list of found Bluetooth® devices, find "Bose SoundDock 10" and select it      If prompted, enter the Bose® SoundDock 10 system passkey: 0000      When your music device confirms it is connected, the Bluetooth® light will stop flashing and remain on   If this is not your specific Bose speaker, look for it and follow similar instructions.  <comment227154> Please describe the specific problem you are facing, your iOS version, iPhone model, etc. <comment227156> I have a Bose Sounddock that has always worked fine - It stopped working after my last software update to iOS 7.1.2 - how can I remove the update and go backwards - is that possible?

But i read this that might help http://www.scosche.com/car-audio/charging-adapter-for-ipod-iphone <comment227178> possible duplicate of [Why won't my iPhone 4 play through my bose sound dock anymore?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/28294/why-wont-my-iphone-4-play-through-my-bose-sound-dock-anymore) <comment227228> Let's narrow this down. 1) if you're asking to downgrade - just ask that and say the reason is flakey interaction with a bose sound dock hardware 2) If you really want troubleshooting steps - have a [look here](http://meta.apple.stackexchange.com/questions/2508/why-were-not-customer-support-for-company-x-or-product-y) for guidelines on editing out extra things (like potential solutions) and instead focus on how to learn enough to troubleshoot the iPhone - hardware connection. I would say, it's better to just leave this here and ask either or both questions as more brief follow on questions.
