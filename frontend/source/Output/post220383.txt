Suddenly all my apple music songs are gone <body> I open my Music App from iPhone and suddenly I don't see any songs. Neither I see any storage size for songs that used be around 2.5 GB. I restarted my phone with no luck. I have not sync my phone with other any PC iTunes. In fact, I have just charge my phone as usual. I am using iOS 9.2 iPhone 6s Plus 128 GB. What is causing this issue?  <comment266735> Do you have Apple Music enabled? <comment266754> Nope....Its not enabled
