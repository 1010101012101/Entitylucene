Bash completions broken <body> I am using following bash completions installed via brew:  precodebash-completion bash-completion@2 /code/pre  My .bashrc looks like:  precodeif [ -f /usr/local/share/bash-completion/bash_completion ]; then . /usr/local/share/bash-completion/bash_completion fi   if [ -f /usr/local/Cellar/bash-completion/1.3_2/etc/bash_completion ]; then   BASH_COMPLETION=/usr/local/Cellar/bash-completion/1.3_2/etc/bash_completion   . /usr/local/Cellar/bash-completion/1.3_2/etc/bash_completion fi /code/pre  The problem is when I press TAB on an empty prompt on keyboard I get the error:  code-bash: words: bad array subscript/code  After removing code/usr/local/share/bash-completion/bash_completion/code from code.bashrc/code error doesnâ€™t happen but I miss out on many completions.  What is the problem here? How can I fix it?  <answer295283> The solution is that I should call bash completion from 1.3.2 before codebash-completion@2/code. Following is how my code.bashrc/code looks, and this solves the problem:  precodeif [ -f /usr/local/Cellar/bash-completion/1.3_2/etc/bash_completion ]; then   BASH_COMPLETION=/usr/local/Cellar/bash-completion/1.3_2/etc/bash_completion   . /usr/local/Cellar/bash-completion/1.3_2/etc/bash_completion fi  if [ -f /usr/local/share/bash-completion/bash_completion ]; then     . /usr/local/share/bash-completion/bash_completion fi /code/pre
