App will scan available devices on the network to connect select your PC and then you can browse the files select the one you want to stream and thats it  <comment258123> Instead of just dropping the name of an app, can you please explain in more detail on how to set things up both on Windows and iPhone side to make streaming from Windows to iPhone work <comment258127> Once you have installed the App connect your PC and phone on the same network.
