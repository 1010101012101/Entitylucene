Script doesn't find file <body> Suppose codemy_folder/code contains codemy_script/code and codemy_program/code. codemy_script/code tries to run code./my_program -myoptions/code. It works when I codecd/code into the directory, but not when I double click on it.  Here is the output:  precodeCasebashMac:~ chris$ /Users/chris/Programs/synergy-1.3.1\ 2/work_comp_server ; exit; /Users/chris/Programs/synergy-1.3.1 2/work_comp_server: line 1: ./synergys: No such file or directory logout /code/pre  How can I fix this?  <answer2297> "./synergys" is a path relative to the directory which you are currently in. To fix this you will need to specify an absolute path, for example:     /users/chris/Files/synergys   Obviously change it to a path that actually exists :)  Might be overkill, but there is a wikipedia page about paths:  Path_(computing)  <comment1947> Why isn't the script run in the path it resides when I double click? Is there a way to refer to paths relative to the script? <comment1988> Assuming you are using a bash script, this question over at stackoverflow will help you out :) http://stackoverflow.com/questions/59895/can-a-bash-script-tell-what-directory-its-in
