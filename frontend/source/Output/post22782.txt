You have to select "Synch Photos" in iTunes, choose "Selected folders", and leave all folders unchecked, then synch, and choose "Remove" from the pop up dialog. For some reason, just unselecting "Sync Photos" will not delete the photos from your phone.   img src="https://i.imgur.com/xkXVgGH.png" alt="Imgur"  img src="https://i.imgur.com/vJYF6Qg.png" alt="Imgur"  <comment25449> By connecting it to the computer that synced the photos, you simply de-select the items you wish to remove. Am I missing some aspect of your dilemma? <comment82229> I have now read in twenty different places how easy this is but in my case it does not work. Have an iphone 3GS, synced a subdirectory of photos to it. Now I can not detail them on the phone. When I use itunes and uncheck them I can no longer press apply because it thinks the phone is full and wont let me sync. I donâ€™t want to wipe out the phone because I have not had a successful sync. <comment230124> I had same issue and i found solution on youtube, you have to make fake folder to delete synced photos from iPhone ... here how you do in this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRlEO1kMUmI Hope this will help
