Sync / Transfer Spotify Playlist to Apple Music <body> Is it possible to transfer all my Spotify playlist to the new Apple Music?   I have like 10 playlists with more than 5000 songs, I would hate to lose them.   <answer193797> Supposedly, Apple is releasing an API to Apple Music (as evidenced by it's future appearance on Sonos), at which point this type of service will exist. As of now, no luck.  <answer194528> Alright I have found a way online to do it, the article was in Dutch so I will translate it for you all.   strongThings you Need:/strong  ol liMAC, preferred latest version/li liAn TextEditor, if you don't have one get the free TextWrangler/li liCharles Proxy, free to download proxy tool/li liPython 3, download the MAX OS X installer here/li liSpotify2Music script/li /ol  strongThe process:/strong  strongStep 1 - The Setup/strong  Create a folder on your desktop, this will be our working folder. Place the 2 files from the Spotify2Music zip in here.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pbSPx.png" alt="Spotify2Music Folder"  strongStep 2 - Exporting the Playlists/strong  Login into Exportify and extract the playlists you want. You can export the playlist by using the green buttons Export. Once you have done this successfully a window opens containing the CSV file. Select the whole file and create a file spotify.csv and place it in the desktop folder you created in step 1.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2ngnR.png" alt="Exporting playlists"  strongStep 3 - Matching songs/strong  We must match the Spotify songs to Apple Music songs. Open a terminal and cd to the folder on the desktop (see Step 1). By this step you should have installed python 3. While in the Desktop folder type: python3 retrieve-identifiers.py. The script will start working.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/O82Ou.png" alt="Matching songs"  strongStep 4 - Retrieving the cookie from iTunes/strong   We are going to retrieve cookie data from iTunes using Charles Proxy.  ol liFrom the Menu Proxy go to SSL Proxy Settings/li liCheck 'Enable SSL Proxying'/li liClick on add and insert '*itunes.apple.com' /li liIn the same Menu check on 'Mac OS X Proxy'/li liGo to iTunes go to an Apple Music playlist but don't do nothing/li liCheck you have enabled recording (please refer to image below)/li liWhen recording is enabled add the playlist to my Music/li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bfBMD.png" alt="enter image description here" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WE9lV.png" alt="enter image description here"  When Charles is stopped go to to the tabs as shown in the screenshot above. Copy the fields (x-dsid, cookie, x-guid) to TextEdit or Word.   strongStep 5 - Inserting the Cookie data/strong  The 3 data files we have just "stolen" from iTunes need to be inserted into 'insert-song.py'. Open this file with TextWrangler (or equivalent) and go to lines 30,31 and 32. Paste the x-dsid, cookie, x-guid data and save the file. Remember all files must be in the same folder.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/PoxDE.png" alt="enter image description here"  strongStep 6 - Ready to Import!/strong  Open a terminal navigate to the folder from Step 1 typ in 'python3 insert-songs.py' and you are now importing all the (Matched) Spotify to Apple Music.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/XwInN.png" alt="enter image description here"  strongTips and Tricks:/strong  I have made folders like this to enable a quick import of all my playlists. I suggest you do the same. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/y2dU1.png" alt="enter image description here"  If you run into sync problems, check out this post http://www.idigitaltimes.com/apple-music-problems-how-fix-issues-syncing-playlists-icloud-library-offline-455939  strongRemark/strong  Don't over do it! I had all the playlists open in tabs in my terminal and I overflowed the Apple Music buffer. This process takes time so do 1 playlist at a time and go sleep or take a nape or a coffee :)   strongCredits/strong  All credits go to This Post  <answer199600> The Applefy OS X app is pretty straightforward. Only requires OS X and iTunes. Follow the instructions from their README:     ul   liOpen the application and log in with your Spotify details./li   liSelect the playlist you want to transfer from the dropdown list./li   liPress the 'Save Playlist' button./li   liNavigate to your home folder and there will be a folder called Applefy./li   liInside this folder will be a folder with your playlist name containing MP3s./li   liOpen iTunes, go to the Playlists tab and make a new playlist./li   liDrag the MP3 files into the playlist./li   liSelect all and right click. Choose 'Add to iCloud Music Library'/li   liOnce the songs have been registered, right click again and 'Remove download', you can now stream or download the full song using your Apple Music subscription./li   /ul   <answer231354> I used an app called MoveToAppleMusic. It's a paid app but will do the job. It works by capturing the Apple Music session data, then adding the songs to iTunes. It will also double check to see if certain songs are already in iTunes. Pretty painless for the most part. So if you're looking for a solution that's a little less involved than the ones above, consider checking this app out.  <comment232081> Running Charles actually prevents iTunes from authenticating Apple's servers, so before step 4 make sure to navigate to an Apple Music playlist within iTunes (you can't do this while Charles is running). Also, after recording the header attributes and inserting them into the script, quit Charles before running the script (otherwise the script fill fail as well).
