Is there a difference regarding battery between Apple Watch 38 mm and 42 mm? <body> Apple says here the battery power for all Apple Watches no matter which size is up to 18 hours.   But is there a difference regarding battery? The 42mm version has bigger display, maybe also a bigger battery? Is there any difference? I would like to buy the device with the best battery.  <answer266354> Apple used to say that the larger Apple Watch ‘typically experiences longer battery life’ on their Apple Watch battery information page, however they removed this line from the page when the Apple Watch Series 2 was released.  The mAh specifications are as follows:  ul liApple Watch (original) &amp; Apple Watch strongSeries 1, 38mm: 205 mAh/strong (source)/li liApple Watch (original) &amp; Apple Watch strongSeries 1, 42mm: 246 mAh/strong (source)/li liApple Watch strongSeries 2, 38mm: 273 mAh/strong (source)/li liApple Watch strongSeries 2, 42mm: 334 mAh/strong (source)/li /ul  <comment334012> Remember that a larger screen used more battery. <comment334481> Yes. But as long as you do not exaggerate with push 42 mm should still be the better choice. I think most consumption will be app / background activity.
