Seeing current permissions for a file? <body> How can I see the permissions for a file (e.g. if I want to recreate those permissions for another file using codechmod/code)?  For example after I run codechmod 644/code on codefoo.txt/code, what command, if any, can I run on codefoo.txt/code which returns code644/code?  <answer3281> If you type codels -l/code in terminal you get the permission for your file  precodedrwxr-xr-x   7 ---  staff   238 Apr 14  2010 images -rw-r--r--   1 ---  staff  2628 Aug 26  2009 index.html drwxr-xr-x@ 11 ---  staff   374 Feb 28  2010 simplemvc /code/pre  You can use table below to convert coderwxr-xr-x/code to number and vice versa:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MrsIZ.jpg" alt="alt text"  And get more detail here.  <answer3282> The easiest way I'm aware of that will list all permissions, including ACLs, is simply to use the Get Info command from the Finder on the concerned file.  <answer41142> The easiest way to get the octal permissions from the command line is by using codestat(1)/code with a format specifier.   You can read more in the manual page, but the following will give you what you want:     stat -f "%OMp%OLp" em&lt;file or directory&gt;/em   code%OMp/code returns the setuid/setgid/sticky bits in octal and code%OLp/code the user/group/other permissions in octal.  For example:  precode$ ls -ld Data drwxr-xr-x  6 mj  staff  204 20 Feb 11:09 Data $ stat -f "%OMp%OLp" Data    0755 /code/pre  <comment2948> You might want to try at http://unix.stackexchange.com if you don't get any answers here. All I know of is `ls -l foo.txt` which will give you the rwxrwx--- string which you can convert to octal yourself (but I guess you know that already).
