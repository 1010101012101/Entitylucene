Bad Google translate? <comment258714> How do you transfer your photos? <comment258717> Saving the photos by order in Finder? I don't think that's possible as you can order them, but once you select the order operations (name, date, etc) it's hard to put them back in the order again. I suggest sorting them into folders or using the tags that Mac OSX comes with.
