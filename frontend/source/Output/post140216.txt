How long does it take for a review to appear in the App Store? <body> On Friday, I went into the App Store on my iPhone and submitted a review for a game.  I just checked all the reviews for that game, and my review hasn't appeared yet.  About how long does it take for a review to appear in the App Store?  <answer140218> Usually it shouldn't appear immediately since more often than not, your reviews need to be approved before they are published by Apple for all to see.   <comment165264> Also see http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/8508/why-do-iphone-app-store-ratings-and-reviews-seem-to-get-processed-so-slowly <comment165265> I've submitted over 50 reviews and never once has one shown up immediately. <comment165266> @bmike About how long does it take for your reviews to appear? <comment165267> @pacoverflow I'd say between 24 hours and 2 weeks is the range which all that I've cared to check have arrived. <comment165269> @bmike Like i mentioned more often than not they have to go through the approval. But the general time for reviews to appear is 24-48 hours. <comment165322> At least 1 week if you're lucky, at most 4 weeks. But usually around 2 weeks. Just set the launch date 4 weeks ahead if you want a countdown launch without failing like BBM.
