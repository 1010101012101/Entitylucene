Force a link to open in Safari instead of the in-app browser <body> I have an issue with QR Readers. I encode a URL within a QR Code. When read by many iPhone App they will open the URL within a WebView within the app.  I want to open a vCard there, which those internal things just won't do - page stays blank but when opened directly in Safari everything works great.  Here is my example:  ul liIf you visit vcard.nikb.de in Safari it will bring up a VCard/li liIf you scan the QR below (which opens the site mentioned) it won't open.../li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/scB44.png" alt="enter image description here"  So my question is: Is there any way to get out of the WebView and open Safari?  <answer26805> This is not possible, unless the app was designed to explicitly support opening Safari (with a button for instance).  You can't modify an app's internal messaging to its own webviews on stock OS iOS devices, for app security reasons if nothing else.    <answer26862> ol liTry www.qrstuff.com/li liChoose "contact details (vcard)" in the left column. Put in your data and try that QR-code. Shouldn't need to open Safari for that./li /ol  Note: Don't miss the last option, after all the inputs, to link to a vcf-file or input the vcf-data into the qr code as-is. The second option works fine for me.  I hope this solves your problem.  <comment30602> I suggest contacting the developer about adding this functionality. <comment30676> DO you see any possibility make IOS view the VCard from the WebView? <comment30692> Hi - thanks a lot for your answer and your suggestion.  Using a URL QR was a well considerd decision. The resulting Matrix is a lot smaller than one with the whole contact details included. Not only a smaller QR is easier to read for smartphones but also it looks better when printed.  Also the vcfQR wont give me the possibility to store a picture in it does it?
