Increase double-click cursor movement sensitivity <body> (Note: I think this is new in Yosemite, as I never had this problem before updating, but it's possible I just never noticed.)  In Accessibility preferences (formerly Mouse/Trackpad), it is possible to set how much time delay can occur between the two components of a double-click.  It seems OS X also allows a certain amount of cursor movement in this interval (~15 pixels, I think), and I would like to decrease the allowance to about 2 pixels.  Why? I am fairly fast with the mouse, and even at the minimum delay time, sometimes when rapidly clicking several things in a list OS X thinks I'm double-clicking on one item and opens it instead.  If you haven't experienced this, try increasing the delay in Accessibility  Mouse &amp; Trackpad and clicking on two adjacent items in the Finder.  <comment250701> I don't think it has anything to do with distance, just duration between clicks. <comment250712> @user14492 No, distance is definitely a relevant variable. To prove this, decrease the necessary speed in Accessibility, click, move the mouse more than 15 pixels, and click again. That will not register as a double-click. However, if you only move the mouse ~10 pixels, it will register, even if it is done at exactly the same speed.
