My os is OSX 10.11.5 and curl -V result is following :     $ /usr/bin/curl -Vbr   curl 7.43.0 (x86_64-apple-darwin15.0) libcurl/7.43.0 SecureTransport zlib/1.2.5   Protocols: dict file ftp ftps gopher http https imap imaps ldap ldaps pop3 pop3s rtsp smb smbs smtp smtps telnet tftp    Any advice would be appreciated.  <answer249731> Open chromedriver_mac64.zip in your browser. If you see this message:  precode&lt;Error&gt;   &lt;Code&gt;AccessDenied&lt;/Code&gt;   &lt;Message&gt;Access denied.&lt;/Message&gt;   &lt;Details&gt;     We're sorry, but this service is not available in your location   &lt;/Details&gt; &lt;/Error&gt; /code/pre  Then Google is restricting your access. Simply download that file with an alternative network/IP/location. Then move the file to code~/Library/Caches/Homebrew//code or code/Library/Caches/Homebrew//code due to the installation of Homebrew. Then try to reinstall. Homebrew will use downloaded file.  Alternatively you can use a network proxy in the terminal while running codebrew/code command.  <answer290803> Your codecurl/code is using codeSecureTransport/code which is using macOS builtin version of SSL which likely be incapable of outgoing encrypted web communications, instead of OpenSSL.  So try reinstalling codecurl/code via Homebrew with the following options to support OpenSSL:  precodebrew reinstall curl --with-libssh2 --with-openssl /code/pre  supNote: Paste above line into the Terminal./sup  Related: cURL fails with error: Couldn't understand the server certificate format.  <comment310675> It's a regression for root brew: https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/issues/796 <comment329030> Is it still happening? <comment330402> No, I updated brew and problem solved
