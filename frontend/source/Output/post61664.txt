How to install and override Vim in Mountain Lion for +ruby +python support? <body> I want to install and override the current vim version in Mountain Lion due to me needing +ruby &amp; +python support. I am particularly interested in using the brew commands from Homebrew but I haven't seen a current best practice procedure for it (or even a bundled recipe covering vim). I am open to other ways to accomplish buildig +ruby and +python into codevim/code.  <answer61666> Best setup I've seen yet is YADR:  https://github.com/skwp/dotfiles  Uses zsh, ruby, vim, etc all nicely configured, and very customizable.  <answer61682> I would install Homebrew with  precoderuby &lt;(curl -fsSkL raw.github.com/mxcl/homebrew/go) brew install macvim --override-system-vim /code/pre  It has Ruby and Python support and will effectively replace the original Vim without actually deleting it (because the Homebrew one will be in /usr/local). Follow the directions afterward about linking the GUI app to /Applications.  <comment71203> Looks like an awesome setup, but it won't help actually getting a featureful Vim installed. See my answer. <comment71204> Actually, it includes an awful lot of really useful vim packages, add-ons, etc. Totally transformed my use of it. <comment71206> But it won't add Ruby or Python support to a binary that doesn't include it. <comment74105> I haven't used this, but a nice article here seems to scratch the same itch as you mention in your post: http://blog.jerodsanto.net/2011/08/brew-install-vim/
