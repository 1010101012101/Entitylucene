Mac Mini (summer 2011) and Dell U2711 - How to get the maximum resolution 2560x1440? <body> I've been using the Mac Mini with Dell U2711 monitor for couple days and only now I've realized what is wrong: The display isn't using its maximum resolution 2560x1440 but the 1080p which the OS reports as the max resolution. I then read from the Apple's site that for some reason 1080p is the maximum resolution when using the HDMI-connector.  The Mac Mini contains only HDMI and Thunderbolt connectors, at least according to Apple's site. The Dell-monitor doesn't have Thunderbolt but instead it has VGA, DVI, DisplayPort and HDMI.   So my question is: Is it possible to get the maximum resolution out of my monitor?  <answer37747> Only via Thunderbolt.  As you said, Apple's documentation for the Mac mini (Mid 2011) states:     h3Video Support/h3      ul   liThunderbolt port with support for up to 2560-by-1600 resolution/li   liHDMI port with support for up to 1920-by-1200 resolution/li   /ul   It used to be possible with models using a dual-link DVI Adapter which the new models don't support:     Simultaneously supports up to 1920 by 1200 pixels on a DVI or VGA display; up to 2560 by 1600 pixels on a dual-link DVI display using Mini DisplayPort to Dual-Link DVI Adapter.    <answer37766> Thunderbolt contains a DisplayPort channel.  You can get a Thunderbolt/Mini DisplayPort to DisplayPort cable.  I found a cheap one on Monoprice a while back. Here is a 6 footer.  <comment45265> It would be more helpful if you linked to the actual cable you bought from them rather than just the site. <comment45274> *This* is the answer. Thunderbolt uses the same connector as Mini DisplayPort, since they're compatible. MiniDP-to-DP cables are available pretty much everywhere @cksum <comment45275> You're right, cksum. Just added a link. <comment78540> So MiniDP to DVI adapter doesn't work, it must be MiniDP to DisplayPort? <comment78542> Single-link DVI can't drive the monitor at it's native resolution, but Display Port certainly can.
