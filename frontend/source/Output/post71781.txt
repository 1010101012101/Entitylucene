What tools exist to rename (truncate) batches of files in OS X? <body> I get bunches of files I need to rename. The original filenames normally have 7 digits - plus an optional character (or two), followed by a space then a whole string of other characters. I need to rename them to be such that the space and everything after it is replaced by '-z'.   For example: (original filenames)  3543679 ggry Hugh highs Bhutto.jpg  6789456 hfghh hfghh death.eps  8753674a hfryg gyjbff hfghh.png  4686536c Guggenheim.jpg  Would become: (renamed filenames) 3543679-z.jpg  6789456-z.eps  8753674a-z.png  4686536c-z.jpg  Anyone got any ideas how to automate this?  <answer71782> Try running something like this in Terminal:  precodecd ~/Some\ folder for f in *; do mv "$f" "${f/ *./-z.}"; done /code/pre  <answer83750> Yes. you should by the Finder Automator Action pack from Ben Waldie. Here is his link:  http://www.automatedworkflows.com  He designed 20 new actions all just with the Finder (as well as others), and I have it and I can do exactly what you are describing with ease.   <comment83366> I like Lauri's answer below, but personally I would use Name Mangler http://manytricks.com/namemangler/ I think it is easily worth the $10 especially when you take into account the free support that is offered on their mailing list. <comment83441> Am I missing something? I am not real strong at CLI stuff - all I managed to do was end up with a single file called -z.jpg! <comment83445> It works for me with the examples in the question. Do the filenames start with spaces or something? <comment83452> Hey Lauri, sorry - forgot to thank you. Thanks!  Do I cd into the folder contains the files? Then type in the rest? I'll try again tomorrow, it's getting late.
