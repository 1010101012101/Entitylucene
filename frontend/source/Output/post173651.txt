Install OSX on Macbook Air which currently only runs Windows 7 <body> I have a mac book air, which was formatted a long time ago, and only has windows running on it.  I would like to run Mac OS again instead of windows. Or if that isnt possible, have both OS's.  How can I get Mac OS installed on this machine again?  <answer173653> The easiest way is probably to use OS X internet recovery:   ol liPress kbdcmd/kbd+kbdalt/kbd+kbdR/kbd at startup/li liOpen the disk utility from the opening menu/li liReformat the disk to HFS+ Journaled/li liClose disk utility and go to install OS X/li /ol  This procedure will delete all your data and Windows completely.  <comment204350> Though n1000's answer will work - it might just be worth checking by holding Opt at the boot chimes, just to see if any remnant of OS X is still on there. If so you could build from that rather than wipe & start over.
