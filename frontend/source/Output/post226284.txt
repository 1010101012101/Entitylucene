How to unlock broken iPhone 5c? <body> I would like to import photos from an iPhone 5c. When I connect the iPhone to the PC with a USB cable the PC says the iPhone is locked.  I don't know how to unlock it and even if I did, I can't: half of the screen looks like a matrix and the Home button is gone.  I've been using Siri to send texts and make calls but can only do that when the phone is charging.  How can I unlock the iPhone or iCloud?  <answer226308> What do you mean by "I don't know how to unlock it and even if I did, I can't: half of the screen looks like a matrix" ?  Do you mean you actually strongdo know how to unlock it/strong but can't because the screen is damaged? Or do you mean you can't because you've forgotten your passcode? Or do you mean something else?  We may be able to help if you provide full details of your situation and what you've already tried.  For example, have you tried any of the following:  ol liRestarting your device by holding down both the power button and pressing down on where the home button should be for at least 10 secs until the Apple logo appears?/li liDouble tapping on the slider to see what happens?/li liConnecting your device to your computer strongafter/strong launching iTunes?/li liConnecting your device to your computer and strongrunning/strong your photo software to see if you can transfer your photos?/li /ol  Also, is your device set up to use photo stream on iCloud? If so, your photos may already be accessible via iCloud from another device, so you may not need to transfer them from the iPhone.   Please provide as much info as you can.
