Visual english-english dictionary for macOS dictionary app? <body> Does macOS' dictionary app support visual dictionaries? Is there any  English-English visual dictionary available for it?  <comment360401> What do you mean by image support? If possible, be more specific. <comment360402> @N.Cornet Updated. <comment360414> The dictionary app itself seems like it should [support them](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/DictionaryServicesProgGuide/schema/schema.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40006152-CH4-SW1). But I don't think I've ever really seen any 3rd-party dictionaries available for the app, visual or otherwise. <comment360428> @calum_b  there are lots of 3rd party dictionaries, for some time already  http://m10lmac.blogspot.com/2013/01/adding-dictionaries-to-dictionaryapp.html <comment360492> @calum_b Yea, there are 3rd party dictionaries available. Just `brew cask search english-persian-dictionary` for example or head over to dictionaries.io.
