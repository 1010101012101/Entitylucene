Retina display compatible Python IDLE? <body> On my Retina MacBook Pro, the Python IDLE development environment has blurry, non-retina text.  Is there a way I can make the text retina?

According to this bug report on Python.org, it's an issue with the TkInter GUI library, which IDLE apparently makes use of. TkInter in turn is based on Tk, which is a cross-platform GUI toolkit, which means it almost certainly doesn't use the standard OS X text renderer, which is the only way to get "free" Retina text.  As an alternative, perhaps look at ways to make the default python shell or IPython running in Terminal more useful to you?  <answer74512> I'd say segiddins has it almost right, with a couple of slight adjustments that made that solution work perfectly for me:  ol liCopy IDLE.app to the desktop./li liRight-click the copied IDLE.app and select codeShow Package Contents/code./li liOpen codeContents/info.plist/code./li liAdd the following two lines...  code&lt;key&gt;NSHighResolutionCapable&lt;/key&gt;/code  code&lt;true/&gt;/code  ...to the end of the plist file, but before the last two lines (code&lt;/dict&gt;/code code&lt;/plist&gt;/code)./li liSave the plist./li liReplace the original IDLE.app with IDLE.app you just modified./li /ol  <comment79621> Which app is actually experiencing poor resolution? Is there an actual application called "Python"? <comment79623> Yes .......... http://www.python.org <comment79624> What @DanJ is asking is that in the terminal, where python is often run, everything should look fine, because the Terminal app is responsible for rendering text, and is retina compatible. Using python, ruby, perl, anything from the terminal should not make a difference. Are you talking about a Python IDE, or third party terminal app? How about a screenshot demonstrating your problem? <comment79625> Python IDLE. Terminal does not print characters in colors unfortunately, otherwise I would use it rather than IDLE. Ill post a pic in a bit <comment79634> That did not work :( <comment79636> I guess it doesn't use a native text rendered then. <comment79637> What do you mean, Terminal doesn't print color characters? Are you saying you want syntax highlighting? Or colored output? <comment79638> If I clicked on get-info, the option to `open in Low Resolution` is checked and locked !! <comment79639> Is this after you made the change to the plist? <comment79640> Before and after, the setting wont change <comment79641> Darn. sorry, since I dont have a rMBP there isn't much more I can come up with.
