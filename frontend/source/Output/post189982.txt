How to share a Smart Album in Photos App <body> I am using the new Photos app in OSX and would like to share recent photos with the Apple TVs in my house by using Home Sharing.  The photos would be used for the screen saver feature on the Apple TV.  It seems as though the best way to do it is to use a Smart Album and set the Date range.  However, it seems as though Smart Albums cannot be accessed using Home Sharing as they do not appear as an option in the Apple TV screen saver settings.  Does anyone know if it is possible to share Smart Albums using Home Sharing?  <answer221139> did you sort this in the end? It should pop up as an album as any others do. Works for me. I'm doing the same thing as you, but trying to share a smart album on cloud photos.
