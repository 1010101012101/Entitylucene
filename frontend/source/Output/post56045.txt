Is there a keyboard shortcut for Don't Save? <body> One thing I do a lot is kbdCommand ⌘/kbd-kbdTab/kbd over to TextEdit, jot down some notes, and then decide to throw them away.  I can close the window with kbd⌘/kbd-kbdW/kbd, but is there a way to not-save it from just the keyboard?  Escape simply cancels the close. kbd⌘/kbd-kbdD/kbd takes the file-picker to the Desktop (and I thought this used to work, pre-Lion, but maybe I'm just imagining it).  Is there a keyboard shortcut for Don't Save, short of turning on Full Keyboard Access?  <answer56047> The default shortcut was changed to ⌘⌫ on Lion.  You can change it back to ⌘D with codedefaults write -g NSSavePanelStandardDesktopShortcutOnly -bool true/code. It won't affect some applications like TextEdit though.  <comment64336> Great!  Can I ask how you knew this? <comment64338> It's been mentioned here and on other websites multiple times. <comment64391> It did exist pre-Lion; you aren't imagining it. <comment64399> It's listed in [Apple's big list of keyboard shortcuts (aka KB #HT1343)](http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1343). <comment273118> _"Command-Delete: Select Delete or Don't Save in a dialog that contains a Delete or Don't Save button"_ (from the previous link). I just tested ⌘⌫ on OS X Yosemite with Atom and it works too, so it may be generalized to other OS X versions and apps too!
