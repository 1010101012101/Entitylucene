Macbook Air screen drawing suddenly slow <body> This has been going on for a week or 2. Restarting seems to help because WindowServer is blowing up. But the problem keeps coming back.  Specs:  ul liMacbook Air mid-2012, 8GB RAM, 2ghz i7/li liYosemite 10.10.5/li liChrome 49/li /ul  Some symptoms that recently popped up:  ul liPage scrolling in Chrome is laggy. Turning off GPU acceleration in Chrome fixes the problem/li liTyping this question in Chrome is laggy as it updates the preview text below/li liSwitching tabs in Chrome is laggy/li liPage scrolling in Safari is not laggy/li liSwitching applications in OSX (command+tab) is laggy/li liWindowServer likes to consume CPU (mostly solved by disabling Little Snitch menu bar, but it's still using decent CPU from time to time)/li liActivity Monitor says that WindowServer is currently using 35GB memory. (!?)/li /ul  CPU usage is generally low and memory usage is currently 7GB.  <comment281007> WindowServer & overall memory usage would be a concern, but I had something similar on Yosemite which never went away until I updated to El Capitan - http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/198963/typing-lag-on-se-sites-safari <comment281176> Anything logging many mesaages per second? Check your console (All Messages) to find out. <comment281191> I'm confused what "memory usage" is. You say 35 GB and then you say 7 GB total. Are you looking for guidance using activity monitor/top/memory pressure? Or is this more about how to make a new user account and troubleshoot preferences and extensions/plug in?
