No weather information in Yosemite Notification Center <body> First off I know there's a Weather widget in Today view which is working fine for me. What I am referring to is the weather information that shows up right on top under the big date section for some users as below:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/piV5m.png" alt="enter image description here"  Whereas my Today View looks like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GIoh7.png" alt="enter image description here"  What gives?  Edit: For what it's worth, here's what my Location Services pane looks like:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/SRA3m.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer154202> Check that you have allowed weather to access your current location.   In System Preference - Security &amp; Privacy - Privacy tab - Location Services  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/TByUl.png" alt="system preference screenshot"  <answer155511> ol liTry to switch off and on again the weather-location mode./li liDisable and enable again "Today" item in your notifications./li liRestart your system./li /ol  It helps to me.  <answer155521> I had the same problem and this fixed it:  ol liOpen Notification Center/li liClick the grey Edit button at the very bottom/li liClick the red minus icon (-) next to Today to remove it/li liClick the green plus icon (+) next to Today Summary to add it back/li /ol  Once I added it back, the weather summary popped up.  <answer169174> Is your Wi-Fi turned off? I had the same problem, and realized that it was because my Mac couldn't find my location since Wi-Fi was turned off (I was connected via Ethernet and this Mac does not have a GPS chip).  When I switched Wi-Fi on, it immediately started working  <comment181467> Thanks for your response but that doesn't help unfortunately. My Location Services does show a check mark against Weather but it doesn't have that black icon next to it. Not sure how to force it to request location. Please see the screenshot updated in the question. <comment182935> Thanks for your advice and sorry for being a tad lost here but how exactly do you disable/enable "Today" item in Notification Center? <comment183056> Just try that @daGUY offered below. Even noticed that I had the same problem today. It repeated permanently. I think that it's system problem, maybe Apple will fix it in previous uptake. Also I have [this](http://apple.stackexchange.com/review/suggested-edits/81324) trouble in notifications with weather app. <comment183074> Just tried it with no success. But thanks for your efforts anyway. <comment201464> Mine doesn't show weather at all in location services, and it shows no locations in the notification centre. Maps works fine.
