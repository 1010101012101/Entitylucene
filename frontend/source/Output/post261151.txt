Mac Mini absolutely fails to detect display <body> I know this is a very common issue and I have read SEVERAL threads on how to solve this but NONE of them seem to work for me.  I am using a Mac Mini (late 2014) and a ThinkVision Pro 2840M external monitor. The external monitor has DP as well as HDMI support. It works perfectly well when using HDMI. The Mac Mini fails to output to the DP. This is at startup. So, I end up getting a blank screen when using DP. To workaround this, I have to do the following:  Boot Mac using HDMI Then plug the DP into Mac Mini Remove the HDMI cable Doing this, the Mac outputs using DP. But, then, again, when I restart the Mac Mini, it's back to square one and it fails to output via the DP. At this point, I have to plug the HDMI AND RESTART, because it does not automatically output to HDMI either.  So, the issue is right from the startup, DP is not detected, but post startup, there is a workaround to get DP detected. Another thing to note, when using DP at the startup, it can output the Recovery Mode BUT CANNOT OUTPUT the desktop.  This is quite weird, and I have tried formatting the OS, and it has been present on all versions of OS, right upto Sierra. I have also tried switching between DP version 1.1 and 1.2 that does not help either.
