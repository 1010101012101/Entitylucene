Any way to Speed up OS X Screen Sharing <body> For a fair amount of time I used to use LogMeIn for remote logging in but their prices are becoming to expensive lately with the Canadian dollar for it to be worth it for me.  So I decided to give the built in Screen Sharing a try. It was a quick setup and am accessing it remotely from a Windows machine using VNC viewer but my internet connection appears to be a huge bottle neck.  In VNC Viewer I only have a few options for quality, it is currently set to 'Best Compression' (8 colors) and I could do with much worse quality.  With Logmein It was possible to go even further with black/white, which would be fine with me as well. Is there any way to do this with the built in Screen sharing?  Any other suggestions to speed up the experience?  EDIT - Specs:  ul li15in rMBP(2013?) running OS X Sierra/li liUsing VNC Viewer on Windows 7 to access it/li /ul  <comment318613> Please add what version of VNC Viewer and Windows you are using to your question. <comment318614> @tubedogg Done! Sorry about that <comment318636> You can set it lower on your VNC client. If your current client doesn't allow that, try a different one.
