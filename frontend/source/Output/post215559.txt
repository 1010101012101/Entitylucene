Where can I find Logic Pro X essential content from a web browser? <body> I have got Logic Pro X on my Mac, however when I open it I am welcomed by this screen: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yQfoT.png" alt="Time isn&#39;t really 10 seconds..."  I got the same thing with GarageBand  My Question  Is it possible to download this from the internet anywhere maybe from the apple website  <comment260395> Are you not already downloading it - according to your posted picture? <comment260398> @Tetsujin Yes but I prefer downloading it on another computer with faster internet connection. It isn't a mac so I was planning on moving using a USB. *BTW the download later changed to 26 hours* <comment260401> Years ago, when you used to have to buy the content separately, you could download it direct. Since they rolled it into the app, that's your method. No way to get it on a Windows machine. <comment260403> @Tetsujin :( I will have to wait then...
