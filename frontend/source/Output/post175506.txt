Can't delete files from remote Buffalo drive, "Permission Denied" <body> There are several files on a remote Buffalo drive that I can't delete. I'm using a Mac (OSX 10.9.5) and Finder reports the drive's filesystem as "SMB (NTFS)".  I have tried from the GUI and from Terminal, but I always get "Permission Denied":  pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"codeWeb$ rm -f LigatureSymbols-2.11.eot rm: LigatureSymbols-2.11.eot: Permission denied /code/pre  Even with "sudo":  pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"codeWeb$ sudo rm -f LigatureSymbols-2.11.eot  Password: rm: LigatureSymbols-2.11.eot: Permission denied /code/pre  Here is a directory listing:  pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"code-rwxrwxrwx  1 Web  staff    4096 Jun 26  2014 ._LigatureSymbols-2.11.eot -rwxrwxrwx  1 Web  staff    4096 Jun 26  2014 ._LigatureSymbols-2.11.otf -rwxrwxrwx  1 Web  staff    4096 Jun 26  2014 ._LigatureSymbols-2.11.svg -rwxrwxrwx  1 Web  staff    4096 Jun 26  2014 ._LigatureSymbols-2.11.ttf -rwxrwxrwx  1 Web  staff    4096 Jun 26  2014 ._LigatureSymbols-2.11.woff -rwxrwxrwx@ 1 Web  staff   83542 Jan 30  2013 LigatureSymbols-2.11.eot -rwxrwxrwx@ 1 Web  staff   82468 Jan 30  2013 LigatureSymbols-2.11.otf -rwxrwxrwx@ 1 Web  staff  201950 Jan 30  2013 LigatureSymbols-2.11.svg -rwxrwxrwx@ 1 Web  staff   83340 Jan 30  2013 LigatureSymbols-2.11.ttf -rwxrwxrwx@ 1 Web  staff   62636 Jan 30  2013 LigatureSymbols-2.11.woff drwxrwxrwx  2 Web  staff   16384 Mar  5 08:59 _notes /code/pre  I am logged in as "Web", so it seems that I am the owner. It also seems that I have full permission (read, write, execute).  I tried looking for flags (such as "immutable") that might prevent deletion, but there don't seem to be any:  pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"codeWeb$ ls -leO -rwxrwxrwx@ 1 Web  staff  -  83542 Jan 30  2013 LigatureSymbols-2.11.eot -rwxrwxrwx@ 1 Web  staff  -  82468 Jan 30  2013 LigatureSymbols-2.11.otf -rwxrwxrwx@ 1 Web  staff  - 201950 Jan 30  2013 LigatureSymbols-2.11.svg -rwxrwxrwx@ 1 Web  staff  -  83340 Jan 30  2013 LigatureSymbols-2.11.ttf -rwxrwxrwx@ 1 Web  staff  -  62636 Jan 30  2013 LigatureSymbols-2.11.woff drwxrwxrwx  2 Web  staff  -  16384 Mar  5 08:59 _notes /code/pre  I tried removing the "immutable" flag, even though it doesn't seem to be set, but to no avail:  pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"codeWeb$ chflags nouchg LigatureSymbols-2.11.eot Web$ rm -f LigatureSymbols-2.11.eot rm: LigatureSymbols-2.11.eot: Permission denied /code/pre  I notice some "extended attributes" (@) on the files, but nothing that would obviously prevent deletion:  pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"codecom.apple.ResourceFork     286  com.apple.quarantine        42  com.apple.metadata:kMDItemWhereFroms       137 /code/pre  And I can't seem to remove these attributes either:  pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"codeWeb$ xattr -c LigatureSymbols-2.11.eot xattr: [Errno 13] Permission denied: 'LigatureSymbols-2.11.eot' /code/pre  Not even with "sudo":  pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"codeWeb$ sudo xattr -c LigatureSymbols-2.11.eot Password: xattr: [Errno 13] Permission denied: 'LigatureSymbols-2.11.eot' /code/pre  How can I remove these files from the drive?  hr  Edit: Is there any tool or method to "force delete" files without regard for permission?  <comment206974> Is it possible that the "Web" user is not the same "Web" user to which I'm logged in? Could it be a different (non non-existent) user that had the same name? <comment206976> `sudo` should take care of that. But as the files are not local: did you restart the Buffalo drive? <comment206981> Have you tried taking ownership of the files first? <comment206983> @patrix Thanks for the suggestion. I just restarted the drive and I still get "permission denied" when trying to delete those files. <comment206985> @Hefewe1zen I am logged in as "Web", which appears to be the owner of the files. Could I be mistaken? <comment206986> Have you tried mounting the drive using cifs:// instead of smb:// <comment206987> @Hefewe1zen How do I do that? I tried connecting to `cifs://path-to-the-drive/` and Finder now reports the filesystem as "SMB (Other)". I am still unable to delete the files.
