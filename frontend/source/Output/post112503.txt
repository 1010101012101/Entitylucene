Why are certain games only available on iPad? <body> I recently bought a 5th generation iPod touch. I searched for "Magic 2014" but was greeted with the message:  "Magic 2014 is only available on Apple iPad".  Why are certain games iPad only?  <answer112504> The most simple answer probably is embecause the developer decided accordingly/em. There might be several more specific reasons, the most relevant is probably that some games just need a bigger screen and/or it's too cumbersome to maintain two GUI versions in parallel.
