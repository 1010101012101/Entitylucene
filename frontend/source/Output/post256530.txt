How to save data from broken GPT, GUID and unmountable, no type volumes? <body> I have a Macbook Pro mid 2012 and 750GB hard drive. I tried to delete Windows partition on the hard disk and now I can't access my main Mac partition (disk index 2) anymore. It shows something like "FFFFFFFF-FFFF-FFFF-FFFF-FFFFFFFFFFFF" and I don't even know what it is.  I don't want to format/delete this partition because it has important files. The main Mac partition had FileVault enabled and this is the output from sudo gpt -r show disk0  precode start        size  index  contents            0           1         PMBR            1           1         Pri GPT header            2          32         Pri GPT table           34           6                    40      409600      1  GPT part - C12A7328-F81F-11D2-BA4B-00A0C93EC93B       409640  1167843728      2  GPT part - FFFFFFFF-FFFF-FFFF-FFFF-FFFFFFFFFFFF   1168253368        1608            1168254976   126689280      3  GPT part - 48465300-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC   1294944256      262144            1295206400   168673192      4  GPT part - 53746F72-6167-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC   1463879592     1269536      5  GPT part - 426F6F74-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC   1465149128           7            1465149135          32         Sec GPT table   1465149167           1         Sec GPT header /code/pre  I appreciate any help or suggestions!   <answer263930> I deleted from the MAC-Disk utility window. No, I am not trying to boot into OS X or trying to mount the disk from another system. I am just trying to save my files from that partition.  Here are the screens:   strongdiskutil list/strong  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/f7VF9.png" alt="**diskutil list**" strongdiskutil cs list/strong  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uTeOg.png" alt="diskutil cs list" Thanks!  <comment322170> How exactly did you delete this partition? What do you mean "I can't access my main Mac partition"? Are you trying to boot into OS X or trying to mount the disk from another system? What do `diskutil list` and `diskutil cs list`  show? <comment330696> The history of the disk (or partition table) seems to be incomplete. You write: you had a filevault enabled partition and a Windows partition. Now we see an unknown partition (disk0s2) and an non-encrypted CoreStorage partition (disk0s4). The partition table doesn't show much free space (300 MiB) so you either reclaimed the ex-Windows partition to add/install another OS X partition or disk0s2 was the Windows partition (which would be a **very** uncommon set-up). <comment330698> The history of the disk (or partition table) seems to be incomplete. You wrote in your question (if you are the same memyana): you had a filevault enabled partition and a Windows partition. Now we see an unknown partition (disk0s2) and an non-encrypted CoreStorage partition (disk0s4).

Please don't use multiple memyana accounts - that's confusing! Ask a mod to join them!
