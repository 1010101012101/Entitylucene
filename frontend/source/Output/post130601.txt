Macbook Pro 13" 2011, Samsung Galaxy S3's Headset Mic not working <body> My macbook's internal mic stopped working. I plugged in the headset I got with Samsung Galaxy S3, into the mac. I can hear the audio in earphone but the headset mic is not working. What steps can I take to make the the headset mic work along the macbook?  <answer130604> You will need a Apple special plug for the Microphone to work.  It needs to look like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zC2gR.png" alt="plug"  If it is 4 rings kind, then check you System Preference - Sound setting and select the external microphone as input source.  Final check--the pin out:  The original TRRS configuration was created by Nokia and has a pinout of Left Audio, Right Audio, Mic, Ground.  Apple came along and changed their pinout to Left Audio, Right Audio, Ground, Mic.  You could go about trying to find a jack converter that switches the Ground a Pin for your Samsung headset.
