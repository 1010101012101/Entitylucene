Numbers: How Can I Make Rows and Columns Smaller than 9 Points? <body> I am making a grid-like diagram (for table seats at a party) using a Numbers table. Some cells are considerable wide and hold the names of the guests. But I need to make some of the rows and columns very narrow, to use them as margins (gutters?) between the cells that have actual content.  strongHowever/strong, I can't set either row height or column width to less than 9 points. I've searched everywhere, but can't find a way to override this minimum. Lowering the text size of the rows and columns to the minimum allowed of 1 pt didn't help either.     <comment303017> I've tried to do it too and it appears the minimum values are hard coded and therefore cannot be set lower. <comment306499> Have you an example of what the desired output would look like?  Perhaps cell text formatting such as using Indents or Text Inset?
