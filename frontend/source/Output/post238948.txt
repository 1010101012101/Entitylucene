OSX: how to add a right click option in folder to open the folder with an application like VS Code? <body> Is it possible to add a service in a folder to open it with a specific application?  As shown in given below screen shot an application named codeever note/code has done this. I want to do it manually for #VSCODE and #Brackets  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KCit3.png" alt="enter image description here"  strongEDIT/strong  As my question has been marked unclear so I am trying to elaborate with an example.  Let's take VSCode for an example. It is a text editor that opens a folder in it and allows an user to edit the text files in the folder and the folder's subfolders. There are so many other applications are there in the market like Sublime, Adobe Brackets and so on.  The Folder hierarchy look like this (screenshot below)  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dv4jp.png" alt="enter image description here"  In order open the folder in the app I have to open the app then go to open folder option then find the folder then select and click on open button  In stead of this I want an option in the right click of the folder to open the folder directly with the text editor.  emJust like you can open a folder in terminal by adding a service/em  <answer238951> Here there's a guide that you may use to create an application that will open your favorite applications, as well as any folders you may use frequently, so you can get to work (or play) with just a single click. Maybe it may fit your requirements :)  hr     This workflow is used to launch Microsoft Word, Adobe Photoshop, and   Apple's Preview application. The workflow also launches Safari and   opens the About: Macs home page. It also opens a folder in the Finder.   You could customise it as you wish.      strongCreate the Workflow/strong      ol   liLaunch Automator, located at /Applications./li   liSelect 'Application' as the type of Automator template to use./li   liIn the Library list, select 'Files &amp; Folders.'/li   liDrag the 'Get Specified Finder Items' action to the workflow panel on the right./li   liClick the Add button to add an application or a folder to the list of Finder Items./li   liClick the Add button to add other items to the list, until all the items you need for your workflow are present. Don't include your   default browser (in my case, Safari) in the list of Finder items. We   will choose another workflow step to launch the browser to a specific   URL./li   liFrom the Library pane, drag the 'Open Finder Items' to the workflow pane, below the previous action./li   /ol      strongWorking with URLs in Automatorâ€‹/strong      This completes the part of the workflow that will open applications   and folders. If you want your browser to open to a specific URL, do   the following:      ol   liIn the Library pane, select Internet./li   liDrag the 'Get Specified URLs' action to the workflow panel, below the previous action./li   liWhen you add the 'Get Specified URLs' action, it includes Apple's home page as a URL to open. Select the Apple URL and click the Remove   button./li   liClick the Add button. A new item will be added to the URL list./li   liDouble-click in the Address field of the item you just added and change the URL to the one you wish to open./li   liRepeat the above steps for each additional URL you wish to open automatically./li   liFrom the Library pane, drag the 'Display Webpages' action to the workflow pane, below the previous action./li   /ol      strongTesting the Workflow/strong      Once you finish creating your workflow, you can test it to ensure it   functions correctly by clicking the Run button in the top right   corner.      Because we're creating an application, Automator will issue a warning   that 'This application will not receive input when run inside   Automator.' You can safely ignore this warning by clicking the OK   button.      Automator will then run the workflow. Check to be sure that all of the   applications opened, as well as any folders you may have included. If   you wanted to open your browser to a specific page, make sure the   correct page loaded.      strongSave the Workflow/strong      Once you've confirmed that the workflow works as expected, you can   save it as an application by clicking Automator's File menu and   selecting 'Save.' Enter a name and target location for your workflow   application and click Save. Follow the above process to create   additional workflows, if desired.      strongUsing the Workflow/strong      In the previous step, you created a workflow application; now it's   time to use it. The application you created works the same as any   other Mac application, so you need only double-click the application   to run it.      Because it works just like any other Mac application, you can also   click and drag the workflow application to the Dock, or to a Finder   window's sidebar or toolbar, for easy access.   <answer239049> You can do this with an strongAutomator Service/strong.  strongCreate the Service:/strong  ol liOpen strongAutomator/strong and select strongService/strong or strongFile/strong  strongNew/strong  strongService/strong If strongAutomator/strong is already open./li liSet strongService receives selected/strong to strongfiles or folders/strong and strongin/strong to strongFinder/strong./li liAdd a strongRun Shell Script/strong emAction/em, setting strongShell:/strong to strong/bin/bash/strong and strongPass input:/strong to strongas arguments/strong and add the following emcode/em:/li /ol  hr  precodefor f in "$@"; do     open -a 'Visual Studio Code' "$f" done /code/pre  hr  ol start="4" liSave the strongService/strong as strongOpen in Visual Studio Code/strong./li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rgAnY.png" alt="enter image description here"  ol start="5" liClose strongAutomator/strong./li /ol  You can now select strongFiles/strong and or strongFolders/strong in strongFinder/strong and then emcontrol-click (right-click)/em on them and select strongOpen in Visual Studio Code/strong from the strongServices/strong Context Menu.  Note: I tested this with strongVisual Studio Code/strong but not with strongBrackets/strong as I don't have it installed. However you should be able to create one for it too in the same manner while substituting the application's name in the codeopen/code command.  <answer262163> Here is an alternative solution: instead of using the right-click menu, you could open the folder from the finder toolbar! img src="https://github.com/hamxiaoz/open-folder-with-vs-code/raw/master/demo.gif" alt=""  Please see my repo here: open-folder-with-vs-code  <comment293117> You already can right click on a file shown in a Finder application window and open with either the default application for a different application. What do you want the service to do different? <comment293118> Actually, I do not get it. How does it will add the option in the context of a folder  to open the folder with an app? <comment293119> @DavidAnderson I need to open `folder` itself with an application not an `file`. <comment293188> What do you expect to happen if a folder is "opened" by an application? Which application are you talking about specifically? <comment293207> I am talking about applications like VSCode and adobe bracket. @patrix i have even mentioned them in my question. I am a web developer and needs to open folders in these sort of text editors <comment293228> I'd vote to re-open, except that the clarification really makes it a 'coding' question, for Stack Overflow, rather than here.
