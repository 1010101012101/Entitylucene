How to change all dates on file and preserve them during file move? <body> I would like to change all dates on a file [all four reported by codestat/code command]. I cannot find a way to change the "inode last changed" date. I've tried:  precodetouch -t SetFile -d SetFile -m /code/pre  but this single date remains unchanged.  Also, is there any way to move file between directories and leave all of the dates intact? I am moving whole directories, with lots of files inside, so I would prefer to have a single command to do so, if not - I will read the date upfront and set it after the move.  <answer198943> You cannot controlcodectime/code.codectime/code is set with the creation of the codeinode/code. codectime/code changes to the codemtime/code when you modify a file. codectime/code is set to the current date and time when you modify the codeinode metadata/code, such as changing codemtime/code, file permissions, or renaming a file.   The closest you can come to matching codeatime/code,codemtime/code, and codectime/code would be tocodetouch/code a file which will set all three to the current date and time. But at anytime codectime/code may change, even OS X applications can cause changes to the codeinode metadata/code without changing the content of a file.  codebtime/code or codebirthtime/code will not change when moving files on the same filesystem.  Tools that support preserving file metadata are codeditto/code, codepax/code, and codecp/code with the p option. None of these tools support preserving codebirthtime/code across filesystems.
