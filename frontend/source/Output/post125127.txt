How to get a list of application windows only from the current desktop with applescript? <body> Need to do something like the next  precodetell application "Safari" activate     set AllWindows to every window     set WinCount to number of items in AllWindows      repeat with i from 1 to WinCount         set this_window to item i of AllWindows         -- do something with the this_window     end repeat end tell /code/pre  The abowe work ok, and getting ALL opened opened Safari window.  How can get the windows only from the curent desktop? So need somewhat change the line  precode    set AllWindows to every window /code/pre  to something like  precode    set AllWindows to ONLY FROM THE CURRENT desktop windows :) /code/pre  Any idea?  <answer125250> System Events only includes windows in the current space / desktop:  pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"codetell application "System Events" to windows of process "Safari" /code/pre  I don't know any way to convert a System Events window object to a Safari window object though, apart from hacks like this:  pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"codetell application "System Events" to tell window 1 of process "Safari"     set {x, y} to position     set {w, h} to size     set b to {x, y, x + w, y + h}     set t to title end tell tell application "Safari"     set found to missing value     repeat with w in windows         if bounds of w is b and name of w is t then             set found to w             exit repeat         end if     end repeat     found end tell /code/pre  codetell application "System Events" to value of attribute "AXIdentifier" of window 1 of process "Safari"/code does not correspond to codetell application "Safari" to id of window 1/code.  <comment146434> What do you mean by *current space*? <comment146448> @Robuust space = desktop. I have 9. Current = the active one.(actually displayed). The "space" term comes from an old application, when the "multiple desktops" aren't built into the OS X... Edited the question. See the tag "spaces".
