Copy menu is greyed out in Microsoft Word <body> I'm running Word for Mac 2011 and the Copy menu is greyed out. Command-C works. This is on OS X 10.11 El Capitan. My mother-in-law has the same problem and she's on 10.9 Mavericks (I think).  <answer219523> Solved it. Go to:  View  Toolbars  Customize Toolbars and Menus...  Click on Menu Bar row and select Reset  Quit Word and relaunch  <comment373057> This worked for me... but... why? <comment373278> That is a very good question! No idea...
