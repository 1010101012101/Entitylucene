External storage device formating error? <body> Trying to repair an external storage device in Disk Utility I first clicked "Verify Disk..." and then "Repair Disk..." but i got the below error:     Verify and Repair volume “disk3s2”br   Repairing file system.br   ** /dev/rdisk3s2br   Invalid BS_jmpBoot in boot block: cc4542br   File system check exit code is 8.br   Updating boot support partitions for the volume as required.br   Error: Disk Utility can’t repair this disk. Back up as many of your files as possible, reformat the disk, and restore your backed-up files.   How do I solve the problem?  Specs: OS X Yosemite 10.10.5  <answer251097> You could easily wipe the drive and start fresh - use care that disk 3 is really the disk you wish to erase everything.  precodediskutil eraseDisk JHFS+ UntitledUFS disk3 /code/pre  If that fails, you likely have a hardware error (unless the failure is your OS or not using an account with codesudo/code permissions). If that succeeds, you could then use Disk Utility to rename things as you please or learn more about codediskutil/code and use it to rename / repartition / reformat the drive going forward.  <comment312040> Please add the output of `sudo gpt -r show disk3` (or the respective disk identifier of the external drive) entered in Terminal.app to your question by editing it in! <comment312051> Reading the question I'd assume that the disk/volume holds some data/content **and** the OP has **no**  backup. This is no good advice without mentioning that the data is gone after executing the above command. <comment312052> it was a bootable drive ,,previously ..., i dont want the data in the drive ..and what is this line of error ......---- Invalid BS_jmpBoot in boot block: cc4542
