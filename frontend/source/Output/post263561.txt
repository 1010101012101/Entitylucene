Is there a way to see a calendar in Photos? <body> I want to click on Dec 25th 2014 and see all the photos I took that day. I thought there used to be a calendar in iPhotos, was that removed in Photos on macOS?   <answer263680> It doesn't look like the calendar made it into Sierra.  However, there are other ways to search for photos using specific keywords.  From this Apple Support page, you can either use Siri or Search to find photos taken on a specific day, at a specific location, or with specific people:     For information about how to search using keywords assigned to photos,   see Find photos by   keyword.      strongAsk Siri/strong. Say something like:      ul   li“Show me photos of California”/li   li“Show me photos from April”/li   li“Show me beach photos”/li   li“Show me vacation photos”/li   li“Show me photos of Becky”/li   /ul      strongUse the built-in Search Box in Photos:/strong      ol   liClick the search field in the toolbar./li   liType the search text in the search field./li   /ol      As you type, suggested searches appear below the search field. You can   type multiple words separated by a space to search based on multiple   criteria. For example, entering “California March” locates all photos   in “California” taken in “March.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/JxcRr.png" alt="Blockquote"      ol start="3"   liClick an item in the suggested searches to see matching photos./li   /ol   <comment330276> On which device, Mac or iOS? <comment330356> @Peter macOS. thanks
