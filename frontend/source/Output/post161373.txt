Yosemite won't empty trash <body> Re: Yosemite does not like emptying the trash  So I'm not tech savvy but am having this very same problem with the trash after upgrading to Yosemite. I typed codelsof +D ~/.Trash/code and this is what I got  precodeCOMMAND PID USER FD TYPE DEVICE SIZE/OFF NODE NAME UserEvent 699 romaabraham 11r DIR 1,2 68 35694329 /Users/romaabraham/.Trash /code/pre  I am not sure what to do next.  <answer161374> I infrequently have an issue where something is locking whatever item is in the Trash.  I reboot, and 10 times out of 10, I'm able to empty it.  For example, I save a screenshot to my desktop, then send it as a Mail.app attachment.  Once the mail is sent, I try to Trash and empty the screenshot.  I am unabvle to do so until I quit Mail and empty Trash.
