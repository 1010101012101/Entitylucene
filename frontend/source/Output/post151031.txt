iMac won't restart after upgrade to Yosemite <body> Just made the upgrade to Yosemite but now my iMac wont restart or shut down. Whenever I try to do any of these it stays on a black screen with a mouse pointer, and I have to turn it off and back on manually.  Any help?  <answer151047> Mine was showing a black screen after I updated my iMac to Yosemite.  I unplugged my USB mouse and the new Login screen was displayed.  No restart was necessary.  <comment177682> Can you describe your problem with more details please? Are you inside Yosemite? And then you click on the Apple-Icon and Shut your Mac down? Which iMac do you have? <comment177697> did you try any of the start ups like Safe mode....and you made a USB? <comment283993> @miro  What is your System Model  ?
