Switching between Apps on Guest MacOS, on MacBook Air (MacOS Sierra like Host), Virtualbox <body> I have both strongMacOS Sierra 10.12/strong for Host and for Guest using strongVirtualBox 5.1.10/strong  I want to know how switch between applications on MacOS guest Side.  kbdCmd/kbd + kbdTab/kbd On Guest Side, but is taken like Host Side, and change Guest to another application opened Host Side.  How can I configure.  I have strongWindows 10/strong and strongCentOS 7/strong like Guest too, and they works perfectly with kbdAlt/kbd + kbdTab/kbd, but for MacOS guest I can't find.  How configure combination for MacOS Guest and another combination for MacOS Host, to switch between their opened applications respectively?  Thank you.  <comment340810> Could you rephrase this? I'm not sure I understand the question. <comment340811> Oh my English is confused! <comment340927> I think what the OP is saying is that when they're in the _guest_ version of MacOS Sierra and they use the Cmd + Tab Keyboard shortcut, instead of the shortcut cycling through the apps running **within** the MacOS Sierra 'guest', the shortcut is cycling through the apps open in the MacOS Sierra _host_. And, while this is happening, the guest version of MacOS Sierra is being treated as just another app running on the host. <comment341055> Thank you, OP what means?
