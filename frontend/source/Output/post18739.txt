Can Aperture auto-delete photos after import from an iPhone <body> I'm trying out Aperture to see whether I should upgrade from iPhoto. I take a lot of photos on my iPhone and have always imported, emthen deleted/em these using iPhoto. After importing photos from my photo with Aperture I didn't get an option to delete the originals from the phone. Am I missing a config option somewhere, or does Aperture not offer this functionality?   <answer19844> Aperture does not seem to offer this functionality for the iPhone. So after importing it does not give you the option.
