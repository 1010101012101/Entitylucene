Where is nmblookup in Lion? <body> I'm trying to call nmblookup in a Terminal on Lion, but it's not available. How can I lookup NMB hostnames from the Terminal now?  <answer24978> run the following command:   precodewhich nmblookup /code/pre  It should output the following:   precode-bash-3.2$ which nmblookup /usr/bin/nmblookup /code/pre  This is on 10.6.8  <answer24983> The codenmblookup/code utility should be in code/usr/bin/code.  Check your $PATH to see if it has been included by typing codeecho $PATH/code at the system prompt.  If it does exist in your path, then you can run the command codewhich nmblookup/code, as suggested by @Lyken.  Otherwise, to find a command that is not located in your path, type the following commands at the system prompt.  precodecd / find . -name "&lt;name&gt;" -print /code/pre  There is also the codewhereis/code command, however, this only checks the standard binary directories for the specified program.  The alternative to codenmblookup/code is codenslookup/code.  This is also located under code/usr/bin/code.  Note that I am running Snow Leopard 10.6.8.  <answer24987> Samba is no more part of OS X: Lion has an own implementation of the protocol. It was dropped because Samba moved to a stricter license (GPLv3) which gives Apple problems with the publication of the software on the App Store.  strongEdit/strong  Here you can find some more information: http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/11/03/23/inside_mac_os_x_10_7_lion_server_apple_replaces_samba_for_windows_networking_services.html  codenmblookup/code was removed along many other command line tools:     [...]reducing the number of commands and subcommands from over a   hundred to just 19[...]   Thanks to cksum for the hint  As Ingmar answers you can use codesmbutil lookup/code  <answer25017> On OS X 10.7 (Lion):  precodesmbutil lookup &lt;hostname&gt; /code/pre  Example:  precode$ smbutil lookup NAS1 Got response from 10.21.0.133 IP address of NAS1: 10.21.0.133 /code/pre  <answer79296> If you must have nmblookup you may install samba3 via MacPorts and probably brew, I don't use brew so I'm not completely sure.  <comment28123> It should be in /usr/bin.  At least, it is on my system.  If you want to look for something that is not set up in your path, you can `cd` to the root directory, and type the following command: `find . -name "name" -print` <comment28128> Just an aside, I am running Lion (10.7.1) and it does not contain this utility. <comment28129> Note that the `which` command will only work if the command can be found in the user's $PATH.  In this case, it is pretty unusual why /usr/bin has not been added to the user's path. <comment28130> P.S. An alternative utility is `nslookup`. <comment28131> Really sorry. I was such in a rush that I indicated that I was using Snow Leopard, but I'm using Lion. My apologies. And as cksum said above, I can't find the utility. "bash: /usr/bin/nmblookup: No such file or directory" <comment28132> Well, that explains why you couldn't find it in your path.  As I mentioned earlier, I think a viable alternative is `nslookup`.  I believe that this should be included with Lion as it is a standard utility across most platforms. <comment28133> Absolutely right. Here's more on the subject if you'd like to incorporate it into your answer (it talks of Lion Server, but it should also apple to the consumer version of Lion): http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/11/03/23/inside_mac_os_x_10_7_lion_server_apple_replaces_samba_for_windows_networking_services.html <comment28165> nslookup/dig/host are looking up DNS names, not NMB (NetBIOS) names. <comment28178> nmblookuop is no more present on Lion <comment28179> No need to search for it: is no more there on Lion <comment28231> Point taken.  I wrote this before the question was changed from Snow Leopard to Lion.  What seemed unusual at the time was why /usr/bin wouldn't be in the user's $PATH.  Having seen the responses from other people, it makes more sense now. <comment28245> Indeed. Looks like its gone in lion as per the answer above <comment28276> You and Matteo provided useful feedback. Thanks a lot for this useful command! <comment28277> This is good to know. No idea Samba got kicked out of Mac OS X because of licensing issues. <comment28279> @RÃ©mi: not only Samba, gcc too (substituted by LLVM). In principle everything licensed with GPLv3 <comment147372> This also works on latest OS X Mavericks. Looks like they removed nmblookup but smbutil still works.
