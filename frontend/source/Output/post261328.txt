Macbook pro 2015 “Can't install addittional components” <body> I have such problem. I bought today new macbook pro 15" 2015. The standart os is OS X EL Capitano, I used laptop for 2 hour, saw the new os (mac os Sierra) in Apple Store and decided to update it. Then pushed download, waited for some time, and os started to upgrade. After os updated was a White screen without any life. I restarted my mac it worked but on El capitano, but started to be slow and got lags. I went to recovery mode and push "Reinstall MacOS Sierra". After some time happened the problem, I don't remember what is the problem. I restarted againg to recovery mode and saw that now it is not "Reinstall MacOs Siearra" but was "Reinstall osX". I pushed it and proccess has been started. There was "Installing addittional components. Laptop will restart automaticly". After 5 minutes "Can't install additional components". I tried to do it some times. And tried with formating ssd. But I didn't touch Recovery "Apple disk image media". Can someone help me, please ?
