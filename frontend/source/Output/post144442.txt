iOS 7 status bar for UI development <body> I am creating some UI designs for an app, but I am struggling to find a template for the time, carrier, battery etc. bar at the top of the iPhone's display.  Where could I find a copy of this bar so that I can add it to my designs?  <answer144443> Here's an iOS 7 status bar with the default UINavigationController background colour:                                    img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Qvkq9.png" width="320"  <comment170146> Thanks, much appreciated.
