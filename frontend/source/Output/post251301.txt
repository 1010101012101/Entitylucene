iOS 10 Beta Updates <body> My partner just took my old iPhone 6. I had this running the public beta. I have since wiped all data using the reset functionality. My question is... will it continue to update?   <answer251305> In order for it to update to public beta software the phone needs to have a profile downloaded on the device which can be obtained from Apple's beta site assuming you signed up for it then you could just log in with your Apple ID and download it which will then give you the updates for the beta software.  <comment312310> What iOS version do you have on the phone now? <comment312331> Are you asking if beta updates are still enabled or if when iOS 10 is released, the normal update will happen? <comment312398> Latest public beta but I am not signed into it any more.
