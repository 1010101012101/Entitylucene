Screen Forced Away from Dashboard <body> I have this issue on my strongMacbook Air/strong that happens often if I select a gadget on the dashboard. I get forced away from the dashboard to the Desktop. I noticed if I previously selected one gadget and I select a different gadget it will do this. For example:  ol liI use the dictionary gadget/li liMove away from dashboard to do something else/li liThen go to the dashboard again to use a calculator/li liForced away from dashboard/li /ol  Is this a software problem or is it normal? If it is normal, can I stop this from happening in "system preferences"?  Version strong10.7.5/strong  <answer76613> I have updated my software on my Mac and this problem has stopped. Thank you all for helping me with this issue.  <comment84742> And this is not just an accidental swipe back to the Desktop with four fingers on the Trackpad? I cannot reproduce this behavior. <comment84743> No, I use three fingers to swipe between the desktop and dashboard but click on the gadgets with a mouse. After swiping I do not touch the trackpad at all. Only the mouse. I am not sure about what triggers this to happen because sometimes this issue does not occur and only happens when least expected. <comment84744> What sort of mouse? Two finger swipes can bring you to the Desktop with Magic Mouse. <comment84748> It is made by a brand called Tuscani and I think the kind of mouse is supposed to be HD-M324s.  http://imgur.com/DPbpr
