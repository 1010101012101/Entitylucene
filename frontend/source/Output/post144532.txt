iPhone 5s, can't decline call <body> Since last year, I have been using and iPhone 5s with iOS7 version.  My Problems are:  ol liI haven't been able to decline an incoming call for some time./li liThere are two User interfaces available for incoming call. One interface has the option to Decline with red button. In the other interface, I can't find the option to decline./li /ol  <comment170237> Why are you not able to decline an incoming call? Do you not see the red "decline" button or does it not respond when pressed/tapped? Does it happen irregardless of sleep/logged in state of the phone or only for calls arriving while the phone is at sleep/turned off? <comment170248> It's probably when the phone is not in the sleep/turned off state. The incoming call interface does not give you the "decline" option.
