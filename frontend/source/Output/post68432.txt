Can "mdfind" search for phrases and not just unordered words? <body> Is there a way to search for an exact phrase using the codemdfind/code utility? For example, I created two text documents titled "test1" and "test2". The contents of "test1" are:     I love Apple   And the contents of "test2" are:     Apple love I   When I type this in terminal (I placed both files in ~/Documents):     mdfind "I love Apple" -onlyin ~/Documents   I get:     ~/Documents/test1.txtbr   ~/Documents/test2.txt   How would I search for the exact phrase "I love Apple" so codemdfind/code only returns results containing those words in that order (in this case only "test1.txt")?  <answer68437> You need to escape your quotes like so:  precodemdfind \"I love Apple\" -onlyin ~/Documents /code/pre  This results in just the one document being found:  precode~/Documents/test1.txt /code/pre  Without escaping them, I don't think the quotes actually get passed to the codemdfind/code command, they're just interpreted by your shell to say that codeI love Apple/code is a single argument. With the backslash-escaping, the argument then includes the quote characters.  <answer68442> The double quotes can also be placed inside single quotes:  precodemdfind '"exact phrase"' /code/pre  This would search only in the contents:  precodemdfind 'kMDItemTextContent=="*exact phrase*"' /code/pre  <comment79462> Thanks. This worked too, but drfrogsplat answered first.
