Make OS X Mail show the most recent message in conversation <body> I like how Mail groups related messages together in a "conversation", but I hate how it always by default shows the oldest unread message in a thread--even if it is months old! This has gotten me on a couple of occasions where I will see a new email come in, click it, and see a message from months ago, but not emrealize/em that I'm not seeing the one that just came in.  Anyone know how to make Mail always scroll to the top/newest message in a conversation when clicking a message?  <answer114341> In Mail preferences, at the bottom of the Viewing pane, under Viewing Conversations, there is a checkbox to Show Most Recent Message At The Top. I think that's what you want.  <comment134004> Unfortunately this just swaps the chronological order. It doesn't affect which message of a conversation is displayed when you select the message in the list. <comment134006> Interestingly, if I check "mark all messages as read when opening a conversation" it gets *closer* to working in that the *next* time I click the conversation it will scroll to the top, but still not the *first* time I click it! <comment320257> It worked for me. I think when you open a conversation it just shows the most recent unread message, which is neat.
