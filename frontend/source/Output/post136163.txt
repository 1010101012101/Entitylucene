How can i Get Tunes to recognize my Iphone 5 <body> Itunes no longer recognizes my Iphone 5 whether by USB, Bluetooth or WiFi. Although my computer shows the phone to be paired and configured correctly, it does not show up in the Itunes device listing. How can I  correct this so that I can sync the phone with my computer? (This is a recent occurrence; for months Itunes recognized the phone immediately)  I use an Imac, OS 10.6.8 Itunes 11.2.2 (3)  <comment161456> give us some hints: type of computer, version of OS, version of iTunes, etc. <comment161460> Did you already restart both the phone and the computer? <comment161465> Re-introduce them to each other.   A simple, informal introduction goes a long way.
