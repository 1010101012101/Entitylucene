Where is BSD.pkg on OS X 10.9? <body> I want to extract BSD.pkg file and pull some apache configuration file to cover my apache http.conf file.  I locate in code/Library/Receipts//code, But the codeBSD.pkg/code file is empty.  <answer115366> This pkg is also in the "OS X Install ESD" this one should not be empty.  to get it just download mavericks from app store  make a right click and show package contents there should be an "OS X Install ESD".dmg  mount it  now you should find BSD.pkg under - /Volumes/OS X Install ESD/Packages/BSD.pkg  <comment135043> Thanks for your reply, I Click download button on the AppStore, But alert me:```OS X v10.9.1 is already installed on this computer. Use the Updates page to install the 10.9 update or if you would like to download the full OS X installer click Continue.```, Did I download mavericks from AppStore will replace my current system? <comment135090> No it won't. You will be able to simply quit the installer.
