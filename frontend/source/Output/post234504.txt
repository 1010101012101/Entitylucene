ZSH - missing git icons <body> Hi I've just installed ZSH and it looks awesome but git icons are still missing and I don't know what I miss.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dsLMo.png" alt="enter image description here"  What I should do?  <answer234511> Turns out I didn't have powerline font.  You can get it from here  After download, double click to install and set as strongdefalut font/strong &amp; strongnon-ascii font/strong  <answer234522> Missing icons in this case a empatched font/em isn't installed which is dedicated for showing specific symbols for your shell.  You can either set yourself up easy with an available repo. I should note that these patched fonts are for the codePowerline/code extension and may or may not be compatible with other extensions.  If you wish to patch your own font, however, it's a little more involved:  ol liDownload codefontpatcher/code/li liUsing a package manager such as codehomebrew/code, install codefontforge/code (codebrew install fontforge/code)./li liPatch your fonts by running the fontpatcher script like such:  codefontforge -script /path/to/fontpatcher.py MyFontFile.ttf/code/li liUpdate your terminal configuration to use the patched font./li /ol  <comment286691> Which them are you using? <comment286693> amuse at this moment but I've tried with [agnoster](http://i.imgur.com/AcwoZgd.png) but there was more missing icons. If this is important I'm running on os x 10.11.4 <comment286695> Have you tried to re-install it? Not much of a technical solution, but that might just do trick. <comment286698> How to do that? <comment286699> https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh#uninstalling-oh-my-zsh - this should tell you how to uninstall ZSH. Then, re-install it again. <comment286700> @ChickenWing24 I've updated my question, maybe you know correct font? <comment286701> Hmm, I never had to install any additional fonts. Can't think of why it's not working for you. Sorry can't be of more help. <comment286702> @ChickenWing24 and you had all those icons for git/osx etc? <comment286704> You're right. Just checked back the repo, it seems that you do need to install the fonts. Based on this article here - http://dhruvasagar.com/2013/03/13/amuse-zsh-theme, you need the InconsolataDz font. <comment286706> Let us [continue this discussion in chat](http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/38221/discussion-between-dudi-and-chickenwing24). <comment286707> @Dudi that update should be an answer not an edit <comment286708> @Mark will do :) <comment286710> Can you expand on this e.g. where you get it from
