Is it possible to mount a DVD iso to look like it's a DVD drive? <body> I have an old game DVD (Chessmaster 9000) that I bought legit (I swear), and I would like to play it on my Mac Air, which has no optical drive. With another game (Civ V) I've had success data-dumping the DVD to an iso in linux, and then mounting the iso on the Mac Air. But Chessmaster 9000 is the kind of game that needs the disc emin/em the drive to play. Having the iso mounted is not enough.  Is there a way to convince the Mac Air that it has a disk in a drive? My best hunch so far is that if it emis/em possible, it involves a codevndevice/code command, but I have had no luck so far, and documentation for it is very thin on the ground. I'm looking for the magic to make this work via a low-level command-line, rather than the commercial (but cheap) software that is available in one answer.  ul liIt looks like it requires writing your own low-level driver for the fake device. In other words, worth $10 to me! Accepting @Guido's answer./li /ul  <answer93344> Try with codeDAEMON Tools Lite for Mac/code, you can download here:  http://www.daemon-tools.cc/products/dtMacLite  This software has figured out how to trick the computer to thinking a DVD is mounted and I don't know if you can re-implement it via the command line tool codevndevice/code you mentioned.  <comment109497> How does this tool differ from mounting .iso images directly via Finder? <comment109499> I used it to mount images that were unsupported by Finder, and maybe they use a different engine (or they simulate a dvd drive) to mount the file. I wrote `try` not `sure will work` <comment109542> I had trouble working out the weird interface at first, but it turns out *this works*! Thanks @GuidoPreite. Now: what's the low-level magic going on here? I can't help think there's some simple CLI trick that doesn't require $10 activation ... but if not, that's a worthwhile $10 in my view. <comment109543> For the benefit of others who might try the light version: click the "change" button on the first splash screen to activate your trial period. (?!) Then a new "Remote" device shows up. The only way I found to mount anything on it, though, was to change the preferences of Daemon Tools to make a key combination for mounting a new image. (?!) From there, hit the key combo you chose, and you will be able to pick your iso. <comment109559> Glad you solved, I really don't know how they implemented <comment111067> If it is very old, it will be a PowerPC program which will not run on modern OS X versions.
