How to delete picture from home screen on iOS 7? <body> How can I delete a picture that appeared on my iPhone 4 home screen? I did not download or add this. There is no x to remove it and turning off restrictions did not help.   <comment256548> By picture you mean an icon for an app? What's the name of the app?
