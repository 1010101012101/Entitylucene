Spotlight shortcut Cmd+Space stops working in Yosemite <body> I have to go to the spotlight menu under system preferences and change and re-set the keyboard shortcut to Cmd+Space and then it starts to work again.   Has anyone else also experienced this? Anyone know what causes the shortcut to stop working?  <answer251343> Go to System Preferences  Keyboard  Shortcuts tab and click Restore Defaults. Then reconfigure your shortcut.  <comment183424> if your settings do not stick repair the permissions in disk utility. <comment216270> Haven't experienced it in weeks, theres been a number of OS X 10.10 updates. Probably something in there addressed it. <comment274616> I have this issue too. Have you found a solution? <comment274617> @Doug El Capitan <comment274618> I am on El Capitan (10.11.3) :( <comment274619> ah, damn. I dunno, haven't reproduced this issue in a while now. Maybe it's some app that you've installed that may somehow interfere with spotlight or keyboard bindings or shortcuts. <comment312377> I would mark the bug as "unreproducible" if that was a thing I could do. This one feels like something that Cupertino has fixed <comment370976> I am experiencing this bug also.
