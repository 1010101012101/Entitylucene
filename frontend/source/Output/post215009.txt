X11 Mouse Acceleration setting <body> X11 that I am using (XQuartz 2.7.5 (xorg-server 1.14.4)) with Yosemite has very high acceleration with the mouse (external or trackpad). Is there a way to lower the acceleration or remove it all together?  <answer225056> I'm currently using SmoothMouse. Ä°t disables Mac OS X mouse acceleration  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rPGSO.jpg" alt="screenshot"  <comment273101> what does this do and how do you make it work? A link on its own is not a good answer <comment273251> Currently the website is not functional so I have no clue what this program does.
