Recover docx files <body> We have just discovered that none of the passwords on our word documents work any longer, and I need a recommendation of an application that I can use to recover the files.  I believe the files had been created on a windows based computer, so I do not have much of a problem with using a windows based program if required.  <answer34582> This applies to .docx files:  ol liCreate a back-up copy of the file/li liChange the extension from .docx to .zip/li liOpen new .zip file/li liExtract all files/li liIn the extracted folder, navigate to word\settings.xml/li liOpen settings.xml/li liRemove the tag w:documentProtection, emdon't forget to include the &lt; and //em/li liSave file/li liCopy to modified settings.xml to the actual .zip file (over write)/li liRename .zip to .docx/li liOpen file/li /ol  Microsoft Office 2007 and up are xml files that can be edited if you know what to look for.  I just want to add that I am NOT responsible for what you do with this information.  I do believe that knowledge is power and with power comes responsibility.  <comment26173> What do you mean by "none of the passwords on our word documents work any longer"? Do the files now open without a password at all, or do they not open with the password you previously assigned? Have the files been modified since you assigned the password to them? <comment29934> The latter. docx files won't open when given an expected password. He essentially needs a way to brute force the documents open, or get to the file content without supplying a password.
