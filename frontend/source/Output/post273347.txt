Sort photos by keyword or tag on iPad <body> I'm looking for a way to manage a few hundred photos on an iPad and be able to sort them by keyword/tag. I don't care if I have to access the photos from a server or the Photos library on the device or by other means. It seems there may have been a few options a number of years ago judging by the following two similar questions that were already asked.  ul liSorting of photos, on ipad/li liCan I use my iPad to organize photos that are stored externally? /li /ul  Ideally, I would be able to just view a list of keywords that are being used by the photos and tap on one, or a few, to filter down to just those images. Having not used it, it seems Photosmith did create a list of the keywords being used, though development and support ended over a year ago and the App Store reviews indicate there might be issues importing photos. Sort Shot seems to have had a fairly good way to sort the images but it's no longer available.  Does anyone know of a current product or solution that would allow me to sort through photos by keyword just by tapping on keyword in a master list that the app or service would collate?  Thanks
