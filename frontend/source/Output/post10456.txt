Customize Quick Look to allow me to view .yml files <body> I would like to use "space" to preview *.yml files directly out of the finder on Mac OS X.   I think I have to tell finder to launch the text file quick view handler for files with that type and this has something to do with universal type identifiers (UTI.)  But that's as far as I was able to get.   Can anyone give me the magic formula? Thanks!!  <answer10462> I've had great luck with the free QLStephen plugin for Quick Look. It displays lots of other plaintext formats.br Probably worth a shot to see if it will work with codeYAML/code files.  You can get it here.  <answer10463> I use Ciarán Walsh’s TextMate in QuickLook plugin.     This is a TextMate plug-in and a QuickLook generator which renders QuickLook previews (for certain filetypes) using the TextMate syntax highlighter. Currently it’s configured to highlight Perl, PHP, Ruby, Shell, C headers and Obj-C(++). Note: this effectively sets up TextMate as a server for the syntax highlighting, so it won’t work unless TM is running (QuickLook will just fall back to the standard preview if it’s not).   Here is a convenience link to download the plugin and you can read more about it on Ciarán's web page.  This is what it looks like when I QuickLook a .yml file:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/JwY3f.png" alt=".yml QuickLook"  <comment46181> Works for YAML for me, on Lion 10.7!
