Decimal separator setting for the Spotlight calculator <body> I use the Spotlight calculator a lot but since the upgrade to OS X Mavericks the decimal pointer has changed to a code,/code instead of the code./code as in a previous release. Probably it now respects some locale setting but I cannot find which.  I reside in a German speaking country but use a US keyboard, the interface is set to English, the region formats are set to United States (with the exception of the currency being set to Euro), see this screenshot.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Dhbrf.png" alt="Language &amp; Region settings"  Still, the calculator expects a code,/code as a decimal separator:  precode1+.5 /code/pre  gives no result, while  precode1+,5 /code/pre  prints code1+,5 = 1,5/code  How can I change the decimal separator back to a code./code?  strongEdit:/strong As you can see in the screenshot the decimal point is set to code./code through these settings. Spotlight ignores that setting until you reboot (which I hadn't done at the time).  <answer117014> You can change the settings from the codeAdvanced.../codebutton in the Language &amp; Region preference pane.   Remember that you have to either reboot or log out for the changes to be applied to Spotlight!  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/IAgRj.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment136774> In addition, the free utility Alfred gives you the option of treating both the comma and the period as decimal separators simultaneously. This has come in handy on occasion when I am pasting in numbers formatted both ways. The above is better as a canonical solution. <comment136781> Well, as you can see in my screenshot (on the right bottom you can see sample values), I have the settings exactly as I want them (grouping `,`, decimal `.`). Still Spotlight only accepts a `,` as a decimal point. <comment136782> That's strange, I managed to change the decimal separator from here and it got applied when I logged in again or rebooted. <comment136921> ok, the reboot did it. Thanks! <comment164435> If you don't like rebooting, kill the SystemUIServer process. Type `sudo killall SystemUIServer` in the terminal. This will reload the spotlight configuration.
