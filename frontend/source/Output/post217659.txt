eapolclient process using 30GB of memory? <body> I’m using a brand new Retina MacBook Pro, 15-inch, Mid 2015  running OSX 10.11.1 with 16GB RAM. I received a low memory warning, asking me to close unused applications. When I checked Activity Monitor, I saw the the emeapolclient/em process had used 30GB of RAM.  Is this normal?  I was running Adobe Audition, Tweetbot, and Chrome - about 7 tabs, none of these apps were doing any intensive processing at the time…   Any suggestions as to what is going on?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2Oxmy.png" alt="screenshot"  <answer217662> You have at least three processes running wild:  emeapolclient/em:       probably related to 802.1x protected networksbr emCCXProcess/em:   related to Adobe Creative Cloudbr emCCXLibrary/em:     related to Adobe Creative Cloud    The last two obviously occur after the update to Creative Cloud 3.4.0.180. A staff member of the Adobe forum advises to update to Creative Cloud 3.4.0.181.  To solve your problem for now try to quit or kill the three processes in emActivity Monitor/em. Then try to quit all other running apps graciously (by quitting them from their menubar), restart the machine and check if it's still the same.  hr  There is some evidence that the Creative Cloud problems are related to corrupted preferences files. You may try to create a dummy user, log-in with your CC credentials and check if the problem persists.  <comment263135> The eapolclient is used by Mac OS X to connect to 802.1x secured wireless networks. <comment263139> That's very helpful, thank you.  I'm updating CC now... Any idea about what to do about the other one? <comment263140> @tomh It may be related to the rogue CC version . Is your Mac connected to a RADIUS server? <comment263143> @tomh, After a reboot does `eapolclient` still consume an absurd amount of memory?
