App not installing from Mac App Store <body> Ive just got a brand new iMac and have purchased a game (BioShock Infinite) from the Mac App Store.  For some reason the download failed halfway through so I tried again from the Purchases page of the app store. However it fails again immediately.  After trying that a few times I removed it from the Purchases page and then searched for it again, back in the app store. I clicked Buy again and it advised me that it was already purchased and would download again. But the same error occurs.  Does anyone know how to fix this?  <answer105958> Restarted Mac altogether. Seems to have worked
