Creating Smart Folders (perhaps programmatically) based on photo IPTC metadata? <body> I have thousands of photos with IPTC metadata -- I'm mostly interested in the star-ratings and the tags -- and I'd like to create folders for those images that automatically stay in sync as I change the metadata.  When I create a Smart Folder, I don't see any way to use IPTC metadata. (Though I see old posts on forums that make it seem like this was once possible?)  While automated synching using OSX's Smart Folders would be great, I'm also happy to use a tool or perhaps write a bash script to do this for me. I'm not quite sure where I'd begin with the bash script, though.  I'm using Mavericks, but if there's a Yosemite-only solution I'd be interested in that too, as I'll probably upgrade eventually.  Any thoughts?
