How can I start a Hangouts phone call with Applescript/Terminal? <body> I want to initiate a Google Hangouts phone call with Applescript.  Hangouts has an AS dictionary, but with only the default suites.  I want to emulate opening the Hangouts popup, typing in a phone number, and starting the call.  I looked at Hangouts API, but it is beyond me. But I think it could be done by calling python or ruby scripts from Terminal.  (I would like to integrate this into Butler's action-on-phone-number feature.)  <answer265404> This script I wrote works for me.  You may need to adjust a few of the delay values, depending on the speed in which your computer launches your browser etc.  I actually wrote this script and saved it as an application and then I enabled it as a dictation command  precodetell application "Safari"     activate     set URL of document 1 to "https://hangouts.google.com/"     delay 8 --adjust this value if needed     set the clipboard to "1-234-567-8910" -- enter the real phone number     tell application "System Events"         click button 5 of UI element 1 of scroll area 1 of group 1 of group 1 of tab group 1 of splitter group 1 of window "Google Hangouts" of application process "Safari"         delay 1         click button "New conversation" of UI element 1 of scroll area 1 of group 11 of UI element 1 of scroll area 1 of group 1 of group 1 of tab group 1 of splitter group 1 of window "Google Hangouts" of application process "Safari"         keystroke (the clipboard)         delay 2         key code 36     end tell end tell /code/pre  <comment170041> Hangouts has an AppleScript dictionary? <comment170043> Exactly what I though?  @Ze've what app are you using?? <comment170062> Just shift-cmd-O from AS editor... But nothing inside of it. <comment340328> As of 2017_01_28, this code does not work. If you can fix the issue, I would very much appreciate it. <comment340333> @Ze'ev Did you ever find a good solution to this question? <comment340344> @rubik'ssphere thank you for pointing out my original script no longer worked.  I made some adjustments to the original and now the script works again <comment340382> The new code works perfectly. My web browser of choice is actually Google Chrome. Can you write a version of this code for Chrome? What about for the desktop Google Hangouts.app? <comment341067> @rubik'ssphere my first attempt was with Google Chrome and I could not get it to work. I even tried adding a JavaScript command for the action of clicking on the "new conversation" button in Google Chrome. When I tried compiling the script, in script editor, it kept throwing an error message "access to blah blah blahâ€¦ denied" <comment341407> I thank you for trying!
