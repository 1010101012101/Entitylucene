What does an X in the upper-left of a folder icon mean? <body> I created this at the volume root per instructions to install MongoDB. I haven't seen this before. Is it invalid for me to create a top-level folder like this?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hSnth.png" alt="Screenshot"  <answer191274> The X is actually a button.   It appears for example when you download a file or when you copy a folder/file. It allows you to cancel the download/copy process.
