Why is iTunes grabbing the input from Bluetooth Remote controls on a late 2017 MBP? <body> here's an odd conundrum for you:  Normally when you connect a Bluetooth remote control to a Mac, the active application receives the key commands sent by the remote.  e.g. if Keynote is the active application then pressing 'play' will present the presentation, but if iTunes is active, then the play button will play the current track.  A friend has a late 2016 MBP (the new touchbar ones.)  She would like to use a BT remote to control Keynote.   However, whichever application is front-most, iTunes grabs the remote commands.  So - pressing play or fwd/back will emalways/em control the music in iTunes, even if Keynote is active.  There doesn't appear to be anyway to change this.  I have tried several types of BT remotes, and the odd behaviour is shown with all of them.  I have tried the same remotes on other MacBooks and MacBook Pros and they all behave normally.   The odd thing is that the owner of the MBP claims that when she first paired the remote it worked as expected for a short time.  The MBP is running the current version of Mac OS Sierra.  1 - Can anyone with a touchbar MBP and a BT remote test this case to see if they get the same results?  2 - Does anyone have any idea what would cause this?  I can only assume that it's an OS bug to do with the touchbar support.  Thanks.
