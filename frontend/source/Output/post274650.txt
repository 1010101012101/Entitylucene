Is there a way to prevent recent applications from moving to the far left when switching with Command-Tab? <body> Given applications ABC; switching to C gives: CAB  Command-Tabbing to an application brings it to the left end of the Command-Tab cycle. Any way to disable this?  <answer276422> https://www.keyboardmaestro.com/documentation/5/applicationswitcher.html  I googled around and found the free Keyboard Maestro software. Using it you can customize your application switcher. You can hide specific applications from appearing in the switcher by going to Keyboard Maestro Preferences - Excluded. In the switcher, pressing E will toggle hide/unhide apps.  <comment347891> Welcome to Ask Different!  We're trying to find the best answers and those answers will provide info as to why they're the best.

For example what would it do like this AB(C)D with C activate? <comment348088> It brings it to the left: the activated app is brought to the left, so AB(C)D - CABD
