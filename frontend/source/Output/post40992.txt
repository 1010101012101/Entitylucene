How to create HFS partition on Windows 7 machine <body> I've got Windows 7 running on my computer and I would like to partition my codeD:/code volume, make it HFS+ but I cannot find any tool that will accomplish this.  Anyone had done this before? Is it possible? I have EaseUS partition tool but it does not support HFS/HFS+.  <answer40996> I only know of two commercial tools: MacDrive and TransMac. They both have limited time trials to evaluate before you buy.  You could also try a Live CD of GParted, it has HFS support.  Update: a colleague of mine told me you can create a HFS partition with codediskpart/code. Just make sure it's strongprimary/strong and use partition id codeaf/code (codecreate partition primary id=af/code).  <answer100256> You can use Paragon HFS + for Windows, for example. With him will be an opportunity and to read and write.   <answer132734> This did the trick for me.  Paragon Hfs-Ntfs converter.  <answer159654> There is PARAGAN PARTITION MANAGER FREE EDITION with wich you can do this, to format in windows partitions to Apple HFS.  <comment46412> Thanks Vlad, I tried trial version of MacDrive but I couldn't format the ntfs volume I suppose it is limited won't let me do it but I will try TransMac it sounds promising. Thanks alot <comment46414> @Pinchy - Not sure what *couldn't format the ntfs volume* means. You want to format an existing NTFS partition as HFS? AFAIK you have to delete the NTFS partition and create a new HFS partition in the free space. <comment46416> Well, I didn't delete the partition coz I didn't know I needed to delete the partition to see the format options on the volume. I will try that one too. Thanks again.
