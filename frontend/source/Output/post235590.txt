How can I add a universal keybinding for a program? <body> I want to add a key binding that allows me to use it even when the application is not in the foreground. Specifically how would I add play/skip/previous key bindings to Spotify?  I'm not looking for the media key bindings. They can stay as is. I would like to add custom ones with keys of my choosing.  <answer235605> This can be answered by this other question. Basically, you're going to want to create an Automator action and assign it a global shortcut using the Keyboard preferences panel.  Edit: @bmike , the dupe you referenced didn't answer his question. The one I linked to does.  <comment288190> It's not a duplicate. That's not even close to what I'm asking. <comment288205> As written, it's too close to the duplicate. Your issue might not at all be duplicate - so an edit to this explaining specifically why this isn't a duplicate and linking to the post should be enough to review this and get it reopened. Perhaps you have a specific key combination you wish to bind? (or explicitly don't want to use the F7 through F9 alternate meanings?) <comment288209> Thanks jimmy0x52 - what's going to be best - picking the details from the answers you linked to or just closing this dupe of the other. <comment288454> @bmike The accepted answer in that other thread is very elaborate - I'd suggest just pointing this at that thread and closing this one as a dupe. <comment288484> Perfect. Thank you. That link is closer to a duplicate.
