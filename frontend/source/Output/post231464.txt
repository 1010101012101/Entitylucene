Thunderbird - quit when close <body> When I close the windows of Thunderbird 38, it is because I have finished to work on my mails. But Thunderbird is still running and can tell me when new mails are arrived.   For now, I have to click-right on Thunderbird to quit.  Is there a way to quit Thunderbird when I close the window?  I am using Mac OSX 10.10.   <answer231466> No, as on Macintosh closing Applications' windows ( by either clicking on the emtop-left/em strongred button/strong or doing kbdCommand/kbd+kbdW/kbd ) doesn't quit it.   To quit it, instead of closing all windows, you have to actively go into the menu option through strongem[Application Name]/em / Quit em[Application Name]/em/strong or by doing kbdCommand/kbd+kbdQ/kbd
