iPhone 4 "A Series" battery? <body> I was just about to order a replacement for my iphone 4, when I noticed there are apparently two different types. Both are claimed to be genuine apple batteries, however one costs nearly 10GBP more than the other. The only difference I can tell is that one of them is called em"iPhone 4 Battery strongA Series/strong"/em  Anyone has an idea what the difference might be?  <answer9089> I have gotten an answer from the seller, who states that they are both the same. Hm, price targeting?
