View PDF in Preview in Full Screen? <body> Is there any way to view a PDF in Preview in Full Screen? Quick Look works, but it doesn't have the 'remembering the page you were looking at' feature that I like.   <answer2735> codeView/code  codeSlideshow/code (or kbdShift/kbd+kbdCommand/kbd+kbdF/kbd).  <answer7400> Install MegaZoomer, it'll give you nice fullscreen viewing in Preview.  Update: Note that OS X Lion will give you this feature.  <answer177165> ctrl+cmd+f  by using this combination, you can also zoom in pages in fullscreen.  <comment2433> This is great but you can't zoom in or out using  + or  -. <comment2447> @JFW: Indeed, it appears [this was removed in Snow Leopard](http://discussions.apple.com/message.jspa?messageID=11383768). <comment2464> Your best bet is  + f to switch between “Actual Size” and Fit To Screen. (works while you’re in “slideshow” mode) <comment2540> Isn't  + f 'Find'? <comment2547> @JFW: Not while you're in Slideshow mode. There it resizes to "Fit to screen", but not back to "Actual size". You can also do it with the on-screen button bar. <comment15006> Or use [Skim](http://skim-app.sourceforge.net/) instead. It's an excellent pdf viewer, much more feature rich than preview. And it's free. <comment15007> Cool, nice find.
