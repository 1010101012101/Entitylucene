Safari Tabs not remembering <body> In my preferences I have set the Safari opens as "windows from last time".  I do not know, but it seems not to be working. When I click on the red icon and close the window and start it again my tabs are lost. In Firefox I remember there were always there when I started it up.  Is there anything else I can use? Maybe an addon ?  <comment254058> Is this Safari on Windows or on Mac? On a Mac, that's the behaviour I'd be expecting, since you're actually just closing the window - i.e. all the tabs - instead of quitting the program using the menu Safari - Quit or âŒ˜Q.
