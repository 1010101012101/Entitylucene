Belkin USB PDA Adapter Driver <body> I'm trying to install "Belkin USB PDA Adapter Driver" and I'm getting message:  You can't open the application Belkin USB PDA Adapter Driver because the Classic environment is longer supported.  What can I do in order to get it to work?  <answer9543> Look for updated drivers.  This is an app written for Mac OS 9, so there's really no way to get it to work with a computer running OS X.  <comment10008> went to manufacture's website they only have for OS9, and Vista, not even for W7, and I thought I'm going go with "big" brand name like Belkin to make sure everything is "ok"... go figure...
