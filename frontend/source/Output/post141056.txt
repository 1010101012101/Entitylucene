Copy text from command line as formatted text <body> So I have a script that outputs this  precode&lt;pre style="background:#f1f1f1;color:#000;font-weight:bold;"&gt;echo 'Hello World';&lt;/pre&gt; /code/pre  What I would like to do it copy it to the clipboard as rich text and not plain text.  Is this possible?  Right now I have this command:  precodecreate-codeblock | pbcopy /code/pre  This obviously only copies the plain text html code to the clipboard.  What I really want is the html formatted version copied to the clipboard.  Any thoughts?  What I am trying to do in the end is paste rich formatted text into Evernote.  <answer141067> As aglasser commented, you can use codetextutil/code like so:  precodecreate-codeblock | textutil -stdin -format html -convert rtf -stdout | pbcopy /code/pre  <comment166217> Maybe this link will help you? I think you want to use `textutil`. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6095497/how-can-i-generate-a-rich-text-link-for-pbcopy
