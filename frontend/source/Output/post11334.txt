Is there a way to use Skype on ipad with audio chat only? <body> I'm having first version of ipad and a USB headphone. is it possible to use skype on ipad? I'm on Wi-Fi.  <answer11336> I was using Skype on my 3rd gen iPod for audio calls, so I wont think you'll have have any problems using it on a 1st gen iPad.  <answer11340> You cannot use USB Headset with an iOS device, however, you can use Skype on your iPad with the iPhone headset or with the integrated mic and speaker.   <comment11856> but no skype application for iPad in apple store. <comment11857> There isn't but you can install the iPod/iPhone version on your iPad. Download the app via iTunes, and then sync it to your iPad. <comment11858> ok. but i think audio chat is not possible on ipad because no USB port available <comment11859> @jitendra-vyas You may use iPad's built-in microphone, or use the earbuds with microphone which came with your iPad. Alternatively, there is a USB adapter for the iPad, but I'm not sure if it's compatible with headsets. <comment12836> can i do voice chat from ipad without having earphone and external mic. Is inbuilt mic availabe inside ipad? <comment41704> USB headsets do work with the Camera Connection Kit. <comment41705> The pinhole next to the headphone port is the iPad's microphone.
