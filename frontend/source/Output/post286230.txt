Can you answer a call with AirPods faster than EarPods? <body> I am considering to purchase the Apple Airpods. Currently I use Apple Earpods. My only consideration in this purchase is: stronghow fast can I answer a call and start using it/strong.  Could someone who has both please measure the time it take to:  CONTESTANT A  ul liRemove AirPods from a purse/bag/li liOpen case/li liInsert pods to ear/li liSwitch over from talking with phone to talking with pods/li /ul  CONTESTANT B  ul liRemove EarPods from bag/li liUnwrap earphones (wrapped using the power-chord crossover style)/li liInsert phones to ear/li liPlug phones into phone/li /ul  This is a serious question. I do not like all these new products with a million new features but the one important thing adds a few seconds to each use. So I need to know if the AirPods are a step forward or a step backward.  <answer286235> AirPods are much quicker, as you don't have to spend 5 minutes untangling them. No matter how you wrap them, it's going to happen. Also, switching is automatic, so no need to worry there.  <comment361083> This is a fact-based question about benchmarking Apple products. Why the hate? <comment361084> Can't you purchase them yourself and try the experiment?  If you don't like them you can return them to Apple for your money back or ebay them. <comment361085> There are way too many factors involved in this in my opinion.
