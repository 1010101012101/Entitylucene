Using MacPorts bash, tab completion no longer lists hidden / dot files <body> I used MacPorts to install bash (bash @4.3.8_0). I switched Terminal to use code/opt/local/bin/bash/code as the command to startup.  However, now when I type codevim ~/.&lt;tab&gt;&lt;tab&gt;/code, it no longer lists dot files. If I switch back to using the default Mac OS X shell command, it works by listing the hidden dot files.  Does anyone know what settings I need to switch?  I've tried adding codeset match-hidden-files on/code in my code~/.inputrc/code as well as running codeshopt -s dotglob/code but neither seem to have any effect.  <answer126811> There is an issue filed for this in MacPorts Trac. The real issue is that auto completion does not work for any paths starting with ~ (tilde) — try codevim .&lt;tab&gt;&lt;tab&gt;/code.
