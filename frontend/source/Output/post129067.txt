Jailbreak before iOS 8? <body> Does anyone think that we can expect a jailbreak between iOS 7.0.6 and iOS 8? Or will we just have to wait it out? My iPad 3rd gen is running iOS 7.1 and I can't find a jailbreak for it.   <answer129071> According to Evad3rs jailbreak team:     Q: When I can make jailbreak 7.1? br/   A: We don't have such information.   Wait.   As you don't want to ruin your Apple devices, you should not download any Jailbreak tools from external sources except the strongreal deal/strong.  E.g. Evad3rs, Redsn0w  <comment151080> So your question basically means; will there be an iOS 7 jailbreak? There's already one for iOS 7.1. <comment151082> @Rob There isn't a jailbreak for 7.1? Only 7.0.x <comment151085> Sorry, I should have been more clear. There is no jailbreak for iOS 7.1, that I know of. The newest one is 7.0.6. I think there may be one for iPhone 4 or older, but I'm not sure. Now, I don't know if this means that I can use this on my iPad 3rd gen or not. Which is what I want to jailbreak. But I know it won't work for my iPhone 5s. Luckily that didn't get updated, so it's still Jailbroken. Do you know of one? I'll edit my question to be more clear. <comment151086> Thank you. That's pretty much what I have found everywhere else so far. I hoped someone here might have a more definite answer. Wishful thinking, I guess.
