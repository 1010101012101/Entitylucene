Why doesn't my messages icon on my iPhone 5 display the number of messages? <body> I don't know if I may have accidentally changed some settings, but now the icon on my Messages doesn't display the number of unread messages. However, my Mail app does, so I am not sure why this is. I tried going through settings to see what I could find, but to no avail.  How do I fix this?  <answer118949> You've turned it off in Notification Center.  ol liOpen Settings, then scroll to Notification Center and tap it./li liScroll down to the "Include" section; "Messages" should be there. If not you've turned off notifications for it altogether; scroll on down to "Do Not Include" and you should see it there. In either case, tap it./li liTap the "Badge App Icon" switch so it's emon/em./li /ol  Your messages count should be back.  <comment146630> I tried this fix bu it still doesn't work :(
