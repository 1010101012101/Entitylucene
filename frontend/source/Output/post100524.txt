Error when trying to install Snow Leopard Server in Parallels <body> In a previous question, it was asked if Snow Leopard Server is supported in Parallels 8, and from Parallels documentation, it would appear that it is.  I am trying to stand up a Snow Leopard Server VM on my Parallels instance, but to no avail. I get a window each time saying, simply, codeMac OS X can not be installed on this computer/code.  Has anyone here had success installing SL Server? If so, did you also encounter this error? And, if you saw this error, how did you overcome it?  <comment118344> Are you using a retail copy of SL server or one that came with a Mac? <comment118346> Is there a way to tell from the disk itself? <comment118347> The restore disk is generally gray while the retail disk should look [like this](http://regmedia.co.uk/2010/11/29/mac_mini_with_snow_leopard_server_7.jpg). <comment118627> OK, I have the retail disk like the one in the linked photo. <comment121319> If I have the retail disk, shouldn't I be able to stand up a SLS VM?
