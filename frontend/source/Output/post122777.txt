Keystroke commands for open recent <body> I want to set a keystroke command (Mountain Lion) to trigger the common File menu's Open Recent option.  I've tried the System Preferences = Application Shortcuts = Keyboard Shortcuts. My shortcuts show up in the applications' File = Open Recent menu, and when I type my assigned keystrokes there's a little flash in the File menu bar, but nothing else happens.   Any ideas, y'all?  <answer122859> I have used FastScripts to assign a shortcut to this script:  precodetell application "System Events" to tell (process 1 where it is frontmost)     tell menu bar item 3 of menu bar 1         click         repeat with x in {"Open Recent", "Open Recent File", "Recent Projects", "Open With"}             if exists menu item x of menu 1 then                 click menu item x of menu 1                 exit repeat             end if         end repeat     end tell end tell /code/pre  It opens an Open With menu in Finder and a menu for recent files in other applications.  See http://osxnotes.net/shortcuts.html for other ways to assign a shortcut to a script.
