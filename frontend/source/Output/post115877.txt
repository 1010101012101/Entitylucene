How do I determine if my Macbook Pro supports audio input through the audio jack?  <answer115879> You can list specifically which audio devices your system is using in Terminal:  precodesystem_profiler SPAudioDataType /code/pre  Another way you can determine if you have the combination audio port is when you're viewing codeSystem Preferences &gt; Sound/code you will have an output option that shows up on the input tab.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Jed5Z.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <comment135588> I might be wrong but to me its a switchable when you only have one Jack on the Mac.
