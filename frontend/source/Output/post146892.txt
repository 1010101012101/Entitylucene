Any clues?  <answer146898> 8.0.1 was removed last night from Apple's servers. To fix your issue without having to restore the phone, follow the instructions: here:     Turn off Find my iPhone via Settings  iCloud. Download iOS 8 for   iPhone 6 or iPhone 6 Plus. Make sure you're on the latest version of   iTunes. Go to About and then Check for Updates or visit iTunes.com.   Launch iTunes on your Mac or PC. Connect your iPhone 6 or iPhone 6   Plus to iTunes via Lightning to USB cable. Hold down Option (Mac) or   Shift (Windows) click on "Check for Update". Choose the iOS 8 firmware   file (.ispw) you downloaded in step 2. Let iTunes do its thing. Once   you're back up and running, Turn Find my iPhone back on.   <answer146926> Apple revoked iOS 8.0.1 last night after issues with iPhone 6 models were revealed.  The installation is failing as the device can't verify the download is correct as iOS 8.0.1 is no longer available.  To delete the download, go to: Settings app - General - Usage - Manage Storage   Find the iOS 8.0.1 option, select it and tap delete.  Finally, go back to the Software Update screen and it will show iOS 8.0 as up to date.  <comment173144> Note that the Settings app will retain a badge number of 1.  This will be resolved when Apple release iOS 8.0.2 soon. <comment173148> You should be happy that you weren't able to install it. They really botched that update. <comment173368> That did the trick for me <comment173407> +1 ... after deleting the 8.0.1 download this way, it finally finds & lets me install 8.0.2 <comment173808> what if we are trying to delete the new update 8.0.2 and we go settingsthen to general then we go to usage then manage storage but the ios 8.0.2 is not showing up to delete it can you help me
