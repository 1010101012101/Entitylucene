How does a barcode scanner trigger the virtual keyboard? <body> If a bluetooth barcode scanner is connected to an iOS device in HID mode, the virtual keyboard is hidden by default. There are some scanners which are able to show it again if needed for manual user input. My question: how exactly is this being done? My understanding is that in HID mode a scanner is acting the same as a keyboard. If that's true is there a special key code which does the trick?
