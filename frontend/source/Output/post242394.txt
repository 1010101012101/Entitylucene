Some keys not working on Musical Typing? <body> I can't play some keys, such as H when on Octave C1, H and D when on Octave C2 or J and K on Octave C3. When I press them, I get no sound. If I manually place the notes out and then listen to it with Musical Typing open, it visually plays them.  Anyone know how to fix this?  <comment298164> Is this Garage Band? Logic Pro? <comment298173> @Angelplayer Logic Pro, thought people could see it in the tags but maybe its not so obvious.
