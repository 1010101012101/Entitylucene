Notification center does not show mail alerts <body> I'm a new Mac user since yesterday. I've read much about the notifications which are available with Mavericks.  I connected my Twitter account and also set up my iCloud mail account.  I thought that I would receive notifications in the upper right corner of when I receive new mails or Tweets were created from people I'm following.   I was very disappointed when I recognized that there are no notifications at all.  Do I have to set up notifications some where?  <comment126261> Do you have Do Not Disturb enabled? Click the Notification Center icon in the menu bar at the top right of the screen, then scroll down to reveal the Do Not Disturb switch. <comment126310> No I am not in DnD mode, I've checked that already. <comment126375> Go to the Apple menu  System Preferences  Notifications and select Mail (or Twitter) in the list. Do you have an alert style selected? Is the "Show In Notification Center" checkbox checked? <comment126535> Ok, I've just found out, that the mail.app hast to run (at least in the background). But then the notification center doesn't make sense?!
