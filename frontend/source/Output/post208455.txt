How can I change Keychain permissions without being physically present? <body> According to Apple's Documentation, for certain operations, the user must be physically present.  However, I am trying to administer a Xcode Server build box via Screen Sharing, and I can't add or remove keychain items because of this restriction. This server is inside of our corporate firewall. Is there a way to remove this restriction for this server?  In the Console, SecurityAgent gives this message when I try to Allow access to a keychain item:     Ignoring user action since the dialog has received events from an untrusted source   <answer226533> If you have ssh &amp; admin access to the server you could use the security command line tool to manipulate keychain items. It can add &amp; delete passwords, identities and certificates, look at the security man page for the details.  I haven't tried but it looks like codesudo security dump-keychain -i &lt;keychain&gt;/code may do what you want.  I suppose that you could use the security tool from the terminal via Screen Sharing if you didn't have ssh access.  <comment251467> No, as I said, the server is behind a corporate firewall <comment257322> http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/212622/keychain-wont-let-copy-passwords-after-10-11-1-update#comment257296_213099
