Terminal behaving differently since updating to Lion <body> Ever since my company updated to Lion, terminal.app has been behaving differently. When I click on the dock icon, it sometimes opens several terminal windows at once, instead of a single one, and all of them display my previous session's activity, rather than just opening to a shell prompt.   What can I do to make the terminal go back to behaving the way it used to? I can't find anything in the prefs that would account for these changes.  <answer33930> This is the resume feature of OS X Lion.  h2Undo resume for a specific application/h2  Type the following command in the Terminal. Then restart the specific application.  In general the syntax is:  precodedefaults write com."producer"."program-name" ApplePersistenceIgnoreState YES /code/pre  Thus, in your case (Terminal.app) it is:  precodedefaults write com.apple.terminal ApplePersistenceIgnoreState YES /code/pre  If you want to set the resume feature again, simply write NO using the same syntax.  h2Undo resume for all applications/h2  In order to disable this for emall/em applications do this:  go to strongcodeSystem Preferences-&gt;General/code/strong img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/alhlq.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer33981> If you prefer a graphical interface you can use the app strongTinkerTool/strong.  This application gives you access to additional preference settings and allows to activate hidden features in the operating system.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HSPy0.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment38735> Is there any way (even if I need to do it via terminal command) to set this on a case-by-case basis? There are some apps where I want this behavior, but for most of them I don't. <comment38749> Yes, I've updated the solution above. <comment39078> Thanks! This is great. Generally I prefer command line when I'm on a linux machine, but I'm not as familiar with the actual program names on the Mac so the GUI is really helpful to make sure I'm affecting the correct apps. <comment39107> @EmmyS You should accept the answers when they solved your problem :) That way, when searching this site with the search bar, one can see that this has been solved. <comment59901> I have unchecked the "Restore windows when quitting and re-opening apps" option but TextEdit still re-opens files I have abandoned the last time I used it. Any ideas? <comment59902> @AndrewJ.Brehm No idea why this is happening. How long has this been going on? I just disabled this feature as well, and I had to restart the tested applications several times to see the change take affect. <comment59914> I disabled the feature when I saw it. I didn't even want to know what new terror Apple had tried to bring upon me. However, TextEdit has always re-opened files that I never saved.
