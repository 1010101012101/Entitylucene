Restore Safari Java Applet Placeholders <body> By default Safari has Java disabled, but places a “plugin content” placeholder or something similar where the Java Applet would be. However, if you enabled Java and then disable it again Safari no longer adds placeholders, opting to just remove the Applet from the flow of the webpage entirely. Is there any way to restore Safari’s default placeholder?
