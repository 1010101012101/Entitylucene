Can I use the same iTunes account on all my devices? <body> I've heard a lot of conflicting information about how many devices/computers can share an iTunes account.  What are the actual limits, and are devices distinguished from computers?  My current configuration is (all using the same iTunes account):  ul liOne Windows computer with iTunes/li liOne iPad/li liOne iPhone/li liOne Apple TV/li /ul  I want to add:  ul liAnother, separate Windows account (on the same computer), that will use a separate install of iTunes/li liTwo more iPhones/li liAnother iPad/li /ul  I'd like everything to share the same iTunes account - is this possible?  <answer35722> Yes. You can set up the same itunes account for all devices  <answer35728> Yes, you can. And if you have iTunes Match you have your Music on all these Devices. I love it.  <answer35729> This is what the official Apple documentation says:     Your Apple ID can have up to strong10 devices and computers (combined)/strong   associated with it. Each computer must also be authorized using the   same Apple ID. Once a device or computer is associated with your Apple   ID, you cannot associate that device or computer with another Apple ID   for 90 days. You can view which devices or computers are currently   associated, remove unused devices or computers, and see how long   before they can be associated with a different Apple ID from the   Account Information page in iTunes on your computer.
