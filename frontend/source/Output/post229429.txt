How to Install Game Boy Advance Emulator on my iPhone 6 <body> I want to play Game Boy Advance games on my iPhone, but I can't install a working Game Boy Advance emulator on my iPhone.  I have iOS 9.2.1 installed on my phone. I searched for tutorials online, but the app can't be installed.  Is there any way to play Game Boy Advance games on an iPhone?  <answer229430> I use the buildStore :  http://builds.io  $9.99/year/device but you have a lot of emulators (a stable GBA4IOS) and cool apps.  Hope this can help.  <answer237760> There are many emulators out there espeically for Game Boy Advance, but the most current one is GBA4iOS. Check it out and see if that help.  <comment280558> Have you tried [sideloading](http://bouk.co/blog/sideload-iphone/) GBA4iOS (what I presume you're using?)
