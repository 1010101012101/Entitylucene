Where is the screenshot property list now located in Mavericks? <body> Previously, the screenshot property list could be found at:  code~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.screencapture.plist/code  In Mavericks, this file no longer exists. In the past, I used to be able to manipulate the location and image type of screenshots using the .plist mentioned above. Where are these values now stored? Do I now need to create the plist in order to manipulate these variables, IE:  precodedefaults write com.apple.screencapture location ~/folder/of/my/choice /code/pre  To be sure this was not an issue with my user account, I created a new admin. account and tested.   <answer130258> Looking at my MBA with 10.9.2 it is still in the     User/myname/Library/Preferences/com.apple.screencapture.plist   As it turns out, the .plist will only exist (be created) if you modify the screencapture settings, like location to save and others.  <answer130259> Yes, the plist seems to no longer exist by default, however I have changed my save location using the same command that you provided in your question and it's worked fine — the plist emis/em read by OS X after logout and login.  <comment152609> Buscar: thanks for the reply. This file neither exists in my user account, nor a vanilla admin user account I created to double check that it wasn't an issue related to my own account. Could this be a system wide issue? <comment152610> grgarside, appreciate the response (and reassurance i'm not going crazy!). Out of curiosity, do you know where these variables now natively reside (without creation of a new property list to manipulate that which clearly is present somewhere)? <comment152611> it could....it should have been there by default. unless you deleted it and did not restart allowing it to recreate it self. <comment152616> Forgot to reboot. But I just checked, no luck. <comment152620> why would it no longer exist by default? <comment152623> @njboot I'm not sure — I presume it'd be hardcoded into the app. <comment152624> @Buscar I guess because it's no longer required. <comment152634> So how come I have it? <comment152645> @Buscar I presume either you or an app has created it by changing a setting.
