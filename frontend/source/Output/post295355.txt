Lost partition after trying to run BootCamp on 10.13 on APFS. How to recover? <body> After trying to install Windows via Bootcamp on (yes I understand what "beta" means) beta High Sierra 10.13 I was left with unbootable partition:   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/78LQs.png" alt="enter image description here"  I cannot mount this disk. It's shown as "Mac OS Extended" file system though it was APFS.

(you might also add a gist showing `sudo gpt show disk0` and `diskutil list` and optionally `diskutil ap list` in case our volunteer cadre of disk repair wizards show up (cough klanomath, cough). <comment372909> @bmike Meant "unbootable". sudo gpt show disk0 : https://gist.github.com/pbrewczynski/912bfa11d7b54adbb6696d2a43f37dba   diskutil list: https://gist.github.com/pbrewczynski/ca9e7c93a86849e82e9a4315a8189f24  diskutil ap list: https://gist.github.com/pbrewczynski/1c528dfddc5376600c983cb4a081eef7   Thank you for your time. <comment372911> OK - excellent edit. My knowledge isn't going to help other than to see if you can boot with option key or select the BootCamp volume from the Startup Disk pane - likely those aren't going to work given the data I see, but those steps can't hurt any more than what's done. Also - a bug report or feedback if you have that option with Apple might get an engineer's attention - they are clearly looking for real world breakage at this point in the beta process.
