What data can only be migrated to a new iOS device using backup and restore? <body> I think this will be a useful community wiki reference: strongexcluding device settings/strong, what iOS user data (the kind of data that is created and stored over time) can only be migrated to a new device through the use of iCloud/iTunes Backup and Restore from Backup?  This can be relevant to anyone buying a new iPhone or other device to replace an old one â€” if you decide to set the new device up as a "New iPhone", even though you had data on an old iPhone Backup, you will immediately start creating strongtwo streams/strong of data that strongcannot be merged/strong without using 3rd party tools.  This contrasts with data that can be re-downloaded to a new phone after logging in with an Apple ID (iTunes app/music/video purchases, iCloud Mail/Contacts/Calendars/Drive), as well as data that can be migrated piecemeal using iTunes (app documents).  <answer253258> h1Health Data/h1  The Health app provides a way to export all data in XML format, but the very same app offers no bulk import functionality from this XML format. Health data is included in iCloud/iTunes backups.  <answer253259> h1Messages/h1  iMessages are distributed using end-to-end device-specific encryption, so it is not possible for message history to be redistributed to a new device. SMS/MMS messages are delivered by your service provider to your phone and only stored locally.  <answer253262> h1Apple Watch Data/h1  As this support article indicates, the only way to pair an Apple Watch with a new phone and maintain continuity of your data is to restore the new phone from a backup.  <comment315244> HealthKit data is only stored in iTunes backups if they are encrypted. <comment315245> iMessage history cannot be downloaded onto a new device, even by logging in. Such an option flies in the face of end-to-end encryption for iMessage. Messages are encrypted for known device(s) of the recipient at the time of creation on the sender's device (with the recipient's public key[s]). The key required to decrypt only exists on the receiver's device(s). Therefore it would be impossible for a message to be decrypted by a new device that was not known at the time of message creation. The only exception is backups, and you're not talking about backups based on the end of your answer. <comment315246> Also, please provide a reference for the option to "have Apple save all [iM]essages indefinitely", as such an option would directly contradict the statement in Apple's [official iOS security guide](https://www.apple.com/business/docs/iOS_Security_Guide.pdf) that "iMessage messages are queued for delivery to offline devices. _Messages are currently stored for up to 30 days_." (emphasis mine) <comment315248> The answer is "everything, except these specific cases". There is very little that can be transferred to a new device without a backup. iMessages cannot be, despite your assertion to the contrary. The only things that really transfer are things stored separately in iCloud: iCloud Photo Library, contacts, mail (iCloud, yes; other services, possibly), calendars stored in a cloud (iCloud/Gmail/etc), files stored in iCloud Drive, media and apps purchased from Apple ... <comment315249> ... and data in random apps that support iCloud Data. That's really about it. A better question would be, "What content can be migrated _without_ a backup?" <comment315250> Again, though, this storage is for delivery to known devices that happen to be offline, and will not result in historical messages appearing on new devices, even within the 30 days. <comment315367> @tubedogg Hey, I'm perfectly willing to believe that I've misunderstood iMessage storage. You don't have to ask permission to edit this answer, and I think that would've taken far less time than it took you to tell me how wrong I am. <comment315369> I disagree, on the basis that I can imagine far more answers to that question than I can for this one. The number of iOS features that generate user data that is *not* stored in the cloud really appears to be quite limited, but that data does tend to be very high value. Just the other day I noticed that keyboard autocompletes were synced across my devices, including to new ones. You've also got keychain data, which powers a slew of features.
