Managing keychain from terminal <body> I want to move my keys from codelogin/code keychain to codesystem/code keychain from terminal. Is that possible? I checked the security manual but I can not see the option there to do so.  <answer227868> strongWhy?/strong  The login keychain is for your user account. Moving that data to the system keychain would make your information available to all user accounts including 'Guest' accounts. Do you really want to do that?  I don't know if it is possible to do what you want, but if I look at my login keychain it includes my personal passwords, Apple ID, public keys (no problem), and strongprivate/strong keys. These should strongemnever/em/strong be made available to anyone. They are strongprivate/strong for a reason.  Don't do this.  <comment277744> Yes i know whats that mean and i want to do this. Its needed for Xcode server to operate on system Keychain <comment277752> Good luck then. I see dump-keychain, export & import. That should get you somewhere <comment277754> You commented this is for Xcode on a server. There are better approaches to giving Xcode access to keys and certificates that do not involve `system.keychain`. Please can you ask a question that deals with what you really want to solve. <comment277760> See http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1355637/using-a-non-default-keychain-in-xcode/6645998#6645998 for an example of getting Xcode to use a non-default keychain. You can unlock and leave a keychain accessible without a password, if needed.
