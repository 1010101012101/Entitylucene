Can I call a phone number from the Terminal? <body> In Yosemite, is there a way to start a phone call from the command-line aka Terminal?  Something like:  pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"codecall +316123456789 /code/pre  <answer158413> You can with codeopen "tel://+316123456789"/code start a phone call process - but you still need to click on the "Call" button to make the call.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LRvd1.png" alt="enter image description here"  To do so, you may also simply press kbdâ†©/kbd. To automate everything via Applescript:  precodeopen location "tel://+351918306031" delay 2 tell application "System Events" to key code 36 /code/pre  <answer158993> In theory, you could use Automator to setup a sequence of actions to trigger making a call.  I've never actually used Automator, but my understanding of it says it'll work.    First, you could create an Automator script that perhaps triggers Rene's answer of running codeopen "tel://+316123456789"/code emand/em clicking the 'Call' button. Or, you could have it open the Google Hangouts Chrome Extension and similarly dial a number.  Second, you would call the Automator script from the command line (as described here):   precodeopen MyAutomatorCaller.app --args '+316123456789' /code/pre  Lastly, you could create a Bash alias for the above command (i.e. in ~/.bash_profile):  precodecall() {      open MyAutomatorCaller.app --args $1 } /code/pre  <comment186259> What app does this? <comment186261> This is "Phone calls via iPhone" - also known as "Mac + iOS Continuity" (Yosemite + iOS8). <comment187258> FWIW it appears that pressing the Enter/Return key will press the 'Call' button, which may make automating this a little easier. <comment263683> If you don't have an iPhone, this will call using FaceTime, so the receiver will need to be an address that has that.
