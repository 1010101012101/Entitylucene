Why the service does not start after logging in <body> The service is jenkins installed with homebrew on Yosemite. I have this:  precode~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.jenkins.plist /code/pre  and this:  precode% launchctl list | grep jenkins -       0       homebrew.mxcl.jenkins /code/pre  and each time I login I need to start it manually. Not being familiar with launchd don't know where to find the cause. Grepped all the logs in /var/log/ looking for 'jenkins' and found nothing.  How to know what is hapening? Does launchd logs somewhere? Or maybe it doesn't even try to start poor jenkins because I missed something obvious?
