How do i make safari prevent search on addresses? <body> I have an internal server at the address codehttp://myserver/code. If I type codemyserver/page/code safari starts a google search. How can I disable this behavior?  I know I can prefix codehttp:///code and it will start working, but other browsers lets me just type the address and takes me there.   <answer284809> I think if you add a slash code//code at the end of the address, it won't search and it's easier than codehttp:///code at the beginning.
