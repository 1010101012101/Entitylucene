Putting display to sleep using windows keyboard <body> Is there some key combination to put the display on a mac to sleep using a windows keyboard, or somewhere where I can change the default key combinations?  <answer277578> You can utilise hot corners on mission control, indeed it's quite handy for putting monitor on sleep or show desktop.  Simply you can attribute a corner of your screen to put on sleeping your monitor (by mouse pointer though, not with your keyboard, If you are using mouse/trackpad)  To activate this on your mac:   preferences  mission control  hot corners  You will see four corners and many options for each corners.   <comment349485> I came across somewhere that you can use hot-corners and require holding down the cmd key for it to work, but I can't find anything explaining how to make this change, any idea? With hot corners alone I keep doing it by accident. <comment349496> @CorneliusJEhmke i think you can do it simply by: choose a hot corner action from drop down menu while you are pressing a shortcut you wish to make the combination. <comment349880> That's worked, thanks. but it's having a bit of a freakout about the peripherals attached to it now.. :P these things are such a nuisance
