OSX dock mysterious element <body> I have a mysterious element appearing on my dock that looks like the indicator under a folder but isn't actually attached to anything - any ideas how to get rid of this?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Gb9yN.png" alt="Screenshot of my dock"  If I turn on dock hiding it disappears when the dock is hidden but reappears when the dock is visible.  Hardware: Macbook Pro Retina 13 running OS X Yosemite 10.10.1  <answer160212> I managed to fix this by restarting the dock by running the following in the terminal:  precodekillall -KILL Dock /code/pre  <comment188381> It's the downloading indicator [thermometer], should fill from left to right as a download completes, but it seems to get stuck in Yosemite. Yours don't even look like it properly belongs to the app above it. You found the fix, though.
