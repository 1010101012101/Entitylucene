Apple TV Apps Question <body> I shared an Apple Tv with my ex. We recently just broke up and she took the Apple Tv, even though it was linked to my personal Apple ID. I changed my password so my account can't be accessed anymore.   My question is, if I purchase and download apps through my iphone, such as a dating site like match.com, will those downloads be visible on the Apple Tv? Or since I changed my password, will none of my app information be obtainable? I want to confirm that they wont because I don't want to deal with the drama if so.  I appreciate the help and apologize in advance if this is a dumb question. I am not very technically saavy with electronics as it is very apparent.  <answer268552> ol liHead over to iCloud/li liLogin with your user name and password/li liHead into settings. /li liScroll down to my devices. /li liClick on the Apple TV you wish to remove. /li liThat should open a dialog. There is a blue circle with an X in it. Click on it. That will disassociate your ID with the Apple TV. /li /ol
