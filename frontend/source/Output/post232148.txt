Manually deleted Time Machine backup files to trashcan....undo? <body> I was trying to free up space on my TByte external drive connected to my iMac by dragging files (folders for each "day", directly under "iMac" hard drive in Finder) to my trashcan.  I even provided the admin password to do this.  Now I realize that was a big mistake.  When I enter Time Machine now, my original backup from 2012 is still there (whew!)  However, I would like to return my trashcan files back to the external drive, but I can't seem to do that....it never seems to complete the transfer, saying "preparing to copy "million" files...."  I can't empty my trashcan either!  Any advice?  <comment283601> Please add additional info (or screenshots) to your question: Which files and folders did you drag to the trashcan: arbitrary single files and folders or one (or several) superior folder(s)?
