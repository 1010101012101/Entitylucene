Why can't I download apps on my iPhone 6s <body> I just got an iPhone 6s and I'm having trouble downloading apps. It keeps asking me to set up three security questions and when I do it says that it's downloading but then it asks me to set up security questions again, and if I say cancel then it stops downloading the app. I just keep going in circles which is quiet annoying. What can I do about this?   <answer214724> Sounds like this strongmay/strong be an issue with your AppleID. You do have an AppleID already? If not create one, you don't have to use an iCloud.com email address you can use whatever you currently use as your AppleID.  I would log into iCloud.com and check your account settings, security and most importantly, the security questions. Maybe even change your password. Once that is done, sign out of iCloud on your iPhone and sign back in with your new credentials.   Once you have signed in again, try downloading an app. It will likely ask you for a password but should not prompt for anything else.
