How to fix iTunes wrong song time? <body> My mp3 in iTunes shows a time of about 20 minutes, when it really have about 5 minutes. The VLC Player and the Windows Media Player shows the correct time for the same file, what's wrong with my iTunes?  <answer79894> The incorrect time is most likely due to an error introduced by the encoding software. You can repair the problem by using the emConvert to AAC/em feature in strongiTunes/strong.  In strongiTunes 11/strong this feature can be found under the emCreate New Version â†’/em option of the emFile/em menu.  <answer183245> The wrong time duration, is not solved with iTunes 11 and it's not depending from the encoding software (with the new releases of iTunes).  Even re-loading the file, deleting it form the device, often doesn't sovle the problem.  the only one effective solution I found (I got several times this issue) is:  ul liRemove the file with iTunes form your device/li liCheck if the song was really removed from the device, into the device itself with iTunes on the iPhone or iPad. If not, touch the title, shift your finger to left, and a red rectangle "DELETE" will appear and touch it./li liRename the file of the song and re-upload it./li /ul  The reason of the 3rd point above is that: I noticed that often, even applying the first 2 points, for some reason (unknown to me), the device still put the old duration and/or old parameters. Changing the original file name, solves the issue.  <answer243688> Mr. Van Cool's fix did not work.  Jaberg's suggestion worked, but I found an easier way to get to the "Convert ..." option.  From the songs menu, right click on the songs with the bad time &amp; "Convert to AAC" is in the popup menu.  Fixed 4 songs in under a minute, added the M4A files to my playist, and burning to CD worked as expected.  <answer260051> I had the same problem. My track was more than an hour, but it only showed 1h04mins. Converting to AAC or apple lossless didn't work for me.  Fixed it by using this app called Tag Stripper, https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tag-stripper/id432262744?mt=12  ol listrip the track of its ID3 tags/li liimport it fresh into iTunes. Track duration should be fixed now/li licmd+i to edit the id3 tags./li /ol  Done. There might be a simpler way, but this worked for me.
