Why is the Time machine exclusion list unsorted? <body> I noticed that when you add files to the Time machine exclusion list, it adds them in what appears to be a random order, it doesn't seem to be alphabetical or size-based, not even a queue.br Here I'm dragging the empty folder code~/etc/code and it only offers to insert it at that green line.br Any ideas why is this and if there is a specific order in this?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vpPYu.png" alt=""
