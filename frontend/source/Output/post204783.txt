No devel block is defined for automake? Error when using Homebrew <body> I'm getting an odd error that google seems to only have a handful of (unhelpful) results for.  When I use homebrew to try and install some dev libraries or tools, it's coming up:  precodebrew install -v --devel --fresh  automake autoconf libtool wget libimobiledevice **Error: No devel block is defined for automake** /code/pre  Any ideas on how to fix this or what I'm doing wrong?  <answer218317> This is because libmobiledevice is no longer on --devel branch, remove that and you should be all set.  codebrew install -v --fresh libimobiledevice /code
