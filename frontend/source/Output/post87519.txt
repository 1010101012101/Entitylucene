Cannot connect to specific website since OSX Mountain Lion install <body> I just installed Mountain Lion and everything is working pretty well except I can't connect to adobe.com.  I can not connect on any of the browsers (firefox, chrome, safari).  i can access the website on my other mac and my pc.  I've tried:  Adding a New Network Location &amp; Renew DHCP. Changing my MTU to 1453 Clearing my SystemConfiguration of Preference Files.  I don't know what to do. I can't install the adobe suite that i just bought because I can't access the website to authenticate it.   Please please help me, im desperate.   <answer87578> Some 'cracked' apps change the code/etc/hosts/code files so apps cannot connect to their servers to verify the credential or serials.  It looks like that could be your case.  Can you check: codesudo cat /etc/hosts/code from Terminal and check if any Adobe hostname is listed there?  If so, you have installed a cracked Adobe app.  <comment102295> Can you ping adobe.com and if sotraceroute to it? <comment102301> There is a very low probability that this relates to your situation, but may be worth a look. http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/42271/cant-access-particular-website-macbook-osx-lion <comment102305> If you open this on Terminal, a text file should open: "open /etc/hosts". Does yours have anything like an adobe website? <comment102376> yes! when I entered that command in terminal i got "#Activation Blocker" and then a whole string of text that has adobe.com on the end of it. (ie. 127.0.0.1 hl2rcv.adobe.com,  127.0.0.1 activate-sjc0.adobe.com ) what do I do with that? <comment102394> If Victoria does have a cracked app, do you have recommendations on how to find and remove it? <comment102395> I bought this computer from a co-worker a few years ago.  he may have had a cracked version of adobe suite installed.  i'm not sure. There is an old version on the mac but I want to install my legit copy and it won't let me.  I ran the command and theres a load of adobe host names that came up.  how do I get rid of them? <comment102398> Sounds like this is the case; this answer should be edited to include how to remove entries from the hosts file.
