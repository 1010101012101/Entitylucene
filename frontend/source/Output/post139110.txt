Macbook retina 15 3 external screens <body> I've read reviews about 3 external screens for late 2013 macbook pro 15 retina, and looks like there are different opinions about that. Some of videos I saw demonstrates the fact that it is possible connect all three screens at once.   But before buying all necessary components I would like to show what kind of screens I would like to purchase and what type of adapters I am about to use.   Could you please take a look for my build and let me know your opinion if it is going to work and if not, could you please describe correct way of connecting it.   3 BENQ Screens (1920 x 1080, 2 ms, VGA, DVI-D, HDMI)  2 screens will be connected using mini display port to HDMI Adapter  1 screen will be connected directly on HDMI port.  Do you think that build would work?   <answer139114> I have had problems with third party video adaptors, so I'd be hesitant to try that. Since your monitors have DVI ports, I'd go with two Apple Mini Display Port to DVI adaptors and use an HDMI cable for the third monitor.  <comment164093> Thanks a lot. Have you tried plugin two screens on DVI and one on HDMI, does it work? Because some people says that they able connect only two screens at once. <comment164096> Yes. I wasn't able to keep that setup for long, but it worked well while it lasted. <comment164128> Right! Thanks a lot! What happened with setup, did it broke your mac? <comment164138> No, Somebody else needed a monitor and I had four.
