OSX Lion 10.7.3 update has broken Safari <body> This happened right after I have upgraded to 10.7.3 via Software Update utility. Or maybe even 10.7.2 unfortunately cannot recall now.  Before update I saw nice page saying that Safari cannot connect to remote host.  Now I'm getting meaningless garbage. See sample screenshot. (My reputation is not high enough to post images)  Does anybody knows how this can be fixed?  Just to be clear, nothing is listening on localhost:8000  <answer57383> Update to Safari 6.0 has fixed the problem.  <comment56247> Seems like font caches problem. There are several programs that clean the font caches (you can find them easily) but I can't recommend any of them as I haven't used any of them.
