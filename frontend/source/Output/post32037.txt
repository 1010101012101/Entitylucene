How do I compile Doom3? <body> Has anyone compiled doom3, released here: https://github.com/TTimo/doom3.gpl ?  I have never done something like that before (compile c++/xcode project) and a how-to would be more than welcome.  Also how do I know if it can run in my macbook?   <answer32042> Why would you compile the engine? It is emnot/em the full game, so you wouldn't be able to play after compilation.  Anyway, if you're still interested, there's a thread on Hacker News speaking about it, they also mention how to compile the project if you don't have Xcode 3.2  Edit: for what is worth, here the instructions for Xcode 4.  <comment36750> I think you've spotted one of my biggest goofs ever. Got over excited and thought it was the actual game... <comment36784> @dim `This source release does not contain any game data, the game data is still covered by the original EULA and must be obeyed as usual.` It's in the README.txt
