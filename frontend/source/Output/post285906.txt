Is there a way to start speaking a word using macOS text to speech by hovering over it and pressing a shortcut? <body> I want it to speak the word without selecting it, just hovering over it + a shortcut. Or by pressing a shortcut after using the lookup feature in Mac.  <answer285910> You can use the following Keyboard Maestro macro:  ol liAdd a double click at current mouse location action./li liAdd a press ⌥⎋ action.br ⌥⎋ the default shortcut for ‘Speak selected text’, set in System Preferences → Accessibility → Speech. Change this to match the preference at that location./li liSet the macro to be triggered on a hot key./li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/OwNda.png" alt=""  <comment360694> Your first step says "_Add a double click at current mouse location action._" and doesn't that select the word? The OP said "_I want it to speak the word **without selecting it**, just hovering over it..._". (Emphasis added.) <comment360949> @user Yes, but I took it to mean that OP didn't want to select the word themselves and rather "just hovering over it".
