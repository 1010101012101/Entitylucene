Installing PostgreSQL on Snow Leopard <body> I've been trying to install PostgreSQL on my Snow Leopard in order to use django on Heroku. I decided to go with the graphical installer here (http://www.postgresql.org/download/macosx/). However, then I read the readme file which says you have to edit the shared memory in /etc/sysctl.conf. I couldn't find that file so ended up creating one through the touch command in terminal. But then when I open it through Terminal it says read-only and refuses to let me edit it. Does anyone know how to get around this? I'm a complete beginner and have been searching for solutions for hours without luck. Thanks for your help!  <comment107113> Related: http://stackoverflow.com/q/9248105/398670 <comment107114> I also tried to install PostgreSQL recently on Mac OS and need to create it. /etc/sysctl.conf is in system file and normally should be accessed for writing only for root. Try in console: `sudo vi /etc/sysctl.conf`
