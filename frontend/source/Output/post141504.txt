Mystery application? <body> Okay, so I was watching a WWDC video a while ago, and they were doing a demonstration on how to implement some code into your app...  And as they were demonstrating the code, the guy who was doing the demo was pulling blocks of code from a small window in the bottom right corner of the screen.  I thought that this would be a useful application to have (as I am an apple developer myself) and I thought it would save me a lot of time...  The only problem is I have no idea what this application is called and so do not have any information about it...  All I know is that the WWDC video is called "Optimize your earning power with iAd" and that the application in question is shown at 37:50 in the aforementioned video.  If someone could point me in the right direction as to where I should start my search I would be most thankful...  <answer141507> The little text snippet application they are using is called DemoMonkey. It's actually a sample code project on developer.apple.com from 2010.  <comment166927> there are a LOT of bugs in the code... Is there another application in existence that is similar to this? <comment166985> I'm not really sure if there are similar applications. If you feel like it could you log some of those bugs [here](https://github.com/wooster/DemoMonkey/issues) and I'll see if I can fix them. :)
