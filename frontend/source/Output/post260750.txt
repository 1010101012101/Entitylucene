Magsafe L design, after repair light always amber <body> So i repaired an L design magsafe connector for a friend (the wires were completely ripped off were they solder on the chip)   After the repair when plugged in the light goes amber (never green) and doesn't actually charge anything, I tested the voltage before and after its plugged in and it does ramp up to ~16 volts like its supposed to but its like the macbook never even notices its plugged in (I've tested this on multiple macbooks at work and for each the other charger works but not the repaired one.)  Does anyone know what just a constant amber light means?  Also not sure if it matters but I have only tested the charger on the macbooks at work and not on the macbook it actually goes with but I'm assuming it would behave the same.  <comment326484> How well did you heat-protect 'the chip' when you were soldering it? Best guess would be you fried it. <comment326496> I was afraid that might of been what happened.
