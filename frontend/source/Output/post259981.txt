MacOS server - OD certificate location weirdness <body> I hope someone can help with this.  I have 3 macOS servers running, all fully updated, one of them set as OD master and two replicas.  When I try and bind a client to the master, the certificate offered is messed up - host name mismatch caused by it being a .com domain on a server with a different hostname. Fair enough. Here's where it gets strange.  On the server itself a different (correct) cert is used to secure all services in the server app. In Keychain access, the incorrect host mismatched cert is nowhere to be found and all the identity preferences point to the correct certs. There is no mention of the .com cert in either keychain. Furthermore, this .com cert is also not present on either replica, is not present in /etc/certificates and is not mentioned in var/root/Library/Application Support/Certificate Authority.  Maybe I'm missing something really obvious, but I'd appreciate any help with figuring out just where the server is pulling this cert from, and how to change it to the correct one.
