How does find my iPhone work? <body> I had my iPhone 4 stolen a couple of years ago I thought recently to check I cloud find my phone to see if anything has changed as in come online. It hasn't . when it happened I went into icloud find my phone. It immediately said offline so I clicked lost mode. With failure of anything happening I clicked erase . it said erase will happen when iPhone comes back online. But it has never been back online.it had a 4,digit lock on it. When it was stolen i rang it and then it was switched off. I'm just wondering if find my phone was off will a erase of all my photos info texts etc be erased  if it ever comes back online? And what could the thief of done to stop it from coming online and a working phone?   <comment196043> This will get better answers if you limit it to a single question. <comment196048> We will not tell you how to hack a phone after it has been lost or stolen. For the find my phone to find it, it has to go online with the original identifiers. <comment196070> I don't know weather find my phone was on. when going on to find my phone it said offline I have erased the phone but it says erase will happen when phone comes online. So when the phone connects to internet will a erase happen even though find my phone is not on?
