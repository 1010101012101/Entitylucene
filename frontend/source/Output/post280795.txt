Anyone get freezing cursor while windows update? <body> I'm getting random freezes of my cursor and I'm unable to find a pattern or recreate it. Most recent freeze was while looking at an Ask Different page in Citrio and it lasted about 20 seconds.  Has anyone else experienced this behavior or does anyone have any suggestions as to where to look to find the cause?   My system setup is: iMac 5k, 10.12.4, 1tb ssd, 32gb ram, logitech wired mouse, apple wired keyboard.
