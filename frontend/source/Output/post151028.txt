Mac Dictation - How to select backspace? <body> Using OS X 10.9 and 10.10 dictation, I can find/use the various grammatical commands as shown here. Is there a way to select back, erase, cancel?  When I try these words, they are typed not implemented.  Thanks  <answer159329> Solution 1: You can say "Press backspace key" (at least with 10.10).  hr  Solution 2: You can define the voice command "backspace" that triggers an automator workflow that sends a delete keystroke:  precodeon run {input, parameters}  tell application "System Events"     keystroke (ASCII character 127) end tell  return input  end run /code/pre  hr  Solution 3: You can use BetterTouchTool (free):  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/I4Emw.png" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/y6FKs.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer267596> When I say "Press Backspace Key", the dictation system usually types "Christmas". I have to say it very slowly and deliberately, and then it works.  <comment187269> Thanks a ton, I will play with these options.
