curl isn't outputting what it used to <body> I had programs that relied on using curl in the terminal (bash) and one day thy just stopped working. I realized this was because the output of curl had changed for some reason. I thought maybe the website had changed but I tried another one of my programs that used it and it also didn't work. I then just typed in "curl google.ca" to see what happened, and it gave me this:   301 Moved H1301 Moved/H1 The document has moved A HREF="http://www.google.ca/" rel="nofollow"here/A.   (idk how to show the raw HTML, which is obviously what I recieved with curl) which isn't what it had done before. I haven't the slightest idea why this is happening. I haven't noticed any difference in my web browsing experience. What's going on here?  <comment284386> Try `curl -sL google.ca` or `curl -L google.ca` <comment284397> Ooo the s option is awesome, didn't know about that. Yeah that works, thanks. Any idea why I didn't need to use it before then everything switched the same day? <comment284403> Never mind, I was wrong. My things still don't work. I must have had something left over in an maybe was typing the command wrong so it wasn't overridden. Also one of the sites that has changed and become useless doesn't have the moved thing, so -L does nothing for that. could you try this URL on your computer for me and see what you get?: http://uwsmashclub.challonge.com/UWmelee26. For me it used to have all the data for all the matches that I could then process, now it has nothing like that at all. <comment284404> Yeah I just vied the page source and it's exactly what I USED to get with curl.
