Is it possible to make a hotkey for switching audio output? <body> I am using external monitors. Because of this, whenever my mac goes to sleep, it automatically redirects output to the monitor. This is annoying to fix, as I have to move my mouse and click to fix it every time. Is there a way to set a hotkey to toggle the sound output for me? something like codecommand+shift+s/code  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YzuXm.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer258043> Since you only have the two output devices, the following emcode/em will toggle between the two.  pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"codetell application "System Preferences"     activate     set current pane to pane "com.apple.preference.sound"     tell application "System Events"         tell application process "System Preferences"             tell tab group 1 of window "Sound"                 click radio button "Output"                 if (selected of row 2 of table 1 of scroll area 1) then                     set selected of row 1 of table 1 of scroll area 1 to true                 else                     set selected of row 2 of table 1 of scroll area 1 to true                 end if             end tell         end tell     end tell     quit end tell /code/pre  I test this as an Automator Service using a Run AppleScript emaction/em and then assigned it a hot-key combo and it works on my system having only two sound outputs.  The tricky part is going to be finding a hot-key combo that isn't assigned to any or all apps already.  As an example kbdcommand/kbdkbdshift/kbdkbds/kbd is Save As... in Safari, but if the Desktop has focus when pressed it works to trigger the Service.  ol liOpen Automator./li liFile  New  Service, with setting as shown in the image./li liAdd a Run AppleScript emaction/em an replace the default emcode/em with the emcode/em Above./li liSave the Service as, e.g.: Toggle Sound Device/li liAssign it a keyboard shortcut in: System Preferences  Keyboard   Shortcuts  Services/li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/EN9Uu.png" alt="Toggle Sound Device"  <comment322467> See my answer to http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/217148/using-apple-script-to-manage-sound-output-selection/218223#218223 - you could use this in Automator, saved as a Service. <comment322475> Thanks @Tetsujin. I am having trouble implementing that for my problem. I am new to applescript. <comment322478> Thanks! Where do I put this script? <comment322479> @kilojoules, See updated answer.
