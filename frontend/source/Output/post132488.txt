How to resize the file system of a linaro img <body> I am following the instructions here to setup an ARM VM for the Open Security training "Intro to ARM".  How to set up an ARM VM for Open Security Training's "Intro to ARM" course  In the instructions it says:     Then use parted or gparted (not available on Mac, unfortunately) on   the image to actually resize the file system.   Now, I have successfully used gparted to resize the file on a linux VM, but I was wondering how I might do this on the Mac.   They do note:     Mac users might want to copy the .img file to a linux box/VM and run   parted there. There is probably a contrived way using fdisk and   resize2fs   Can anyone provide that contrived method?
