How To Disable Lion Ellipsis Autocorrect <body> Every time i write code.../code in a text editor like TextEdit or Coda, Lion has started replacing it with a single Ellipse character, which doesn't encode to HTML. This started after I upgraded to Lion and happens across multiple programs. Any idea how to stop it?  <answer27116> Go to System Preferences, select codeLanguage &amp; Text/code, then the codeText/code tab, and deselect the box for that option. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/k1HkQ.png" alt="enter image description here"  Or you can disable the feature completely by deselecting the box at the top.  <answer111941> In Mavericks at least, this seems to be controlled by the "Use smart quotes and dashes" feature found in System Preferences → Keyboard → Text. Uncheck the box, and the behavior goes away, even in Evernote.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0PLkX.png" alt="System Preferences → Keyboard → Text → Use smart quotes and dashes"  <answer157527> If "Smart Quotes" is active in Keyboard Settings but you don't want smart ellipses, Edit menu in most applications on OS X Yosemite, unchecking "Smart Dashes" found in Edit - Substitutions - Show Substitutions stops autocorrect of three periods to ellipsis.img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/TuEGx.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment127156> Thanks. I have done this and it works in all apps except Evernote. Evernote has no pref for this in the Preferences. Any idea of how to fix it? Thanks for entertaining this random aside. <comment127193> @Yar Sorry, I don't know. You could ask your own question specifically for Evernote and see if someone else does. <comment145022> I'm using TextEdit on 10.9.2, and I'm finding that I have to restart TextEdit for this change in System Preferences to take effect. <comment185296> Certain apps seem to not respect the system "substitution" settings. In Adium, for instance, turn off ellipsis by opening a chat window, right-clicking in the textbox (where you type a message), then select `Substitutions` and de-select `Smart Dashes`. I could not find this setting in the actual `Adium-Preferences` dialog. A similar sequence might work for other apps with a composition field. See also [this other answer](http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/157527/97853). <comment202345> Resolved within Textedit or system wide? <comment346041> See hoc_age's comment in the "hooked" answer - to get to this menu, you sometimes have to right-click on the input fields of the program that is suffering this issue. That is, the "Substitutions" menu item isn't in the Menu Bar, and only can be "found" by right-clicking on *input fields*. Bah.
