Internet Recovery failed -1006f <body> My problem is same as with this question -1006F error message when trying to recover mac  I have follow that question which direct me to this thread  https://discussions.apple.com/message/22273842#22273842  from this link it says I need to buy new harddisk, so I bought a new one and installed it.  Now when I boot up the macbook it automatically goes in to internet recovery, but again in middle of loading I still get the -1006f error again?  <answer177791> It's solved already.  The problem is my internet connection not stable at that moment. when I had a stable connection it worked flawlessy!  <comment207670> There is a step missing. Did you format your new disk? Did your reset your PRAM ?
