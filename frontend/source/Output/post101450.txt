Does Mountain Lion (10.8.4) come with SharePoint plug-ins, or did I just install these? <body> I did a custom installation of Microsoft Office 2011 for Mac on my MacBook Air running 10.8.4., but I changed my mind and decided to uninstall it.  I only installed Word, Excel, and Proofing Tools (English only).  I'm reading up on how to fully remove all the tidbits Microsoft sprinkled about, and I noticed a couple files on my system:  precode/Library/Internet Plug-Ins/SharePointBrowserPlugin.plugin /Library/Internet Plug-Ins/SharePointWebKitPlugin.webplugin /code/pre  I didn't include SharePoint in the installation, so I'm not sure that's where these files came from. It's a new machine, so the only alternative is that they were included with OS X 10.8.4, in which case I'm inclined to leave them be.  Does anybody know more about these files, where they likely came from?  <answer101454> Those two files are not part of Apple's installed software on 10.8.4.  I would chalk it up to Microsoft's installer.  You can research this in depth with a tool like Pacifist by http://www.charlessoft.com
