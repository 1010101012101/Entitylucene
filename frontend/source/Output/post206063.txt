Yosemite - Require password after sleep is disabled <body> I am trying to prevent the system to always ask for the password when it wakes up from sleep.   ul liI have a MacbookPro with Yosemite 10.10.5. /li liUser has admin rights and password different than the iCloud one. /li liFileVault is off./li /ul  The System Preferences  Security and Privacy  "Require password [5 seconds] after sleep or screen saver begins" is disabled and there's no way to enable it.   If I execute codedefaults read com.apple.screensaver/code i get:  precode{     askForPassword = 0; } /code/pre  If I execute codedefaults -currentHost write com.apple.screensaver askForPasswordDelay -int 3600/code the defaults don't change...  <answer234840> Run on terminal.app;  Admin@MacBook. script bash. #!/bin/sh bash. defaults write com.apple.screensaver askForPassword -bool false  <comment248436> Are you using your own Mac or a company supplied Mac? That the option is disabled suggests a managed default is in place. <comment249107> It's my own Mac :( <comment249108> In the same time, if I create a new user, for that one I can access the option. So there's something about this user that is messed up...
