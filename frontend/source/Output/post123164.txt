Change highlight color in Mavericks preview? <body> In Preview on OS X 10.9 Mavericks, is it possible to change the color to something other than yellow, green, blue, pink, purple?  I know it is possible to highlight in other colors because I did it while using Preview for the first time after upgrading to Mavericks, but now that I've changed I can't seem to change back.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Q5JGl.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer124793> I'm afraid this is not possbile anymore as Apple removed the workaround via the Fonts-Menu.  Discussed in the Apple Support Forum here : br/ https://discussions.apple.com/thread/4145911?start=15&amp;tstart=0 br/ (same problem with underline colors) br/ and on MacRumors here : http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=1658053 br/ where they discussed what has changed since ML. br/  <answer128270> There is another workaround, which is actually a bug I think, but mah...  ol liSuppose you want to underline in blue. Highlight something in blue./li liRight-click on what you just highlighted, and make it underlined instead./li liSelect the underline tool./li liDo cmd-z twice. This will remove the underline you just did./li liUnderline what you want: it will be underlined in blue! :)/li /ol  Steps 2 and 3 are actually interchangeable.  strongEdit/strong: I have actually better:  ol liWrite any text with color 1./li liChange its color to color 2./li liSelect the highlight or underline tool./li liDo cmd-z. This should change the text color back to color 1. (If it is not the case, make sure the text you have written is not selected.)/li liYou now have the underline/highlight tool selected with the color box accessible. Select your color (even if already selected), then highlight/underline./li /ol  This was my Preview bug finding day :) Enjoy!  <answer142514> To change the highlight color simply right click a highlighted selection then choose another color  <answer151560> Unfortunately, that workaround no longer works in Yosemite. Instead, you can use this small utility to modify the color externally. http://qiita.com/cielavenir/items/eb9c24085c202d72c0ab (confirmed to be working also on Mavericks)  <answer189518> ol liSelect the underline option/li liUnderline text by selecting/li liRight click on underlined text and change it to a highlight color/li liUnderline text again by selecting/li liRight click again on underlined text and choose a different color/li /ol  The new highlighted color will be a mix of the two different colors.br Sort of like mixing food coloring; for example try mixing two yellows with a pink.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1j9aB.png" alt="Screenshot"  <answer244984> I'm using El Capitan. In Preview choose View--Customize Toolbar... Select the highlight tool and add it to your tool bar. Now you can hit the dropdown arrow and choose a color for highlighting.  <comment216575> I have the colour box available, but cannot reproduce being able to highlight with the selected colour at that point. Are you on 10.10.3? <comment301971> The question is about "to change the color to something **other than** yellow, green, blue, pink, purple". Your answer is to change the color in these predefined colors.
