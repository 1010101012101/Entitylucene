Numbers: how do I create a column with a sequence of times? <body> In Numbers, I would like to create a column with automatically generated cells to create a timetable with each hour and each half hour.  I create a new document, type in "7:30 AM" and then in the cell below I type in "8:00 AM" then I drag downwards from the first cell, but it doesn't work, it replaces "8:00 AM" by "8:30 AM" but I only want 30 mns increments...  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YmEXO.png" alt="enter image description here"  I tried changing the cell format to "date and time" but it just erases whatever I typed and replaces it by today's date and time or random dates and times...  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/PKL8U.png" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/JJBGk.png" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LqW6P.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer204297> The formula syntax in Numbers is actually less intuitive and more stubborn than Excel IMO. Nevertheless, to create time intervals:  ol liIn the first cell, say codeB2/code, type code8:00 AM/code/li liIn the following cell, type code=B2+"30m"/code  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kWpbO.jpg" width="285"/li liemNow/em, drag down:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/e01Qs.jpg" width="351"/li liVoilà:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FOLTM.jpg" width="353"/li /ol  <answer204316> In addition to njboot's answer, If you wish to drag and apply the ½ hour increments emwithout entering a formula/em,  be sure to select strongBoth/strong cells before dragging down the yellow dot.  This will copy the pattern down (or across, for that matter.)  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HBkPO.png" width="109" title="Select Both Cells to drag formatting"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ljCDw.png" width="109" title="Dragged cells"  hr /  h3emEdit:/em/h3  If you want to use a formula:  Use Duration:  codeDURATION(weeks, days, hours, minutes, seconds, milliseconds)/code   Using emDuration/em one can then adjust the increments later on affecting all cells with one simple change.  For example, suppose you wish to change it to 15 minute increments or 2 hour or 25 minutes.  This can be accomplished using a dynamic formula to allow for greater flexibility in your solution.  One could add a new table (or use hidden cells or whatever tickles one's fancy) to create an area where a number can be added that will change the increments universally.  h3Create Duration formula:/h3  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jS8KX.png" width="400" alt="Duration Formula" /  Notice that strongHours/strong and strongMinutes/strong are tied to cells that can be adjusted without changing the formula.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/BMnm7.png" width="400" alt="Formula to increment time" /  h3Then, after dragging down the formula, just change the increments when desired./h3  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/AH5fy.png" width="300" alt="30 minute" / img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YB6lW.png" width="300" alt="15 minute" /  <comment246213> Awesome! But I think you mean "Voilà" :) <comment246220> @fabriced Sì! colpa mia :)
