How to make a semi-transparent arrow added with Preview on a PDF map visible on an iPhone via Safari? <body> I had posted a map on a website showing a bike itinerary loop and was asked to add a directional arrow showing which way to go along the loop. Good question ! (https://abeille-cyclotourisme.fr/programmes/pdf_2017/2017-03-16_velofourchette.pdf). &lt;-- On this link, the arrows *are visible if you flatten the PDF   CONVOLUTED CURE. I found a complicated cure to the above question: Open the PDF file with Graphic converter, select dynapdf importer rather than Apple Quartz PDF importer, Graphic Converter  Picture  Alpha channel  Flatten. Then recompress again the pdf file with Preview. The above link points to the corrected file, where the arrows are visible on my iPhone  MAKING THE ARROWS. I opened the PDF file with Preview and added semi-transparent arrows to the map (Preview  Tools  Annotate  Arrow) and uploaded the annotated pdf file to the server. The arrows were visible on the map on any browser on the mac. But they were not visible on Safari for iPhone (5c) nor iPad mini 1st generation.   Hence the question: what did I do wrong ? can anyone explain ?  <comment346419> I've tried to make this one question. If I focused on the less important question, please re-ask that question in a second thread and link here for continuity / context.
