How to repair bootcamp after partitioning for triple boot <body> I already had El Capitan and Windows running smoothly. I needed to add a partition so I could triple boot into Ubuntu. OS X and Ubuntu both work perfectly now but my Boot Camp side seems to have gotten screwed up.  I now get the following error when I try and go onto my windows partition: "Recovery. Your PC needs to be repaired. Error code: 0x000000e"  The thing is, on my Mac side, I can still see Boot Camp under devices and I can access my files. Any ideas how to resolve this problem?  Thanks in advance for any help!  <answer245858> While booting press kbd⌘ Command/kbd  kbdR/kbd to start OS X Recovery (if it doesn't work do kbd⌘ Command/kbd kbd⌥ Option/kbd  kbdR/kbd)  Select your disk and click codePartition/code, after that, press "-" (minus) to remove the partitions you don't want.  <answer253351> Last time when I tries to partition my Mac, Bootcamp got messed up, what I did is boot into the Windows 10 installer (CD or USB). You can download an ISO here, then burn it to an DVD disc or USB drive. Then pass through the language selection screen, when you get to a screen that says Install Now, there should be a button on the bottom left corner saying Repair This Computer (or something like that, I don't have the CD right now). You should get to a screen similar to this, click Advanced options:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/EwOqh.png" alt="Troubleshoot"  Now click on Startup Repair:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uZSeh.png" alt="Advanced"  Then follow the instruction to fix startup, then you should be able to boot back into Windows 10.  Hope this help.  P.S. This seems like a problem with the MBR when you partition the drive.  If that can't fix Windows 10 startup, you may be having some problems with the Windows partition.  <comment303143> Select your disk how and in what?  You seem to be missing a few steps here. <comment314981> How does that solve OP's problem though ? <comment314982> @RetroCode You would have to add **your** `diskutil list`, `sudo gpt -r show /dev/disk0` and `sudo fdisk /dev/disk0` outputs to the original question (by editing it) or you won't get a proper answer. MCCCS'  answer is completely wrong.
