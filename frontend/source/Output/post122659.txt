Applescript click action working, but generating a System Events error <body> I'm working with an AppleScript that turns off (but does not quit) Hazel. The script works fine but generates a syntax error.   Here's the part of the code causing the error:  precodetell application "System Events"     tell process "System Preferences"         set frontmost to true         click radio button "Info" of radio group of window "Hazel"     end tell end tell /code/pre  And here's the error:     System Events got an error: radio button "Info" of radio group of window "Hazel" of    process "System Preferences" doesn’t understand the “click” message.   I'm sure there's a simple fix, but I'm new to AppleScript and not much of a programmer. Any help would be greatly appreciated.  <answer139598> This code works great. Please pay attention to "radio group 1" part. Took me several hours to figure that out. :-/  precodetell application "System Preferences"     activate     set current pane to pane id "com.noodlesoft.Hazel" end tell tell application "System Events"     tell process "System Preferences"         set frontmost to true         click radio button "Info" of radio group 1 of window "Hazel"         delay 1         click button "Stop Hazel" of group 0 of group 0 of window "Hazel"     end tell  end tell /code/pre
