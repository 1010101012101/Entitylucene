How to open a searched file in Finder? <body> When I search a file in Spotlight, it provides me a good result. But the problem is that I want to open the file in Finder, instead of directly opening the file in an application. How can I open in searched files in Finder, meaning that I want to open the folder that contains the searched files in Finder?  If I can do what I want in another application like Alfred, that will be also wonderful.  <answer120001> Highlight the result in Spotlight, then strongpress ⌘↩︎/strong. This will open the containing folder in Finder.  hr  Alfred will also let you do this, with a bit more customisation:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/PYA5K.png" width="400"
