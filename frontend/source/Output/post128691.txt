Set Safari 7 dv tools console to clear on reload? <body> I use Safari 7.03 for web development.  One thing I noticed is that the console log doesn't re-set on a reload of the page.  You need to clear it manually.  So if you run a page with a JS error, it shows, then you fix the error in your JS code and reload the page and the error is still in the log -- but it's from the LAST time.  Chrome clears the error log every time.  Is this a setting in Safari somewhere?  <answer128822> Either inline in your HTML, or in an external Javascript file.  Call the function codeconsole.clear();/code  Now, every time you go to reload your page, the console will be cleared.  <comment150735> yes, this is annoying. Especially when the little clear console trashcan has chosen to disappear. <comment242686> This does not work in Safari. Apparently a bug? <comment294756> this same in safari 9.1
