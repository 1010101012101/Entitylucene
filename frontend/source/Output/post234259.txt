View and delete individual messages directly from POP server in OS X Mail <body> There is/was a feature in OS X Mail that allowed to fetch the list of messages from the server in a configured POP account. This fetched only message headers - all at once - and displayed the list in a window then allowed to individually select messages and delete them directly from the server. Not all messages via the Preferences - Accounts - Advanced - Remove now option but individually.  I can't seem to find this option any more. Was this removed from Mail or just well hidden?  <answer234314> ul liIf accounts are inside a global Inbox, open the Inbox reveal arrow  /li liRight Click the individual account Inbox  Get Account Info    img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rmFz3.png" alt="enter image description here"/li liSelect the Messages on Server tab  /li liWait for it to load, then you can select &amp; delete any/all messages on the server/li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ANjZr.png" width="400"
