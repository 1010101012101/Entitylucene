How to stop iMovie removing high frequency audio when exporting? <body> i have inserted a high frequency audio (more than 18000Hz) into a Movie, it is to test if children can hear that frequency during my video presentation. However, iMovie does not allow anything above a certain frequency to be exported.  I have tried exporting as Quicktime: I used the following sound settings  Linear PCM  but when i click on preview and use a sound analyzer, it still doesn't detect the frequency.  Someone please help  <comment54835> which version of iMovie? <comment54837> iMovie '11 is the current one i'm using
