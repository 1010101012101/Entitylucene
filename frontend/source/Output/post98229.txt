iPhoto - Removing image files that weren't taken by a camera <body> I recently attempted to import my archive of 20000 photos into iPhoto - unfortunately I found out that some of the imported images were not photos but things I downloaded from the internet.  I would like to know how I can filter these images according to their Exif tags. I want to specify the cameras whose photos I want to keep - and the rest I want to delete. Is this possible using iPhoto / is there a script that will do this?  Any help is much appreciated.  <answer98236> You can create a smart album to divide your pictures into the ones you wish to keep &amp; the ones to delete. There are several metadata fields you can use to create an album that divides your images - you should likely start with the Camera Model field.  So, to do this,  ol liSelect New Smart Album in iPhoto/li liUnder Match the following condition, select Camera Model is (whatever camera you wish to retain)./li liIf you have several cameras create more than one condition, and change the "Match all of the following conditions" to "Match any of the following conditions."/li /ol  Depending on your setup, you can reverse this search - instead creating a Smart Album that contains just the images that weren't taken with any of your cameras, and then deleting the downloaded ones...  <comment115333> What exif tags are you looking for? <comment116470> Worked perfectly, accepted this. Thanks.
