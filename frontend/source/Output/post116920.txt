OS X 10.6 kinit hangs on ticket renewal <body> I (grudgingly) upgraded an old Mac Mini from 10.5 to 10.6 last September (and the likelihood of me upgrading beyond that for this little beast is slim to none). I have been using an AFS cell as my distributed file system without any problems until this upgrade.  Often, but not always, when I go to renew the Kerberos ticket, codekinit/code will hang indefinitely until I kbdCtrl/kbd-kbdC/kbd it. And that's when really weird things start to happen:  ul lino subsequent processes will start/li lino subsequent files or sockets will open/li lino existing process with an open file or socket can be killed./li /ul  Existing processes, however, with existing sockets (e.g. iTunes with an MP3 stream going) keep going (but try to kill the process and it will hang). The system can't be shut down from the menu or the shutdown/reboot commands, and in this state the only recourse is to hard power-cycle the machine. If the screen saver is on, it appears frozen, or alternatively a black screen with just the mouse cursor.  I originally thought this was a problem with AFS, but upon further inspection, I can replicate this behaviour without even touching AFS.  The one major difference I spotted between 10.5 and 10.6 kinit is that the latter seems to use the keychain, as it doesn't ask for a password. Worth noting: I have SSHKeychain installed, and clicked "Unlock Apple Keychain" before invoking codekinit/code after my ticket expired and it didn't hang as it usually does. Is it possible that codekinit/code is choking on a locked keychain, and that somehow has a ripple effect on the rest of the system?  Does this sound familiar to anybody? I've been power-cycling this machine every ten hours for the last five months and I'd love to give it a break.  <comment142881> Worth noting: `kinit` has never hung on me if I run `sudo dscacheutil -flushcache` first.
