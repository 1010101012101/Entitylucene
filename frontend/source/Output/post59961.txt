Setting up dual monitors on MacBook Pro with Retina <body> I just got my strongMacBook Pro with Retina/strong yesterday and I bought a strongMini DisplayPort to VGA Adapter/strong to setup dual monitor, it worked fine.  Today I tried to connect Retina with my external monitor, I tried again and again.  My Macbook Pro just can't detect the monitor why?  <comment69213> Try to reboot your rMBP first. <comment69215> I've tried reboot and several methods yesterday, it couldn't work. Today I boot my RMBP and it works! I don't know what's happening..., whatever it works fine right now! thanks for helping:) <comment237667> What is model of your monitor? Why VGA and not a digital connection? Is it a CRT?
