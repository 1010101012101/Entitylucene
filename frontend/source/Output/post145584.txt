How to change terminal $HOME variable? My terminal can't even be opened now <body> I mean change $HOME not by defining in ~/.bash_profile, but loading the variable when shell opens.  By the way, after some misoperation I cannot even get into the Terminal now... It now says [Process completed] and does not respond, as it should when every time it exits. Is there a way to configure or re-install the Terminal?  <answer145591> I think the reason your terminal is acting up is that the default command has been changed somehow.  In preferences-Startup see what is set img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/BFbGn.png" alt="terminal preferences"  I suspect that the Command is running something other than a shell. Change it back to Default login shell and all will be fine.  <answer145600> By default the code$HOME/code variable is set to your home directory, you have nothing to do yourself in code.bash_profile/code. I think something goes wrong in the process of starting your Terminal session. It is likely that your code~/.bash_profile/code is corrupt.  You can fix this without your terminal:  ul liOpen TextEdit and press kbdCommand/kbdkbdO/kbd to open a file./li liPress kbdCommand/kbdkbdShift/kbdkbdG/kbd and enter code~//code to go to your home directory./li liNow press kbdCommand/kbdkbdShift/kbdkbd./kbd, this will make sure you can see hidden files./li liOpen code.bash_profile/code, create a backup if needed, delete the contents and save./li /ul  This should fix your problem. You can try this for code~/.profile/code (if it exists) as well.  You can check your codeHOME/code variable by opening Terminal and type:  precodeecho $HOME /code/pre  This will return your current home directory. It is most likely that you do not want to change this. But if so, it is best to change it just before you run the command, not in your code.bash_profile/code.  hr  This example will show you how to change your HOME temporarily (for Bash):  precode# store original HOME location ('/User/CousinCocaine') ORIGHOME="$HOME" # set new home location     HOME="/User/CousinCocaine/my/new/home/is/here" # check new home location echo "~/ " ~/ echo "\$HOME "$HOME"" # set home location back to original HOME="$ORIGHOME" # test old home location echo "~/ " ~/ echo "\$HOME "$HOME"" /code/pre  <comment171597> You have likely made a typo in your `.bash_profile` file. <comment171664> Yep, I open shell with /usr/sh and everything goes fine. Thanks <comment171813> Then it is almost certain you have a corrupt `.bash_profile` file. In sh, do a `rm ~/.bash_profile` to remove this file and then your bash is up and running again. My strong advise is to use bash as your default shell instead of sh. good luck.
