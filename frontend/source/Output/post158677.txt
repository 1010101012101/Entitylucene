Is there a way to do per-application rules in pfctl/alf? <body> I'd like to implement a mitmproxy for a single application on my mac. Pfctl doesn't natively have (from what I can see) support to set rules based on the application source/dest of the packets, but the Application Level Filter (ALF) does. Is there a way to combine the two? From what I can see, the only rules you can apply to ALF is a simple accept/deny flag, nothing more. I'd ideally like to apply a 'rdr' rule within alf  <answer158689> Have you looked at this post (see comment dated 30 Aug from user mhils)?  Basically, running in mitmproxy in transparent mode can be accomplished with the -T argument.  It appears that this is supposed to provide access to the PID of the source process, but I am not sure that the destination process id is captured.  I am not a user of mitmproxy, so please let me know if this helps.  Cheers, Byron
