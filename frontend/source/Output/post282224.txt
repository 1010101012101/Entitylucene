How do I download a Facebook messenger audio file? <body> A loved one recorded an audio message on Facebook messenger for me; it looks like the image below. I'm trying to download it, but nearly all of the ways to capture it don't see that the file exists, and the one exception to that downloaded a file that nothing can open.  Can someone please tell me how to download this file such that it can be played? I have 10.9.5, if that makes a difference. Thanks!  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/L1s5I.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer282234> Instead of downloading the audio file you can use an audio grabber to record it during playback. I've got good results with Piezo in the past.   <answer282540> I'm sure there are many other methods but I will give you two simple examples here. And I will safelly assume that you have access to the macOS Safari Browser...  hr  h3Method 1/h3  ol liGo to the chat that contains the audiofile you want on Facebook's Messenger Website./li liOpen the codeDevelop -&gt; Show Web Inspector/code/li liGo to the strongcodeNetwork/code/strong tab/li liGo back to the the chat and press the "Play" button of the file you want to download/li liIf you go back to the codeNetwork/code tab you'll notice that a codeaudioclip-xxxxxxxxxxxxx-xxxx.aac/code audio file has been loaded.

From there navigate to your messages and you will see downward arrow at the end of the audio clip. Click this and your audio will be downloaded to your default location on your computer, most likely your downloads folder.  Then go back to the normal version of Facebook by replacing m. with www.  Hope this helps  <comment356025> I was able to use the second method without problems, both on the messenger website and in the message area on Facebook-thanks! I have a question about the first method, though; I don't appear to have a Network tab… is it called something different on Mavericks, or is it hidden someplace non-obvious? <comment356026> Try updating `Safari`. Which version are you using? <comment356044> I'm using Safari 7.1.6. According to my husband, who built my Hackintosh, I can't get a newer Safari until he updates the operating system, but he doesn't feel like doing that at this time. Do I just not have a Network tab? <comment356045> @Goingcrazy maybe under the `Timeline` tab? <comment356063> I have a tab called Timelines, and under it there is something called Network Requests… But it, and all the other options, bring up totally empty grids of some sort. <comment356077> @Goingcrazy that's is probably because nothing has been loaded / requested yet. Open the network timeline, go back and click on the "play" button. This will send a request to the server for the audio file and should show up in the web inspector. <comment356168> I tried it; no luck. All I still have is a blank grid. <comment358513> Then [Audacity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audacity_(audio_editor)) should work too. <comment371909> The mobile site cannot be loaded in my version of Safari. It DOES load in Firefox, but I don't get any kind of arrow anywhere associated with an audio clip. However, when I clicked on the file name itself, it gave me an option to download it! Thanks! :-)
