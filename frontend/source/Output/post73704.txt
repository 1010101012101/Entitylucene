Smart mailbox for senders who are not members of a group <body> I want to set up a smart mailbox in Mail that contains messages from any sender who is emnot/em a member of a particular group in my address book.  There's an option in the smart mailbox rules for "sender is member of group," but I don't see a way to negate it. Is this possible?  <answer73707> This is maybe a bit counter intuitive but you can do it via the Contacts app.    You can make an intelligent group in your Contacts app with the criteria:   ul liis not member in group/li /ul  and use this group for your smart mailbox.  <comment85623> Ha! So it's a smart mailbox in Mail for people who *are* members of the smart group in Contacts of people who are *not* members of another group. That's smart but totally non-obvious :)
