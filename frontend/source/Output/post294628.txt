How to sync movies from iTunes on my Mac to my iPhone? <body> I want to enjoy my iTunes digital media files on my iPhone because I am going on a trip. I currently have movies on my Mac, how can I sync them to my phone?  <answer294748> Make sure you can add the movies to iTunes on the Mac. A general rule is only .mp3, .mp4, .m4a, and .m4v files will be added. Once you can see them in your iTunes library, connect your iPhone to your mac with a USB/Lightning cable and sync the movies to your iPhone.  <answer294758> supemKeep scrolling for instructions for non-iTunes movies/em/sup  h2For media purchased through iTunes:/h2  Star by finding the media. All movies in iTunes can be found in the dropdown, under strong"Movies"/strong:br img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/d3wQW.png" width="300"/  First, check to see if your movie has the cloud icon on its cover, like this:br img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LoLf6.png" width="175" /  If it strongemDOES/em/strong:br Right click it and select strongDownload/strong in the right click menu. Wait for the download to complete. This will take a while depending on the size of the movie and your internet connection speed. Once completed, the cloud should disappear and you can continue on with these directions.  If the title strongdoesn't have a cloud/strong (or you completed the above steps):  Connect your phone to your computer and select it next to the dropdown on the navigation bar. Select strongMovies/strong in the emsidebar/em and check strongSync Movies/strong.  If you do not want to sync all your movies in iTunes, you should uncheck the strongAutomatically include.../strong box and select the movies you wish to sync.  Now, just press the sync button on the bottom of the screen. This will probably take awhile because of the size of movies.  h2For non-iTunes media:/h2  Start by dragging and dropping each movie you'd like to add into the Home Videos section. This is found under the strongMovies/strong page:br img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/d3wQW.png" width="300"/    Here's the home videos tab:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ffjg9.png" width="200"/  Now that you've dragged and dropped all your media into the strongHome Videos/strong tab, now you can sync it to your phone. Connect your phone to your computer and select it in the navigation bar. Select strongMovies/strong in the sidebar, and check the strongSync Movies/strong checkbox.   If you have other movies you do not want synced to your phone, uncheck the strongAutomatically include.../strong box and manually select the movies you'd like to download.  Press strongSync/strong at the bottom of the window and you're done! (after the phone syncs, of course)  <comment371911> Usually you can connect the iPhone to the computer running iTunes and sync from within the application. What happens if you do that? Did you already check on Apple.com? <comment373293> Thanks a lot for the useful message. <comment373323> @Sophialing If this answer helped you, you can click the check mark to accept it.
