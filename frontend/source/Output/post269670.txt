Unable to enable development on iOS 10.1.1 <body> I am currently having an issue with Xcode 8.2.1 not being able to activate developing on my iPhone 7 Plus (on iOS 10.1.1). Whenever I try to deploy an application, it gives me the following error:     An error was encountered while enabling development on this device. Please try rebooting and reconnecting the device. (0xE8000076)   In the iPhone's console, I found the following errors:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ka9N1.png" alt=""  Does anyone have an idea what I could possibly do to solve this issue? Any solutions I have found so far did not work at all. And yes, I did already try rebooting and reconnecting multiple times.  <answer272063> Maybe you forgot to register your device with your develop account? I got that error code (0x8000076) when I forgot to register it. To double check:  ul liFind the identifier of your iPhone  ul liIn Xcode open the devices window (Window - Devices)/li liSelect your phone and find its identifier/li /ul/li liLogin to your developer account (https://developer.apple.com/account)/li liNavigate to your devices (https://developer.apple.com/account/ios/device/)/li liFind the identifier in the list of devices./li liCheck if the names are identical/li /ul  If it is missing, create a new entry.  <comment338820> Try switching out your cable for a genuine Apple cable? <comment338875> @owlswipe I am actually using the original Apple Lightning cable that came with my phone. Also I don't see how an alternate cable would have anything to do with the error shown in the console. <comment338909> And have you tried the official suggestion of "rebooting and reconnecting the device"? <comment338910> @owlswipe And have you tried to read my question in its entire form? If you don't bother reading the question, please refrain from answering. <comment338915> Oh, my bad! How about: "For me, it had been set up in iTunes months back, but after opening up iTunes, selecting the device, and rejecting the prompt to upgrade it, only then would Xcode's Devices Organizer start re-downloading Symbol Files, and eventually it worked." http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32658727/cannot-connect-ipad-with-ios-9-to-xcode-7-1-beta-7b60 <comment338916> Also: "The problem is resolved after I updated iTunes to version 11.4 via Software Updates." http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:qeHNjRs70PsJ:blogs.candoerz.com/question/146440/xcode-6-gm-with-iphone-5s-ios-8-gm-0xe8000070.aspx+&cd=17&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us <comment338917> And another: "In my case, during 2 years developing, my phone has several test app with name (null). you can only see a default Xcode app icon in app list in Setting. I had tried updating Xcode, but not work. finally I delete these null name apps, then Xcode - device can connect it without warning sign. Run test app won't get the error in question." http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:qeHNjRs70PsJ:blogs.candoerz.com/question/146440/xcode-6-gm-with-iphone-5s-ios-8-gm-0xe8000070.aspx+&cd=17&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us
