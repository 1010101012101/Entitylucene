How to uninstall rEFInd (0.8.2) on Yosemite <body> I'd like to remove rEFInd, since my laptop doesn't wake up from suspension (provided that the laptop is only powered by battery) anymore eversince I installed it (in neither of the operating systems: Mac OS and Ubuntu).  Assuming one has installed rEFInd on the main hard drive, then according to rEFInd's page it should be enough to remove (important: also empty the trash) the following folder:  precode/EFI/refind /code/pre  http://www.rodsbooks.com/refind/installing.html#uninstalling  Indeed my blessed folder is that one:  precodeMac:~ user$ bless --info finderinfo[0]: XXXXXXXX =&gt; Blessed System Folder is /EFI/refind finderinfo[1]: XXXXXXXX =&gt; Blessed System File is /EFI/refind/refind_x64.efi finderinfo[2]:      0 =&gt; Open-folder linked list empty finderinfo[3]:      0 =&gt; No alternate OS blessed file/folder finderinfo[4]:      0 =&gt; Unused field unset finderinfo[5]: XXXXXXXX =&gt; OS X blessed folder is /EFI/refind 64-bit VSDB volume id:  0xXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX Mac:~ user$ bless --info --getBoot /dev/disk0s2 /code/pre  Now my question is, do I have to remove just the coderefind/code folder, or also the codeEFI/code folder? Since my codeEFI/code folder also contains a codetools/code folder. Here's the entire folder tree:  precodeEFI    - refind        - icons        - keys        - refind_x64.efi        - refind.conf    - tools        - gptsync_x63.efi /code/pre  <answer213043> The codegptsync_x64.efi/code program file was emprobably/em installed with rEFInd, but is a separate program. Leaving it in place should do no harm, but will also probably do no good, so it's a judgment call on your part. If you remove rEFInd, chances are the only thing that would run codegptsync_x64.efi/code would be a subsequent install of rEFInd (or of its predecessor, rEFIt) or launching it manually from an EFI shell.
