Macbook pro retina late 2013 - Is it possible to use 3 external QHD monitors? <body> (Retina, 15-inch, Late 2013) - 2880 x 1800 /  Macintosh HD /  2,3 GHz Intel Core i7 /  16GB 1600 MHz DDR3 /  Intel Iris Pro 1536 MB/  I use Adobe's and Cinema 4d only , and hope to use 3 external QHD monitors as soon as possible , but i don't know it's can be or not.  I already order a monitor 'Dell u2515h' that is QHD(2560x1440). And i heard that FHD(1920x1080) monitors are possible to use 3 external monitors with my mac from someone, but unfortunatly FHD is not good for my work..(4k,UHD can not buy ,because of my budget..haha..)  So. Is it possible to use 3 external QHD monitors with my macbook?
