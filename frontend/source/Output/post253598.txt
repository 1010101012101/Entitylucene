Lightning EarPods + Mac <body> Looking the Lightning Earpods, but can't seem to find a USB 3 or 2 to Female Lightning adapter. Anyone know anything or where I could find one?  <answer253613> Per the system requirements on the Lightning EarPods store page, an iPhone, iPod or iPad running iOS 10 or higher is required to use them. Even if you had a USB adapter it wouldn't work because there are no drivers in the OS for them.  <comment315573> AFAIK, you're not intended to use them with Macs. Interesting question though. <comment315574> @JMY1000 is correct.  Apple sells Lightning to USB connectors but they're only for use with cameras. <comment315575> @fbara Seems like an answer right there ;)
