Permissions/ownership issues with MacPorts mysql55 after migration to a new Mac <body> After a migration to a new mac, I cannot access MacPorts mysql anymore. It's running mysql55, and I get the error:  precode**ERROR 2002 (HY000): Can't connect to local MySQL server through socket '/opt/local/var/run/mysql55/mysqld.sock** /code/pre  I did a 'touch' on the file. I've tried ownership of _mysql:_mysql and of root:wheel, with permissions of 755 and 775 for each, with no change.  What should the ownership be of /opt/local/var/run/mysql55 be, and with what permissions?  <comment374269> Is mysql running? <comment374270> The activity monitor contains no mysql/mysqld tasks, so I'm guessing not. <comment374271> That socket can't exist if the server isn't running.  You need to start the server. <comment374272> Right. In doing an explicit start (sudo port load mysql55-server) I'm getting a Darwin version error. Is it safe to assume it's a matter of macports needing upgrading (the old mac was el capitan, and the new, sierra)? <comment374287> It's best if you post the error and rework the question to address that (bigger) issue.  While I can "hold my own" when it comes to MySQL, I *only* run it on VMs on my Mac or in the cloud.  I've never run it natively on macOS, so from a Macports perspective, I would be out of my depth. <comment374288> I typically use VMs too. But that aside, I found that I do need to update Xcode and Macports. But that's a related but different issue. Your statement that it needs to be running resulted in my finding that other issue, so please give it as an answer So I can select it :-) <comment374290> I appreciate that.  Being that you are new here go ahead and write it up and I'll upvote so you can build up your reputation.
