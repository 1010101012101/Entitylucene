Re-directed screenshot location via defaults file doesn't work <body> I'm sure everyone knows about the standard changing default location where captured screenshots are stored.  A simple   precodesudo defaults write com.apple.screencapture location &lt;enter path to folder&gt; killall SystemUIServer /code/pre  should have sufficed but nothing happens.  My screenshots still save to desktop but the worst part is, when I read the file I've just written to, it tells me that the location that screenshots are being saved in is the folder that I've redirected to!   precodesudo defaults read com.apple.screencapture /code/pre  gives  precode{ location = "/Users/Me/Documents/Screenshots/"' } /code/pre  However it continues to save them to my desktop. The folder remains empty; it's not as if it saves it to both the folder and the desktop.  Ideas?  <answer266677> If you use codesudo/code you change the default for the user you are codesudo/codeing into, in this case the coderoot/code user. Just run the commands without codesudo/code and you should be fine.
