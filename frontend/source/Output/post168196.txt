Yosemite as ftp server <body> I have many problems with my Mac OS X. The system is only reachable via SSH, but not with FTP and not with SMB. So I tried to concentrate on FTP, seems easier to debug and may be it's one problem for both services.  First I enabled ftpd with:  precodesudo -s launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/ftp.plist /code/pre  Then I try to ftp. But nothing. I got the standard error: Operation timed out.  After that I tried it again and made a tcpdump on the MBP. Looks fine for me:  precodetdmacpro:~ root# tcpdump port 21 tcpdump: data link type PKTAP tcpdump: verbose output suppressed, use -v or -vv for full protocol decode listening on pktap, link-type PKTAP (Packet Tap), capture size 65535 bytes 17:32:53.539323 IP 192.168.0.58.49191 &gt; 192.168.0.2.ftp: Flags [S], seq    2091779555, win 65535, options [mss 1460,nop,wscale 3,nop,nop,TS val 271391148 ecr 0,sackOK,eol], length 0 /code/pre  So the packets are reaching the MBP, but it did not answer.  After that I created a new virtual machine on my MBP to be sure that no switch makes any problem. Then the ftp client was in my virt. machine. But same error.  After that I tried a ftp user@MBP_IP, again same error.  After that I disabled fptd with   precodesudo -s launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/ftp.plist /code/pre  and started the ftpd manually with  precode/usr/libexec/ftpd -d -D -l -U /code/pre  again the same problem.  Then I used another terminal and made a:  precodeftp localhost /code/pre  This works. So I think the ftpd is configured properly. But I also controlled the ftp.plist with a new installation. The same content.  So is there anybody out there who has any further suggestions how to isolate the problem or how to solve it?  <answer187440> Have you checked that it listening on the correct network interface? If connecting to localhost:21 works, but connecting to your LAN IP does not, it's likely just a misconfiguration. You can confirm with something like this:  precode$ netstat -an | grep LISTEN tcp4       0      0  *.21                *.*                    LISTEN /code/pre  You want to see code*.21/code or code0.0.0.0.21/code or code192.168.0.x.21/code.  If you see code::1.21/code or code127.0.0.1.21/code then it's only listening on the localhost interface and won't be reachable from other systems.  I couldn't reproduce your problem on my Yosemite system; when I ran codeftpd/code with the arguments you provided, it correctly listened on all interfaces (code*.21/code).  <comment197359> Is there anything related to the problem in `/var/log/system.log` (or other log files) at either the timestamp you try to start ftpd or you try to access the server? <comment197542> No, I only found that the the ftpd is enabled or disabled. I do not see any log messages from connection establishments to ftp. But I think this is a kind of standard. In my virt. Test-System I also see only enabling or disabling, but no login messages when the ftp connection is established. <comment197575> Any reason not to use SFTP? Just curious. <comment205952> Yes, I need ftp to backup configurations from an appliance, this appliance do not support sftp
