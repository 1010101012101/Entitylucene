iMovie Clip not rendering <body> I imported some videos from my phone onto my laptop. They are mp4 files and when I play them they play properly. However, when I import them into iMovie they are all really laggy and the video lags behind the audio. I tried to delete them and import them again many times and it doesn't work. Does anyone know how to fix this?  <comment189068> Did you give it time to make the low-res proxy media? [I assume iMovie does that too, like FCP, to speed up playback whilst editing.] <comment189168> Import as what?
