How can I safely create a partition to an already bootable drive <body> I already asked this question on Apple's community forum, right here, so I'll post the answer here if something comes up there first.  This is my problem :  I recently bought an external drive of 500Gb with the intent to use it to store large files that I use on my Mac and to use it as a bootable drive for Windows. I followed this tutorial to make the drive bootable on Windows 10, everything works well for that part. Now I want to be able to partition the drive so that I can have strong2 parts for Windows/strong (1 part that contains the infos for the boot, 1 that contains Windows) and strong1 part that I can use on the Mac side to store files/strong. I thought that I could simple use the partition operation on the strongDisk Utility app/strong, but the operation is emgreyed out/em. I found many answers on forums, but none of them is exactly what I'm looking for. Any idea how I can can achieve it ?  The actual state of the drive :  precode/dev/disk2 (external, physical):    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE          IDENTIFIER    0:     FDisk_partition_scheme                        *500.1 GB   disk2    1:                 DOS_FAT_32 WINBOOT                 209.7 MB   disk2s1    2:               Windows_NTFS BOOTCAMP                499.9 GB   disk2s2 /code/pre  Thanks in advance and have a good day !  <answer242530> Ok, after spending the afternoon looking how to solve this, I found that the easy way was to create a new partition from Windows' side in exFat format. And since the format exFat is modifiable on Mac, unlike NTFS, I can then erase it and then change the format to whichever I want.  <comment298383> Great! Please mark your question as solved then <comment298626> Ah, forgot, my bad.
