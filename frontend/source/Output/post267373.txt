My Safari download button has disappeared <body> For some odd reason, I am unable to witness my download button, even when i am downloading something. I am able to access the downloaded file(s) in Finder just fine, but theres no download button for me to access it, open, and/or drag and drop the file in Safari itself. Does anyone have a solution to this issue?  <answer267388> I think you accidentally removed the download button from the Toolbar.  ol liSafari menu: View  Customise Toolbar/li liAdd download button by dragging it to the Toolbar/li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/eePdr.jpg" alt="Screenshot Safari Toolbar Customiser"  <answer288044> The downloads button will re-appear after your next download  <comment335544> For some reason though, the downloads button isn't appearing among the "items" to drag into the toolbar. <comment335574> What if you drag the default set of icons in? <comment335589> That hasn't worked either <comment335605> I can not reproduce your issue on my own Mac. What version of macOS are you using? <comment337340> The issue is gone now, I think it is because i changed the "clear downloads queue" to after safari quits
