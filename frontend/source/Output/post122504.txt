For example, for a new machine I would like to setup the following exclusion list:   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pPda7.png" alt="enter image description here"   <answer122515> The codetmutil/code command line tool, included with OS X, supports the ability to add and remove items from the exclusion list.  precodesudo tmutil addexclusion ~/.ivy2 /code/pre  See the tmutil manual page for more information about this tool's options.  As codetmutil/code is a command line tool, it can be incorporated into AppleScripts using strongdo shell script/strong, combined with Automator workflows using the strongRun shell script/strong step, or as part of a traditional shell script.  <comment142945> related http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/63778/8605
