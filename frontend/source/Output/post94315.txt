Why doesn't my VPN work with my new Mac? <body> I used Migration Assistant / Setup Assistant to copy everything from an old Mac to a new one, both running 10.8.4. My VPN connection uses the built-in OpenVPN client, via the Network pane in System Preferences.  The VPN worked before the migration, but after migration it just spins on "Connecting..." for a while before reporting:     The negotiation with the VPN server failed. Verify the server address and try reconnecting.   I can still ping the VPN server, though.  In Console I see these messages, with some information redacted.  precode2013-06-18 1:10:33.202 PM configd[20]: IPSec connecting to server vpnhost.example.net 2013-06-18 1:10:33.202 PM configd[20]: SCNC: start, triggered by SystemUIServer, type IPSec, status 0 2013-06-18 1:10:33.325 PM configd[20]: IPSec Phase1 starting. 2013-06-18 1:10:33.367 PM racoon[55678]: IPSec connecting to server 1.2.3.4 2013-06-18 1:10:33.367 PM racoon[55678]: Connecting. 2013-06-18 1:10:33.367 PM racoon[55678]: IPSec Phase1 started (Initiated by me). 2013-06-18 1:10:33.372 PM racoon[55678]: IKE Packet: transmit success.

So if that's what your VPN connection uses, go to codeSystem Preferences &gt; Network &gt; (your VPN) &gt; Authentication Settings.../code and set the correct value for the shared secret. Then codeApply/code and try to connect again.
