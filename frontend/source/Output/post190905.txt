Mac Terminal can't navigate between split panes <body> h2Problem/h2  I have just bought a new macbook pro and am using the Terminal to code. I have read a lot of posts about pane splitting, but nothing answers my question (or none of the solutions have worked). I have figured out that I can open a new pane using command-d and close it using command-shift-d, however I cannot figure out how to switch between panes.  Edit: I am starting in vim, and want to navigate to the regular terminal.  Here is a picture of the editor before pane splitting: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GzuBI.png" alt="enter image description here"  Here is a picture after the split, but can not figure out how to navigate to the above pane to start using the terminal: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/C2zAz.png" alt="enter image description here"  hr  hr  h2Details/h2  ul liModel: MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Early 2015)/li liOS: OS X Yosemite Version 10.10.3/li liProcessor: 2.9 GHz Intel Core i5/li liTerminal: Version 2.5.3 (343.7)/li /ul  <comment226685> Does http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/6504/how-do-split-panes-in-terminal-work?rq=1 answer your question? Basically you only can interact with one pane, the others are read-only. <comment226691> @patrix yes it does! thanks a lot. I have now installed iTerm2 to be able to achieve what I want. <comment226710> @Vaderico faster than on SO, isn't it? <comment226711> @Thomas what do you mean by SO? <comment226712> @Vaderico StackOverflow <comment226717> @Thomas ahh right. yes :) yes it is, was it you who pointed me in this forums direction? if so then thank you very much
