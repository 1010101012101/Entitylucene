How can I diagnose random restarts? <body> My Macbook Air is randomly restarting — a real problem when I have it set up to give a presentation, and walk to the stage to find it back at the login screen. How can I diagnose the cause?   <answer181917> codeConsole.app/code located in codeApplications/Utilities/code will display the logs of the system. Inspecting might point you to the reason of the reboots.   <comment216659> Thanks for the reply. I looked at the logs (which are AMAZINGLY ENDLESS — I had no idea of all the work being done) but can't see anything obvious at a point where it is restarting. What should I search for? The only "restart" that showed up in a search was "CGX Restart Session Workspace". Might that be it?
