General Password Get/Set <body> I had sent my MacBook Pro for a hard-drive replacement which was returned back with a fresh installation of the OS. But there is no password set when I need to "click to unlock".  ol liHow do I set my password ?/li liHow do I retrieve my sudo password ?/li /ol  <answer61141> I assume that the account you are using doesn't need a password right now (otherwise how would you log in). Passwords can be changed in System Preferences - Users and Groups  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yRHQi.png" alt="enter image description here"  If you are an admin user, your sudo password is the same as your login password.  <comment70538> Can you access everything on the computer or are there things locked for you?
