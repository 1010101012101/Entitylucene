Android phone not even charging on a Mac Mini (Yosemite) <body> I'm new to OSX, so I'm probably doing something which is obviously wrong.  I have a Samsung Note and USB cable which when plugged into my Linux laptop work without any issues.  I have a late-2012 Mac Mini running Yosemite.  When I plug the phone into the Mac Mini's USB ports it does not even start charging.  I have tried three different USB ports, including ports I know are working (as I swapped the keyboard and mouse plugs).  What do I need to do for my Mac Mini to at least charge my Android Phone?  <answer207970> I have strongzero/strong experience with Android, that said it may be that a driver or such (sync software for Mac?) might be needed for the Mac to 'recognize' the phone  <answer208153> The solution was to buy a Cubot X15 Android phone to replace the 3+ year old Samsung Note.  It worked with the Mac Mini immediately.   <comment250586> Why has this question been downvoted?  If the answer is obvious, please enlighten me. <comment250597> Have you tried the phone on another computer? <comment250633> @IronCraftMan Yes, I have tried it on my Linux laptop and on my Linux workstation, where it works fine. The fact that it doesn't even charge on the Mac Mini really surprised me. <comment250964> Yes, I installed Google's Android software for OSX.  My query was that the phone didn't even charge when plugged in to the Mac Mini.  I had reasoned that I could not expect anything else to work until the phone would at least show that it was charging. <comment250973> Yah sorry, you might want to head on over to http://android.stackexchange.com/ and see if they have any suggestions as most of us here have Macs and iPhones
