Apple Remote Desktop - Reports Battery Percentage or Battery Hrs Left <body> With Apple Remote Desktop, how can I generate a Battery Status Hrs Left or Battery Percentage Left on my Mac Laptop(s)?  I did find something that tells me the "Battery Charge Remaining (mAh)", but it give me a number that I do not understand, example: 646.  Can I have the percentage left instead or hours will be fine too?  Thank you so much and have a wonderful day.  Fabio
