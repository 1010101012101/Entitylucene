Need more pseudo terminals <body> I'm running tmux and creating many sessions to various servers. After opening 128, I can no longer open new ones, or open new tabs in Terminal. The error messages is:  precodeforkpty: Device not configured Could not create a new process and open a pseudo-tty. /code/pre  Is there any way I can increase the number of ptys?  <answer83122> (Tested on OS X 10.8.2; other releases may be slightly different.)  You can change the system’s limit on ptys with the emsysctl/em command.  precodesudo sysctl -w kern.tty.ptmx_max=255 /code/pre  This should immediately let you open more ptys.  To set this automatically after each reboot, put the following line in the code/etc/sysctl.conf/code file:  precodekern.tty.ptmx_max=255 /code/pre  (Note: I did not try this, but, from a look at the source code, it looks like emlaunchd/em does process this file.)  This file may not exist; if you have to create it, you should probably be sure it has restricted ownership and permissions:  precodesudo chown root:wheel /etc/sysctl.conf sudo chmod 644 /etc/sysctl.conf /code/pre  hr  Eventually, you may run into some other per-process or per-user resource limits (e.g. total number of processes per user, and total number of open file descriptors per process).  <comment95436> It'd be helpful to know what version of OS X you're running, and what kind of Mac, and particularly, how much RAM you have installed. <comment96724> Eventually got to test this, works great, thanks. For the record, I couldn't set this above 999, but that will do for now. <comment96725> I'm using 10.8.2 and have 8gb of RAM, which should be more than enough to open thousands of ssh sessions. <comment103681> This allows me to open up to 169 ptys, but not more. `sudo sysctl kern.tty.ptmx_max` returns `999` which is correct. Anything I'm missing on this one? <comment103790> @ubuntudroid: You might be running into a limit on the number of open files (`ulimit` in *bash*). These kinds of limits are inherited from parent processes, so to change it for *tmux* you will need to change it in (e.g.) a shell and then restart your *tmux* server. To make the change “persistent”, try a [`launchctl.conf`](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man5/launchd.conf.5.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/5/launchd.conf) that uses a [`limit` command](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/launchctl.1.html). <comment169534> Whenever inside tmux on my Mac (10.9.4) i noticed `ulimit -a` reported a 256 file descriptor limit. Calling `ulimit -n 2000` totally worked though.
