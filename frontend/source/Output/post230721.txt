OS X El Capitan bash shell not working in Terminal <body> I have a weird issue with my bash shell in OS X El Capitan. I was messing around with my .bashrc file today, and now when I open my terminal I see nothing out of the ordinary (no messages, just the basic bash prompt), but I cannot enter any commands. I can type, but once I press enter I just hear the bell ring and nothing happens. Some of the things I have already tried:  ul liDeleting .bashrc (and restarting Terminal)/li liDeleting .bash_profile (and restarting Terminal)/li liMaking very basic .bashrc and .bash_profile files with echo statements. These statements are run and are printed to the terminal, but I still cannot enter any commands./li liSwitching my shell to zsh instead, and found that it works just fine./li /ul  Any information you guys could give me would be very, very much appreciated. Thanks!  strongEDIT/strong br/ This issue seems to have resolved itself. I didn't restart my computer, I just came back to it this morning and bash seems to be working just fine. Maybe a caching issue?  <comment282058> Welcome to Ask Different, Tom. It might be best to provide your edit as an actual, proper answer so it can be selected.

It was quite unnerving.
