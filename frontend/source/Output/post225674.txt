Can a webpage open in Safari crash the whole computer? <body> I have a Mid-2011 MacBook Air. Everything seems to be working fine, except Safari keeps freezing and stops responding. Sometimes, when Safari freezes, it causes the whole computer to crash and I have to restart it.  I thought browsers were supposed to have security measures that prevent this from happening (like Sandboxing). How can a webpage crash the whole OS?  <answer225692> My assumption solution: Safari is continuously attempting to reload the last session. To resolve this issue go to code~/Library/Saved Application State//code Remove the com.safari... folder and place in the Trash.  A second issue could be adware, which created the issue in the first place.  Open Safari, which should operate properly after removing the above folder, and go to AdwareMedic . Download and run the free program and that will remove any adware.  <comment273904> can you provide the url of a page which causes this problem?  do you have the same problem with FireFox or Chrome? <comment273905> Do @TomGewecke suggestion first. Subsequently,  open your **Console.app**, located in `/Appications/Utilities/Console`. Update the original post with the contents of your most recent `com.apple.safari…` or `com.apple.webkit….` log under “System Diagnostic Reports” <comment310434> I figured out the answer. It was because of Flash.
