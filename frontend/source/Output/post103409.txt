How to show my .emacs file in finder? <body> I am new to Mac. I installed emacs, but I can't see my .emacs file in the finder. I can open the file from inside emacs, and I saved another copy on my desktop, but it's not showing.   <answer103411> These files starting with a dot are meant to be hidden in *nix.  To see them in terminal add the code-a/code flag to the codels/code command:  precodels -a /code/pre  To see them in the Finder you will want to set a hidden preference (this is global change tho, you'll see all your hidden files everywhere):  precodedefaults write com.apple.Finder AppleShowAllFiles TRUE /code/pre  and then restart the finder:  precodekillall Finder /code/pre  To reverse and hide them again:  precodedefaults write com.apple.Finder AppleShowAllFiles FALSE &amp;&amp; killall Finder /code/pre  Source  strongUpdate to add:/strong  Lately I've only been able to get this to work when the string codecom.apple.finder/code is lower case!  I think this happened starting in 10.9, but not certain.  So you'll want:  precodedefaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles TRUE; /code/pre  <comment121716> Do you need to see these files in the Finder or in terminal? <comment121718> I just want easy access to my .emacs file so I can make backup copies. And after I made a copy, I would like being able see it so I know where it is.
