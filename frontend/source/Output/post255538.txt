How to adjust Slo Mo video settings on mac? <body> I remember one or two years ago, when I recorded slo mo videos with my iPhone I could import them to my macbook and still adjust the slo mo in the quicktime player (it looked like the settings on the iPhone, a bar above the video stream where you can change the position of the beginning and ending mark of the slo mo mode, but this has changed now. Does anybody know how I still can edit the slo mo settings, without doing things like slowing down/speeding up the whole video in iMovie or something. I just want to change the beginning of slow motion, and it's a video from my previous iPhone, I only have it on my macbook now.  I hope you can help me, Thank you very much :)
