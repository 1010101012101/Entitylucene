Buying an iPhone 6S in the US, and using in Europe? <body> Should I be worried when buying an iPhone 6S in the U.S., if I want to use it in Denmark, Europe? I will be buying it SIM-free.  Worried in the sense that the network might not be working (GSM/CDMA etc.).  <comment256596> Worried about what? The phone not working, no warranty in Europe, it getting confiscated when entering the country or something else altogether? <comment256597> My apologies: The phone not working w.r.t. network, etc. <comment256600> if it's sim free it'll work without any problems, you'll need to check if the iPhone is compatible with your carrier to be able to use 4G (LTE) : http://www.apple.com/iphone/LTE/ . Even if it's not compatible, you'll have 3G+ instead of 4G but the network will work fine in both cases <comment256602> Alright. Thank you!
