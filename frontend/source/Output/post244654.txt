Why does sudo shutdown -h now command work but I cannot shutdown my mac traditionally? <body> I am on OS X El Capitan 10.11.5 on a Macbook Pro Early 2015.  When I try to shutdown or restart by pressing the Apple, it doesn't work. All of my applications close, the menu bar clears, and finder was quit, but I could still use the dock to load and use apps.  I am still able to access my dock, and I can open up apps like Chrome, but Finder is down. Typically, I resolve this issue by holding down the power button, and then turning my laptop back on.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YYYzg.jpg" alt="My screen looks like this when I try to shut down or restart."  However, when I use the command codesudo shutdown -h/code on my Terminal, it shuts down without any problem at all. Also, when I boot into Safe Mode, I am able to restart and shutdown my Mac just fine. I have tried disabling all my extensions in System Preferences, but that doesn't work either. I am very confused regarding this, and I would appreciate any help. Thank you.  <answer244659> This seems to be related to Mac mini won't shutdown  shutdown -h forces a cold reset. All changes are being lost. It's like holding down your Macs power button.  Do you use a Wacom driver? Do you use Java? If so, try uninstall/reinstall them and restart OS X   <comment301517> What happens if you create a new user and use that? <comment301518> Hi Mark, the same error occurs when I use a new account. I'm thinking the cause of this is due to some extensions, but I'm not sure which ones are causing it. <comment301537> This is incorrect. `shutdown -h` **is not** like holding down your power button.  When you issue `shutdown` all running processes are sent a `SIGTERM` then a `SIGKILL`.  Holding down your power button does nothing of the sort.  See `man shutdown` for more details. <comment301538> What if you log out first, *then* try to shutdown?  Does it work there? <comment302624> Allan, unfortunately it still doesn't work when I log out first.
