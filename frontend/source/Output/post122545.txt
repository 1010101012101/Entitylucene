How can I remove the white background from a profile picture? <body> I want to set a profile picture that has a transparent background, but when I do it gets a white circle in the background that I do not want. Is there a way to prevent this from happening, or maybe just set the alpha value of the colour it uses?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/XgLPR.png" alt="enter image description here"  The original image does not have the outer white circle.  <comment142994> Against what background do you want to match colors? Alpha makes a color transparent and masks the image so that any background can show through. Do you have keynote or any software like Photoshop or equivalent? <comment142996> The original image already has a transparent background, but when it is set as the user picture the outer white circle in the example is added by osx. <comment142998> So you're looking to modify the crop algorithm in system preferences? (or the log in screen where you pick a user to log in to start the window server and GUI processes?) <comment143000> I guess it'll be in the crop process, since the modified image is used in the users list in Preferences-Users as well as on the login screen.
