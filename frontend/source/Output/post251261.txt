Access permissions for command file created with bash <body> I wrote myself a simple bash script which is a wrapper for codecompass create/code function, plus it creates a command file in the directory for codecompass watch/code (so that instead of manually typing out the directory and watch every time, I just double click on an icon in the project folder). The problem is that I get the following error when opening the command file:      The file “watch.command” could not be executed because you do not have appropriate access privileges. To view or change access privileges, select the file in the Finder and choose File  Get Info.   I can run it from the terminal with codebash watch.command/code (assuming I'm in the appropriate directory). I tried changing the permissions in finder for the file as well as the folder (read and write for everyone), but I still get the same error (plus I don't want to change permissions manually every time).  Also, if I open text mate and make exactly the same file and save it to my project directory, it runs as expected.  Here is the code for my codenew_project/code command:  precode#!/bin/bash compass create "/Users/user_name/Desktop/$1" --bare --sass-dir "scss" --css-dir "css" --javascripts-dir "js" --images-dir "images"; echo "#!/bin/bash" &gt;&gt; "/Users/user_name/Desktop/$1/watch.command"; echo "cd /Users/user_name/Desktop/$1" &gt;&gt; "/Users/user_name/Desktop/$1/watch.command"; echo "compass watch" &gt;&gt; "/Users/user_name/Desktop/$1/watch.command"; /code/pre  (the code$1/code argument is the project name)  <answer251341> codechmod 700 watch.command/code Now try double clicking the file.  <comment312403> what does `ls -l /Users/user_name/Desktop/$1/watch.command` show (replacing $1 by an actual directory
