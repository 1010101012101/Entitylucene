Format external HFS disk without ESP <body> When formatting an external disk larger than 2GB, OS X automatically creates an EFI System Partition (ESP).  For compatibility with other devices, I want to format a large disk with only one partition, and no ESP.  How can I do this in OS X Yosemite?  precodediskutil eraseDisk HFS+ 002 disk2 /code/pre  I found this Technical Note describing Apple's partitioning policy, but it doesn't say how to avoid creating the ESP.  Edit: Forgot to mention I need to use GUID partition map for compatibility, not MBR.  <answer250119> You can repartition the disk with emgpt/em and format the partition with emnewfs_hfs/em:  Open Terminal.app and to get an overview enter:  precodediskutil list /code/pre  Get the partition table of the disk in question (below I assume the disk to partition is disk2):  precodesudo gpt -r show disk2 /code/pre  Destroy the GUID partition table and create a new one:  precodediskutil umountDisk disk2 sudo gpt destroy disk2 sudo gpt create disk2 /code/pre  If the disk previously was formatted as a FAT volume, a new GUID partition table can't be created because the PMBR turns into an MBR (which blocks the GPT creation) and you have to overwrite it first:  precodediskutil umountDisk disk2 sudo gpt destroy disk2 diskutil umountDisk disk2 sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/disk2 count=1 sudo gpt create disk2 /code/pre  Get the new partition table:  precodesudo gpt -r show disk2 /code/pre  Now create a new partition with gpt. Depending on the block size of your disk you may have to align the partition. Disks with a block size of 512 Bytes have to be aligned. On disks with a block size of 4096 Bytes you can use the first free block (block nr. 6) and the size of the free space.  Example (a 2.2 TB disk with a block size of 512 Bytes):  precode       start        size  index  contents            0           1         PMBR            1           1         Pri GPT header            2          32         Pri GPT table           34  4292870077            4292870111          32         Sec GPT table   4292870143           1         Sec GPT header /code/pre  Do the math and align your volume to 4k blocks. This means: the start block and the size is divisible through 8 (and has to fit in 4292870071 blocks in my example because the lowest recommended start block is 40). Create a new partition:  precodesudo gpt add -i 1 -b 40 -s 4292870064 -t 48465300-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC disk2 /code/pre  emwith i: index position (usually 1 for the first partition); b: start block; s: size in blocks and t: type of partition (here HFS+ = 48465300-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC)./em  Example (a 6.0 TB disk with a block size of 4096 Bytes):  precode      start       size  index  contents           0          1         PMBR           1          1         Pri GPT header           2          4         Pri GPT table           6  976746229          976746235          4         Sec GPT table   976746239          1         Sec GPT header  sudo gpt add -i 1 -b 6 -s 976746229 -t 48465300-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC disk2 /code/pre  Format the partition with newfs_hfs (-v emname/em: name the volume; -J: journaled):  precode sudo newfs_hfs -v test -J /dev/rdisk2s1 /code/pre  The volume will be mounted automatically. Else enter codediskutil mount disk2s1/code.  hr  Be warned: checking the disk with Disk Utility will yield:     Problems were found with the partition map which might prevent booting...   and with codediskutil verifyDisk disk2/code     Started partition map verification on disk2br   Checking prerequisitesbr   Checking the partition listbr   Problems were found with the partition map which might prevent bootingbr   Error: -69770: Partition map check failed because no slices were found   <comment310451> What kind of disks are you talking of? The GB-sized thumb drives or rather the TB external HDDs? <comment335452> Excellent answer, thank you!
