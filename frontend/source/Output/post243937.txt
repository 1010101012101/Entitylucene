less doesn't work <body> Recently I've noticed that less command doesn't work.  precode$ ls | less                                                         CertificateEntreprenuership101.pdf Engineering Software as a Service_ An Agile Approach Using Cloud Computing_B00CCEHNUM copy.azw3 Photos.zip Raspberry_Pi_Education_Manual.pdf chef-v100 chef-v100.zip node-webkit postgresql-v400 2 postgresql-v400.zip rd1_ua rd1_ua.zip /code/pre  As you can see it didn't open less as viewer. It might be some global setting but I have no idea what might it cause.  Update.  precode$ which less /usr/bin/less $ echo $LESS                                                            -F -g -i -M -R -S -w -X -z-4 less &lt;somefile&gt; - works as expected /code/pre  <answer243940> From codeman less/code:  precode   -F or --quit-if-one-screen           Causes  less  to  automatically  exit  if  the entire file can be displayed on the first           screen. /code/pre  Remove the option from codeLESS/code to avoid this.  <comment300475> Is `LESS` set in the shell? What does `echo $LESS` return? Does `less some-text-file` work as expected? <comment300477> @patrix, see the update, thanks <comment300479> For me it was tricky, thank you <comment300480> Please point me to the documentation of 'echo $LESS', i've never heard of this expression. <comment300482> `echo` is a shell command which prints all its arguments (try `echo Hello World`). `LESS` is a variable defined in your shell which can be addressed as `$LESS`. Combining this together you can use `echo $LESS` to display the content of this variable. <comment300504> Why are some parts of the output in blue?! <comment300506> Why is the word “Causes” in blue? Strange. <comment300513> @Nicolas Because it's the start of the line and the first letter is capital. The ‘default’ syntax highlighting style colours such text as blue. <comment300523> @NicolasBarbulesco That’s the *Always* Perfect™ default syntax highlighter.
