Can ACL permissions modifications affect system performance? <body> Is it possible that changing/adding permissions on a large set of folders can affect system performance, causing everything to run more slowly?  The way this is done might matter. I'm imagining the case where permissions are set strongrecursively on a user home folder/strong ("/Users/MyUsername") via the "Get Info" dialog within Finder and additional users or groups are added to the ACL.  <comment312461> It might slow the system down for a bit while the modification is being made, depending on the size of the home folder, but long-term it should not have any noticeable effect, no.
