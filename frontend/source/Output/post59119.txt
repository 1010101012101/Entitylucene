Where are Safari 6.0 passwords saved? <body> Prior to version 6.0 Safari had no features for managing passwords distinct from the system wide support provided by Keychain:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pjhRz.png" alt="Before Safari 6.0"  but Safari 6.0 adds a new tab in its Preferences dialog for saving and managing passwords for websites:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/I7pix.png" alt="After Safari 6.0"  Does this change correspond to a change in locations for storing or rules for managing the security of passwords? Are Safari passwords still stored securely in the Keychain or are they in a new, separate store?   Where are Safari 6.0 passwords saved?  <answer59130> The passwords are still saved in the Keychain, and not a separate 'new' location. Safari 6 just includes a new front end for accessing them directly without having to go to the Keychain Access application.  <comment68186> Thanks for the edit. To append to my answer, in case you have an issue with the new Passwords pane in Safari, you can still manage (delete/etc) them in Keychain Access.
