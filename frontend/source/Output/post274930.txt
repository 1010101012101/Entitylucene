EDIT:   Using strongCommand_Line_Tools_macOS_10.12_for_Xcode_8.2.dmg/strong of emhttps://developer.apple.com/download/more//em doesn't work properly...  strongWednesday 10:47 PM/strong img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zfAnM.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  strongThursday 8:43 AM/strong img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/esErh.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer275633> I found the problem...  Previosly I had reduced the Memory from strong2048MB/strong to strong1536MB/strong.  I know the minimun requirement is strong2048MB/strong.  I tried creating a new Virtual Machine using strong1536MB/strong, but it was very slowly...  Then I need to restore the memory from strong1536MB/strong to strong2048MB/strong.  <comment345775> Just download Command Line Tools for Xcode from: https://developer.apple.com <comment346753> Good catch that running macOS virtualized has lots of pains and problems that may not be apparent at first glance.
