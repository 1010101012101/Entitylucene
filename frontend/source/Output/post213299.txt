When I got back and logged in again, the Proxifier's connections area shows this info:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yC4Qo.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Lots of apps on my Mac including Chrome, Safari, Evernote, Twitter etc. can not access the network anymore. Anyone know how to solve this?
