Upgrade to final from Public Beta? <body> I'm currently on the public beta of El Capitan, how do I upgrade to the final version of the new OS?  <answer208243> The safe way: Boot into Recovery HD, erase the drive, and restore from your Yosemite backup (if you have one). Then download the installer and upgrade.  I wouldn't recommend just downloading the installer and updating, as bugs could be carried over.  <answer208255> You don't emneed/em to upgrade. OS X 10.11 GM and final release are the same according to Apple and once 10.11.1 is released both the GM and final release will update to it.
