Multiple or duplicate cursors <body> I'm seeing a problem where I have multiple mouse cursors on certain parts of my screen or screen configurations. I've searched bug reports and haven't seen any mention of something similar, so I'm wondering if anyone has seen this problem before.  I've tried:  ul liRestating the computer/li liUpdating the OS/li /ul  I'm hesitant to wipe and re-install everything... but that's my next step unless I can solve this annoying bug.  emWhen I take a screenshot, the second cursor disappears, so please excuse the phone photos/em.  strongPointer and I-bar on text input:/strong  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/T5Czg.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  strongPointer and drag hand when editing the previous photo:/strong  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0ZcHx.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  strongSecond cursor on a monitor that is rotated 90Â° CC (vertical):/strong  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/aQvBG.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  strongComputer Information:/strong  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YwSsh.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer246905> I got a tip from a co-worker to reset my SMC (which I hadn't tried yet), and that solved the problem.  To reset the SMC, hold codeShift/code, codeControl/code, and codeOption/code while the computer is plugged in. It restarted my machine and the problem is now resolved.  <comment304615> Have you tried resetting your SMC?
