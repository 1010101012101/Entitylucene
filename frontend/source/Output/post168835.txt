My NAS connected through AFP or SMB takes really long to load folders with many files? <body> I have a Thecus NAS N5550 connected to my Mac. When I open the folders it sometimes takes up to 30 seconds until i see anything in the folder. I'm using OSX (10.10.1) what is going on?  <comment198973> This is a good question. I've found that some network protocols are really slow with big directories, and optimization tips would be handy. <comment199027> I think it has something to do with indexing of the files.
