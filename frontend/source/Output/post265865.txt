Not able to connect to Iomega Home Media Cloud Edition NAS <body> I am using a Macbook Air Early 2014 running macOS Sierra (I was unable to access the NAS using previous versions also) and I am unable to connect to an Iomega Home Media NAS attached to my network. If I restart it I am able to connect however this only lasts a few hours before it fails again.   I believe this problem is related to my Mac because my phone (an Android) and the other PCs (Windows 10) in my house can all see and connect to the NAS through their file browsers and through its web portal  I am able to see the Time Machine Share on the NAS appear under "Shared" in Finder however when I click this it gives me the error "Connection Failed" and when I click "Connect as" nothing appears.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Q7Ryg.png" alt="enter image description here"  I have tried connecting to the media portion of the NAS (which when the NAS works can be accessed while the Time Machine part still does not work) using SMB and AFP but nothing appears and through Chrome and Safari using its IP and I get the error "This site canâ€™t be reached - 192.168.0.23 took too long to respond."  I have checked my router and the Home Media is appearing with an IP of 192.168.0.23. My Mac is there as well with the IP 192.168.0.9, I also checked my DNS settings and the routers IP is there.   I did an nslookup and it properly returned the name of the NAS   precodeServer:     192.168.0.1 Address:    192.168.0.1#53  Non-authoritative answer: 23.0.168.192.in-addr.arpa   name = Home-Media. /code/pre  however when I tried pinging it it returns codeRequest timeout for icmp_seq 16/code  Is there a setup guide or troubleshooting guide or someone that can explain how to make this work?
