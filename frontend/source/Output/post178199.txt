How to solve Yosemite massive memory leak? <body> I am experiencing a massive memory leak in Mac OS X 10.10.2 (14C2513). I have 16 GB of RAM and the used memory rise to circa 15 GB in ~3 hours. Top applications usage is relatively low, circa 200 MB per application (10 top applications).  I solved it only shutting down the system.  Is there any update for this?  <answer178209> OS X (and all modern operating systems) is designed to use all of the memory that's available, for file caches if it has no better use for it. That's not a problem, since memory used for file caches is still available for applications to use.  <comment211036> Please add a screenshot of Activity Monitor - Memory <comment211037> OS X (and all modern operating systems) is designed to use all of the memory that's available, for file caches if it has no better use for it.

In Activity Monitor, what are the values for App Memory, File Cache, Wired Memory and Compressed? <comment211038> @MikeScott I think You can post it as an answer. RAM is there to be used, You paid for it :) <comment211042> Did you notice any performance or usability issues due to this memory situation? <comment211043> @MateuszSzlosek I wrote it as an answer, but I changed it to a comment since it asks for more data. If the data support it, I'll make it an answer. <comment211047> Mh, maybe I misunderstood Activity Monitor - my fault. I read Memory Used and I thought it was the app memory. Indeed, App Memory is only ~7GB, while the most part is File Cache. I think I am going to delete this question. <comment211049> @fbrundu You should leave the question here, so that the next person who does the same thing can find it, and the answer.
