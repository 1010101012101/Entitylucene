where is the Documents folder shown in iFile (iPad-Air)? <body> There is a folder called strongDocuments/strong (and other folders beside that) in strongiFile/strong  I tried but can't find the physical location with iFunbox or iTools.  How can I find the physical location of that folder?  <answer129994> When using a system that doesn't know how to follow POSIX symbolic links (like iFunbox), then you're going to need to know the actual location of the directory. When using iFile, it'll appear to be located at code/var/mobile/Documents//code, but in reality, code/var/code is a symbolic link to code/private/var//code. So the answer to your question is: The codeDocuments/code folder is located at code/private/var/mobile/Documents//code.  <answer193054> Download Apple file conduit "2" from cydia, Once you do you will be able to see everything that you want such as /var in Ifunbox in the raw system files section  <comment152489> Thanks for Answer But I can't find '/' folder in iFunbox. there is a category called 'Raw File System' and can't see anything relative in that ! <comment152923> I'll have to look in to it further.
