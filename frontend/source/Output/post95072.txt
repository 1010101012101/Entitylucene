Two pane file manager for Mountain Lion? <body> I recently moved from Linux to Mac, and am missing a two pane file manager. I was thinking about along the lines of midnight commander, krusader (Linux) or total commander (Windows).  I installed midnight commander and am using it, but a GUI file manager would sometimes be handy.  Any suggestions for Open Source alternatives?  <answer95076> Forklift is nice, has support for FTP + SFTP + Amazon S3 + WEBDav. A bit pricey, but I got it on sale and there were a few discounts again after that so maybe worth a wait.

After installing MacPorts use:  precodesudo port install krusader /code/pre  I doubt it will look good, but It should work. It supported Aqua look years ago, so no X11 was needed, but I have no idea how it stands now.  <answer95080> I like mucommander.  It is cross-platform, to boot, very much like codemc/code, but with a GUI instead of a 'TUI', and allows you to connect to, say, SFTP shares and such.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2N6B0.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer95201> Checkout XTrafinder - google for it and download it from the source of your choice...  It can be found here.  From the website:     XtraFinder add Tabs and features to Mac Finder.      • Tabs.      • Dual Panel &amp; Dual Window.      • Arrange folders on top.      • Cut &amp; Paste.      • Global hotkeys.      • "Copy Path", "Show Hidden Items", "Hide Desktop", "Refresh", "New   File", "Copy to", "Move to", "New Terminal Here", "Make Symbolic   Link", "Contents", "Select...", … .      • Light text on dark background.      • Colorful icons in Sidebar.   The nice thing really is that it extends finders usability.   <answer103678> I'm using TotalFinder, which supports dual-mode as well as some other great features. (I most like the tab support.)  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6TyyD.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment111475> Yes - forklift looks nice, but I was looking for something Open Source (Linux heritage...). I'll edit my question. <comment111569> I found mucommander before, but I simply don't like java. At least under Linux, they looked funny and usually were slow. But I might give it a try. <comment111660> Can you explain why it meets the asker's requirements. <comment111781> @tomTom I found it and I am using it- but it is not actually a two pane file manager - it opens a second instance of finder. But I will try it out. <comment122014> Let's consolidate this with the other two-pane browser tool. If there are substantial differences in the problem you face, we can edit this so it's clear you are looking for something different than the linked question <comment122171> It is actually really nice and I am still using it - like it. <comment122182> Looks very similar to Xtrafinder - any substantial difference justifying the 18$ pricetag? <comment122191> I don't know -- I only learned about Xtrafinder when I posted my response here so haven't tried it.
