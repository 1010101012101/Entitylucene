how to pack python package that includes python scripts and bash scripts for OSx as pythonTool.app? <body> I have made a python tool which I want to share with users. I tried Automator, and it works but in that I used Application  Run Shell Script in which I hard coded the path to my python script, but since I want any user to be able to use it from any location, I don't think I this seems possible solution. Secondly my python script also takes current folder as argument, See below:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DSGzg.png" alt="using Automator"  In the above picture the path to of application is where I am developing, which is wrong, infact that path should I guess be dynamically generated and the second argument current folder path should also be passed.  I also tried with platypus, that does copy the content to Application folder and all required files packaged inside Gallery.app(see below)  precode Contents        \_ Info.plist       \_ MacOS         \_ Gallery # i ran this guess clicking on Gallery.app executes this binary       \_ Resources                 \_ AppSettings.plist                 \_ MainMenu.nib                 \_ README.md                 \_ __init__.py                 \_ appIcon.icns                 \_ controlBar.py                 \_ exifread                 \_ gallery.py                 \_ icons.py                 \_ script                 \_ scripts                 \_ slideShow.py                 \_ slideShowBase.py                 \_ utils.py                        \_ PyQt4                       \_ Qt.so                       \_ QtCore.so                       \_ QtGui.so                       \_ __init__.py                       \_ _qt.so                       \_ libQt.a                       \_ libQtCore.a                       \_ libQtGui.a /code/pre  but since my tool requires PyQt4 I included required files too but  again that gives below error:  precodeTraceback (most recent call last):   File "/Applications/Gallery.app/Contents/Resources/script", line 12, in &lt;module&gt;     import utils   File "/Applications/Gallery.app/Contents/Resources/utils.py", line 4, in &lt;module&gt;     from PyQt4 import QtGui, QtCore ImportError: dlopen(/Applications/Gallery.app/Contents/Resources/PyQt4/_qt.so, 2): Symbol not found: _PyCapsule_Type   Referenced from: /Applications/Gallery.app/Contents/Resources/PyQt4/_qt.so   Expected in: flat namespace  in /Applications/Gallery.app/Contents/Resources/PyQt4/_qt.so /code/pre  Earlier I was getting exifread module not found so i copied it too and got rid of the error but doing the same for PyQt4 didn't worked :(  <comment135378> What happens if you copy the directories and scripts manually. Also note my note in my answer on your last post about doing a similar thing for my action <comment136857> The normal tool for doing this is [Py2App](http://pythonhosted.org/py2app/) for which the code includes a PyQt example <comment136966> @Mark: this would be it, i will give it a try...
