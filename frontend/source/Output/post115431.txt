Battery value in terminal different to battery value in menu bar <body> My MacBook Pro Retina is currently reporting 100% battery in the menu bar, however if I run the following command in terminal;  precodeioreg -l -w0 |grep Capacity /code/pre  The following is returned;  precode| |           "MaxCapacity" = 8520 | |           "CurrentCapacity" = 8434 | |           "LegacyBatteryInfo" = {"Amperage"=679,"Flags"=7,"Capacity"=8520,"Current"=8434,"Voltage"=12906,"Cycle Count"=28} | |           "DesignCapacity" = 8440 /code/pre  If we do strong(8434 / 8520) * 100/strong we get 98.990...% (CurrentCapacity divided by MaxCapacity and multiplied by 100)  I ran the command earlier today and there was an even  greater difference between what terminal reported and what the menu bar icon reported (about 5% different).  What causes this? Thanks  strongEDIT:/strong My MacBook has been plugged into power and saying 100% battery in the menu bar for over an hour, but terminal has been saying 98.990...%. However, I ran the command again and it now says 100% in terminal;  precode| |           "MaxCapacity" = 8520 | |           "CurrentCapacity" = 8520 | |           "LegacyBatteryInfo" = {"Amperage"=0,"Flags"=5,"Capacity"=8520,"Current"=8520,"Voltage"=12862,"Cycle Count"=28} | |           "DesignCapacity" = 8440 /code/pre  (CurrentCapacity and MaxCapacity are now equal)  Does this mean my MacBook 'lies' and says the battery is charged an hour before it actually is?
