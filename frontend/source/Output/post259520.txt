MacBook pro hard drive clicking won't start, installing new hard drive <body> My 2010 15" MacBook pro has a hard drive that suddenly started clicking.   And when I start now I can enter my password but as it boots, after a while it starts clicking and won't boot up.  As I'm thinking of getting a new hard drive, where can I get the operating system?   Now of course I should have used time machine and an external drive, but it is too late now.  I did back up most of my files to an external drive, but not the latest files :-(  .  Ideally if I can start my Mac just one time I would do a time machine back up.  But right now I can't even start it one time.  <comment324737> Have you tried Internet Recovery?  Hold Cmd-Option-R while booting.  You should be able to download the version that came with your Mac, then you can upgrade to the version of your choice
