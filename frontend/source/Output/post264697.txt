PDFScanner Automation <body> I recently purchased PDFScanner to convert a bunch of scans into searchable, smaller-sized PDFs. I specifically picked PDFScanner because of its AppleScript automation (see "Features" section on PDFScanner's website).  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/OXedf.png" alt="enter image description here"  However, when I put together the above script using the built-in commands as documented in PDFScanner's AppleScript library and tried to run it, I got the following error:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/tAkYH.png" alt="enter image description here"  At this point, I'm stuck. I've contacted the developer. He said this exact same scripts works for him and that I should try to delete and reinstall PDFScanner, which I did to no avail. Can anybody figure out what the problem is?  hr  Here's the complete script:  precodeon run {input, parameters}      tell application "PDFScanner"         deskew input         rasterize input         ocr input     end tell      return input end run /code/pre  <answer293570> As it turns out, the cause of the problem was trivial. I simply used the wrong type of (formatted) quotation marks in codetell application "PDFScanner"/code. After removing the formatting, everything worked like a charm. This workflow saved me quite some time:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/umQxc.png" alt="enter image description here"  precodeon run {input}      tell application "PDFScanner"         repeat with PDF in input             deskew PDF             rasterize PDF             ocr PDF to PDF         end repeat     end tell      return input end run /code/pre  <comment331837> Copy your script, paste into TextEdit, In TextEdit, go to the Format menu and choose Make Plain text. Select & copy plain text from TextEdit into workflow. Give it a whirl. <comment331839> @IconDaemon Intersting idea, but the problem remains. <comment331840> If 'input' is a variable you came up with, try changing it to `input_file_name` or something. Perhaps 'input' is a reserved word in Automator and can't be used as a variable.. <comment331842> @IconDaemon The variable `input` is in fact preconfigured when adding the "Run AppleScript" action to an Automator workflow. The following construct is added automatically: `on run {input, parameters}    (* Your script goes here *)    return input end run` <comment331844> Can you change it anyway and give it a test? <comment331845> @IconDaemon I did right away, but to no avail. <comment331849> Oh, well. Take a look at these links: [Apple Support](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/6503937?start=0&tstart=0) and [StackExchange](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/197245/applescript-expected-then-but-found-identifier). <comment331853> @IconDaemon Thanks for the links. I had found the Apple Support thread during my own searching but not the StackExchange post. Both don't seem to provide any further suggestions to my case, however.
