Mac connects to network with no problem but browsers can't connect to websites <body> Computer has Mavericks 10.9.5.  Chrome, Firefox, and Safari all do not connect to websites though the network is clearly connected.  *****  EDIT:  Browsing works in safe mode *****  I've read many articles and tried the following solutions:  1)  Set DNS servers to Google DNS and open DNS.  2)  Reinstalled operating system through the internet recovery.  The internet for the recovery worked as expected, so this issue is something specific to browsing.  3)  Added Chrome, Firefox, Safari to mac firewall  4)  Removed System Configuration folder from library/preferences  5)  Disabled McAffee antivirus put on by work IT  6)  Ran McAffee scan and found nothing  7)  Renewed DHCP  Anyone have any ideas?  Thanks in advance!  <answer199855> Turns out that HBSS was preventing browsing due to not having the latest Mcaffee updates.  Thanks to all who helped me through this!  <answer288290> I have experienced for a few days the same issue on MacOS Sierra (10.12.5).  No one of the suggestion found on internet seemed to work.  Finally, while installing the "strongLittle Snitch 4 Public Beta/strong" to check firewall trouble, the browser functionality suddenly springed back. I also choose to 'force quit' the installation to avoid to shut down or restart my Mac.  I guess that the Little Snitch installation overwrited some files, resolving the issue, without ever have to restart browsers or computer.  <comment238880> Run network utility & see if you can ping stackechange.com &/or google.com If no, see if you can ping 104.16.14.128 & 216.58.208.46 <comment238881> I'll do that straight away.  I forgot to mention, that browsing works in safe mode and I'm using the subject Mac currently.  I'm going to have to log into regular mode then back into safe mode in order to post the results, so it will be a few minutes before I can tell you what happened. <comment238883> Ping worked for all four.  No problems <comment238884> So it's either a port or an app block... Check without firewall. Check for presence of LittleSnitch, which is a user Firewall if you don't know it. Maybe test https addresses like https://iforgot.apple.com to see if that can get through. Or maybe try Terminal nc -v portquiz.net 80 [or 8080, 443 etc]to see if a port is open [you appear to need to quit that after each query with Ctrl/c or subsequent queries go silent] <comment238885> Okay.  Can't get to https sites.  Port test times out for each port.  Turning off firewall didn't work.  I know it's not https, but I tried fandango.com.  Interestingly, the fandango icon on the browser tab appeared before the browser timed out. <comment238886> rebooted router recently? [I'm running out of ideas, though] <comment238887> Yes.  And connected to different networks.  Tetsujin, thank you so much for taking the time to help me.  I really appreciate it! <comment239900> Have you tried creating a fresh account on the Mac? I'm presuming you didn't do a _clean_ install of the OS. <comment239908> I had a similar problem, though with me it was just one site. Do ever remember editing `/private/etc/hosts` file? That's where I had the problem, run `cat /private/etc/hosts` and make sure it only has three lines other than the comments. You can also post it in a comment, it doesn't contain any confidential info. Also do have this issue if you connect to internet with WLAN, and Wifi? <comment239909> If you can connect in Safe mode, then it means something is getting loaded after boot. Two usual culprits are kernel extensions, and Launch Agents/Daemon. Try `kextstat | grep -v com.apple`, and `launchctl list | grep -v com.apple`, to list those, respectively. Find anything you don't recognise? Like @Tetsujin said make sure you have any reverse firewall app like Little Snitch configured properly. <comment240037> @calion, thanks for the question.  On your suggestion, I set up a new user account with no change to browsing performance. <comment240038> @user14492, I got 4 lines from cat /private/etc/hosts:                   127.0.0.1   localhost 255.255.255.255 broadcasthost ::1               localhost  fe80::1%lo0  localhost <comment240039> @user14492, here are the results of keyextstat and launchctl:  [link] (http://imgur.com/7YPqqjB)  Not sure what I'd be looking for here, but I don't see anything that jumps out as unusual to me. <comment240040> @user14492, finally, I have tried connecting through wireless and ethernet with same results.  Also, looked for little snitch specifically and didn't find it.  Not sure if the comp has any other reverse firewall app. <comment240077> First thing, run this `networksetup -listallnetworkservices`, it should print out a few names. Them run `networksetup -setv6off name` name being the way you are currently connecting to internet (prob Wi-Fi). It should ask for you password. Then try connecting see if it works. I'm seeing a few of launch daemons with label `address.anonymous.*`, that don't make sense,  do you know what they might be. Because it's unusual for the label to be like this. I have none, perhaps they were installed by your Work IT guys? Try running the command in Safe Mode, it's a good chance it might be one of them. <comment240099> Well, that definitely did something, but it didn't stick.  I ran the command in safe mode and logged back into regular mode.  I attempted to connect to a website.  The loading spinner in the browser tab moved fast as one would expect if it's working and the page title immediately loaded.  Then it processed for 15 seconds with no change. I figured it was reverting back to the previous behavior.  Interestingly, I went to kill the network and as soon as I did, the page loaded.  After that, every attempt to connect to a page timed out with no page load and a very slow loading spinner. <comment240107> @user14492, sorry didn't answer your question.  Not sure what the anonymous launch daemons are.  I've been working on a Django app for a few months and had no problems.  Not sure if it could be related to that in any way?  Maybe a module I installed?  Though I haven't installed any recently.  I don't know. <comment240540> Sorry, I wasn't clear. I meant `networksetup` commands in regular mode. And run the `launchctl` & `kextstat` in safe mode. So you can see which ones are not loaded in safe mode, one of them could be the culprit. Anyways, it's good that the page loaded, so perhaps your network service is switching back to v6. You can check that with `networksetup -getinfo name`, also if you wanna read more just run `networksetup`. Have you tried creating a new account, and see if you can access the web there? <comment240683> @user14492, I apologize for misunderstanding.  Good news though.  My team's IT manager was able to sort it out.  Turns out HBSS was not allowing me to browse because I needed to update McAffee, apparently.  He did some things related to that and I'm back up and running.  My organization's security settings are kind of interesting.  Anyway, I can't thank you enough for taking all of this time to help me.  I truly appreciate it.  You're very kind.
