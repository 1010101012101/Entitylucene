How to find image compression type used in PDF? <body> I don't know how to find the image compression type used in a PDF on my Mac.  I've tried Adobe Acrobat Pro, but the "Document Properties" box does not show any data regarding compression.  <answer240656> The 'compression type' (e.g. JPG, PNG, TIFFâ€¦) can vary from image to image within the PDF document, which is why it's not shown in the general document properties. Instead, use the strongPreflight/strong function to analyse all document pages and get a list of page objects including every single embedded image and its compression/encoding method.  Steps (based on Acrobat Pro XI):  ol liIn the right-hand Tools column, go to "Print Production" and click "Preflight"./li liIn the Preflight dialog window, go to the tab "Profiles" and expand the list of profiles under "PDF Analysis"./li liChoose the profile "List page objects grouped by type of object", then click the 'Analyse' button and wait until the process ends./li liIn the 'Results' tab, expand the line "Overview", then "Images", then expand the image infos by page number and colour mode (CMYK, RGB, Grey/Black). Double-clicking the page-entry line highlights the image on the document page./li /ol  <comment295794> I assume you already know about this, but https://helpx.adobe.com/acrobat/using/pdf-properties-metadata.html. <comment295796> I do not understand the relevance of your link. <comment295797> I'm voting to close this question as off-topic because it does not appear to be about Apple hardware or software within the scope defined in the [help centre](http://apple.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic). <comment295915> I am using Acrobat Pro XI too. Do you mean "Preflight" instead of "Prepress"? <comment295950> @user598115 Yes, 'Preflight' in the 'Print Production' tools. I'll correct that in the answer.
