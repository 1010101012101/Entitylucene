Disable Mac notifications when running Parallels in full screen? <body> I am on a Mac running Parallels 12. When I run my Windows 10 VM in full screen mode, I don't want to see email or Slack notifications from Mac OS, just Windows 10.  How do I disable Mac OS notifications from coming through when I am running my Windows 10 VM in full screen? Otherwise, I end up seeing double notifications, one for Mac, and one for Windows.  <answer283493> You can turn on Do Not Disturb mode from the notification centre quickly before entering fullscreen on parallels.  Open strongNotification Center/strong - Pull Down to reveal strongDo Not Disturb toggle/strong.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HStQA.png" alt="enter image description here"  Alternatively, You can go to "System Preferences" - Notifications to set custom Do Not Disturb settings. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9cnDB.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment357398> Have you tried turning on DND on your mac? You can find it in Notification Center by scrolling upwards, this may be a manual fix and resets itself at ~8am the next day. <comment357485> To quickly turn on Do Not Disturb you can option click the Notification Center icon.
