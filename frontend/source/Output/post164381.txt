Unlock iPod touch 5 after reset <body> I am the sole owner of the iPod touch 5 and I reset the iPod. Now it's not letting me sign into the iPod with the Apple ID I provided. It keeps telling me I can't unlock the iPod with this Apple ID! How do I fix this?   <comment192713> This happens when the last Apple ID that you used to sign in to your device is different than the one you are providing - if you have signed in to the device using a different ID, try signing in with that one. <comment192721> I don't have another one, I only use one.... I tried my old ones.... Nothing is working <comment192722> Are you sure you are the original owner ?? It does not appear so! <comment192725> Yes I am, I gave my kids the iPods for their birthday, and it was signed into another account just for apps when she first got it, and then I made myself one after I got my own iPod!!! I never had to restart or factory reset it before.... First time for everything... Its confusing <comment192732> you are going to have to visit apple store with proof of purchase to get it unlocked. just to clarify, you are talking about 2 apple id accounts on that device.
