How to take a screenshot of the front window from the command line? <body> The codescreencapture/code utility has a code-w/code switch which allows capturing the front window, but only after highlighting the window and getting a click from the user.  Is there any way to capture the front window non-interactively using some shell command?  <answer91556> The code-l/code option allows capturing a window by ID. It is only shown in the help message and not on the man page.  I don't know any way to find the window IDs that would work with all applications though. This doesn't work with Preview, Activity Monitor, or Chrome:  codescreencapture -l $(osascript -e 'tell application (path to frontmost application as text) to id of window 1') /tmp/screencapture.png/code  <comment107470> I can't find any `screenshot` command on my Mac running OS X 10.8.3. Is it an addition you've installed? Which is your OS version? <comment107493> @jaume corrected to `screencapture`
