FileVault encrypted installation corrupted, unable to boot <body> I recently force-shutdown my MacBook Pro Retina, late-2013 model. After entering my FileVault password to unlock the volume, the Apple logo appears, as does the spinny circle. Given time, the Apple logo turns into the prohibited icon, and stays stuck.  Booting into recovery, I find that I cannot decrypt disk0s2, nor can I install OS X onto it, the OS X partition on my SSD. It's recognized as having partition type "FFFFFFFF-FFFF-FFFF-FFFF-FFFFFFFFFFFF"  The SSD itself is fine, as I can create an image of my entire SSD to an external disk without issue, but the partition seems to be broken.  Is there any way to recover my data?
