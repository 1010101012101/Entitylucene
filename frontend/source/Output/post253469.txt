Can I kill cloudphotosd daemon? <body> I don't use any iCloud features such as photo upload or sharing. Yet, on my Yosemite-based MBPR, I see two processes running that appear to be related to photos:   ul licode/System/Library/CoreServices/cloudphotosd.app/Contents/MacOS/cloudphotosd/code/li licodeSystem/Library/PrivateFrameworks/CloudPhotoServices.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/CloudPhotoServicesConfiguration.framework/Versions/A/XPCServices/com.apple.CloudPhotosConfiguration.xpc/Contents/MacOS/com.apple.CloudPhotosConfiguration/code/li /ul  Can I safely stop these daemons without affecting any functionality that is not related to iCloud or iCloud-based photo sharing?  If so, what is the right way to stop these processes?  (I know I can codekill -9/code them, and I could write a script that does that every time I log in, but if there is a codelaunchd/code configuration I can alter to avoid starting them at all, I'd like to find out what it is.)
