Use tap to click instead of click to select user on start up <body> I have Mac OS X 10.10.3. On startup of the OS you can select between different users on the machine. To select a user you have to do a full click, but instead I want to use tap to click.  Can this be changed in the settings somehow?  <answer201954> Is your "Tap to click" enabled?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5NEP0.png" alt="Tap to click"  <comment243501> What do you mean by touch? <comment243503> tap-to-click should be the correct translation I think. <comment243504> I've been wondering about this for a while. Question upvoted. <comment243505> Is your display a touch screen? Or do you wanna hover over the user without click? Or just 1 click? <comment243506> @emotality: I'm using a Mac Book Pro without touch screen. I want to tap on the user instead of physically pressing down the trackpad. <comment243510> Yes this is enabled, but still I have to do a "click" on login. Everything else seems to work with a tap, but not the login one. <comment243513> No, I only tried `sudo defaults write com.apple.driver.AppleBluetoothMultitouch.trackpad Clicking -int 1`. I'll try yours and tell you the results. <comment243514> That's a first! Have wired mouse plugged in, never noticed. Will edit answer once I get the answer! My bad.. <comment243521> @klanomath: It didn't worked. Even after a restart it doesn't work.
