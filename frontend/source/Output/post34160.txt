How can I control where photos end up when I sync them to my iPhone? <body> I'm trying to have fewer photos on my iPhone (3GS running iOS5), and if possible to have them searchable by naming them.  With this in mind I used Image Capture to download all 500+ pictures onto my MacBook Air (running Lion), then synced my iPhone with iTunes to remove them all.   (To do this, I made a folder called Empty Folder and put it in my Pictures folder, selected it in the iPhone's Photos tab in iTunes - you can't, for some no doubt magical Apple reason, select any folder that isn't a subfolder within another folder - and synced. Only way I could find to do it, other than wearing out my fingertip by deleting all the photos one by one. I couldn't see any way of deleting a whole 'album' of photos on the iPhone itself or in iTunes.)  I then named all the photos I wanted to keep - 111 of them - and dragged them into another subfolder in Pictures, this one called iPhone Photos.   I connected the phone again, and in iTunes and the phone's Photos tab I deselected Empty Folder and selected iPhone Photos.   All hunky dory. All 111 photos are now on the iPhone.   Except that there are now three albums on the phone: the empty Camera Roll, Photo Library with 111 photos, and iPhone Photos, with the same 111 photos, organised differently.   What the...?  Is there any way of getting the photos I want to keep into the Camera Roll and getting rid of the extra albums?  <answer34175> To add pictures to the Camera Roll, you have to snap them with the built-in camera (or with a screenshot) on the iPhone.  The Photo Library contains all the pictures, they may be additionally organised in user-specific folders (like your iPhone Photos folder for instance).  <comment38985> Is there a specific reason you are not using iPhoto?
