How do I create a DMG file from a directory? <body> I'm trying to add a few files into a dmg. How do I create a DMG file from a directory?   <answer48415> Some step by step instructions can be found here.  After opening Disk Utility:     ol   liClick the New Image icon/li   liPlace the contents of folder/directory into the newly created disk image./li   /ol   <answer50040> If you want to do it from the command line, you can use hdiutil like so:  precodehdiutil create -volname WhatYouWantTheDiskToBeNamed -srcfolder /path/to/the/folder/you/want/to/create -ov -format UDZO name.dmg /code/pre  Man hdiutil for more details.  <answer217781> I ran across this just as late, and I figured I'd save some time for people.br I used this thread to make my dmg file, but I had to use the "-fs " parameter or hdiutil would error with error -5341.br Using Yosemite, I ran the following:  codehdiutil create -fs HFS+ -srcfolder /Users/danlund/TestFolder/ -volname Test test.dmg/code  <answer227318> On Yosemite this did it for me too.  Made a small function:  precodedmg(){   hdiutil create -fs HFS+ -srcfolder "$1" -volname "$2" "$2.dmg" } /code/pre  Usage in Terminal:   precodedmg /My/Source/Folder NameOfDmg /code/pre  <comment55473> Could you be more precise? You can create DMG with Disk Utility, do you want something to automate it (bash scripting...)? <comment55474> @Lo√ØcWolff Nope, no need to be. I didn't know that Disk Utility allowed for that. <comment102640> Just what I was looking for! Made a bash script to help automate it for convenience: https://gist.github.com/AlistairIsrael/5308455 <comment167423> How does one create a DMG of the smallest size for the given folder? I'm referring both to the size of the .dmg file, and to the size of the filesystem when it's later mounted. If I'm compressing a 73MB folder, I'd like both of these to be 73MB + the minimal filesystem overhead. I'd also like the .dmg to be compressed, so that it takes up less space. Are these possible? I see no options for these two in Disk Utility, on Mavericks. <comment168001> accepted answer didn't work for me, this one did! <comment232426> What exactly do you mean by "place"? When I click and drag a folder to the newly created disk image, nothing happens. And I don't see another option for adding files. <comment276100> You have to add where to save the function (e.g. .bash_profile)
