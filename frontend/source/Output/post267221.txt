My YouTube app is stuck and never starts downloading on iPhone 6, iOS 10 (screenshot attached) <body> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/X5dpA.png" width="280"   I have waited for an hour it doesn't work. All others apps are downloading smoothly. Also restrictions are off. I also tried to download it through iTunes from my laptop.  <comment335265> That "Get" button is for the Google app below, not the Youtube app, which shows the non-responsive download circle. <comment335266> @Umer Aslam - have you forced a restart of the device by holding down the Home & Power buttons? <comment335472> @tetsujin I am talking about the youtube app. The download circle is not responding. I have restarted the phone many times. But the circle remains just there. <comment335473> @IconDaemon No I haven't. What does the force restart do??
