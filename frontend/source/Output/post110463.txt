xcode-select --install not available on update server <body> I'm trying to install the new command line tools in OS X 10.9, and I get this weird error from Apple.     Can't install the software because it is currently available from the Software Update server.   codexcode-select --install/code  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kQHNp.png" alt="screenshot"     A workaround is to download the tools from here https://developer.apple.com/downloads/index.action â€“  nnyby   But that also returns an error.  img src="https://i.imgur.com/maM2KFU.png" alt="screenshot"  Can anyone offer an alternative way to download this?  <answer111746> The site seems to be online again now. \o/  Here's a direct link to the download if the site goes offline again:  http://adcdownload.apple.com/Developer_Tools/command_line_tools_os_x_mavericks_for_xcode__late_october_2013/command_line_tools_os_x_mavericks_for_xcode__late_october_2013.dmg  <answer142400> XCode Command Line Tools can be downloaded directly from the Apple Developer site here as pointed out by this stackoverflow answer.  You could also just run my XCode CLT install/bootstrap script if you're looking for a quick automated solution.  <answer282415> This error could also mean that you already have the command tools installed. The error message should have been more on to the point.  <comment130126> A workaround is to download the tools from here: https://developer.apple.com/downloads/index.action# <comment136093> It just produces 'Your session has expired'.
