How to make a Mac harddrive partition non bootable <body> Just recently added an SSD drive replacing the optical drive. Carbon Copy the whole partition and now left with 2 bootable drives. How do I make the old partition no longer bootable? I've changed the default boot using Startup Disk utility, but want to make the partition completely non bootable  Thanks  <answer70331> To check whether a disk drive is bootable, open Terminal (in ApplicationsUtilities) and type (replace code/Volumes/SSD/code with the folder your disk drive is mounted at):  precodebless --info /Volumes/SSD/ /code/pre  If the output looks similar to this:  precodefinderinfo[0]:      0 =&gt; No Blessed System Folder finderinfo[1]:      0 =&gt; No Blessed System File finderinfo[2]:      0 =&gt; Open-folder linked list empty finderinfo[3]:      0 =&gt; No alternate OS blessed file/folder finderinfo[4]:      0 =&gt; Unused field unset finderinfo[5]:      0 =&gt; No OS 9 + X blessed X folder 64-bit VSDB volume id:  0x844F837C9317318A /code/pre  your computer won't be able to boot from the drive.  For comparison, this is what the output of a bootable disk drive would look like:  precodebless --info /  finderinfo[0]:     62 =&gt; Blessed System Folder is /System/Library/CoreServices finderinfo[1]: 327769 =&gt; Blessed System File is /System/Library/CoreServices/boot.efi finderinfo[2]:      0 =&gt; Open-folder linked list empty finderinfo[3]:      0 =&gt; No alternate OS blessed file/folder finderinfo[4]:      0 =&gt; Unused field unset finderinfo[5]:     62 =&gt; OS X blessed folder is /System/Library/CoreServices 64-bit VSDB volume id:  0xD9A24BFA7A5E7EDC /code/pre  The command codebless/code includes option code--unbless/code to unset volume bootability (from codeman bless/code):     em--unbless directory/em  Use the HFS+ volume mounted at directory and unset any persistent blessed files/directories in the HFS+ Volume                                 Header.   So if you find out in the output above that your drive is bootable, "unbless" it:  precodesudo bless --unbless /Volumes/SDD/ /code/pre
