How to dim (and un-dim) display in automator <body> For those that are interested in the final script you can get it here  h2original question/h2  hr  I am trying to make a alarmclock script to wake me up. but I can't figure out how to change the screen brightness in automator.img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Mcftj.png" alt="here is my workflow without brightness"  I found a way to control brightness with the commandline. but I can't get it to work in automator     I'm the original author of the code listed in this hint. I originally wrote it for two reasons: first, to adjust brightness automatically by location on my iBook G4, which had no ambient light sensor, and second, so I could have my laptop turn on the backlight when a long operation finished, providing a quiet form of notification I could use while at a seminar.   http://sabi.net/nriley/software/brightness.zip is 4-way universal, 10.5+. I compiled it under 10.6 with:...   (see full forum page )   but when I try to use   precodebrightness 0 /code/pre  or  precodebrightness 1 /code/pre  I get an error in automator. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/OwA63.png" alt="error"  am I using the run shell script wrong? could this be done easier in apple script? is there a alltogether easyer way to do this?  strongI need to turn the brightness up and down in automator how is this done?/strong  strongUpdate/strong  I tried the apple script method you mentioned and it....showed the overlay that shows when the key is pressed but did nothing else  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rMDU0.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer16624> To use the command line way you tried, you have to install some software. You can download it, and find install directions, here.  Another option: You can run an AppleScript from your Automator workflow to press the brightness up/down keys. Up:  precodetell application "System Events" to key code 107 /code/pre  Down:  precodetell application "System Events" to key code 113 /code/pre  Note: you may have to Enable Access for Assistive Devices for the AppleScript to work.  <answer16665> Where did you install the “brightness” command? Even if you've set up your PATH in the shell coderc/code scripts, it may not take effect for these commands because Automator isn't run emfrom/em a shell. (You can set environment for all programs including GUI using code~/.MacOSX/environment.plist/code, but I wouldn't recommend fiddling with PATH just for this.)  I suggest changing your Automator workflow to use the full path to where it's installed, e.g.  precode/usr/local/bin/brightness 1 /code/pre  <answer111256> Try having the automator run this AppleScript. It works for me!  precodeset brightness_level to 1.0  tell application "System Events"     tell application "System Preferences" to reveal the anchor "displaysDisplayTab" of pane named "Displays"     tell slider 1 of group 1 of tab group 1 of window 1 of process "System Preferences"         set value to brightness_level     end tell end tell /code/pre  <comment18168> I belive I have installed it...I CAN go to the terminal and say  brightness 0 and have the screen go dark... but it won't work in the script...but I will try this other way and let you know <comment18170> also when I use either of those scripts I JUST see the sun that shows how bright the screen is...without it changing at all... =( I think I am doing something wrong... <comment18192> @mjrider Can you take a screenshot of just the Run Shell Script action for me? That's weird with the scripts; they now do that on mine too. I wonder why they aren't working... <comment18204> http://www.screencast.com/t/f6g9CSMDmf8 I get the same results if I use "pass input as argument" <comment18214> it is installed there as stated in above tutorial http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20090901021817717 <comment18216> @mjrider: I don't see a specific place mentioned in the main text, but I do see `/usr/local/bin` and `/Library` (not a good idea) mentioned. But *neither of these places is in `PATH` by default*, so you must use the full path to *where you actually installed it*. <comment18217> @kevin reid http://www.screencast.com/t/Od4RTdNt5NRY I did place it in /user/local/bin. I can run this command from terminal right off the bat without any other command. and it works find http://www.screencast.com/t/Bkyv91LPySN <comment18218> That's because you have `/usr/local/bin` configured in your `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile`. Programs not running from a Terminal will not have these settings. **Use the full path to the command in your Automator configuration.** <comment18219> OOOHHHH so insted of "brightness 1" use "/usr/local/bin/brightness 1" IN THE SCRIPT in automator? (wasn't quite clear in your answer thats what you ment) <comment18220> beautiful that works...I still would edit your answer to make it more clear thats what you ment. thanks <comment320039> This no longer works in macOS Sierra
