How to know where file is going to be saved? <body> I have an application that is going to save a file to my MacBook Air El Capitan.  Trouble is, I cannot seem to find a way to determine where it's going to save the file in the dialog.  How do I find the FULL PATH of where it's going to save it?  The file save dialog appears to give me no way to determine this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kmwFh.png" alt="enter image description here"  strongWhere is it going to save the file?/strong  <answer258489> Click on position indicated by the red arrow in the figure below:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZQtGx.png" alt="enter image description here"   This will allow you to choose which folder/path you need. You can also use the Command - Shift - G to open the dialog to explicitly paste / type in a path.  ul liEnter a filename in the File Open dialog/li liSave file to hidden directory with standard OS X save dialog/li /ul  <comment323130> You can always see the full (somehow inverted) path by clickin' on the drop-down menu (the current folder name) left to the search filed. <comment323132> @klanomath So it just shows as a list, instead a path? <comment323134> Yepp, it's no path like the common cli path. But both are only metaphors... <comment323135> @klanomath  Thanks, that's NOT obvious.
