Identify which apps are draining the battery on an iPhone or other iOS device for iOS 10? <body> How to find which apps are draining the battery on an iOS device in iOS 10?  Previously in iOS 8 you could go to Settings  Battery to see a list of apps with a percentage number for rating how much battery they were responsible for using, as shown in this posting. Gone in iOS 10.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fQUgw.png" alt="enter image description here"  I found the Question How to check what causes iPhone battery to drain out?. But that Question and its Answers do not really describe how to identify particular problematic apps.  <answer268431> h1Be patient/h1  That list of apps with percentages may not appear immediately.  You may need to actively use your device for strongas much as an hour/strong before that list will appear. During that time you will see a message explaining that it may take “a few minutes” of usage. In my experience, that is an underestimate.  <comment337107> Also note that those figures represent the power usage during the indicated period (24 hours or 7 days), so if your usage in that time was unusual then the figures will be misleading.
