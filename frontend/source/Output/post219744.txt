Allowing sudo privileges, but not access to sites <body> Is it possible to make it so a user can use the sudo command in terminal, but not have access to sites other then those allowed through parental controls, without a third party system?   <answer219745> The two concepts are mutually exclusive.  Adding someone to the sudoers list effectively gives them the power to bypass any restriction you wish to impose on them.    <answer219752> By adjusting the emsudoers/em file (em/etc/sudoers/em) with codesudo visudo/code it should be possible to accomplish this. It is a hell of a job and you need a profound knowledge of all commands to fine-tune this while avoiding errors and loopholes though.   You have to add the user to the emUser privilege specification/em section  precode... # User privilege specification root    ALL=(ALL) ALL %admin  ALL=(ALL) ALL ... /code/pre  Then use a whitelist (or a blacklist) of allowed (or disallowed) commands:  Examples:  whitelist  precode# User privilege specification root    ALL=(ALL) ALL %admin  ALL=(ALL) ALL user    ALL=/usr/bin/nano,/usr/bin/opensnoop /code/pre  blacklist  precode# User privilege specification root    ALL=(ALL) ALL %admin  ALL=(ALL) ALL user    ALL=!/usr/libexec/PlistBuddy,!/usr/bin/passwd,!/usr/sbin/* /code/pre  You may mix whitelist and blacklist.  Please check codeman sudoers/code how to simplify things or narrow things down by configuring emUser, Runas, Host and Cmnd alias specifications/em.  hr  Check the accepted answer to the question How to prevent sudo users from running specific commands? for the pitfalls of configuring a simple command like codernano/code in the sudoers file.  <comment265819> i think the real question should be why you trust one this much so you thinking about giving them sudo powers but don't trust them to not go on certain websites?
