Under which circumstances is the iOS Music App reset? <body> I have observed that sometimes the Music.app on iOS resets itself which means that the "up next" playlist is erased and replaced by what appears to be either some sort of Genius playlist or just shuffling all songs on the iPhone.  I would like to "schedule" a bit ahead what music to listen to next, even if that "next" is only on the next day.  Under which exact circumstances does this reset happen?  ul liIt is iOS 10.1 with an active Apple Music subscription and iCloud Music Library enabled./li liTherefore I'm not syncing music with iTunes/li liIt could be connected to some "library updates" or other bookkeeping tasks that are run in the background. I have observed that this happens if I charge the phone.  But not if I only plug it in for 5 minutes.  It does happen during overnight charging, though./li /ul
