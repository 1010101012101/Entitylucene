How to modify settings of Bootcamp inside the Windows partition <body> This is my first time partitioning my disk, so please excuse my ignorance.  As I started using the new partition, I find weird stuff are happening... my scroll bar is going way too fast, I can't right click with the right side of my mouse (I configured that on my mac partition), and I can't click on something by tapping the trackpad.  Can someone help me manage the Bootcamp settings that (supposedly) I installed while using Bootcamp Assistant?  Thanks a bunch for your help.
