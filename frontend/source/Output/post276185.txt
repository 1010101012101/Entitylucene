Disable _only_ drag/drop Spaces Split View functionality <body> I have Spaces enabled and "Displays have separate spaces" enabled. There is a behavior on OS-X where if I show the 'spaces bar' at the top of the screen to re-arrange the spaces, it's possible to drag/drop one space on top of another creating a split space (I'm guessing this is "Split View"?).  I hate this behavior. I know I can supposedly disable Split View by unchecking "Displays have separate spaces", but I like that feature.  Is there a way to disable emonly/em the drag/drop Split View functionality?
