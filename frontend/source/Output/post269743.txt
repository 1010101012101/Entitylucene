USB Drive not showing in disk utility (but showing in lsusb) <body> When I plug my USB drive (FAT32 partition) the light turns on, I can see it in lsusb :   precodeBus 036 Device 004: ID 0bc2:231b Seagate LLC Expansion  Serial: NA8NN1NC /code/pre  I can also see it in OSX system report, and I can see the disk hash enough power to work (500 ma/500).  But there is nothing about this disk in the Finder, nothing in Disk utility and nothing with the 'diskutil list' command.  Is there a way to force a repair or a mount using the result of the lsusb command (Bus 036 Device 004: ID 0bc2:231b) ?   Thanks!
