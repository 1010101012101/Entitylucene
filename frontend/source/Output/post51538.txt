Hide webloc extension <body> I know that I can hide emall/em extensions but how do I hide just one, say codewebloc/code? I don't want to hide each the extension of each file individually.  <answer51542> The only thing I could find, suggested by strongBenjamin Schollnick/strong, here., is this:     find -x /path/to/folder -name *.webloc -exec chflags hidden {} +   It will hide the extension for existing files, therefore, you will need to run it again for newly created files.  Althought in the original question its said for Leopard, I guess it will work for Lion too.  <comment58918> Thanks. I still find it strange that there isn't a system-wide switch for that. <comment58922> Apparently it is. Just found this, too. http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/18589/hide-only-app-file-extensions-but-show-the-rest
