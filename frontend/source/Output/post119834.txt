Moving full screen apps between monitors shortcut <body> Does anyone know if it is possible to move a full screen app to another monitor using a shortcut? Or if there is no existing shortcut would it be possible with Applescript?  BetterTouchTool has "Move window to next monitor" as one of its predefined actions but this only works on desktops and not with full-screen apps.  Thanks in advance for any help!  Simon  <answer153933> Did you consider using Keyboard Maestro?  Here is an example of how I deal with moving windows through screens. I just tried to move full screens apps -never tried before- and seems that didn't work well. But you could modify my macros to codeExit full screen/code before moving to the next screen and codeEnter full screen/code after that. The macro for that is called codeType a Keystroke/code.
