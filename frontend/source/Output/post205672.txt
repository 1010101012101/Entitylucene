ATV3 Youtube Quality <body> I have a strongem3rd generation   Apple TV/em/strong that I'm trying to watch some strongemYouTube/em/strong tutorials on but the streaming quality is really low.br strongemHow do I select a higher definition?/em/strong I can't seem to find an option or setting for it.br The clip I'm watching right now actually started at around strongem720p~1080p/em/strong for the first ten seconds or so before reverting back to a blurry mess. It's obviously auto adjusting to the available bandwidth, just like it does in an ordinary browser, on an ordinary computer.br I don't mind if I have to wait for videos to load. I don't mind if it's not a emFull HD cinematic experience./em I just need it to be watchable. Surely there's something I have overlooked.  <answer205709> You should change the default TV resolution of your Apple TV.  codeSettings --&gt; Audio&amp;Video --&gt; TV Resolution/code and choose the resolution you want.   <answer224153> I would first look at the network connection and the Internet connection.  If neither of those are the issue, or (as with me) neither of those can be changed, the best I can suggest is to quickly pause the video near the beginning and wait a while, in hopes that your Apple TV will build a sufficient buffer at the desired resolution.  If the resolution downgrades before you can pause it, back out and try again.  I can't guarantee it'll work, but since there are no settings that would allow you to force a specific resolution with YouTube, that's the best I can suggest.  Sorry, enzo, but that doesn't seem to be the issue.  He does seem to have the resolution set, otherwise he wouldn't get 10 seconds in the resolution he wanted and then a blurry mess afterward.  Unfortunately I have a similar problem that happens intermittently, and I suspect the problem is with my network connection between the Apple TV and my router (which, due to certain constraints, are not in the same room and so I have to use a wireless connection).  It may also be that the Internet connection is too slow to allow for the resolution he wanted.  <comment271838> Yeah, that is pretty much what's happening. The old *pause, wait, buffer, play* trick was the first thing I tried, naturally. It doesn't seem to work the same as a typical web browser. What's weird is that; sometimes, even when it's stopping & starting, it keeps trying to playback at a decent resolution. Sometimes, it doesn't. Other times, even when it's mostly (or fully) loaded, it *doesn't* try to playback at a higher resolution. It's weird, like there's no logical pattern..
