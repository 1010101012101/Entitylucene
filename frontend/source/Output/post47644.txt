How can I tell when the iPhone is actively using GPS versus only using region monitoring? <body> I run Google Latitude on an iPhone 4 with background updates turned on.  How can I distinguish between when it's actively grabbing the location vs when it's using region monitoring to wait for the phone to move?  As far as I can tell, both icons look the same in the status bar.  <answer47646> In Settings -- Location Services each application that uses location services is listed.  In that list any apps that are emcurrently/em using locations services or have used location services in the last 24 hours includes a little arrow icon.  The icons differ based on whether they are currently or recently used location services, and if currently then whether it's a geofence or regular updates.  The icons and description for each icon are included in that settings panel.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9UKPz.png" alt="Location services panel showing apps that use location service, including google maps with an arrow next to it, indicating recent use of location services"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kyTxv.png" alt="Description of each icon in the location services panel"
