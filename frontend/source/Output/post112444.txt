TCP Congestion Control Algorithm of OSX10.7 <body> How can I find out which algorithm OSX10.7 uses (NewReno, SACK, Tahoe...) and if possible, how can I change it?  <answer113925> This Stack Overflow question should help: How to load a different congestion control algorithm in Mac OS X?     The LEDBAT congestion control algorithm is built into OSX Lion   (10.7.X) and does not need to be compiled separately. I don't think it   would be possible to use LEDBAT in an earlier version of OSX without   alot of work. LEDBAT provides for 'background' transfers and may be   selected on a socket by setting the following socket option -   setsocketopt(sock, SOL_SOCKET, O_TRAFFIC_CLASS, SO_TC_BK,   sizeof(int)). It also seems that the socket's traffic class may   affected by the DSCP value in the IP header.      Additionally OSX has had the facility to load kernel modules for other   network protocols for some time using their Network Kernel Extensions   (NKE) - for example there is an NKE module that has been developed for   the SCTP protocol.   Alternatively, another related question might be useful: How do you set the TCP congestion control algorithm on OS X?     According to   http://www.macgeekery.com/gspot/2006-03/mac_os_x_network_tuning_guide   you can actually modify the algorthims used by Mac OS X by using the   sysctl command, but you cannot use anything but the New Reno algorithm
