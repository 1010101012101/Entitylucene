Microsoft 2011 for Mac <body> For school I have to create a Powerpoint presentation and I am experiencing a problem. My teacher asked me to use a Text Effect of strongGradient Fill - Black, Outline - White, Outer Shadow/strong and when I try to hover the mouse over the text effects it will not show me the name of the effect.   Is it a problem with my mac? Should I report this to Microsoft? Any help will be appreciated.   <answer105116> Select the text and right click to select "Format Textâ€¦" from the contextual menu.  ul liClick "Text Fill" to find the "Gradient" settings./li liClick "Text Line" to set outline colors./li liClick "Text Shadow" to set shadow settings for the selected text./li /ul  <answer105117> Click on the block of text you wish to apply the effect to.
