How to suppress the Delete From All Devices confirmation in the Photos app? <body> I installed Yosemite 10.10.3, which comes with the new Photos app. Seems nice so far...  When deleting a photo on my MacBook, a warning message is shown:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6ZgVt.png" alt="Delete from All Devices â€” This photo will be deleted from all your devices."  I don't need to see this every time I delete a photo. I can't see any settings to suppress this message - are there any known workarounds?  <answer181474> If you delete the photo or photos using the right-click context menu rather than the keyboard shortcut then this confirmation sheet is not shown.  <answer182873> Command+Delete avoids the confirmation dialog.  <comment216134> Thanks for the tip, but as of OSX 10.10.3 I'm finding that the right-click context menu's Delete also shows the delete confirmation message <comment328891> That is much less painful, thank you. I was hoping for some random .plist somewhere that had "ConfirmPhotoDelete" or something...
