Is it possible to combine filevault 1 and 2? <body> My main drive is encrypted with Filevault2.  What I want to do additionally is to have a second user account with Filevault1 encryption set up. I'm not asking how to setup legacy Filevault1 for one user on a modern OSX system, because I know how to do that, just know if I will break my system if I try it with the setup already encrypted with Filevault2.  <comment344886> I don't know (I have never tried it) but as the FileVault1 is just an encrypted disk image of your entire home directory I don't see why it can't live on an encrypted volume. You'd need to unlock the FileVault2 volume before you would be able to log in to unlock your FileVault1 home. But might be easier (more effective and would not cause any problems to the OS) just to keep an encrypted disk image for your secret files within a normal account. This would be safe from users (including admins, root) on the computer who could unlock the disk FileVault2 but wouldn't have your disk image password.
