Can't pinpoint PID that's listening on port <body> I'm simply trying to figure out which PID is listening on a specific port on OS X Yosemite.   Here's what I get when I run nestat -an | grep udp  precodedp4       0      0  *.53675                *.* udp4       0      0  *.53779                *.* udp4       0      0  *.58483                *.* udp4       0      0  *.52426                *.* udp4       0      0  *.55909                *.* udp46      0      0  *.52311                *.* udp46      0      0  *.*                    *.* /code/pre  I'm trying to run a specific process that listens on a particular UDP port, but I can't because it's already in use. I've seen some people mention lsof -i4UDP:[port] but that doesn't work. For example, I can't listen on 5353 (and yes I want to specifically listen on this port) because I don't know how to kill its process of disable its service.  Any other suggestions? Also, -p doesn't work either like it does in Linux.  <comment218083> Well there are following options: lsof -i , sudo lsof -i -n -P | grep TCP , and so on. <comment218085> and try this answers http://stackoverflow.com/q/9856590
