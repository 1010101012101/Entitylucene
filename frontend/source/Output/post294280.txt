iPhone 5 won't turn on after being off for two weeks <body> The iPhone was perfectly working. Then it was left home for two weeks. Battery obviously drained out.  When I came back, I put the iPhone on the charger for ema lot/em time. However, the iPhone and the charger were cold, like nothing is really charging. Charger works, have tested it with a different iPhone.  So now my iPhone still can't be turned on!  How can this be possible?  Edit: I tried hard reset combination, tried to connect to laptop, different chargers...  <comment371439> Connect it to a laptop especially the one that you back it up with - may just be different. Also please edit the title .... <comment371440> @SolarMike thanx, tried that already :( title fixed
