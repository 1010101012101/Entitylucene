What is the recommended way to flag a contact as being deceased in the Contacts app on Lion or Mountain Lion? <body> Death is a sad fact of life and over the years some of my old contacts have died.  I still wish to keep a record of their details, birthday, day they died, notes, spouse, kids etc in my Contacts and am looking for a recommended way to flag those records to indicate that the person is dead. I am interested to know how other people have dealt with this.  <answer59778> I've had the same "need." I guess we all do sooner or later. Here's what I did.  Card menu  Add Field  Dates. Then select the Date field drop down in the contact and select custom.  You can also change the general new contact template in the same Cart menu.  I hope this helps.  <answer59870> You could also add a special symbol to the contact’s comments (I use «†», also known as U+2020 DAGGER), and then create a smart group, where the criterion is codeNote/code  codecontains/code  code†/code (Alt-t).  <answer99038> As CDK suggests, my solution was adding a new custom date.   My problem was that I didn't want to be reminded with this person's birthday every year. Finally, I deleted the birthday and added a new custom date for "birth", so it's not recognized by iCal and there are no more notifications about it.  <answer99043> As others have said, you can add a custom date for codedeceased/code and that will help you keep a record. But that doesn't flag them very well for general viewing. You can't filter by the presence or absence of your custom field (at least not in 10.7).  I would also insert a keyword in the notes to use as your filter, something like code#deceased/code. Then you can set up a filtered group called codeNot dead/code to mask all those poor folks. And conversely a codeDead and gone/code group will help you reminisce.  <comment216760> That's a good idea too.  Thanks.
