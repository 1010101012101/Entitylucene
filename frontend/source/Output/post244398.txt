Is there a way to list all available commands in terminal <body> Is there a way to list all available commands in terminal?   I know linux has codecompgen -c/code is there an equivalent command for OS X?  strongUpdate:/strong The actual issue was that I was using zsh instead of bash. So from zsh, I could either just open codebash/code or run a bash command from zsh codebash -c "compgen -c"/code  <answer244402> Like fd0 commented above, the best source for quickly listing most everything you can do in the Terminal, is by using the strongemBash/em/strong strongbuiltin/strong compgen.  strongemcodeCompgen/code/em/strong interfaces with the "completion" function in Bash, so it is intended to keep a list of most everything you can do in the shell.  So it is interesting that strongtechnically compgen is listing commands, aliases, and functions, as well as a few other things like builtins, variables, groups, jobs and service names./strong  My experience is that it will not list everthing, like applications typcially ran in the GUI, which I will mention below.  You can use the strongemcodeopen/code/em/strong command in OSX for quite a few things, for example.  codecompgen -c/code executes the command in a subshell environment, and its output is used as the possible completions, which is probably what you want. If strongBash/strong if your shell, it will spew out similar information for all commands or a single command if you press kbdTab/kbd kbdTab/kbd.   It's also common in strongemOSX/em/strong that many programs can be executed from the shell, so many program names that you'll find in strongem/Applications/em/strong can also be called via a CLI from the shell.  Similarly, many programs are (at least) at strongem/Applications/Utilities/em/strong, some interesting stuff is at strongem/System/Library/CoreServices/Applications/em/strong (as well as other things under the /System main directory...), and as well sometimes custom programs get put under the classic Unix locations like /usr/bin, usr/local/bin, /opt, and /sys/bin.   Often you can find other interesting things to type, probably also covered above, by typing codehelp/code or codehelp [command or argument]/code, with more information about most programs or builtins coming with codeinfo [command]/code or codeman [command]./code  codeApropos/code is also quite interesting, which you may know already.  These things will get most everything, I imagine there are other things one just needs, or should, hack around and discover...  <answer244403> Just tap the strongTab/strong key twice (kbdTab/kbdkbdTab/kbd).  You'll be prompted if you want to see all possible commands.  Tap strongy/strong and you'll be presented with a list.  You can do that same thing for individual commands to see all options for that specific command.    <answer244481> In codezsh/code you need to enable the completion system. Please read through codeman zshcompsys/code. To install the completion system enter the command   precodecompinstall /code/pre  and follow the directions. Check the codefpath/code variable  precodeecho $fpath /code/pre  in my situation I needed to declare the variable in my .zshrc  precodefpath=(/usr/local/share/zsh/5.0.7/functions) /code/pre  This is the location of my codezsh functions/code. After the codecompinit/code line in your code.zshrc/code add the following lines  precodeautoload -Uz bashcompinit bashcompinit /code/pre  This is the completions entries in my code.zshrc/code  precode#\\\_ COMPLETIONS _///# zstyle :compinstall filename '/Users/fd0/.zshrc' zstyle ':completion:*' list-colors "${(@s.:.)LS_COLORS}" autoload -Uz compinit compinit autoload -Uz bashcompinit bashcompinit /code/pre  I can now enter the command codecompgen -c/code and it behaves similar to codebash/code.  <answer257671> While in Terminal, type kbdTab/kbd kbdTab/kbd. Then you'll see:   codeDisplay all 1653 possibilities? (y or n)./code  Press kbdY/kbd and it will list all possible commands  <comment301192> Assuming your shell is bash then `compgen -c` will work. <comment301296> maybe it is because I am using zsh I am getting `zsh: command not found: compgen` <comment301298> yep, if I enter `bash` then `compgen -c` it works, I guess my question should have been what it the zsh equivalent to the bash command `compgen -c` <comment301362> so I think if you are using zsh and have tweaked your default shell on a Mac then you must already be quite an advanced user :) <comment301363> I'm starring your question, because even though it was "is there a way to list..."  it is always interesting to come back & see what other people are using the command line for on OSX
