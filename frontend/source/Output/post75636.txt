Move cursor in steps using mouse keys <body> Every time I tab on one of the numpad keys to move the cursor with mouse keys it doesn't move enough. Is it possible to customize how much it will move with one tab on the key?  I want it to move like 10-30 pixels by doing a quick-tab on the numpad.  <comment136539> See my answer for possible tips at http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/54677/how-can-i-speed-up-mouse-keys
