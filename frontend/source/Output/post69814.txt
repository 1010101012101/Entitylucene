Restart needed to reconnect Thunderbolt Display? <body> I was just reading the Apple Thunderbolt Wiki and stumbled upon this:     25) If I eject a Thunderbolt device using the Taskbar tool or disconnect the Thunderbolt cable, can I reconnect it again without   restarting?      No. A directly-connected Thunderbolt device that is removed with the   Taskbar tool or by disconnecting the Thunderbolt cable will not be   recognized until you restart the computer.   Is that really true? Does that mean I would have to restart my macbook, if I was connected in the morning, unplugged it, put it to sleep, then went to the office and wanted to work on afterwards?  <answer69819> That only applies to using the Thunderbolt device under Windows 7. It's not the case when you're using OS X â€” you should be able to plug and unplug at will, without needing to restart.  It's not clear from that quote, but if you note, the index of Apple's Thunderbolt FAQ (from which this nugget came), items 21 through 27 relate only to using Thunderbolt devices under Boot Camp and Windows 7.  <comment81079> Ok, thanks. You are right, I didn't read it carefully enough. <comment81080> It's easy to miss if you don't pay attention to the headings, just the questions. Glad I could help.
