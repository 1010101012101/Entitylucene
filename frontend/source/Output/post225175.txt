Get Number of PDF Pages in Terminal <body> How can I output the number of pages in a PDF in the Terminal? I looked into the codelp/code family of commands, with no luck however.  <answer225180> You can use pdf command line tools (xpdf) from foolabs.com  There's codepdfinfo/code which outputs something like this:  precodeTagged:         no Form:           none Pages:          4 Encrypted:      no Page size:      612 x 792 pts (letter) (rotated 0 degrees) File size:      134885 bytes Optimized:      yes PDF version:    1.4 /code/pre  So You can get number of pages with:  precodepdfinfo /path/to/file.pdf | grep Pages /code/pre  <answer225183> Using Apple's codemdls/code:  precode mdls -name kMDItemNumberOfPages file.pdf /code/pre  to get just the number of pages:  precode mdls -name kMDItemNumberOfPages -raw file.pdf /code/pre  <comment273213> What are you really looking for?  In other words, are you just looking for a numeric value as the only output? <comment273220> Built-in and does exactly what I need. Perfect.
