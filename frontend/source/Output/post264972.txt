localhost is always responding with "Connection refused: localhost:80" <body> I've been working with the integrated webserver of OS X El Capitan for a while now. I am developing a website project and thus, this was the perfect solution for me. I was starting the local server using codephp -S localhost:8088 -t ./code in the specific directory containing the website data (index.php etc.). Everything was working fine until I refreshed the page one day and it suddenly printed: codeConnection refused: localhost:8088/code. There were no changes made to any config files or anything else. It doesn't matter which port I am using, it always refuses the connection. Sending a request to code127.0.0.1/code in my browser tells me codeIt works!/code. But, once I am starting the server and calling code127.0.0.1:8088/code, my browser responds with its default page displaying that the connection has been refused, as if I did not start/run the server.  The first thing I did was checking whether the Apache config is broken. But, codeapachectl configtest/code printed codeSyntax OK/code.  When I tried to ping codelocalhost/code, I encountered a 100% package loss, so at first I thought that the bug may be located inside the hosts file. codecat /etc/hosts//code printed out the following:  precode## ## # Host Database # # localhost is used to configure the loopback interface # when the system is booting. Do not change this entry. ## 127.0.0.1 localhost 255.255.255.255 broadcasthost ::1 localhost fe80::1%lo0 localhost /code/pre  Looks appropriate, doesn't it? So, I checked my firewall options and discovered that I had "Stealth mode" activated. Unchecking it resulted in having the ICMP-packages finding their way correctly and there was no package loss any longer.  The thing is that I don't know why this problem suddenly occured and how I am able to fix it. I already restored all Apache config files to the originals, but that didn't solve it neither. It seems to be listening on that port, but I can't access the server as it always refuses the connection. Even if the server is not started, accessing codelocalhost/code prints codeConnection refused: localhost:80/code. I don't know where the error could be located. Apache's error log didn't show anything conspicious neither.  codesudo lsof -i -n -P | grep TCP | grep LISTEN/code showed that codehttpd/code is using IPv6 only, so that should work.  If you need any more (config) files, just request them. Thanks!  <answer266373> It turned out that the problem occured only in Opera, not Safari or any other browser. I found out that I had Opera Turbo enabled which would of course let me access my own codelocalhost/code correctly.
