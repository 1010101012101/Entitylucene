How to open a Finder window even if one is open on a different space already, in Terminal? <body> I often use codeopen ./code to open the current folder from Terminal.app. From time to time this doesn't work. The reason is that the folder in question is already open in some other Finder window on some other Space.  Hunting down this Finder window by searching all spaces takes too long. Neither do I really want to go a different space. I just want to open a new Finder window right there on the current space, regardless of other Finder windows open anywhere else.  I tried codeopen -n ./code but this just hangs.  <answer93197> You might use a script like this:  precode#!/usr/bin/osascript  tell application "Finder"     make new Finder window to POSIX file (system attribute "PWD")     activate end tell /code/pre  The script above always creates a new window. This wouldn't create a new window if a window with the same name already exists on the current space:  precode#!/usr/bin/osascript  launch application "Finder" set pwd to system attribute "PWD" set text item delimiters to "/" tell application "System Events" to tell process "Finder"     set w to windows where name is text item -1 of pwd     if w is {} then         tell application "Finder" to make new Finder window to POSIX file pwd     else         perform action "AXRaise" of item 1 of w     end if     set frontmost to true end tell /code/pre  System Events only includes windows on the current space.  <comment109321> As I don't think `-n` would ever work with finder, I suggest using the "App Expose" mouse gesture. If done from finder, it will show all open finder windows. <comment109337> The first script works splendidly! I named it `reveal` and put it in `/usr/local/bin`.
