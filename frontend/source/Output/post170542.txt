How do I deactivate a broken iphone 4s and switch to an old iphone 4s a friend gave me? <body> I recently broke my iPhone 4s and am not due for an update for another year. My friend is going to let me use her old iPhone 4s. How do I deactivate my broken phone so that my friends phone will now be usable as mine? My carrier is Verizon  <answer170545> You can call Verizon customer support @ 1 (800) 922-0204. They should be able to deactivate your phone and activate the replacement. Even in the case of newer phones that are unlocked like the iPhone 6 - you still need a Verizon rep to activate the device after placing the SIM in it due to how their network is configured.  <answer170657> Try to put your device in DFU mode then do a full iTunes restore. If not fixed then vist the apple store or call Verizon Support.  <comment200486> The so friendly ppl at Verizon can do that free of charge for you. Not sure about the free of charge so some negotiating skills might be needed. <comment200699> Please include information as to how to do that.
