Apps Icons not appearing <body> Some of my Apps Icons are changing to a generic app icon, and I have no idea why. Tried to restart the system and nothing. 3 days ago i updated my Skype and then the icon is gone.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fFd47.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer280954> I can think of three (well, sort of) potential solutions to this. You do not need to try these in any particular order - try one first and if the issue returns, then try the other. Option 1 requires entering commands in Terminal, Option 2 doesn't but sometimes only works temporarily. And the third option is doing both Option 1 and 2.  strongOption 1: Reset icon cache/strong  If you tried the second solution first and it doesn't work (or it only works temporarily), you can try resetting the icon cache.  ul liLaunch Terminal (usually found in the Applications  Utilities folder)/li liEnter the following three commands, one at a time:/li /ul  codesudo find /private/var/folders/ \ -name com.apple.dock.iconcache -exec rm {} \;/code  codesudo find /private/var/folders/ \ -name com.apple.iconservices -exec rm -rf {} \;/code  codesudo rm -rf /Library/Caches/com.apple.iconservices.store/code  strongOption 2: Reset and restart the Dock/strong  This remedy is to reset strongand/strong restart the Dock. However, in doing so, you will need to re-add any non-default icons to your Dock. (I usually find it's a good opportunity for people to start afresh and only add things as they actually use them).  So, if your solution doesn't pan out, you can reset and restart the Dock as follows:  ul liGo to Finder/li liPress and hold the kbdoption/kbd key down/li liNow go to the Go menu/li liSelect the Library option to open the User's emLibrary/em folder. You can let go of the kbdoption/kbd key now./li liGo to the Preferences folder (i.e. within the Library folder)/li liFind and move the strongcom.apple.dock.plist/strong file to the Trash/li liNow open Terminal (usually located in Applications  Utilities)/li liEnter this command codekillall -KILL Dock/code/li liPress kbdenter/kbd/li /ul  This should resolve the issue - but remember you'll need to re-add some apps back to the Dock.  strongOption 3/strong  You may find you need to do both options 1 and 2.  Let me know how you go.  <comment353313> Have they changed everywhere (e.g. Dock, Application Switcher, etc)? Also, what version of macOS are you running? <comment353395> Yes, everywhere. Im running OSx 10.12.4 <comment354168> Actually, I did first option and didnt worked. Then, I did second one and also didnt worked. After did both options I restarted my Mac and the icons came back. Thank you very much, but I cant tell exactly which worked, but after doing both and restarting mac my icons are back :). Thank you!
