Can a Radeon 6770 be used by a Late-2009 iMac 27inch i7? <body> Be original Radeon 4850 is damaged and I need to replace it. Unfortunately the graphic card is still so expensive, even as a used one. But I now found a 6770 significant cheaper and I'm wondering if it would work with my iMac. Anybody who tried it before? Thanks
