Why won't iPhoto open after upgrading to Lion? <body> So, I just downloaded and installed Lion on my iMac. However, I did so on a separate clean partition, and saved Snow Leopard on the other. So, in Lion, I tried to open iPhoto on my Snow Leopard partition, and it crashed. Here's the error message:  com.apple.iPhoto: dyld: Library not loaded:      /Library/Frameworks/iLifeFaceRecognition.framework/Versions/A/iLifeFaceRecognition  Any help would be appreciated!  <answer17925> Though this is from 2010, I think that it will work:   You need to re-install iPhoto because it's missing parts of itself:  To re-install iPhoto  ol liPut the iPhoto.app in the trash (Drag it from your Applications Folder to the trash)/li liGo to HD/Library/Receipts and remove any pkg file there with iPhoto in the name. On 10.6 those receipts may be found in the Finder using the Go menu and selecting Go To Folder/li /ol  In the resulting window type  /var/db/receipts/  ol liRe-install./li /ol  If you purchased an iLife Disk, then iPhoto is on it.  If iPhoto was installed on your Mac when you go it then it’s on the System Restore disks that came with your Mac. Insert the first one and opt to ‘Install Bundled Applications Only.

It's really a iPhoto 9.1.5, Time Machine backup/restore and Lion upgrade issue.  To fix my problem I:  ol liDelete my iPhoto Library on my HD/li liRestore the latest iPhoto Library from Time Machine/li liDelete iPhoto software/li liReinstall iPhoto with my iLife 11 DVD/li liStart iPhoto, but it asked me to upgrade from Internet. I did. /li liWith iPhoto 9.1, I started it and bingo, the issue is fixed./li liAfter a few tests, I did another software update to have the latest iPhoto version, 9.1.5/li /ol  I tried many things the past two days, but only the steps described here worked.  Hope it will help you.  Serge  <answer28914> My iPhoto crashed as well. However, if I turned off photo stream in iCloud it loaded iPhoto OK. Not a final fix obviously but a temporary solution to get up and running.  <answer28952> the 3ivx codec is causing crashes on iPhoto 11, 9.2 when Photostream is activated. Try remove it from   HD/ Library/ Application Support  <comment19607> Thanks. I'll try that when I get a chance <comment19698> No problem @thekmc. <comment33241> The original question was related to a quite specific setup issue (installation of Lion on a separate partition). I assume it's a different problem in your case. If you expect somebody to help you resolve it you should ask a new question.
