Mouse Wheel Emulation on Mac <body> I've recently moved into an office that has standardized on Apple computers and have run into something that I have used with Linux that I know is going to drive me nuts on the Mac. I use a Logitech MarbleMouse, a trackball that does not have a mouse wheel. On Linux, there is a configuration option (EmulateWheel and EmulateWheelButton in evdev) that let's you press a button and have mouse/trackball motion act like a scroll wheel.  Is there anything equivalent on Mac?  <answer98508> You can use KeyRemap4MacBook.  Scroll by moving the pointer while holding the secondary button:  precode&lt;autogen&gt;__PointingRelativeToScroll__ PointingButton::RIGHT&lt;/autogen&gt; /code/pre  Scroll by moving the  the pointer while holding F1:  precode&lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::F1, KeyCode::VK_MODIFIER_EXTRA1&lt;/autogen&gt; &lt;autogen&gt;__PointingRelativeToScroll__ PointingButton::NONE, ModifierFlag::EXTRA1&lt;/autogen&gt; /code/pre  Scroll with F1 and F2:  precode&lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::F1, KeyCode::VK_MOUSEKEY_SCROLL_UP&lt;/autogen&gt; &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::F2, KeyCode::VK_MOUSEKEY_SCROLL_DOWN&lt;/autogen&gt; /code/pre  Scroll by moving the pointer while holding the primary and secondary buttons:  precode&lt;autogen&gt;__SimultaneousKeyPresses__ PointingButton::LEFT, PointingButton::RIGHT, KeyCode::VK_CONFIG_SYNC_KEYDOWNUP_notsave_pointing_relative_to_scroll&lt;/autogen&gt; /code/pre  See the source for the key code values and predefined settings.  <answer155534> You can map scrolling to pressing a key and moving the cursor from the GUI!  Here, I map the scrollwheel action to pressing the codeFn/code key and moving the cursor.  Notice the nice option that enables this behavior for both horizontal and vertical scrolling.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/AEnbn.png" alt="Karabiner GUI screenshot"  By the way, KeyRemap4MacBook is now called Karabiner. https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/  <answer229839> Now Karabiner has an option for Logitech Marble Mouse img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fs0I3.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment115561> Your question actually contains two question (of which the latter is maybe answered [here](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/68848/switching-from-ubuntu-to-os-x-and-im-lost/68858#68858) or [here](http://apple.stackexchange.com/search?tab=votes&q=keyboard%20shortcuts)). Could you pose it as two separate questions to keep the site organised? <comment115592> That should be cleaner. <comment115969> This was dead on! Pointing Device - CursorMove to ScrollWheel - MouseButton4+CursorMove To ScrollWheel in combination with Reverse Vertical Scrolling matched my old settings perfectly! <comment150696> It is not clear to me why answer contains HTML, when the program in question KeyRemap4MacBook is fully GUI as far as I can see. -- Could you please add some comments on this HTML is to be used in KeyRemap4MacBook? <comment150701> @zrajm It's XML that you're meant to add to `~/Library/Application Support/KeyRemap4MacBook/private.xml`. See the first link in the answer or http://osxnotes.net/keyremap4macbook.html. <comment150706> Ah. Great! (However, you should edit your answer to include that information, otherwise your answer will be useless when/if the link goes dead.) <comment237267> I wish I could upvote this answer 100 times. I've periodically looked for a solution to this issue for what must be around 8 years (!!) having been a long time lover of the marble mouse. After recently trying the Slimblade (and hating the feel, but loving the scroll) I renewed my hunt. This software is awesome full stop - but the perfect solution to this issue. Thank you! <comment237271> I think it's disgusting that to this day Logitech don't offer this most basic feature in their own software for Macs - it's almost rage inducing. I've been using the mouse for nearly 10 years and their software has been updated during this time and yet they seem to be systematically ignoring the troves of support requests about this issue. It's weird, frankly. Glad we have a solution at last, and one likely more flexible than Logitech would ever give us. <comment280441> @Nathan Hornby once you have more karma you can give it to the person who answered the question.
