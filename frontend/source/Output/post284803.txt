Update automatically my Iphone7 <body> Time ago, when Apple released a new iOS update for iPhone, I could put iPhone on charge, turn it off and the update start (and also finish) automatically. This feature was easy but it doesn't seem to work anymore with the newest iOS updates.Does someone know how to fix it?  <comment359225> The over-the-air software updates still could work without monitoring, at night. It notifies you of this before doing it, and you still have to confirm it. The device has to be connected to wifi and charging, and it also has to be "ON", of course.
