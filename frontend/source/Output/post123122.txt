Safari remember password of all sites after upgrading to 7.0.2 <body> I upgraded to codeMavericks 9.0.2/code the day it was released. I recently found that Safari now asks if I want it to remember passwords on all sites, including sites that I explicitly chose strongnot/strong to remember passwords, like banks. Is this the normal behavior of the updated Safari, or is something wrong with my Mac?  My Safari version is code7.0.2 (9537.74.9)/code  <answer123139> It sounds like it is a new version of Safari. If you don't like it, there is always Chrome!
