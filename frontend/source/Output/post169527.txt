iTunes disable command by trackpad <body> Since a few months, iTunes is listening to the track-pad fingers command codeprevious/code and codenext/code (3 fingers swipe) even if it's not the active application (ie: has focus).  This is emextremely/em annoying when browsing the web and listening to music. How can I disable this shortcut that I didn't set up ?  I've searched in the trackpad settings, the itTunes ones and the keyboard = shortcuts but didn't find the solution.

As OP showed on the screenshot - commands strongPrevious/strong and strongNext/strong assigned to gestures, refer to Track change in iTunes not going back/forth in browser history.  <comment199148> Do You have 3rd party app like **Better Touch Tool** or **Keyboard Maestro**? <comment199152> @MateuszSzlosek yes, see screenshot <comment199156> So this is the culprit. **Previous** and **Next** refer to track change not going back in browser history. <comment199157> @MateuszSzlosek you, Sir, deserve +25 rep. <comment199158> You made my day.
