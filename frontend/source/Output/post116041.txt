How to upgrade my MacBook Air from 10.6 to 10.9? <body> I was given a MacBook Air from my step mother because she never used it. I tried upgrading everything but every time I try to update it, it stays the same old version. Do i need to go to the store first?   It's still on OS X 10.6.8  <answer116050> It's been a long time since I was working on 10.6.8. To my knowledge the upgrade is easier than you think. I hope the following steps are accurate and give you the requested outcome, a working OS X Mavericks (10.9).  strong1. Click on the little Apple logo in the top left corner of your screen./strong  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6IOJM.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  strong2. A drop-down menu should appear looking like this (see below). Press codeSoftware Update.../code./strong  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/R5xUz.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  strong3. Then the following window should pop up (see below). Press codeShow Details/code./strong  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/y8YbW.png" alt="List item"  strong4. The window below should appear. In line 1 (codeMac OS X Update/code) you should see under version code10.9.1/code. (Ignore the other options for now). Make sure the blue box in front of codeMac OS X Update/code is ticked and all others un-ticked./strong  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kGe8A.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  strong5. Finally, there are 3 buttons at the bottom of this window looking like this.      Instead of 5 items (like in the image) it should say codeInstall 1 Item/code. Press this button and from there you should have clear guidance./strong  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QVYxe.png" alt="enter image description here"  Good Luck!!  <answer116051> ol liOpen the Mac App Store (/Applications/App Store.app)/li liDownload the OS X Mavericks app./li liRun it from the /Applications folder if it doesn't automatically run./li liFollow the instructions./li /ol  <comment135796> Hi - and welcome to Ask Different! As for your MacBook Air - you can upgrade to 10.9 using the following instructions from Apple (http://www.apple.com/osx/how-to-upgrade/). And, if you get stuck, don't hesitate to ask more questions here - or visit an Apple Store for help. That is what they do. <comment135797> We may need a little more information here in order to help - were you able to download the 10.9 (Mavericks) installer - and what happened when you tried to apply it? <comment135802> Major updates (10.x) are not distributed through Software Update. <comment135803> My bad, I forgot about that completely :/ Thanks for correcting me. I have up-voted yours so mine does not get in the way. I forgot there was an App Store for that long. <comment135818> Felix is correct that you need to install 10.6.8 before the App store will allow you to upgrade further. <comment135831> @bmike She mentions though at the end of her post that `It's still on OS X 10.6.8`. Thus, I guess my post is fairly useless.
