Can I force apple mail to display "Re:" again instead of the German (and bad) translation of "Aw:" <body> Since I upgraded to Mavericks, Apple Mail will display localized versions of subject prefixes, even if the original received mail used the English prefixes. I find that quite annoying, as this does not conform to standards and conflicts with other mail clients.  So in my German Mail.app, I get  precode"Aw:" instead of "Re:" "Wtr: instead of "Fwd:" /code/pre  Is there a possibility to get back the old behavior which uses the English prefixes?  <comment212843> Are you talking about mails you are receiving or mail you are sending? <comment213503> I'm talking about received mails. Even if other mail clients show these as "Subject: Re: balabal", apple mail displays "Subject: Aw:" <comment213512> Maybe other clients rewrite the subject line and OS X Mail.app doesn't. Can you have a look at the raw mail (Opt-Cmd-U) to see whether you receive them with Re or with Aw? <comment213862> @patrix: No, its definitely Mail.app. Mail headers show "Subject: =?utf-8?Q?Fwd: ...", but the display is "Wtr: ...". I also checked that with other mail clients connected to the same account. They still show the real subject <comment213863> Interesting, doesn't happen here (with Swiss/German settings). <comment213960> Upps, I have to retract that :-) Same thing happens here as well, I just never noticed. Oh well.
