Prevent Cmd+[ changing page in Chrome <body> I'm building a webapp editor and want to enable codeCmd+[/code/code]/code for indenting. However, Chrome (and perhaps other browsers) uses these to switch page forward/back.   I've seen lots of solutions based on editing the shortcuts in the OSX control panel, but I can't expect a new user to start editing those settings just to use my app.  Is there some way to prevent an event bubbling out of the browser codedocument/code - so that I get to use the keypress, but prevent it being used by Chrome - or is there a list of 'safe' keybindings that I could use instead?  <comment348668> Cmd [ or Cmd / ? Honestly, I'd avoid trying to break the regular usage, Cmd [ & ] are universal back/forwards right across Mac. Cmd / is show/hide status bar in many apps & the Finder too. <comment348669> hmm, I don't use shortcuts much but `Cmd [` unidents in Atom. How can I find safe alternatives? <comment348670> 'Terminal' type apps always seem to be a law unto themselves ;) Maybe use the approach that they have for markdown on SE, all the commands are Ctrl/hotkey rather than Cmd - http://apple.stackexchange.com/editing-help
