Speeding up and improving directory listing from windows Servers? <body> When I connect to windows servers (called PC-servers in OS X) getting the list of files in a directory is emreally/em slow (20-30s) in comparison to using a windows machine (&lt;1s). Sometimes the files in a directory even disappear for a while! The network is not slow - copying files goes at 1Mbyte/s.  What can I do to improve this?  <answer2331> If you are using the Finder then try with another file manager or try run a ls in the terminal. Let us know if you are experiencing the same kind of delays using the command line.  Some good alternative file manager are muCommander and Midnight Commander. Try both.  <answer2355> I was able to speed up the directory listing by mounting shares via the command line, like this:   precodemount -t smbfs //user@server/sharename share /code/pre  Where share is a directory in my home directory.   Somehow this is faster than mounting in the finder. Or is it ADmitMac slowing stuff down?  <comment2003> I can't install mc without root access, so I could only try muCommander. Directory listings are blazing fast indeed, but filetransfers are really slow now (136k/s vs 1Mb/s in finder....). <comment2006> ...and muCommander can only copy files, not open them for editing. Bummer.
