How can I see my purchased history of IOS apps that are not FREE? <body> All of us, these days downloaded ton of apps including myself. I bought a lot of iOS Applications in the last a couple years.  Some of them are free, and some of them are not.  I want to see the list of my purchased history - so I can re-download them back.   I found some article that help me see a list of ALL purchase apps, but I find that overwhelming. I just want to see the the one that are not FREE.  Example, 1$ and above.  I've tried look everywhere, I couldn't find anything so far on that.   Any direction on that will be much appreciated.
