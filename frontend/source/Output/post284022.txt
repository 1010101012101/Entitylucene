Create a cloud-based L2TP VPN server that connect to a PPTP server <body> Since iOS10, passthrough of PPTP has been blocked for hotspot connections, meaning that even if using third party clients (on your Mac), it is not possible to connect to any PPTP server using your hotspot connection.  I'd like to set up a server in the cloud (any cloud service), that allows my Mac to connect to it via L2TP (supported and allowed by the iOS 10 hotspot). At the same time I want that cloud server to connect to the Actual PPTP server, and link both networks so that my client has access to the PPTP server.  It sounds a bit complicated but I've read somewhere that is possible, although I can't find the source anymore. Does anyone have some details about how this can be achieved?
