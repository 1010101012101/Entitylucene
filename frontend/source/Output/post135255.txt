Can I install OS X onto a separate external drive partition? <body> There are plenty of articles explaining how to install OS X on a separate partition of your Mac’s eminternal/em drive and how to install it onto an external drive emusing a single partition/em. However, it’s not clear to me whether it’s possible to install OS X onto a separate partition emof an external drive/em. It’s what I’d like to do, is it possible?  For what it’s worth, my external drive currently has a single 500GB partition, is formatted as “Mac OS Extended (Journaled)” and has a GUID Partition Table. That should make it bootable, right?  <answer135256> h3Yes!/h3  As the disk is the correct format, it will show in the disk list in the installer (click Show All Disks). You can install any version of OS X on a partition of the correct format, regardless of where the partition is located.

Standard, 2.5inch external drives are painfully slow if you try to run it as a regular Mac. You won't have any "problems" other than poor performance. FireWire 800 is almost normal, an external Thunderbolt case will be just as fast as an internal drive.
