Which key is Num Lock on an Apple keyboard in Windows? <body> I have an extended keyboard as in the image below  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bzFKq.png" alt="enter image description here"  When connecting to a Windows machine, which key is Num Lock?  For future reference, the key on this UK keyboard does not say kbdClear/kbd, it has an image of a horizontal rectangle with an X through it kbd⌧/kbd but it is the same key and provides the same functionality in OS X.  <answer68725> Under Boot Camp, it's the kbdClear ⌧/kbd button, according to Apple's documentation.  That makes some sense, at least, because that key is where kbdNum Lock/kbd normally lives on other keyboards.  (Note: I don't have the same keyboard to test with, but I'm guessing this document isn't actually Boot Camp-specific; it's just a guide to how the keys are mapped under Windows.)  <answer71423> You can try the combination kbdShift/kbd + kbdClear ⌧/kbd.  <answer228023> You can take the following steps:  ol liclick a SYSTEM PREFERENCES  /li liclick a accessibility  /li liclick a mouse &amp; trackpad  /li liclick a enable mouse keys/li /ol  <answer265742> left shift + key over number 7  that works for me  <comment277949> In what way does this answer the question? <comment333193> That's the Clear key, as already answered. <comment344008> What if you don't have the `clear` button?
