How do I disable requirement to enter password after I close and reopen the lid? <body> I don't like having to re-enter my password if I've just closed the lid for only 5 - 10 minutes.  How can I disable this?  I've already tried going to System Preferences -- Security &amp; Privacy, and setting it to require a password only 1 hour after sleep or screensaver.  Mid-2014 Macbook Pro running Mavericks v10.9.4  <answer145910> As I recall, "lid closed" is an entirely different event than "sleep or screen saver" and you cannot disable asking for a password when the laptop is opened. There is a brief timeout where you can reopen the lid, in some cases, but it's only a few seconds.  <comment171923> Would you please edit your question to include the specify laptop model and the version of Mac OS X which is currently loaded? This will enable responders to give you a more concise and meaningful answer. <comment171929> Done - thanks!! <comment234643> So System Preferences  Users & Groups  Login options  Automatic Login is active?
