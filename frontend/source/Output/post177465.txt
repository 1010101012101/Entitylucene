Mac Mail - Mountain Lion - How does one remove the name from the sender heading? <body> Instead of From: listing { "Name"  }  and showing up on recipients email as such,   I would like to only have the email address shoe up so the above would be  -  { ,xxx@yyyy.zz }.  I have three domains I send and receive from I would like to keep one of them private, without my name showing.  Thanks iciarch  <answer177466> Mail (menu)  Preferences...  Accounts  select the target account and under Account Information in the Full Name: field put the email address not the full name.
