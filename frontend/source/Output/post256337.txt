Does macOS Sierra support multiple users simultaneously connecting to the same machine using screensharing? <body> Apparently this was possible with Yosemite, but I've never actually seen it in action, and I don't know if it has gone the way of Target Display and other cool features they've thrown away.  <answer256349> macOS Sierra still supports multiple simultaneous connected users. In the example below Sierra is running in a VM and emadmin/em is logged in. emuser/em is a remote screen sharing session from the VM host machine (10.9.5) – an iMac – and emroot/em is a remote session from a MacBook Pro (10.11.6):  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/m7EDE.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer283399> The feature still exists, yes. With some experimentation, I managed to understand the trick in knowing strongemhow/em/strong to invoke that system.  My goals were to get a "not mirrored" remote desktop session going, in case I ever needed to work remotely for any reason.  TL;DR - First "screen sharing" session is always mirrored; subsequent sessions will prompt   Here are the steps to reproduce (though, not quite 100%, I noticed; unsure why):  ol liThe "Server" needs at least 2 users who are able to use Screen Sharing./li liHave your "Client" launch screen sharing with the "Dummy" user.  ul liFinder - "Go" menu - Connect to server (Command+K)/li liEnter the credentials for codedummy/code/li liThis is the "first screen sharing" session, and will mirror the displays./li /ul/li liHave your "Client" establish a second connection the server using your "Main" user.  ul liScreen Sharing (application's name) Menu - Connection - New.../li liEnter the credentials for codemain_user/code/li liDialog box should prompt "Dummy is already logged in. Ask for permission to share the screen, or login as [main_user]?"/li liChoose the "login as [main_user]" option./li liThis creates a "secondary screen sharing" session which will NOT be mirrored; it will be a virtual session./li /ul/li liClose the "Dummy" Screen Sharing window./li liClose the "Main" Screen Sharing window./li liHave your "Client" launch screen sharing with the "Main" user.  ul liSomehow, codedummy/code will still have a session running and the system will once again prompt the "ask permission? or just log in as yourself?" questions./li /ul/li /ol  <comment319716> Did I miss something? Last I checked, Target Display Mode still worked on Sierra. :-/ <comment320275> Yes, but they removed it from new hardware.  The last (few?) release(s) of the iMac no longer offer that feature, even though it's a great idea, and something I've ***always*** wanted. <comment320359> The Retina iMacs indeed don't have it (regardless of OS). I miss it too. <comment369837> Is is possible to open 2 screen sharing connections from a same "Client" to the same "Server"?  When I tried `Menu - Connection - New...` it just jumps to the currently opened screen. <comment369891> Yeah. It should be possible! That's the whole point of doing "New..." (step 3). <comment370013> @starloke not for me. Have you tried it? OSX Sierra on both client and server.
