How can I hide incomplete albums in my iTunes/iPhone? <body> I have lots of single songs from albums in my iTunes library. I also have several albums. On my phone, when I look at the "Albums" view, I'm looking for an album to play. What I see are a whole lot of albums I don't actually haveâ€”most of them only contain a single song.  Is there a way to get those albums to disappear from the album view?  I had hoped I could set the "Sort Album" for those tracks and get them to appear as a single album called "Singles" to get them out of the way, but that didn't work. I could set the actual album name to "Singles", but I'd rather not lose the actual album names.
