Finder freezes when showing images quicklook preview <body> On OS X Yosemite 10.10.5 (14F27), when I want to see the preview of an image (JPG or PNG, but I suppose it will be the same with other formats) the wait spinner appears and the Finder becomes freezed, I have to relaunch it via "Force Quit Applications".  I already tried these things:  ol liDelete all the codeplist/code related with Finder and Quicklook I've found inside code~/Library/Preferences/code./li liOn terminal codeqlmanage -r/code and codeqlmanage -r cache/code, but in both cases I had to ^C to abort because after half an hour nothing happened./li liHard disk permissions repair./li liA general clean using CleanMyMac 3./li /ol  I don't know what more could I do besides reinstalling :( Do you know what could be the problem?  Thank you so much.  strongUPDATE/strong  I tried the @Tetsujin solution but stills the same. Anyway, I'm seeing this in the system console.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/iQgGa.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer204757> I would remove all your Quicklook plugins, then return them half at a time to eliminate the culprit.  They can be in 3 different places, code/Library/Quicklook//code code/System/Library/Quicklook//code &amp; code~/Library/Quicklook//code  The fastest way to eliminate is by halves.br Remove half [remember where they came from]br Test.br If fixed, remove that [clean] half &amp; replace with emhalf/em of the rest [the currently suspected 'dirty' half].br If not fixed, remove half of your half - to new folders.br This way you  always know which is your 'clean' &amp; 'dirty' half each time. Test.br Repeat until you have found the culprit.  If the culprit is an Apple plugin, trash it &amp; re-apply the current combo updater for your OS - 10.10.5 at https://support.apple.com/kb/DL1832?  <comment246934> Thanks Tetsujin but nothing happened. I've updated the question with a screenshot from the Console. <comment246937> Did you reapply the combo update? If so, check perms on your /private/tmp directory - instrs for [show invisible files](http://osxdaily.com/2009/02/25/show-hidden-files-in-os-x/) - should be system/wheel/everyone, all read/write  ...& a late thought - did you reboot between tests? <comment246948> I just installed it and it stills the same :( The perms in private/tmp are all read/write, and I restart between tests. I think I have to reinstall the entire system :(
