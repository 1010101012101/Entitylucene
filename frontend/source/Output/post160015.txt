How to stop Finder crashing in Yosemite? <body> As with a lot of posts my Finder constantly crashes.  ul liI've de-coupled Dropbox and Google Drive./li liI've deleted Finder preferences and it's still the same./li /ul  Here's a screenshot of Diagnostics filtered codeFinder/code, I can see there's a problem, just not sure how to fix it.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/EVY58.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment188107> That HideFinder thing looks suspicious, like it's designed to communicate with Finder but is not compatible with Yosemite. Just a guess. <comment188118> Others have had trouble with xpc.launchd. It's Spotlight related:  https://discussions.apple.com/thread/6615545 <comment188234> Looks like this has already been answered here, at http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/151791/yosemite-com-apple-xpc-launchd-error-every-10-seconds. <comment188296> Thanks all, it seems to have resolved itself?
