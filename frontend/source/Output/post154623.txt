MacBook Air on Yosemite no sound device <body> I just upgraded my 2010 MacBook Air to Yosemite.  It froze during installation, I shut it down and when I restarted it booted normally to Yosemite.  Now everything seems to be working ok, but I have no sound. My case is not like most cases where it defaults to an external device. I have nothing attached, no monitors, no external speakers.  When I check system preferences/sound, I get no output devices found.   Here's what I've tried: - rebooting - reset NVRAM - reinstalling yosemite (same freezing problem - waited for 4 hours) - remove plist files from Library/preferences/audio and restarting  Any suggestions?  Thanks  <answer178435> Reset the SMC:  1) Power down the systembr 2) Unplug all cables except Magsafebr 3) Hold down left Shift + Control + Option + Power button for ~5 secondsbr 4) Boot machine upbr  This usually solves issues when certain hardware devices on the device itself aren't responding, especially when multiple do not work.  <comment211321> Hey im having the same issue right now. no red light no input/output and even the usb access on the same side doesn't work! May I ask if you have solved this issue yet?
