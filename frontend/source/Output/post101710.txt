DNS resolution temporarily failing <body> Macbook air mid-2012 w/ Mountain Lion.  Whenever I wakeup from a long sleep and also on some random moments when it's on, i get DNS resolution failures for every server, with nslookup saying code;; connection timed out; no servers could be reached/code; however, direct connections to IP addresses work correctly, since (among others) Skype works perfectly.  This resolves by itself after more or less 5 minutes, when DNS resolution gets back to work correctly, both with nslookup and in other applications (browser etc.).  I have Google's DNS servers (8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4) configured both on my network preferences and on my wireless router's settings.  Possibly related but still unsolved: DNS gone after wakeup  Any ideas?  <comment119851> Did you try monitoring the DNS in your Console? <comment120303> It may also be worth noting that EVERY device on my home network (Android phones, pcs and PS3) seems to be failing DNS lookups when these temporary failures occur.
