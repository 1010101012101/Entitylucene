Can I change the style of the 'Open' dialog for any application? <body> I use an application, HL7 Inspector, and it uses a rather limited Open file dialog. Can I force this application to use the more standard OS X Finder/Open dialog?  The application itself does not expose a preference to change this. Is it handled by the application or is it configurable externally?  Screenshot of HL7 Inspectors Open Dialog
