generic approach to finding the correct name to run an app from the command line <body> Whenever I am not in a browser or in my text editor, most of my time on my mac is spent on the terminal.  What's a quick, generic way to figure out how to run a gui program from the bash shell?  It seems like we always need to run around and find out that program xyz can be called as 'abc'.  For example, Sublime Text's is 'subl', Kaleidoscope is 'ksdiff'.  Great, but you need to look these up for each and every program.  And there are lots of identical questions, about Finder for example.  What is the best Mac approach to figuring out the command line "alias" for an any app?  Can I make use of the Activity Monitor if the program is open? Do I have to go nose around in the Applications folder?  If so, how can I tell the "command line alias file" from the others?  Or can I use strong"ps aux"/strong in bash?  For example, on Linux or on Windows, "foo.exe" in the list of processes means that you could just type "foo.exe" to launch that program.  But Sublime shows up as Sublime Text, not 'subl', so don't think that would work.  <answer182118> Bot Sublime Text and Kaleidoscope are special cases as they install either a helper utility or themselves somewhere in your code$PATH/code.  The easiest way to open any application from code/Applications/code is to run  precodeopen -a APPNAME /code/pre  in Terminal, e.g.  precodeopen -a Pages       # opens Pages open -a "App Store" # opens the App Store /code/pre  <answer205419> Just to elaborate on the answer by patrix.  Specifically on how to figure out what to put in the -a flag.  If I use strongps aux/strong on the command line, it will tell me which appname to use.  precodeaudrey:tests jluc$ ps aux | grep Sub jluc            30721   0.0  5.0  3746992 418976   ??

That's what you want.  creating a file and opening it (made sure it was an unknown extension rather than having it pick up Sublime by association.  precodeaudrey:tests jluc$ echo bzp &gt; test.bzp audrey:tests jluc$ open -a "Sublime Text 2" test.bzp /code/pre  That works.  Finally, if you find you are often using that app from the command line, you can alias it.  precodealias open_sublime='open -a "Sublime Text 2"' /code/pre  This is one for Affinity Designer  precodeps aux | grep Aff /code/pre  results  precodejluc            56148   1.2  1.7  4206616 139500   ??

I knew about **open**, but didn't realize you could use **-a** to launch apps with it or specify another program than the default to open the file.  Thanks.
