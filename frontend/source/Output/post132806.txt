Stuck in soft dfu mode <body> My iPod(4g iOS 6.1.6) is stuck in soft DFU mode because I quit out of redsn0w to early. Then I also used an app to exit recovery mode and now it's in soft DFU mode. I had to use the DFU IPSW in order to put my device in DFU mode in the first place.   When I attempt to restore it in iTunes, after the "extracting software" step, it says "preparing ipod for restore". After the 1-2 minutes pass the boot logo does not show up it says "The iPod (iPod) could not be restored. An unknown error occurred (1601).  I'm just going to try and let my iPod die and then reboot it. Any alternate suggestions to regain control of the device?  <answer132962> I found this on apple support communities     Connect the device to iTunes, confirm that the device is in Recovery Mode. If it's not in Recovery Mode, put it into Recovery Mode.   Restore and wait for the error.   When prompted, click OK.   Close and reopen iTunes while the device remains connected.   The device should now be recognized in Recovery Mode again.   Try to restore again.

After about 1 minute it says error 1600 I believe. <comment157272> Definitely run the restore and post the exact error message or a snippet from the restore log. It could be something you can fix sooner than waiting several days (or however long the battery lasts in that state). <comment157276> After extracting software, it says "preparing ipod for restore".
