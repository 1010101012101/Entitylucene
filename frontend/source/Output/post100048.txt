This could indicate a hardware fault.  If after rebooting your Mac there are still no output devices listed in codeSystem Preferences &gt; Sound/code try running a system report.   You can access this by choosing codeAbout this Mac/code from the Apple () Menu and then pressing the codeSystem Report.../code button.  On the left of the System Report window there should be a section for codeAudio/code.  If you select that you will get a list of Audio devices.  If that is empty you most probably have a hardware fault and need to take your Mac to an Apple Store for repair.  <answer191766> You may try resetting your SMC and NVRAM, which controls power for various components as well as retains settings for a few pieces of hardware.  To reset the SMC on your Mac Mini:  ol liShut down your system and unplug all cables (including power cable)/li liWait 15 seconds at least/li liPlug power and other cables back in/li liBoot machine/li /ol  To reset the NVRAM:  ol liShut down your Mac./li liLocate the following keys on the keyboard: Command (⌘), Option, P, and R./li liTurn on your Mac./li liPress and hold the Command-Option-P-R keys immediately after you hear the startup sound./li liHold these keys until the computer restarts and you hear the startup sound for a second time./li liRelease the keys./li /ol  Aside from that, running an Apple Hardware Test by holding D on boot, then running through the prompts to validate if an issue has been found with the actual hardware for the sound.  <answer193691> Problem was solved automatically when i updated with latest version of OS.  Thanks for your valuable answers and response. Than  <comment117741> When you click on the Output tab - what is selected? Have you gently inserted a headphone into the speaker port on the back and then removed it? Sometimes the hardware thinks a plug is connected and the software agrees to not play sounds when the hardware thinks external speakers are connected. <comment117759> I have the same problem with an old mini: headphones work fine but internal speakers don't appear in the sound preference panel. <comment117765> @Rajneesh071 Do you mean "Last night it was working fine...." ? <comment117796> Possible duplicate: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/18950/cant-un-mute-sound-when-mini-jack-unplugged and http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/75477/auto-mute-macbook-on-headphone-removal <comment117836> @GuillaumeAlgis its not solving my problem.. <comment118086> check my answer..screenshot of list of Audio devices uder System Report, there is nothing under device.. :(
