How do I move widgets on the Dashboard that are out of the viewing area? <body> I have a couple of widgets in Dashboard that moved outside of the viewing area. I can only see them in Mission Control.    img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/e7wAh.jpg" alt="Dashboard widgets outside of the viewing area"  How do I move them back?  <answer41000> Just try to remove them (Manage widgets...) and than add again to dashboard.  <comment46548> Yup. That worked for me. Thanks!
