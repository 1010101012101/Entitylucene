Non-debug qlmanage <body> I've got a codebash/code alias set up in my terminal, codealias quicklook='qlmanage -p '/code, in order to easily quicklook files from the terminal, but the output bugs me.  codeTesting Quick Look preview with files:     /Users/Amory/Desktop/todo.txt 2015-09-01 14:36:40.257 qlmanage[36196:507] *** CFMessagePort: bootstrap_register(): failed 1100 (0x44c) 'Permission denied', port = 0x3e2f, name = 'com.apple.tsm.portname' See /usr/include/servers/bootstrap_defs.h for the error codes. 2015-09-01 14:36:40.258 qlmanage[36196:507] *** CFMessagePort: bootstrap_register(): failed 1100 (0x44c) 'Permission denied', port = 0x9137, name = 'com.apple.CFPasteboardClient' See /usr/include/servers/bootstrap_defs.h for the error codes. 2015-09-01 14:36:40.269 qlmanage[36196:507] Failed to allocate communication port for com.apple.CFPasteboardClient; this is likely due to sandbox restrictions /code  Moreover, compared to invocation via the spacebar, the preview has a big "DEBUG" in the title bar and is just generally not the same.  Why is this?  Is there a way around the debug mode from the terminal?  The code-d/code options only make it worse.  <answer231951> Send the debug output to /dev/null  precodealias quicklook='qlmanage -p "$@" &gt;&amp; /dev/null' /code/pre  No clue on how to remove the [DEBUG] from the window title  <comment283382> Fair enough!  I went with `2 /dev/null` to keep the moderately helpful first line.
