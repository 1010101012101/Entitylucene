How to type ` on Mac keyboard? <body> I searched my US American MacBook keyboard and I did not find symbol of "`" (grave accent). Did I miss it?  <answer124178> On the US keyboard it is in the top left corner to the left of the 1.  You'll see it just under the tilde sign (~) in the top left of the keyboard.   <comment145122> What country keyboard are you using?  On the US keyboard it is in the top left corner to the left of the 1. <comment145123> @AlanShutko Damn my eyes..thanks a lot.
