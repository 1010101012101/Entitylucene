MacPorts: Continue installing other updates after error <body> Say I have the following outdated packages:  ul lifoo/li libar/li libaz/li /ul  I want to update as many as them as possible, so I try to run:  precodesudo port -n -f upgrade outdated /code/pre  However this fails with:  precodeError: org.macports.build for port foo returned: command execution failed Please see the log file for port foo for details: ... /code/pre  How can I make macports try to upgrade bar and baz, if foo fails?  I would like to generally make macports try to install/upgrade other ports if installing/upgrading some of them fails and just continue.  hr  From the man page:   precode -f       force mode (ignore state file) /code/pre     precode -n       don't upgrade dependencies (affects upgrade and install) /code/pre  hr  strongEdit:/strong foo, bar &amp; baz, are 3 total unrelated ports, that doesn't depend on each other in any way.  hr  strongEdit 2:/strong Next time I run this the outdated ports might be a, b &amp; c, instead of foo, bar &amp; baz, so I can't hardcode the failing ones and I can't just do:  precodesudo port update foo sudo port update bar sudo port update baz /code/pre  <answer65373> Considering an old closed ticket, a defect that was fixed:   333 (dependancy failure are ignored and port continues to try and install) – MacPorts  If I understand correctly: to continue following a failure may, in some cases, be defective.   In other words:   ul liit's proper (least risky) to strongnot/strong continue. /li /ul  hr  Postscript: I was too lazy to read the man page in its entirety (not found by the Help menu of Terminal, but that's no excuse). Following advice from someone in codeirc://irc.freenode.net/#macports/code I decided to leave this answer.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WKaYB.png" alt="enter image description here"  I never realised the code-p/code option. Thanks to Tyilo.  <answer65447> The code-p/code seems to work for me.  From the manpage:  pre -p       Despite any errors encountered, proceed to process multiple          ports and commands. /pre  <answer66492> MacPorts dev here; the correct answer to your question is: you don't.  There is a reason why MacPorts doesn't attempt to install a package when a dependency fails to build.  This exact question has been discussed on the macports-users mailing list not so long ago:  ul li“How to proceed past errors?”br http://lists.macosforge.org/pipermail/macports-users/2012-July/029904.html/li liand its follow-up thread “-p considered problematic”br http://lists.macosforge.org/pipermail/macports-users/2012-July/029984.html/li /ul  <answer66527> You can also specify "outdated and not foo" in the upgrade command, rather than just "outdated".  <comment78229> foo, bar & baz, are 3 total unrelated ports, that doesn't depend on each other in any way. <comment78279> In that case you can always update them manually, i.e. sudo port upgrade baz, sudo port upgrade bar, sudo port upgrade foo. <comment78309> see "edit 2" in question. <comment78310> see "edit 2" in question. <comment311812> This should be the correct answer, if a MacPorts dev is speak to it.
