How can I kill a non-responding app? <body> What are all the ways to kill a buggy GUI app?     I can't right-click on its icon in the whatever-its-called bar, or use the top-of-window menu.  The app does not respond to anything, and does nothing but eat more and more memory as times goes on.  In Linux, there's codexkill/code.  Is there something similar on OSX?     <answer22182> You can access the Force Quit dialog box by pressing kbd&#x2318;/kbd+kbd&#x2325;/kbd+kbdesc/kbd, or using the Apple Menu (top left corner of the screen) and choosing codeForce Quit.../code. Select the problem app, and click the Force Quit button.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8S38y.png" alt="enter image description here"  You can also kill an app using the command line (/Applications/Utilities/Terminal):  precodekillall 'Google Chrome' /code/pre  You can also use the Activity Monitor app (/Applications/Utilities). Select an app and click the Quit button: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/JAnLN.png" alt="enter image description here" Then, from the dialog that slides down, click codeForce Quit/code.  <answer22183> All the ways?  There's always another way   :-)  Sometimes kbd&#x2318;/kbd+kbd&#x21E5;/kbd will get focus away from the app so you can talk to the Dock or Finder.  kbd&#x2318;/kbd+kbd&#x2325;/kbd+kbdesc/kbd should bring up the Force Quit dialog box.  If you have/can get to a Terminal window, there's the kill command.  If you have another machine and have enabled remote login, you can ssh in to your machine and issue a kill even if the GUI won't respond at all (and if kill doesn't work there's always codesudo reboot/code as a last resort).  <answer22184> kbd⌘/kbd+kbd⌥/kbd+kbdesc/kbd  <answer22185> The "kill" command also exists in OS X (check out "man kill"); you can also kill an app using a couple of GUI-based tools:  ol lipress kbd&#x2318;/kbd+kbd&#x2325;/kbd+kbdesc/kbd. That brings up a "force quit" menu/li lilaunch the Activity Monitor application. You can also force-quit an app from there./li /ol  <answer22309> You also have the option of kbd⌥/kbd-right-clicking the icon in the dock, which (after a few seconds, likely) will pop up and have a 'Force Quit' option, which you can use to kill an app.  <answer214490> Another way from the codeTerminal/code:  precodeps auxww | grep -i 'google chrome' | grep -v grep | awk '{ print $2 }' | xargs kill /code/pre  Or to force kill:  precodeps auxww | grep -i 'google chrome' | grep -v grep | awk '{ print $2 }' | xargs kill -9  /code/pre  This can be helpful if the screen isn't responding or you get Spinning Wheel of Death, but are able to somehow get to the terminal (e.g.: via SSH)  <comment24551> Very comprehensive :) <comment24772> Holding ⌥⇧⌘⎋ for a few seconds also quits the frontmost application. <comment24774> @Lri Hey, I didn't now abou that one! Cool! <comment24776> @Lri Very cool! I will have to keep that one in mind. <comment149028> The salient feature of `xkill` is that it will kill the owner of a window in X. I do wish there were such an interface in OS X.
