Buy OS X Lion on AppStore but install from previous download with other Apple ID <body> I have OS X installed at home and I am therefore able to re-download it from the app store and to copy the installer on an USB drive.  My parents have a very bad internet connection and I would like to use my installer to install Lion at their home.  Is it possible and if yes how could I buy Lion with their Apple ID but install it from my installer?  Last question, I have an iMac 27 and my parents an iMac 21 both from the same generation, is the installer specific for a given machine or not?  strongEDIT:/strong I do not want to reinstall my parents iMac, just to upgrade it to Mountain Lion...  <comment99174> If you create a bootable USB/disk for Lion OS X you can install it without problems, even with your version. You don't actually have to buy a new one. <comment99179> @Robuust thanks for your answer, I would like to update my parents iMac, not to reinstall everything... Still OK with a bootable USB ? <comment99181> That's what I did, so it should work for you too :) <comment99233> You don't necessarily need to create a bootable USB installer either. You can simply copy the "Install OS X Mountain Lion" file you downloaded from your machine to theirs and double-click to run. It may ask you to authenticate with an Apple ID to verify eligibility, so as long as you use an Apple ID that has purchased ML you will be fine.
