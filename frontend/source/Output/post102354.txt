My mic is not working on Skype (iOS) <body> This morning I update my iPad 2 to iOS 7 and when I went to do a call on Skype, they are not hearing me. Is there something wrong with the settings or is it something else?  <answer102833> I have a similar problem.  It is not only on Skype, any app requiring microphone access, even if granted, does not work on my iPad 2 after installing iOS 7.  Uninstalling Skype did not help either.  You might want to check other apps that use Microphone input to make sure it's not just a Skype issue. It could be hardware failure or an OS issue.  <answer103019> Ensure codeSettings &gt; Privacy &gt; Microphone &gt; Skype/code is turned on.  <answer103069> If you accidentially disallowed Skype app accessing your microphone on iOS7 you can change the setting via: codeSettings -&gt; Privacy -&gt; Microphone -&gt; Skype/code  <comment120540> Check your settings, you now need to provide permission for an app to use your microphone. Settings  Privacy  Microphone.  You may need to reinstall Skype to force it to make the request. Guesswork, btw, hence not an answer. <comment120544> Does your microphone shows up in Skype settings? <comment121341> Next time, if you use bit more words to make your answer, we would reward you :)
