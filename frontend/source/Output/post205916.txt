How to edit hosts with TextEdit on Yosemite? <body> This line used to work codesudo -b "/Applications/Textedit.app/Contents/MacOS/TextEdit" /etc/hosts/code  But on Yosemite, it does not work anymore.  <answer205937> Yes I just tried your command and it exists with error code 132 (I don't know why).   You can still use this to open your hosts file codesudo open -t /etc/hosts/code. It will open the TextEdit app, if you want to run it in the background you can add your code-b/code in the command line.  Or you can use other text editors like vim and nano they're both working perfectly with Yosemite.  <comment248283> This should work: "open -a TextEdit /etc/hosts" <comment248286> What exactly "doesn't work"' any longer? Any error messages? <comment248338> @IronCraftMan it does not work: when trying to save I have a error message : "You do not have the permissions... to edit hosts" <comment248339> @patrix Nothing happens! <comment248341> When trying to save I have a error message : "You do not have the permissions... to edit hosts" <comment248412> you need to duplicate the file before editing it with TextEdit and then copy it back <comment248473> I think on OS 10.9, it used to work without copying the file. I was looking forward to the same behavior.
