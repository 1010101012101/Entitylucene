Snow Leopard installer ISO on USB flash drive <body> I have the setup ISO file for my Mac OS X Snow Leopard. I need to be able to boot this and install it to a USB drive (from a windows pc by booting the USB drive).  I can't run it in a virtual environment and I can't burn it to a DVD (it doesn't work for some reason. It only makes a ~120KB of data on the DVD).  So, I need to make a bootable USB installer from the Snow Leopard ISO so I can boot that and install it to another USB/hard drive (this has to be done from a windows machine).  I have tried Multiboot ISO but it requires the USB to be formatted as FAT32 and as the ISO is over 4GB, this won't work.  How can I create the bootable installer?  <answer104377> you can try with transmac to do this  <comment117554> Just to be sure that we get it right: You want to create a bootable USB stick installer for OS X SL using a Windows machine? <comment117615> That is correct. And I have the ISO for SL.
