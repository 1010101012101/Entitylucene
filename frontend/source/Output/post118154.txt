Can I specify the file name of an iOS Safari image upload? <body> Safari on iOS allows to upload images to websites. However, the file always seems to be named image.jpg. This can be a problem, if the targeted website does not allow renaming uploaded files. Is it possible to make Safari let me choose a name or automatically use some unique name?  <answer118158> No, you can't do this unless the website allows it. The uploaded file will use the name of the file that you uploaded, and on iOS this is always codeimage.jpg/code.  You can provide feedback to Apple regarding this at the following page:  ul lihttp://www.apple.com/feedback/safari.html/li /ul  <comment325105> I noticed this issue is fixed in iOS10 Safari, which is good.
