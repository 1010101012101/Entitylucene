File Sharing Read & Write issue <body> I just ran into this odd behavior today while transferring files via the file sharing feature in Mac OS X.  What happened was most of the files I transferred changed the Read &amp; Write permissions to Read only. These were mainly .css and .html files.   Any one had this before or know whats going on here?   Thanks!  <comment111940> I assume the receiving site did that ? Do you have admin access to it ? <comment111982> Which file sharing protocol are you using, AFP or SMB/CIFS? Did you have to type a password to transfer the files? Is your Mac on the sending or receiving end? Which OS is running the other computer?
