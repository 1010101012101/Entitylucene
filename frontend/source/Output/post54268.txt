Show photo dates when reviewing faces <body> strongIs it possible to see the date of a photo when I'm confirming additional faces in iPhoto?/strong  It's nearly impossible for me to tell my kids apart in some of their photos, but since they were born three years apart, if I could see the date a photo was taken it would make things much easier.  <comment72978> same thing for my two kids... but they're twins so the date won't help !
