Formatting and reinstalling macOS <body> I have a 17" MacBook Pro. I had Mavericks installed on it and I am trying to format it in order to install a fresh copy of the OS.  Here are the things I've done and the results:  ol liI erased Macintosh HD in Recovery Mode by using kbdCommand/kbd+kbdR/kbd in the boot stage. That worked./li liI pressed on Reinstall OS in the OS X Utilities window in Recovery Mode, everything went smooth until it reached the Mavericks installation process. It got stuck and I had to turn it off because it stayed at "6 minutes remaining" for like 2 hours./li liI read in many places that I needed to use the Internet Recovery option. So I booted using kbdCommand/kbd+kbdOption/kbd+kbdR/kbd. It takes me to the Wi-Fi selection and after several hours, it took me to the macOS Sierra page which failed and gave me an error (no Mavericks OS was found anymore)./li liThen I read that it might be caused because of an unstable Internet connection. I tried my home Wi-Fi, I tried my phone's 3G hotspot, both options gave me a 3001f error. /li liI tried a wired network and it instantly gave me 1006f error./li /ol  Step 4 and 5 were both initialized with kbdCommand/kbd+kbdOption/kbd+kbdR/kbd.  Right now, I am downloading macOS Sierra from the App Store from another Mac and will try to boot it from a USB in order to install it. I am not sure if that will work. Let me know if it is a waste of time or it will work!  <answer267008> How to make a bootable usb with the Sierra installer from the App Store.
