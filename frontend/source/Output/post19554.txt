VMware Fusion 2.x not running with 64 Bit Kernel Lion <body> has anyone managed to run fusion 2.x under Mac OS Lion? Since the update it says   strongIncompatibility with 64 bit kernel/strong  This release of VMware Fusion does not work with 64-bit kernel of Mac OS X, you are currently running. To use VMware Fusion, you must restart your computer using the 32-bit kernel of Mac OS X again.  Any ideas :( ?  <answer19564> Upgrade to VMWare Fusion 3.1 which is compatible with Lion, with limited support from VMWare.  VMWare's knowledge base says     VMware Fusion 3.1.3 was designed for OS X 10.5 (Leopard) and OS X 10.6   (Snow Leopard). It is compatible with Mac OS X 10.7 (Lion), with the   limitations listed below.      If you are running an older version of VMware Fusion, upgrade to   VMware Fusion 3.1.3 before upgrading to Lion. Fusion 2.x is   incompatible with Lion.   <answer19565> VMware have said that Fusion 2.0 is incompatible with Lion.  http://kb.vmware.com/selfservice/microsites/search.do?language=en_US&amp;cmd=displayKC&amp;externalId=2003715  Version 3 on the other hand, does offer Lion support.  Note also that the latest version of freeware Virtual Box is also Lion compatible.  <comment21481> I would assume if you upgrade the OS all programs will fail unless you read otherwise. (You don't have to upgrade the OS) <comment21511> Why should they fail? Just look at the windows world, do you know lots of programs that ran under Vista and will not run in Windows7? <comment21520> Because OSs change the APIs that are called and how things work - After each upgrade there are always bugs - maybe not many but some and Sod's Law dictates one bug will be for a program you use. <comment22567> Thanks for the link :-) … a highlight from the 22nd July 2011 edition, emphasis added by me: "VMware can provide **best effort** support if you choose to upgrade to Lion, but we **cannot guarantee a resolution** for all issues." — based on that line from VMWare you might edit your answer to clarify that VMWare support for virtualisation of Lion is currently limited.
