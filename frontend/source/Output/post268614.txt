Is this a normal fan speed and CPU temperature for an idle MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2015) <body> Is this a normal fan speed and CPU temperature for an idle MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2015). The fact that fan 2 is not spinning worries me. I can get 'loaded' fan speeds and temps if that would be helpful.  strong--- CPU Stats ---/strong  CPU temp: 52.38°C  .  strong--- Main Fan Stats ---/strong  Total fans in system: 2  Fan 0 speed: 2154.0 RPM  Fan 1 speed: strong0.0 RPM/strong  .  strong--- Other Temp Stats ---/strong  ul liTaSP Unknown  30.0°C  /li liTa0P Unknown  30.13°C  /li liTh1H NB/CPU/GPU HeatPipe 1 Proximity  37.5°C  /li liTh2H Unknown  38.13°C  /li liTs0P Palm rest L  26.0°C  /li liTs0S Memory Bank Proximity  32.5°C  /li liTs1P Unknown  24.63°C  /li liTs1S Unknown  32.78°C  /li liTBXT Unknown  27.19°C  /li liTB0T Battery TS_MAX  27.19°C  /li liTB1T Battery 1  27.19°C  /li liTB2T Battery 2  27.19°C  /li listrongTCGC PECI GPU  56.0°C/strong  /li listrongTCSA PECI SA  61.0°C/strong  /li listrongTCTD Unknown  -0.42°C/strong  /li listrongTCXC PECI CPU  68.06°C/strong  /li listrongTCXP Unknown  68.06°C/strong  /li listrongTC0E CPU 0 ??  66.97°C/strong  /li listrongTC0F CPU 0 ??  68.75°C/strong  /li listrongTC0P CPU 0 Proximity  47.0°C/strong  /li listrongTC1f Unknown  70.72°C/strong  /li listrongTC1C Core 1  67.0°C/strong  /li listrongTC1F Unknown  70.72°C/strong  /li listrongTC2C Core 2  62.0°C/strong  /li listrongTC3C Core 3  62.0°C/strong  /li listrongTC4C Core 4  58.0°C/strong /li liTG0D GPU 0 Die  35.0°C  /li liTG0F Unknown  35.0°C  /li listrongTG0P GPU 0 Proximity  45.0°C/strong  /li listrongTG1D GPU 1 Die  -127.0°C/strong /li liTH0a Unknown  32.25°C  /li liTH0b Unknown  31.25°C  /li liTH0c Unknown  30.25°C  /li listrongTH0x Unknown  -127.0°C/strong  /li liTH0A Unknown  32.25°C  /li liTH0B Unknown  31.25°C  /li liTH0C Unknown  30.25°C  /li listrongTH0F Unknown  -53.75°C/strong  /li listrongTH0R Unknown  -53.75°C/strong/li liTH0V Unknown  31.08°C  /li listrongTM0P Memory Slot Proximity  40.25°C/strong  /li liTM0S Memory Slot 1  37.64°C  /li listrongTPCD Platform Controller Hub Die  44.0°C/strong  /li listrongTP0P Unknown  40.13°C/strong/li liTW0P AirPort Proximity  36.31°C  /li /ul  hr  h3UPDATE/h3  I sent the mac off to be fixed and it turned out to be something stuck in the right fan causing it to not move! Looking at my fan speeds now: left: 3000rpm right: 2800rpm (seems consistently slower so maybe slightly damaged :L)  CPU temp is now idle at: 48°C ish  Long story short if one of your fan's is around zero then its got stuck or has broken!  <answer268620> Macbook pro shut off temp is around 105 to 110C if I read correctly. Also fans will favor silence over cooling in macbooks. So likely that second fan is not kicking in until it reaches something like 70C.  If over time you notice an upwards trend of temps, I'd look into cleaning the dust out and getting an application called Macs Fan Control to turn up the fan speeds based on temps. The downside is, the faster you run the fans, the sooner they will wear out.  <answer268642> The various temperature readings look absolutely 100% fine!  This resource (which can be filtered) clearly shows that your CPU temp at 52.38°C is nothing to worry about.  My MBP temp is regularly between 66 and 81 degrees, and my fans are regularly at 6200 RPM when my CPU usage is high.   However, the fact that your stats indicate only one fan is spinning warrants further investigation. I would run an Apple Hardware Diagnostics to see if it finds any errors. To do this:  ol liFully shut down your MBP/li liRestart your MBP/li liImmediately press the kbdD/kbd key and strongkeep it down/strong until you see the Diagnostics screen appear/li liWait for Diagnostics to finish (this typically only takes a few minutes)/li liOnce complete, one of two things will appear on the screen:  ul lia emNo issues found/em message/li lia brief description of any errors found plus further instructions/li /ul/li liIf the diagnostics test does find errors, take a note of what they are/li /ol  strongNote:/strong If pressing and holding the kbdD/kbd key at Step 3 doesn't work, start again at Step 1 and, at Step 3 press and hold both the kbdOption/kbdkbdD/kbd keys instead. This will try and run diagnostics from the internet instead, so you will need to allow more time for it to complete.  Let us know how you go.  <answer291354> So, I sent the mac off to be fixed and it turned out to be something stuck in the right fan causing it to not move!

All of those temps look within standard range. I'd try running Apple Hardware test to make sure there isn't a problem with your fan (make sure it's not broken).
