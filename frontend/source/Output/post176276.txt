How can I automatically switch to external speaker whenever bluetooth headphones are turned off <body> This is just a convenience question.  I have a pair of Bluetooth headphones. Whenever they are turned on, I want sound to come through them. When they are turned off, I want sound to come through the speakers. Is there some kind of app/utility that automatically switches the sound output device based upon the status of my Bluetooth headphones?  <comment208071> Isn't that the default ? I have no headphones, but a bluetooth link to my sound system. When the System is on, Sound goes there, if it is off, sound goes through mac default. Am I missing something? <comment208075> How do you Turn off the BT headphones ? how would the system know that?
