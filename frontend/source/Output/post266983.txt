Why my Sierra is very slow and it restarts from time to time? <body> I have a MacBook Air 2011, my macOS is 10.12.2. Recently it is very slow and sometimes it just restarts. It started to happen after the upgrade to 10.12.1 and 10.12.2.  I reset PRAM and NVRAM, I used CleanMyMac app and OnyX, but it didn't improve the situation. I even deleted all the cache files from codeLibrary/code folder, uninstalled some specious apps like Skype, still it didn't help. Recently even when watching the movie in Movist it is bumping.  Any suggestion?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6IL7n.png" alt="enter image description here" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZCgV0.png" alt="enter image description here" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ii0p0.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment334877> Any change it's getting hot? Systems that get "stuck" or reboot (withouten reason) could be caused by overheating. <comment334898> how can I figure it out ? <comment334978> On the first screenshot it says that your battery health is poor. Perhaps look into replacing the battery.
