How to tell if PCIe card is supported in my MacPro? <body> I have a mid-201 MacPro Tower. Bays are full, including 2nd optical drive slot. I've seen PCIe cards that will hold 4 M.2 SSD blades, but the specs listed don't list MacOS as supported, although in some cases, a comment from a buyer says it works in a Mac.  Is there a way to tell if a given card will work? Item shows "Chipset: Marvell 88SE9230 support HyoperDuo" in case this makes a difference.   <comment364224> I'd be far more inclined to trust someone like [OWC\(MacSales\)](https://eshop.macsales.com/shop/hard-drives/sata/mac-pro) than some random thing on Amazon/eBay which says it supports nix & Win <comment364228> It's not so much compatible with the MacPro but rather compatible with macOS.  PCIe is PCie.  Whether there's drivers for it is a different story.  That said, I don't see why it wouldn't work - it should just show up as a drive. <comment364233> i would definitely avoid anything that doesn't specifically state it is compatible with a Mac Pro. Most advertisers aren't even aware such a machine exists, it's far too niche for them. Equivalent of buying a non-Mac-flashed GPU... you're fine so long as you don't need to see the display before login... <comment364244> I had a Dell Fibre Channel PCIe card in an XServe and it worked flawlessly.  It's unknown if your card will work, but one thing is for certain, it won't damage anything.  If it doesn't work, just remove it and return it.  Amazon is great for returns.
