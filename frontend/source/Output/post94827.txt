Toggle Mail Classic View in Mountain Lion with <body> I found a script on this site which I edited to make work with Mountain Lion, I thought. It works fine from Automator, but when I save as a service and assign a keystroke to it, it does not. Any help would be appreciated!  precodetell application "Mail" to activate  tell application "System Events"     tell process "Mail"         tell application "System Events" to keystroke "," using command down         delay 0.1         activate (first window whose name is "Viewing")         click checkbox "Use classic layout" of group 1 of group 1 of window "Viewing"     end tell end tell /code/pre  <answer94843> The script didn't focus the Viewing tab. Try this instead:  precodeactivate application "Mail" tell application "System Events" to tell process "Mail"     keystroke "," using command down     tell window 1         click button "Viewing" of tool bar 1         click checkbox "Use classic layout" of group 1 of group 1         click button 1     end tell end tell /code/pre  If it still doesn't work, it might be because of a bug where the shortcuts for Automator services don't always work until you hover the services menu from the menu bar. See this question for other ways to assign shortcuts to scripts.  <answer95099> Fixed it! It turns out that a service has to be accessed once from the drop down menu. Then it will work with a short cut...finally!  <comment111413> Thanks! That script indeed works from within Automator as my other did, but does not work from within Mail via keystroke. I'll look into other ways assign the shortcut. System Preferences works for my other scripts...oh well.
