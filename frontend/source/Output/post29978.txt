How can I make an automator service always show up? <body> I have an AppleScript that adds the subject of a selected email in Mail to my task manager.  I have put this AppleScript in an Automator service so I can hotkey it.  Only problem is this: Lion insists on only showing the service when I have text selected. Somehow OS X thinks its a text based script even though I specified there is no input.  Is there any way to have the service show up in the services menu independent of the selection I have?  <answer29997> In Automator at the very top of your workflow, there is a dropdown box for which the prompt reads strongService receives selected/strong. If you are getting the results you report, the word strongtext/strong likely appears in the dropdown box. Change it to strongno input/strong and save the service.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0cY7w.png" alt="enter image description here"
