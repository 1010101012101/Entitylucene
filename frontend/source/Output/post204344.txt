Possible to remap CapsLock to emulate the "French - Numerical" behavior on a U.S qwerty keyboard <body> I would like to remap the capslock key to behave as such:  ul liWhen strongOff/strong :   ul liletters are lowercase/li linumbers are not active (symbols characters are active)/li liother symbols (not on the numbers row) behave normally (as if shift was up)/li /ul/li liWhen strongON/strong:   ul liletters are uppercase/li linumbers are active/li liother symbols (not on the numbers row) are inverted (as if shift was down)/li /ul/li /ul  It is the behavior from the "French - Numerical" layout, but I need this on a U.S. keyboard.  <answer204437> Not natively, as far as I'm aware.  Though I don't think it'd be easy, I guess you could use an app such as Ukulele. emI suggest the stable 2.2.8 version, since the 3.0 beta might crash when changing modifier keys./em  ol liDownload Ukulele/li liChange your keyboard layout to emFrench - Numerical/em (  strongSystem Preferences/strong  strongKeyboard/strong  strongInput Sources/strong)/li liIn Ukulele: strongFile/strong  strongNew From Current Input Source/strong (Which is why you changed to French - Numerical in the previous step). After this you can change back to the regular keyboard layout./li liEssentially change all of the keys to match the English QWERTY./li liSave your new layout in your strongLibrary/strong folder  strongKeyboard Layouts/strong (Accessable by pressing ⇧+⌘+G and typing in "~/Library/Keyboard Layouts" and clicking emGo/em)/li liLog out and log in again an switch to your new fancy keyboard layout/li /ol  I think this is the way to go simply because Apple probably did some fancy trickery to make this work for the French layout, so if you base it off of that, you might be able to "trick" the system into accepting the new one.  strongNote:/strong Since we're not ementirely/em sure this'll work, I'd recommend only changing a couple of keys to be begin with, as a "proof of concept" (Then, obviously, if it works, simply finish the layout and repeat step 5 and 6).  Good luck!  <comment246318> I think you would need to use Ukelele or Karabiner to create a custom keyboard layout.
