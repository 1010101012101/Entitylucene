/dev/disk0 disappears <body> On my Macbook Pro mid-2014 (have had it for only a week) I am having an issue where the primary hard drive (at code/dev/disk0/code) just disappears from the system, thus crashing. The only reason I know that it disappears is that I had terminal open one time when it happened and did a quick "ls /dev/disk*". I can't seem to find any information about this problem online.  I just had this happen again. I ran the following program:  code watch -n 1 "ls /dev/*disk*" /code  This started out with the following:  code /dev/disk0 /dev/disk0s1 /dev/disk0s2 /dev/disk0s3 /dev/rdisk0 /dev/rdisk0s1 /dev/rdisk0s2 /dev/rdisk0s3 /code  After awhile suddently the only thing displayed from my watch command is:  code /dev/disk0s2 /dev/rdisk0s2 /code  Which is the Macintosh HD partition of the drive.  <comment170400> Wow - that's really strange. Have you looked over the console logs to see what sort of kernel messages (or other messages) arrive around that(those) fateful moment(s)? <comment170402> I don't see anything that would seem to cause this issue from console. Of course I only have a few minutes to sift through it, before things crash again. <comment170404> I should also point out that when I boot to System Recovery, I can't see the primary drive in Disk Utility as well. Genius bar appointment setup for tomorrow. <comment170407> It sounds like a hardware failure. Hopefully the cable is all you need or just reseating the drive module / cabling. <comment170408> I'm going to try re-seating the drive when I get home tonight; unfortunately I haven't become nerdy enough to carry my tool set in my laptop bag. Hopefully that's all. Regardless the laptop is less than a week old with Apple Care, so it'll be covered.
