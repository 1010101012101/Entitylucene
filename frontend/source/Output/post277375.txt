Set desktop to lock screen when monitor is disconnected? <body> I have a mac desktop that shares a single monitor with a second computer via an HDMI switcher. I've discovered that if I switch the monitor to my second computer, the first computer never turns on its screensaver, and so it never locks itself (I can't set the computer to sleep for technical reasons).   Is there a way to set the computer to lock the user account whenever the monitor is disconnected?   I can set hot-corners and such and try and do it manually, but security that relies on user action is never really secure...
