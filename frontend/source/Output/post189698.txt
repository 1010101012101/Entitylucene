4k monitor on 2009 Mac Pro 4,1? <body> I'd like to run a single 4k monitor on my 2009 Mac Pro.  The Sapphire HD 7950 seems to be the preferred video upgrade card for Pros of this vintage, but the Sapphire site says that only the PC version of this card can drive a 4k.    Does anyone run a 4k monitor on a Mac Pro or can suggest a card?  <comment225134> Excuse the deleted answer...Ha Mac Pro not MBP... obv i overlooked the 4,1 <comment225136> Their site does mention having 4K support. `The display resolution is quadrupled to the resolution of 4KX2K( 4096X2160 ) from the outputs of DisplayPort 1.2 and HDMI.`
