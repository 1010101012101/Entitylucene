Delete TotalFinder Mavericks <body> since I updated to mavericks. I do not use totalFinder anymore. I deleted it first, but on every start i get this failure message.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZAUD6.png" alt="enter image description here"  I already searched the developer site for help. But nothing helped. http://totalfinder.binaryage.com/uninstallation  Do you know any trick how to delete everything from this application?   <answer117568> There is probably a login item that is attempting to run it still in your user account.  In codeSystem Preferences/code select codeUsers &amp; Groups/code then your account in the left hand list. To the right select codeLogin Items/code and browse the list. When you find codeTotalFinder/code click on the small '-' at the bottom of the list.  This should fix it.  If that doesn't work and the Uninstaller they give you doesn't work then I suspect their uninstaller is running into a permissions problem caused by the upgrade to Mavericks. I would try a reinstall and then uninstall.  <comment137358> Did you use the uninstallation option in the menu of the application? Perhaps try installing it again and uninstalling it a second time will do the trick. <comment137361> I have not enough stars to rate your answer, but that was the solution to resolve the problem. Thank you <comment141003> Thanks Tony, I was looking for the same thing for weeks...
