[n] n /code/pre  <comment333855> Which format should the partition actually have? <comment333867> Bad cyclical redundancy check in the GUID partition table makes it sound like an erase and reformat might prove helpful. "GUID Partition Table (GPT) is a standard for the layout of the partition table on a physical storage device used in a desktop or server PC" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GUID_Partition_Table If it's corrupt, your Mac has no idea of what to make of the disk. <comment333919> The external hard drive was badly disconnected from a television. The disc has not been mounted since. There were only movies, but I think it's a mistake that should be able to fix and recover the disk as it was. <comment333920> The disc had the format that usually brings WD, I think it was ex fat <comment333921> But I'm afraid to touch something and spoil it at all, in case you have an easier arrangement to leave the disk as it was <comment333923> This may help: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/206593/rebuild-partition-table-on-external-hdd-not-writable <comment334065> From what I can understand in that article, the problem is in the map of the partition, which would have to be reconstructed. But in that case the disk is formatted for mac, and my disk was formatted in ex-fat I think. That would have to write exactly in the terminal of mac to be able to reconstruct the map of the partition and to recover the disk exactly as it was? (or similar) <comment334094> What I need to know is, with the data I've put, what kind of format I had and what I'd have to put. And also in that part of the disk, since there are 3 options .. dev / disk3 .. dev / disk3s1 and dev / disk3s2, and I do not know where I would have to put the partition map ...
