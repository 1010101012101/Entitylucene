"not authorized" on this computer when syncing iphone to mac even though authorization already performed <body> Even though this computer is already authorized for iTunes:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hHBv1.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Following the directions on the warning message as seen in the screenshot:  I did authenticate this computer  precode    Store | Authorize this computer /code/pre  (which btw had already been authenticated in the past - so I don't know why it lost the auth..).  But the error message continues to happen.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/M9tp4.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  So then we are in a catch22. iTunes say I am already authorized but then turns around and says I am not. I have repeated this process to ensure it were not just temporary.  Why the discrepancy here - and what to do to resolve?   <comment271020> sometimes it's just best to clear all authorisations & start over - https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT204385 <comment271022> @Tetsujin I did reauthorize (i.e. re-enter the iTunes Store password) but behavior persists. <comment271033> did you clear all authorisations first?
