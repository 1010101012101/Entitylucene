How to select text with touchpad without pressing the "hard" key? <body> Now on OS X, when I want to select some text, I have to press the "hard" key on touchpad with thumb and drag through the text with another finger on touchpad. With linux on the same macbook pro, I could quickly touch the touchpad twice and start selection/dragging behavior without pressing the "hard" key on touchpad with single finger. I feel the way in linux is much easier for fingers and quicker. Is it possible to configure OS X touchpad behave in the same way?  <answer151691> The nearest thing available is the "Three finger drag" option in System prefs -- under trackpad you'll find the option to use it:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/aXHgX.png" alt="Trackpad prefs"  This lets you drag by hold three fingers on the trackpad and dragging..  <answer235348> Enabling the three finger "drag" is a bit different on El-Capitan and above:  ol liGo to System Preferences  Accessibility/li liChoose Mouse &amp; Trackpad from the left options list/li liClick Trackpad Options/li liTick "enable dragging" and select “three finger drag” from the drop-down menu next to it/li /ol  <answer275141> Had this issue with new Macbook Air (latest one late 2015) and old trackpad that suddenly required a hard click and drag, simultaneously, to copy large amounts. Found that above directions with modest variation works perfectly as:  ol liGo to System Preferences  Accessibility/li liChoose Mouse &amp; Trackpad from the left options list/li liClick Trackpad Options Step #4 also works as:/li liTick "enable dragging" and select "without drag lock" from the drop-down menu next to it/li /ol  This was how my trackpad always worked before I migrated to the new computer, and it is easier on fingers. 1 finger, no hard pressure.  <comment241361> Is there any other way around without using three fingers? it is hard to select longer texts.
