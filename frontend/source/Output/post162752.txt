Copy-Paste from Mac to Emacs of ubuntu <body> I use codeversion 10.9.2 of OS X/code and a virtual machine code6.0.5 VMware Fusion/code. codeUbuntu 14.04 LTS/code has been installed on the virtual machine. In ubuntu I use codeEmacs 24.3.1/code as editor.  Once emacs of ubuntu is launched, the codeKill Menu/code (see codeEdit/code - codePaste from Kill Menu/code) is empty. If I want to copy a text from Chrome under Mac to Emacs under ubuntu, I can use codeCommand+C/code (which saves the text into the Kill Menu of Emacs) then codeCommand+V/code or codeCtrl+V/code.  I can also copy and paste a text within Emacs by using codeCommand+C/code (which also saves the text into the Kill Menu of Emacs) then codeCommand+V/code or codeCtrl+V/code.  However, the problem is, after I copy and paste something within Emacs, I could not copy and paste a test from Mac to Emacs anymore by codeCommand+C/code then codeCommand+V/code or codeCtrl+V/code: codeCommand+C/code under a Chrome page of Mac can not save the text into the Kill Menu anymore. Consequently, codeCommand+V/code or codeCtrl+V/code within Emacs always pastes the last element in the Kill Menu, which is not what I want.  So I have to close and re-launch Emacs to clean the Kill Menu to enable the copy-paste from Mac to Emacs of ubuntu, which is tedious...  Could anyone help?  <answer164058> I think there are two issues here. One is how to copy from Mac to Ubuntu. That is the work of the VM. You have to set it up and oftentimes it depends on capturing the mouse/keyboard (you may want to look it up in your vmware config for the specific VM you are using, I mean, the one running Ubuntu). From what you said, it looks like this part is working ok.  Then there is a question about the Kill-Yank ring in Emacs. Usually, you kill (cut) using codeCommand+K/code (it kills from the cursor position to the end of the current line; you can kill characters with codeControl+K/code or words with codeOption(alt)+K/code) and you paste with codeCommand+Y/code (it will paste everything that you had killed just before yanking it up). So, unless it is somehow configured differently, whatever you copy or cut with codeCommand+C/code or codeCommand+X/code on your Mac side (provided it is correctly configured on VMWare) should be available on Emacs by using codeCommand+Y/code not codeCommand+V/code.   Hope it helps.  P.S. There is also another trick: Ubuntu tends to think of the mouse as a peripheral having three buttons. Selecting something (just selecting, not copying or cutting it) and pressing the middle button normally pastes it at the cursor position (I don't know, nevertheless, how your VMWare-hosted Ubuntu would differentiate your middle button. Sometimes, it means pressing both buttons at once. On some configurations, you will need to press a modifier (codeOption/code?) while you click the secondary button.  <comment192955> Thanks for your answer, my mac doesn't work that way, but it did allow to to find the solution `Option+Alt+K` (See http://askubuntu.com/a/568012/15432)
