What is the difference between pmset and systemsetup sleep options? <body> On my MacBook Air 2013 (Mountain Lion):  codepmset/code has the following sleep settings:  precode$ pmset -g ...  disksleep            10  sleep                1  displaysleep         2 /code/pre  while codesystemsetup/code has the following settings:  precode$ systemsetup -getsleep Sleep: Computer sleeps after 10 minutes Sleep: Display sleeps after 10 minutes Sleep: Disk sleeps after 10 minutes /code/pre  What is the difference between these settings?  Also, Energy Saver shows "Display sleep" is set to 2 minutes, so coincides with codepmset/code, while "Computer sleep" is no longer shown in Mountain Lion I have read. Why is this no longer possible?  UPDATE: Turns out MacBook Air 2013 dropped separate sliders for computer- and display sleep: http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=1595455 Using codepmset/code to set these individually should still work however. Not sure I like the change though...  <answer95196> In this case, codesystemsetup/code is a high level wrapper that is analogous to the System Preferences UI. Both call the lower level power API which are the internals about how the system actually stores these values for the hardware to use and implement. codepmset/code is a lower level tool that reads the API/hardware values directly, so I would generally trust that over the higher level tools like strongEnergy Saver/strong or codesystem setup/code  If you are right and there is a discrepancy, you might have to file a bug report with Apple to figure out if it's really a bug or just that the information is being mixed up before it is presented to you.  You can go directly to the source file as it's stored at code/Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/com.apple.PowerManagement.plist/code and perhaps it can break the tie between which of these three tools is telling you the correct information?  In all my computers, the numbers match up, so perhaps the codesystemsleep/code values are incorrect for your hardware or OS build?   <answer95275> After doing some more testing, it seems the results from codesystemsetup -getsleep/code correlate with the strongPower Adapter/strong settings on the Energy Adapter prefpane. When I use code-setsleep 10/code, the strongDisplay Sleep/strong timer also jumps to 10 minutes, and vice versa.  Also, when I check strongPrevent computer from sleeping when display is off/strong, codesystemsetup -getsleep/code returns codeSleep: Computer sleeps Never/code, while unchecking strongPut hard disks to sleep when possible/strong causes codeSleep: Disk sleeps Never/code.  strongIn conclusion/strong, it would seem the reason for the deviating values of codepmset/code and codesystemsetup/code is that I was testing while on battery power, so codepmset/code returned battery values, while codesystemsetup/code always returns power adapter values.  <comment111662> The .plist matches up with `pmset`, so I guess that one's the boss. Also, when I move the "Display sleep" slider, the `pmset displaysleep` value moves with it, as does the value in `/Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/com.apple.PowerManagement.plist`. <comment111663> @uffjohn I also neglected to say that these settings get loaded into memory of the SMC and OS and that running processes can put holds on things like sleep, so it's a little more complicated than just a `plist` file but that seems to be very close to reality in my experience. <comment111726> Turns out `systemsetup` only affects the Power Adapter settings, see my update above :) <comment111727> It would be best if you edited those details in to this answer or made a new answer. Questions work best when they are short and precise. Answers work best when there is some narrative - what the initial thoughts were - how you got to a solution and in the end a summary of how things work. <comment111740> Thanks for the tip, I'll do that :)
