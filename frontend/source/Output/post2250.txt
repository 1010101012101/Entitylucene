What is the best method to apply a screen protector to a touchscreen? <body> Installing a screen protector on a touchscreen is not always easy.  Bubbles and dust can make your screen look horrible.  What is the best method/procedure you have found to apply a screen protector?  <answer2251> First I make sure the screen is completely clean using a micro-fiber cloth, then I use a credit card with the cloth wrapped around to press the screen protector tightly as soon as it touches the screen.  The trick is to press, making a forward/backward movement, the protector against the screen as soon as it touches it, removing any bubbles in the process. So don't try to put the protector all at once.  <answer2252> I live in a dry climate, so preventing dust from settling on the screen during application is one of the biggest concerns.  Another is in getting it aligned just right.  Here are some additional steps have used to get the absolute best results.    Note: this involves using water and electronics together, so you must be very careful to use the absolute minimum amount of water and the absolute maximum amount of care.  It could void your warranty, ruin your device, and/or inflict serious personal injury.
