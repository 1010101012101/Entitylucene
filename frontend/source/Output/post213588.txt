How to migrate 'local notes' or 'on my mac' notes to iCloud? <body> I've seen so many questions asked about it, and I found a proper solution today while working. See below. I searched around, and everyone's answer has been either 'copy all of your notes manually' or use a '3rd party solution'. This requires neither.  <answer213590> Do this:  ul liAll devices need the New Notes upgrade to be compatible with this./li liUpdate to New Notes on each device./li liOpen folders view and select Local Notes or On My Phone./li liTap on Edit in the upper right corner and tap on Move All in the lower left corner./li liYou should see this:/li /ul  iCloud  New Folder  'Notes 0 ' [or not including the local notes]  ul liTap on Notes/li /ul  They will empty out of the local notes folder and move into iCloud.  Again, you won't see any of these notes until you upgrade to New Notes.  Pro-Tip: This also works for migrating Gmail notes, etc.  <comment257864> It might have been better to post the answer directly to one of the many similar questions on this site.
