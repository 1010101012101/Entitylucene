Moving Notes from one Mac (Yosemite) to another (Sierra) without iCloud <body> I have a question very similar to this one, with one twist:  I cannot use iCloud on these computers - this is a "security" feature of the way the computers at my work are configured.  Is it possible to get the notes from one computer (OS10.10) copied to another computer (OS10.12) so that I can continue using them?  Note - the solution given in this Q&amp;A ("just copy the entire contents of com.apple.Notes to the Library on the new machine") doesn't work for me as the Notes app on the Sierra machine seems to ignore the contents of the old database (old one is v4, new one is v6).
