Weird scroll behaviour in Pages 09 <body> this really bemuses me. i'm using pages 09 (version 4.1) on osx 10.9.5. when i terminate a scroll downward, the document makes a little "jump" to the right. this is maybe hard to visualize, so i made a gif:  http://gfycat.com/ExemplaryAdoredAntelope  also notice in the gif, there's a little gray area to the right of the document: when i resize the window the document grows or shrinks accordingly (zoom is set to "Fit Width"), but the gray area stays there.  this behaviour occours with some documents/windows, but not others. i tried to close/reopen the affected windows, and even quit/restart pages, to no avail.  how can i fix/prevent/workaround this issue?  thanks  <answer191082> ol liIn the bottom left corner of the window, click on the zoom control and select code100%/code (or any fixed value).  /li liClick again and select codeFit Width/code.  /li liScroll is fixed./li /ol  <comment227112> @jherran please explain the rationale behind your editing
