Yosemite Messages Screen Sharing Disabled <body> I'm trying to screen share on from within the Messages app with another iMessage user. We're both on Yosemite, and we've successfully used Messages's new screen sharing feature many times. One day, we discovered the screen share button was disabled. It has never come back.  Screen sharing is enabled in the Video menu, and we are both on the most recent version of Yosemite. I'm not sure how to look for answers without even an error message to go on.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0NrfS.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer184870> I just used Yosemite's screen sharing via Messages.   Getting it to work on both sides required me to enable strongback to my mac/strong in strongSystem Settings/strong under strongiCloud/strong. After restarting the Messages app on both sides those two rectangles became active and screen sharing worked.  <answer196749> You should also ask your remote person to do this:  ul liopen Messages/li lion the menu, make sure Video/Screen Sharing Enabled is checked/li /ul  Stupid and obvious, I know, but I just wasted an hour helping someone before I remembered that that option existed.  <answer250018> I found that to get screen sharing to work, all I had to do is login to my iCloud account via preferences. After that the screen sharing icon was no long grayed out.  <comment234079> This worked for me after a serious amount of fiddling. Thanks! <comment275603> what exactly do you mean by "on the menu" <comment275616> I mean on the main OS X menu bar. I'm not seeing that menu item right now, which may because I'm not logged into any jabber accounts, or maybe it went away with the El Capitan upgrade? It definitely existed when I wrote my original rely (and was using Mavericks). <comment289332> In Mavericks, Screen Sharing Enabled is in the video menu, but it seems to be different in Yosemite and El Capitan. <comment347156> I don't know whether it was enabling Back to My Mac or whether it was also signing out of iCloud and back in. But I did both and remote Screen Sharing started working in both directions.
