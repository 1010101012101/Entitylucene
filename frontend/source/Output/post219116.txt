Any nice, stable ways to keep a window 'Always on top' on the Mac? <body> I am looking for a stable way to keep any window 'always on top' on OSX.  Afloat, an app that does that requires SIMBL/easySIMBL, which it seems is not very stable.  Are there any better solutions? It's actually surprising that there is no native way to implement this.  <answer219311> If you only really want/need em"stay on top"/em functionality for your strongemTerminal.app/em/strong emwindow/em (like myself), there is a strongemQuake/Guake-style/em/strong emdrop-down visor,/em emstrongSIMBL/strong plug-in/em available that supports being empinned/em to the foreground; strongemTotalTerminal./em/strong   So it's possible, despite the common misconception that it's not.  As of strongemMacOS 10.11 (El Capitan)/em/strong, to install/run strongemTotalTerminal/em/strong, you might need to disableÂ strongemSystem Integrity Protection/em/strong:  precodecsrutil enable --without debug /code/pre  It's no longer open source, but the last open source implementation is still available on strongemGitHub/em/strong. So if you're inclined to, you could investigate exactly how it's achieved. I emailed the developer to ask, but it's been so long since they worked on it, they couldn't (or wouldn't?) really tell me.  <answer226046> If you are looking to do this just for a say an internet browser window you could look at the open source Helium app. It's free, and you can also download the source and compile your own version if you want.  It's basically an internet browser that always floats above all other windows. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/23yhP.png" alt="Helium App"  EDIT:  There's also a newer app from the Apple Mac App Store called Fluid Browser that will do this same thing. It does cost a couple of $s, but it works excellently and has a few more features than Helium (as of 7/6/2016). So you now have two different apps to choose from.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jbXdB.png" alt="Fluid Browser"  <answer237056> Not really an answer but more like a work-around: you can use Spectacle or a similar app to quickly setup a desktop layout that let you follow the original window.  Of course this won't help when you're waiting for someone else to join a support chat and in the meanwhile decide to use your time for something more useful than staring at a blank window -- like working on another virtual desktop :(  Grab Spectacle from here: https://www.spectacleapp.com  <answer237246> There is a free app called Key Codes in the Mac App Store that as far as I can tell stays on top of all other windows. Other than menu items it stays atop all other apps including the Terminal and the Safari URL bar.  <answer245154> I'll note that the iOS Simulator has the option codeStay in Front/code. Extremely useful functionality, and proves that there are Apple-supported and sanctioned ways to achieve this behavior.  Might be worth opening a radar, especially for adding to Terminal.  You can duplicate my radar:      Bug ID 27430873: Add "Stay in Front" option to Terminal windows.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/RRxeh.png" alt="Stay in Front option in iOS Simulator"  <comment265151> The HIG of OSX doesn't allow it and thus it was never programmed anywhere into the windowing system. Usually it means that you'r trying to solve a problem the wrong way, or an app you use is badly written and doesn't do what it needs to do. Actual solutions will either need a better explanation of the problem, or a programmer to fix the app. <comment273717> To let the user set their window-of-choice to always be on top of other windows might cause undesired and unexpected behavior. The screen saver is also just a window - do you want to float above that? What about important alerts? What if two apps demand to be always-on-top? You could theoretically DoS a user by putting your full-screen app on top and logging them out. This is why there is no 'always-on-top' property in Cocoa. One can only specify a relative Z index (and Apple urges against doing that). Your options are basically re-code the app, or use SIMBL. <comment274414> Are you looking to do this for any application in the Mac OS? If so, do you want it to always have focus (meaning key presses and mouse click), or do you want the window of an app to "float above" all others, but NOT be the active window? <comment290223> Welcome to Ask Different and taking the time to post an answer.  As a suggested improvement, your should provide links to the application(s) that you reference in your post.  It makes for a better user experience.

Cheers. <comment324716> I did not like the Fluid Browser experience. Yes, it has a few more features but it's pretty buggy and cumbersome. Helium is very lightweight but does the job. <comment328700> FWIW Fedora has always allowed this (since the mid 90s in RH form) and I have never had any problems of the "undesired" nature. It just isn't in OSX when it could be put in. <comment329935> Brilliant tip Seamus if the op specifically needs that particular app to stay on top. Now, if, hypothetically speaking of course, he wants a different app to stay on top, or perhaps even few different ones, then perhaps not so sterling? <comment341603> Can you block ads in Helium or Fluid? <comment346118> What is this iOS simulator? Is it like an emulator? I have been looking for one. <comment346220> @tjt263 the iOS simulator is bundled with Xcode and mainly used to develop iOS apps <comment346223> Oh ok. What's a radar? Like a bug report? <comment346299> @tjt263 yes, https://bugreport.apple.com <comment364663> TotalTerminal is no longer maintained these days. I ended up switching to iTerm to get the same behavior: https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/48796/iterm-as-a-slide-out-terminal-from-the-top-of-the-screen <comment364964> That's right, I wouldn't suggest using it. But if someone is motivated to implement their own solution, it might be worth browsing the linked source code. <comment367033> For floating terminal, I am using Helium with gotty. gotty allows you to open a terminal in web browser and Helium is a floating web browser.
