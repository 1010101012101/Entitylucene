iPad app to mashup music <body> I'm looking for a simple app that will just let me load tracks from my music library, chop some clips out of them, and assign those clips to a trigger pad. So then I can create "mashups" by holding down different combinations of trigger pads.  Any possibilities?  <answer113074> You have several options:  ul liDM1/li liiMaschine/li liDrumOn/li lietc./li /ul  I have tested iMaschine years ago. I was very satisfied at the time. I'm not sure whether this App is still maintained. I have heard very good things about DM1, never really got the chance to test it though.
