How to stop mail app from sending me an e-mail with "reply all" <body> When I want to do "reply-all" to a message that involves multiple people, the mail app includes myself in the list of recipients. Is there a way to turn off this feature?  <answer249764> Like Tyson said, normally this doesn't happen, but maybe your Mail.app is configured to send you a copy of your mails sent.    Go to Mail  Preferences  Composing and see if you have "Automatically Cc (or some other selection) myself" selected and unselect it if you do.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fImcU.png" alt="Mail composing preferences"  <comment309871> Is the email being received via a forward or alias?  What you're describing is not normal behavior unless the "from" address of the "reply all" is different than where the email was addressed originally. <comment309988> I don't have that option checked, but I still get an e-mail. There is some sort of an alias system, though. I'll contact our system administrator. Thanks! <comment309990> @Tyson There is an alias system. Each user has a username, but using name.lastname@... works too. That might be the problem. I'll contact our system administrator. <comment309991> Correct. Reply all removes the address that it will be sending from, but if it actually sending from jon.doe@ it doesn't know that that jon@ is the same person.
