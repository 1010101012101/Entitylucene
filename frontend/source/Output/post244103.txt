Windows 10 Bootcamp Partition Unseen By OS X <body> I've look around here and Apple's support community, but can't find my exact issue. I recently reinstalled Windows 10 to my MacBook Pro (Mid 2012), added a partition to start on installing Linux, and now OS X doesn't see the Windows 10 partition at all. I can still hold down alt/option to start it up, but I would like to have the option to have it automatically start to Windows 10, which I don't anymore.  sudo fdisk /dev/disk0 returned the following:  precodeDisk: /dev/disk0    geometry: 29185/255/63 [468862128 sectors] Signature: 0xAA55          Starting       Ending  #: id  cyl  hd sec -  cyl  hd sec [     start -       size] ------------------------------------------------------------------------  1: EE    0   0   2 -   25 127  14 [         1 -     409639] &lt;Unknown ID&gt;  2: AF   25 127  15 - 1023 254  63 [    409640 -  233553880] HFS+         *3: 07 1023 254  63 - 1023 254  63 [ 234225664 -     204800] HPFS/QNX/AUX  4: 07 1023 254  63 - 1023 254  63 [ 234430464 -  234428416] HPFS/QNX/AUX /code/pre  sudo gdisk /dev/disk0 returned this:  precodeDisk /dev/disk0: 468862128 sectors, 223.6 GiB Logical sector size: 512 bytes Disk identifier (GUID): F33219B5-A986-430B-8674-23055706EF16 Partition table holds up to 128 entries First usable sector is 34, last usable sector is 468862094 Partitions will be aligned on 8-sector boundaries Total free space is 234693781 sectors (111.9 GiB)  Number  Start (sector)    End (sector)  Size       Code  Name    1              40          409639   200.0 MiB   EF00  EFI System Partition    2          409640       233963519   111.4 GiB   AF00  Untitled    3       234225664       234430463   100.0 MiB   0700  BOOTCAMP /code/pre  Of course, Disk Utility was SO helpful by showing this: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/d8f6a.png" alt="Disk Utility being Helpful"  I don't want to reinstall Windows 10 AGAIN, and I can't seem to find any information that actually helps with this issue. Any assistance would be appreciated.  <answer244166> As you stated, you can hold down the kbdoption/kbd key at startup to invoke the Startup Manager. If you hold down the kbdcontrol/kbd key while selecting one of the displayed partitions, then chosen partition will become the new default startup partition.  <comment302203> The actual answer I ended up using was the exact one I wanted to avoid. I installed Refind and am successfully using it to control boot up. I do appreciate this option, though I'm not sure it would work if OS X doesn't see the partition I would be choosing.
