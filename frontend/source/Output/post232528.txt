How to encrypt existing notes on iOS 9.3? <body> Now that iOS 9.3 finally supports encrypted notes, the problem's come up as to exactly how I'm supposed to encrypt my 300+ existing notes.  Until now I've been storing my notes locally on my phone, since I feel uneasy about storing work and research notes on the cloud in plaintext (I don't consider it encryption if the service has a copy of my key), but it would be much more useful if I could have access to them on all my devices and avoid having to do manual backups.  Locking a single note is easy enough, but I'm struggling to figure out how to apply it to all my existing notes. I can't see an option on the iPhone, iPad or OSX app, so I'm guessing it's probably buried away somewhere in the iCloud Control Panel or icloud.com (I'm not very familiar with either).  Or if Apple rushed this release so much that they actually omitted (or broke) such a crucial feature, could someone suggest a workaround?  <comment285371> Surely somebody has an idea?
