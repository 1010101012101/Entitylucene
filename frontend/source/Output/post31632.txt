Best OS X TODO app that can be synced with Android? <body> Which is the best OS X "TO DO"-app that I can sync my Android device with?  <answer31649> Try out Evernote. It is free. I am pretty sure it can sync between Android and Mac. I cannot test it myself - I do not have an Android device.  <answer31651> I recommend Wunderlist. It has apps for Mac OSX, Windows, iPhone, iPad and yes Android. It can sync all between these different platforms. By the way it's free.  <answer252235> Try iCloud Calendar and Reminder sync I developed it.Trusted with more than 200k downloads.  <comment36301> If these answers don't satisfy your question, I suggest that you flag your post and ask a moderator to try your luck by moving it to [Android.SE](http://android.stackexchange.com/). You're asking a third party app question to support your Android phone, that just happens to need to run on Apple's Desktop OS. But on Android, the OS is irrelevant (by which I mean Android users use all major operating systems and then some), more people use your type of phone, and everything desktop wise is 'third party'.  Something to consider, is all :). <comment36302> Also, there is no "best". Because your opinion of best may differ wildly from someone else's.
