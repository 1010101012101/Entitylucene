Software not available from update server when installing Windows 8.1 on Mavericks <body> I am trying to install Windows 8.1 on OS X Mavericks via Bootcamp. I have a Macbook Pro mid 2010 model.  I'm running Bootcamp assistant 5.1.0 (473).  Unfortunately, I am getting the following error message when the installer tries to download Windows support software:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/oZCwY.png" alt="enter image description here"  Any ideas why?  <answer113090> You can try manually updating the software. Here's a link that you can use. Be sure to follow the instructions.  <comment132707> On a Mid-2010 on Bootcamp 4.0.4 (437) running 10.7.5, I can download Windows 7 drivers. Could it a be a connectivity issue to Apple servers? I have installed Windows 8.1 on a MBP 2012 on Mavericks + 5.1 Bootcamp, which is slightly different than what you have. Is Windows 8.1 supported on your configuration? Please take a look at this as well - http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5634
