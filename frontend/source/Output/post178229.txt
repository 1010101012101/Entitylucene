Can't Add Printer with lpadmin <body> I am trying to add a Pharos printer to a Mac, running Yosemite, and the command isn't working. The problem is that the printer queue has a space in the name. The genius that set it up didn't think that would ever be a problem. The command is:  precodelpadmin -p "Pharos Printer" -E -D "Pharos Printer" -P PHAROS_PRINTER.PPD -v popup://pharos.domain.com/Pharos%20Printer /code/pre  code%20/code and quotes, or a combination of the two haven't worked yet. Anything else I can try? The above command works on printer queues that do not have spaces in their names.
