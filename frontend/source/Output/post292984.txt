What's the easiest way to create ringtones on my MacBook Pro? <body> I own a 2013 15‚Äù MacBook Pro with 16 GB RAM, running macOS Sierra. I would like to create my own ringtones from the songs in my iTunes music library.  What would be the easiest way to go about doing that? The guides I've read always end up confusing me.
