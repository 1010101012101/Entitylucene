Mystery OS X Install program keeps running <body> I am regularly getting an error message from a program that purports to be an OS X Install program.  I have no idea how this is starting, or where it is from, but it appears after reboots too, and I don't like it.  I'm running the El Capitan 10.11 Beta (15A278b), so there is a possibility it's connected to that.  After trying to update some other apps from the MAS, I get an error message which indicates it's a Yosemite Beta Installer.  Anyone know where this can come from, and how I can stop it?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/r5dzK.png" alt="enter image description here" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kT0Ky.png" alt="enter image description here" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uYKZh.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment271328> Have you tried just deleting the installer?... <comment271332> Exact duplicate, except it doesn't show in my MAS. I'll mark as duplicate when I'm not using the iOS app
