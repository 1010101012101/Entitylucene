Unable to unlock screen if QuickTime was the last app open in fullscreen view <body> I noticed that if I leave QuickTime open in fullscreen and then my screen is locked, I have no way to unlock it:  ul liScreen is completely black but for the mouse cursor./li liI can move the mouse across the screen and the attached external monitor./li liBoth the external keyboard and the laptop one have no other effect than to make the system beep by each keystroke./li /ul  Is there a better way than to force power off the machine to unlock it?  <answer224844> command+option+esc, than force quit QT Player  <comment272692> Had similar issues until I updated my OS to 10.11.3. Tried updating the OS and regular disk aid trick ?
