How can I disable horizontal scrolling when shift is held? <body> I have programs which require shift to be held down, while scrolling, to activate certain functionality I deem essential. As of right now, I can only use these programs with my trackpad because any mouse, even if it has native side scrolling capabilities, will automatically switch to horizontal scroll mode. Is there any way to disable this completely? I rarely use horizontal scrolling and if I ever need to, I have arrow keys for it.  I would assume there is some hidden preference I can disable with Terminal, but I don't know what it would be called.  Thanks for any help!
