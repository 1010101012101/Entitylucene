Use both Delete and Backspace in Macbook <body> kbdDelete/kbd key in my MacBook Pro works as kbdbackspace/kbd in other Windows keyboards and kbdFn/kbd + kbdDelete/kbd works as 'delete forward' as an ordinary kbddelete/kbd key in Windows keyboard.  How can I change the keyboard setting so that I can use both 'delete forward' and 'delete backward' using only one key-in?  For example, kbdEject CD/kbd key is rarely used, so I'd like to use this key as 'delete forward' key and kbdFn/kbd+kbdEject CD/kbd for ejecting  CD. Can I do something like this?  <answer82028> You can use KeyRemap4MacBook to remap the eject key to forward delete.  Partway down this List of Prepared Settings are details under "Change Eject Key."  <answer94996> KeyRemap4Macbook is great, but it has way too much configurability and not very much documentation. I found this other tutorial that lets me play around with the default keymapping in code~/Library/KeyBindings/DefaultKeyBinding.dict/code. This is both fast, and keyboard specific; which works very well for me  <comment111440> Eject keys also have a small delay by default, but it can be removed with [NoEjectDelay](https://pqrs.org/macosx/keyremap4macbook/noejectdelay.html.en).
