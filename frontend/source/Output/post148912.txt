Install CA from Command Line? <body> I run a small PKI at my house. There's not much too it - a CA, a few servers and a client certificate on occasion.   I'm looking for a way to install my CA on my iOS devices from the command line. Search results have not turned up anything useful.  I'm fairly certain it can be done using the usbmux protocol because tools like iPhone Configurator can do it.  How do I install my CA from the command line?
