How can I tell what version of Recovery HD OS is running while I'm booted to the recovery software? <body> How can I tell the version of OS X (and the build) that runs on Recovery HD while I'm running in that mode? The Apple menu has no "About" menu that shows that information when you're running normally.  <answer217602> The easiest command is to use Terminal - it's under the Utilities menu - and type the codesw_vers/code command:  precodesw_vers /code/pre  The output will be the version and build that runs when you boot to Recovery which can be different than the version installed on your main bootable OS X partition.
