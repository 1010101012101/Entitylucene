How can I remap the left keypad keys of a Kinesis Freestyle keyboard on macOS Sierra? <body> I have a PC version of the USB Kinesis Freestyle keyboard. It've used these keyboards for years with my Macs and they work very well for me, but I have never used the block of keys along the left-hand side.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/chojl.png" alt="enter image description here"  The kbdback/kbd/kbdfwd/kbd keys in particular would be ripe for use to control iTunes, but the problem is that pressing them generates kbd⌘/kbd-kbdarrow/kbd key sequences, and remapping kbd⌘/kbd-kbdarrow/kbd sequences would cause problems in applications that use kbd⌘/kbd-kbdarrow/kbd keys for editing functions.   Is there a way to change the character sequence that the Kinesis keyboard generates?  <comment374190> Have a look at this [answer](https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/284034/119271).  It's about programming mouse buttons, but the software should be able to reprogram the extra keys.
