To install Blockdev in OSX? <body> I did not find the command in Brew of Yosemite 10.10.3.  I am reading the command developed from here:  precodepv -s $(blockdev â€“getsize64 /Users/masi/Dropbox/1/r3.raw) /code/pre  I think codeblockdev/code is Linux specific command at the moment and not existing directly in OSX.   How can you install Blockdev in OSX?  <answer194988> If you want to get the size of a mounted block device (which is what codeblockdev -getsize64/code does), you can use the following:  precodediskutil information &lt;device&gt; | grep "Total Size" | sed -e 's/[^(]*(([^Bytes)]*\).*/\1/' /code/pre  If you want to do the same for a file, you can use the following (amongst many others):  precodestat -f '%z' &lt;filename&gt; /code/pre
