DVD Player no longer works after El Capitan upgrade <body> After installing El Capitan on my Macbook Pro, I can no longer play DVD's (on my LG  Blu-ray player). I called up LG and they assure me this is a problem with my Mac, and that they are compatible with El Capitan. I called up Apple and they  said LG Blu-ray was not compatible. I called LG again, and they told me it definitely is, and had me return the player. They sent me a new one, and of course it had the same issue.  The issue is that it just freezes, spins in a never ending progress wheel.  Is there any hope for my LG player? Or should I just cave and bounce for a new Apple brand DVD player. (I never use the Blu Ray feature, I only play DVD's)
