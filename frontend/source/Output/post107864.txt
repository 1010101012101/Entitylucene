What are the Manual settings for Internet sharing between 10.9 and 10.7? <body> I have a system with OSX 10.9, and another system with OSX 10.7.5. I am trying to setup internet sharing between the from 10.9 to 10.7.  10.9 has internet through WiFi, and I used a LAN cable to connect it to 10.7 system. If I use DHCP for settings, here are the IP addresses I get.  precode10.7 (client)  Ethernet: IP Address: 192.168.2.3 subnet mask: 255.255.255.0 Router: 192.168.2.1 DNS Server: 192.168.2.1  10.9 (Host)  WiFi: IP Address: 192.168.0.5 subnet mask: 255.255.255.0 Router: 192.168.0.1 DNS Server: 209.18.47.61/209.18.47.62  Ethernet: IP Address: 169.254.32.154 Subnet mask: 255.255.0.0 Router: &lt;blank&gt; DNS Server: &lt;blank&gt; /code/pre  I remember facing the same issue few years back, and I resolved it by setting it manually. But I can't figure out what are the correct settings, Can someone please help me, it's really urgent!!  EDIT: I tried setting both of them manually (ethernet addresses) to:  precode10.7(client)  IP Address: 192.168.2.3 subnet: 255.255.255.0 router: 192.168.2.1  10.9(host) IP Address: 192.168.2.1 subnet: 255.255.255.0 router: 192.168.0.1 /code/pre  doesn't work either!  <answer108426> Your manual set up should work if you configure the 10.9 host to use:  precodeIP address: 192.168.2.2 router: 192.168.2.1 /code/pre  Set the DNS to 192.168.2.1 as well.
