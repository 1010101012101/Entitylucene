Terminal command to enable write to remote NFTS drive <body> Can the emdrivename/em be "Seagate Backup Plus Drive" in the Terminal command code... label= drivename none ntfs rw,auto,nobrowse/code or will the spaces create errors in Terminal?  <answer220921> If you use quotes in the command the spaces shouldn't create errors. Using  precode... label="Seagate Backup Plus Drive" none ntfs rw,auto,nobrowse /code/pre  should interpret the name as emSeagate Backup Plus Drive/em and  precode... label=Seagate Backup Plus Drive none ntfs rw,auto,nobrowse /code/pre  will interpret the name as emSeagate/em.  The better solution is to rename the volume to one word without spaces or use an escape sequence like in this answer.  <answer220922> You need to escape the spaces with code\040/code, so it would be as in the following example:  precodeLABEL=Seagate\040Backup\040Plus\040Drive none ntfs rw,auto,nobrowse /code/pre  See "EXAMPLES" in codeman fstab/code from a Terminal.  <comment267448> You do not necessarily need to rename the volume as the proper way is to escape the spaces with `\040` not quote the label.  See the man page for fstab.  Last time I tried quoting the name of the volume it didn't work. <comment267450> @user3439894 I don't like to type escape sequences in scripts or in the command line. I already linked your answer in my answer.
