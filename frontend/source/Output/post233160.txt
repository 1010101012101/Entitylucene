How to get rid of my spamming notification? <body> The DivX player has installed a junk notification on my Mac saying:     A new version of DivX is available.   as shown below:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2hW4N.png" alt="A new version of DivX is available - Update Now / What&#39;s New"  This stupid notification bumps up every hour or so, and there is no way to turn it off (there's no disable option when I click on it's icon). I don't want and don't need their software. I can't see the player in my emNotification panel/em.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Sb28z.png" alt="enter image description here"  strongQuestion:/strong How to prevent DivX from spamming me with notifications?   <answer233490> h1Removing DivX and DivXUpdate/h1  If you'd like to remove the DivX app along with its DivXUpdate, you need to uninstall the software.  h2Uninstaller/h2  Uninstaller you can find in code/Applications/DivX/code folder and run codeUninstall DivX for Mac.app/code.  h2Manual Removal/h2  If above folder and uninstaller doesn't exist, just remove:  precode/Library/Application Support/DivX/DivXUpdate.app /code/pre  To remove the associated codelaunchd/code services, check first which one are registered by this Terminal command:  precodelaunchctl list | grep divx /code/pre  Then codedisable/code or coderemove/code them. The following two commands will remove the jobs:  precodelaunchctl remove com.divx.update.agent launchctl remove com.divx.dms.agent /code/pre  After you may consider removing these service files from code/Library/LaunchAgents/code (called codedivx/code).  precodesudo rm /Library/LaunchAgents/com.divx.update.agent.plist # For Update sudo rm /Library/LaunchAgents/com.divx.dms.agent.plist # For DivXMediaServer /code/pre  h2Killing notification popup/h2  Then kill the annoying update app, type this command in Terminal:  precodekillall DivXUpdate /code/pre  <comment284979> Updating is an option? Or don't you need Divx? <comment284980> @Rob I don't have the software. I removed it. I don't want to install a new version because I don't need it. DivX is spamming old users to improve their market share.
