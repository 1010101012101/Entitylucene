One key seems unresponsive and then takes effect after a very long, unpredictable delay. How do I fix this? <body> One of the letter keys is not working. When I press it nothing happens at first. Then, long after I have finished typing the following words the letter randomly appears (usually 10s of times in a row). This problem initially occurred with the inbuilt keyboard of my MacBook Pro. I worked around it with external keyboards. Initially this worked but after a few weeks I am now experiencing the same problem with the external keyboards. What is going on and how can I fix this? My OS is OS X El Capitan 10.11.3.
