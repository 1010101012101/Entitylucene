Disable guest access to USB Mass storage device 10.11 <body> I am currently doing a theatre production and running Qlab for sound and lighting cues. I have setup a new user account for people other than me to access Qlab, which is fine. The problem I have is the folder with the music needs to be accessed by Qlab to work correctly. I do not want anybody to be able to copy those files to an external device when I'm not around. Double edged sword, I know!!! I found a tutorial for disabling usb mass storage access in previous ios versions, but it seems more difficult in 10.11. Does anybody know if this is even possible anymore? The guy i'm suspicious of is a bit of a mac nerd so I need to be proactive!
