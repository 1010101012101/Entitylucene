Translate shell script not working within Automator <body> I have this code to translate a word from/to English/Spanish:  precodeS=`/usr/local/bin/trans -b -id -no-ansi "$a" | grep Code | awk '{print $2}'` if [ "$S" = "en" ]; then T=es; else T=en; fi /usr/local/bin/trans -b :"$T" "$a" /code/pre  (codetrans/code is from https://github.com/soimort/translate-shell/)  Running the script straight in Terminal (bash) works great.  But when I try to use it in Automator, I get this error:  code/usr/local/bin/trans: line 5073: gawk: command not found/code  Running codegawk/code in Terminal also works fine.  hr  strongUPDATE/strong: Thanks to solver below, final working script for automator is:  precodePATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin S=`/usr/local/bin/trans -b -id -no-ansi "$@" | grep Code | awk '{print $2}'` if [ "$S" = "en" ]; then T=es; else T=en; fi /usr/local/bin/trans -b :"$T" "$@" /code/pre  <answer270558> The default codePATH/code passed to the Run Shell Script emaction/em in Automator is:   precode/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin /code/pre  I always add a codePATH=.../code, where code.../code is the actual codePATH/code used in Terminal, to the top of the Run Shell Script emaction/em in Automator.  Or you have to add the fully qualified pathname of any executable to the command line that is not in the default codePATH/code passed to the Run Shell Script emaction/em in Automator.  hr  The last line in the codetrans/code emscript/em is codegawk -f &lt;(echo -E "$TRANS_PROGRAM") - "$@"/code and unless codegawk/code is in the default codePATH/code passed you'll need to add the location of codegawk/code to the codePATH/code you pass to the Run Shell Script emaction/em in Automator, or add the fully qualified pathname to the codegawk/code command at the end of the codetrans/code emscript/em.  In Terminal use codewhich gawk/code to get its path, e.g.:  precodewhich gawk /usr/local/bin/gawk /code/pre  In codetrans/code, change:  precodegawk -f &lt;(echo -E "$TRANS_PROGRAM") - "$@" /code/pre  To:  precode/usr/local/bin/gawk -f &lt;(echo -E "$TRANS_PROGRAM") - "$@" /code/pre  Or in the Run Shell Script emaction/em in Automator, e.g.:  precodePATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin /code/pre  Or use the codePATH/code from the output of codeecho $PATH/code in Terminal.  <comment340018> Fantastic! Thanks! Tried to fix your typo `which gwak` but site won't let me change less than 6 characters. <comment340020> @Ze'ev Haven't had coffee yet this morning, I fixed it, thanks. <comment343377> The [useless use of `grep`](http://www.iki.fi/era/unix/award.html) is easy to fix; replace `grep x | awk '{y}'` with `awk '/x/ {y}'`
