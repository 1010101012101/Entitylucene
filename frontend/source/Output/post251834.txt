How to monitor LAN traffic <body> We have a 10+ devices/PCs (phones, Apple Macs, Windows, NAS) Ethernet / Wi-Fi LAN that I have to monitor and admin.   I would like to find a software tool (better if on Mac OS) that enables me to monitor the traffic generated by each single device/PC.  The LAN/Internet traffic seems to be high, I'd like to know if it's a local problem (high bandwidth requirement from single users) or slow internet connection (an ISP problem).  <comment313113> Do you want the monitor to be installed on each device or placed on a single device in the network (like a firewall) that would monitor the other devices? <comment313115> Typically this type of measurement takes place on the network switch. How are these devices connecting to the Internet – through a router/switch/hub ? <comment313181> Would create a DNS server, get it to log. <comment313515> I'm no tech IT guy, but ideally I'd like to monitor the LAN from my laptop. I don't know how can I setup a DNS server. The LAN is connected to the internet thru a network switch + wifi/ethernet modem. Thanks for the inputs!
