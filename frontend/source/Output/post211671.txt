-bash: 1: command not found - Immediately on loading Terminal <body> Upon loading my terminal (since trying to install composer globally) I'm being spammed with countless amounts of -bash: 1: command not found before I even type any commands.  I'm not quite sure what to do, but this is all that happens, I load up terminal and get;  precode-bash: 1: command not found -bash: 1: command not found -bash: 1: command not found -bash: 1: command not found /code/pre  for an unlimited amount of times until I close the terminal.  Can anyone help me fix the issue, or reset my terminal, or anything?  hr  Update:  Trying to run coderm -i ~/.profile ~/zsh* ~/.bash*/code like advised in the comments I got the below:  precode-rm: ~/.profile: No such file or directory -rm: ~/zsh*: No such file or directory -rm: ~/.bash*: No such file or directory /code/pre  I still get the strongemcommand not found/em/strong error.  <comment255511> What is in the bash startup files? <comment255512> depends on your startup files, try running `rm -i ~/.profile ~/zsh* ~/.bash*` see if it fixes the problem. <comment255540> I'm going to put a hold on this. Let's see if the linked question gets you a resolution. <comment255542> Specifically, the answer on http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/208425/5472 about not editing or deleting anything. Just focus on fixing $PATH right now in one terminal. Once you have a sane cling the dot files or deleting them can happen to fix the root cause.
