Time Machine only has files from today <body> I have been using Time Machine to back up my school folders, on a My Passport, for 2 years now, I have never needed to restore files until now.  I opened it today to only find files from today. It says I have some 240ish GB used already, but I cant view anything older than today. I know I should have some PSD and CSW files on it.  <answer295370> You need to use the Time Machine app to browse your Time Machine disk rather than looking through the disk with Finder.  ol liNavigate to the folder where the files/folders are missing in Finder./li liOpen Time Machine.app./li liSelect the files/folders to restore and click Restore./li /ol  <comment372112> You are using the TimeMachine app to browse to your files or Finder? <comment372119> What size is your internal HD & your backup HD?
