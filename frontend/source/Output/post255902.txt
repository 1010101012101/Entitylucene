Which countries can receive payments from Apple? <body> I'm from Costa Rica and I don't know if I can use In App Purchases in the iOS apps I'm developing. Does Apple have a list of countries for which this functionality is available?  <answer255905> In-App Purchases are the same as the sale of an app, from the perspective of where they can be made available.  Apple has a list: App Store Territories  <comment318917> If you're a registered iOS developer, Apple has more documentation about app purchases and IAP's than you can ever read. Look thru the Apple Developer sites, all the info is there.
