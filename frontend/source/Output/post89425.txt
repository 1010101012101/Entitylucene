How do I use Spotlight to find all MP3 that are encoded at 320 kbps? <body> In order to save more space on my music collection, I want to use XLD to convert all my CBR (constant bit rate) 320 kbps MP3 to VBR (variable bit rate).  How do I use Spotlight to find all 320 kbps MP3 in a particular folder so that I can select all of them and open (and thus convert) in XLD?  emPS/em  It was easy to find all Flac files since I just typed in code.flac/code.  Obviously I can use iTunes to get a list of all songs that are 320 kbps MP3 but I can't open them from there.  <answer89427> ol liOpen up Finder and use the Spotlight/Search on the top right of the window./li liType .mp3 in the search bar and Finder will suggest you things like Filenames (Name matches: .mp3), Kinds (MP3 Audio), Downloaded from (...)/li liSelect MP3 Audio type under Kinds section in the suggestion popup./li liThere is a secondary toolbar which appears below the main Finder toolbar and above the search results, which has options like Search (This Mac) (User home) (Shared)  Save button  (on right side) and + icon/li liClick on the Plus icon in the right most corner of this toolbar. This will give you a list of filters/attributes that you can apply to current search. For eg. Kind, filesize, created date etc/li liFrom the filter type menu choose "Other..." and enable "Audio bit rate" attribute./li liNow select the newly enabled "Audio bit rate" attribute with equals condition and enter 320000 as the value./li /ol  You will see a list of files which are encoded with 320kbps bit rate.  To see files with 128kbps change the value to 128000  <answer89441> Using mdfind:  precodemdfind 'kMDItemFSName=*.mp3&amp;&amp;kMDItemAudioBitRate=320000' /code/pre  Or the search syntax:  precodekind:"mp3 audio" AND bitrate:32000 /code/pre  See https://superuser.com/questions/51122/how-to-search-with-spotlight-more-effectively.  <comment104970> and http://blog.superuser.com/2011/06/03/digging-deeper-mastering-spotlight-in-os-x/ as well <comment105010> This "Audio bit rate" seems very buggy. I noticed that as soon as I start typing any number, it would remove some songs automatically. One particular song that Spotlight filtered out when I typed (bit rate greater than 3) had a bit rate of 192 kbps on iTunes. Also typing 320000 or even greater than 300000 doesn't show any of the 320 kbps mp3. <comment105012> `mdfind 'kMDItemFSName=*.mp3&&kMDItemAudioBitRate=320000'` seems to work perfectly but how would I open all those files specifically in XLD from the Terminal? <comment105017> I got kind of close with something like `mdfind 'kMDItemFSName=*.mp3&&kMDItemAudioBitRate=320000' | grep '/ORGANIZED' | xargs -0 open -a XLD`. But that didn't work. <comment105150> Replace the xargs command with this: `while IFS= read -r f; do open "$f" -a XLD; done`. <comment105442> Some unsolicited advice - [Transcoding lossy audio](http://goo.gl/hufNf) is [never recommended](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_loss). Anecdotally, LAME MP3 encoding is anywhere from 50-70% lossy (I could find no definitive source to cite for this, but these numbers seem to be frequently referenced on music & torrent forums), which means that your conversion from 320CBR to V0 could potentially inflict an additional 50-70% loss of quality. All this for files that are 10-25% smaller. Consider using an app like [TuneSpan](http://goo.gl/N8m06) to free up space on your startup disk.
