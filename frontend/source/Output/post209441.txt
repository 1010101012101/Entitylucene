/System/Library/LaunchAgents is locked in El Capitan <body> I'm trying to achieve this: Make my password protected SSH key expire or timeout after a while  In Yosemite, this worked fantastic, in El Capitan, using sudo, the files in /System/Libary/LaunchAgents is completely locked :( I cannot chmod, write, or chown the files.  Using Finder - Get info, the locked checkbox is disabled for the folder and the files in it (changing owner using finder doesn't work too).  <answer209445> In my case, it was the new System Integrity Protection feature in El Capitan. I disabled that in recovery mode using this link :  ol liBoot into recovery mode/li liClick Utilities at the top, and then Terminal/li liType in codecsrutil disable/code/li /ol  <answer209452> El Capitan adds a new security feature named System Integrity Protection (SIP). Among other things, SIP prevents parties other than Apple from adding, deleting or modifying directories and files stored in certain directories:  precode/bin /sbin /usr /System /code/pre  Apple has indicated that the following directories are available for developers to access:  precode/usr/local /Applications /Library ~/Library /code/pre  All directories in code/usr/code except for code/usr/local/code are protected by SIP.  <comment252646> have you tried to modify the files in single user mode ? <comment252693> @maetsoh Why single user mode? I would just try logging in as root. <comment252694> Ugh. How annoying. Apples penchant for locking everything down is really starting to get old. <comment252778> @tjt263 It's intended to save normal users from themselves. SIP can be turned off if you're willing to accept the lowered security. <comment252902> If you're just making a quick fix like this, all you need is to either boot another OS that doesn't use SIP (ie Yosemite or any non Apple OS), or disable in recovery, do your thing, then enable again. Edits do persist even when turned back on.
