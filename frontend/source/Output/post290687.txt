Is there supervision consistency between Apple Configurator and AC2? <body> I have many iPads that are being supervised on Apple Configurator 1.7.1 and the Yosemite OS. We need to start supporting the Mini 4 iPad, and it looks like that requires an upgrade to Apple Configurator 2 (which in turn requires an upgrade from Yosemite). So, if I upgrade from Yosemite to Sierra, and from Apple Configurator to AC2, will all of my currently supervised devices still be supervised and functional? Thanks!
