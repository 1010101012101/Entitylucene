How to touch one place but have the touch count in another place? <body> I want to simulate touch on my jailbroken iPhone 6s. For example, if I touch in the middle of the screen, it will count as I touch the screen bottom. I mean we assign a certain place to simulate tap another desired place, and when we tap that certain place, the phone considers that we tap the desired place.  I know about gesture but I need 4-5 of them at the same time. Is there a way/tweak to do that?  <comment348828> Are you talking about development code to simulate touches on different parts of the screen?
