How to show width and height of image files in Finder's column view? <body> Is there any way to view the width and height of image type files in Finder's column view?  strongI am runnning Snow Leopard./strong  There isn't a checkbox for dimension in the Finder's view options:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/SbSZ1.png" alt=""  <answer52271> strongIcon View/strong and strongColumn View/strong  Pressing kbdCommand/kbd+kbdJ/kbd or emRight Clicking/em, while in the folder where the pictures are, will show the emOptions/em menú. Then strongShow View Options/strong, and enable strongShow Item Info/strong. This will show the image's dimensions below the file.  You could press emUse as Default/em, if, well, you want it to be default.  strongList View/strong  While in strongList view/strong , by emRight Clicking/em the list's title bar, you'll be able to choose extra information columns to show. As Koiyu explains here:     The list of extra columns is relative to the folder's location. In order to get the dimensions available, the folder in question has to reside somewhere under ~/Pictures/. (Under ~/Music/ you could choose e.g. artist or album and under ~/Movies/ you could choose length or codecs and so on…)   <answer52272> The information panels (⌘I) should also show the dimensions for most image files.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/AGIrB.png" alt=""  <answer97820> Try changing to List View (Cmd + 2) and then back to Column View (Cmd + 3). This helps me, sometimes there's just "–" but this fiddle brings numbers back.  <answer238631> Much better is cmd+alt+i and move on all files for quick view dimesnions.  <comment59803> this is what I usually do but it is time wasting though. <comment59804> This is exactly what I need: show the Dimension column in the finder using list view. What you say only work in Icon view, I need to have the rest of columns, then I need to use List view. <comment59806> Edited the answer to match you needs. <comment59809> I moved a image file under Picture but I the 'dimension' column is not visible yet. Look the capture I upload at the bottom of my question. <comment59813> Apparently the List View thing will only work for Lion. The Column and List view, though, should work on Snow Leopard. <comment59822> Sorry, I couldn't see the picture before. It shows that you are doing Cmd+J, but have you tried Right Clicking the list's bar? If you click, it will show more options. To make it clear, I mean Right Clicking on "Kind", for instance. <comment59832> Nothing happens if I right-click the list bar. I guess it is a lion feature <comment59835> Was pretty sure about it, but better safe than sorry. I'll keep searching. <comment255867> works for me on later versions of osx (2015)
