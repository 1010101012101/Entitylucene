Have Automator folder action pass a list of files to AppleScript <body> I need to pass to a .jsx script (a Photoshop script written in JavaScript) a list of image files as arguments when they are added to a folder. According to the Adobe documentation, you can call a .jsx in the following way:  precodetell application "Adobe Photoshop CS6"     do javascript (file "/path/myPhotoshopScritp.jsx") Â¬         with arguments { "path/image1.jpg","path/image3.jpg","path/image4.jpg" } end tell /code/pre  I know that when a folder action workflow is triggered, the items that were added to the attached folder are passed to the workflow. But I have problems in referencing these items from AppleScript and dynamically compose the array you see in the last part of the script:  precode"path/image1.jpg","path/image3.jpg","path/image4.jpg" /code/pre  I imagine it's a simple task, but AppleScript is not intuitive for me.  <answer151427>  Use a coderun/code handler:  pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"codeon run {input, parameters}     input end run /code/pre  Or if you need the input as a list of POSIX paths:  pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"codeon run {input, parameters}     set l to {}     repeat with f in input         set end of l to POSIX path of f     end repeat end run /code/pre  For a script saved directly in code/Library/Scripts/Folder Action Scripts//code, use an codeadding folder items/code handler:  pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"codeon adding folder items to this_folder after receiving added_items     added_items end addin /code/pre
