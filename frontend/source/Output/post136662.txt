How can I set separate exlude lists for Spotlight with 2 OSX installs? <body> I have two OSX installs on the same SSD, and when I switch from one to the other, I keep getting hits from the other volume for my Spotlight searches. I solved this by adding the other volume to Spotlight's exclude list in System Preferences - Spotlight - Privacy, but for some reason this also adds the volume to the other install's exclusion list. I assume this is because the exclusion adds a .noindex file to the volume.  Is there a way to make this install-specific?  Note that both volumes are FileVault2 volumes, so I need to enter a password to unlock the other volume. This means simple boot scripts to remove the .noindex file are out of the question.
