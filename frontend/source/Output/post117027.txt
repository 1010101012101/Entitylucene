The Arrow in pop up menu has gone and icons in the menu bar on the top of the screen disappear after clicking <body> Could anybody tells me how to solve this problem? It's very frustrating to see this from time to time in my laptop. I was trying to post a question on Apple Community, and I don't know why their website won't let me do so.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nktgH.png" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/oM46j.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment137112> I'm voting for a disk/file permission issue. And OSX doesn't have permission to access the file/image (hopefully not somehow deleted) So use Disk Util to repair and verify your drive. <comment137207> @BarryCarlyon it doesn't work. But thanks.
