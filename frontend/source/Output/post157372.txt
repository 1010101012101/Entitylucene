Automount NFS shared home directories and other shares <body> I have a problem with autofs on mac. I made some shares:  codeauto_home/code:  precode*   -fstype=nfs,rw  roskilde:/space/home/&amp; /code/pre  codeauto_remote/code:  precodepublic  -fstype=nfs,rw  roskilde:/space/public mosek   -fstype=nfs,rw  roskilde:/space/mosek vmware  -fstype=nfs,rw  roskilde:/space/vmware /code/pre  codeauto_master/code:  precode+auto_master        # Use directory service /net            -hosts      -nobrowse,hidefromfinder,nosuid /home           auto_home    /remote         auto_remote /Network/Servers    -fstab /-          -static /code/pre  so the problem is this. The shares mount fine, I think, but the problem is that everything mount with permissions like this:  precodedr-xr-xr-x  2 root  wheel  1 Nov 20 14:30 andrea dr-xr-xr-x  2 root  wheel  1 Nov 20 14:30 eda dr-xr-xr-x  2 root  wheel  1 Nov 20 14:30 hap dr-xr-xr-x  2 root  wheel  1 Nov 20 14:30 joachim dr-xr-xr-x  2 root  wheel  1 Nov 20 14:30 ruben dr-xr-xr-x  2 root  wheel  1 Nov 20 14:30 sandvik dr-xr-xr-x  2 root  wheel  1 Nov 20 14:30 tomas dr-xr-xr-x  2 root  wheel  1 Nov 20 14:30 ulfw /code/pre  where the owner should be codeusername:users/code  when I try logging into the server:  precode$ ssh tomas@lyngby Password: Could not chdir to home directory /home/tomas: Operation not permitted -bash: /home/tomas/.bash_profile: Operation not permitted lyngby:/ tomas$ cd /home/tomas/ -bash: cd: /home/tomas/: Operation not permitted /code/pre  What causes this, and how do I fix it?  <answer158194> I found out that the problem was very simple to fix. Just add the resvport option to all the mounting point, and if works like a charm   <comment185022> I've never worked with this on the Mac side, but presuming that it functions similarly to `fstab`, your mount instruction parameters have to specify ownership and permissions if you want that functionality. Otherwise, mount points will always be owned by `root` as the `automount` process is run through it. <comment185863> in `fstab` how do you specify the ownership and permissions of a mount? `fstab` and `automount` are very similar, so maybe I can use the info <comment185891> I would start reading here https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Darwin/Reference/Manpages/man5/auto_master.5.html in conjunction with Google searching to construct your mounts with correct permissions. Also you might have to check the system you're mounting the directories from to see if it will allow NFS exports.
