Removing previously installed PHP extension <body> I tried installing codephp70-intl/code &amp; codephp70-gmp/code, but the installation of both extensions failed. I don't have the time (nor the desire) to deal with this kind of issues right now so I removed them by running codebrew uninstall php70-intl/code &amp; codebrew uninstall php70-gmp/code. However if I try to use codephp/code (in any way, eg: codephp -v/code). I get the following errors:     Warning: PHP Startup: Unable to load dynamic library '/usr/local/opt/php70-gmp/gmp.so' - dlopen(/usr/local/opt/php70-gmp/gmp.so, 9): image not found in Unknown on line 0   PHP Warning:  PHP Startup: Unable to load dynamic library '/usr/local/opt/php70-intl/intl.so' - dlopen(/usr/local/opt/php70-intl/intl.so, 9): image not found in Unknown on line 0   How do I tell php|homebrew I have  removed them?  <comment372574> I would try a `brew cleanup` and then install php over top. Where exactly is your `php` binary that you run? <comment372577> I do not want to to install php again... I ran `brew cleanup`, nothing changed (except the freed up space). `php` is located in `/usr/bin/php` based on `which php`.
