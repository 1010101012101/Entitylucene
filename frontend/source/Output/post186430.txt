Apple Numbers program, weird thing with unix time code formula <body> Hi I have applied the unix time code formula  precode=(((A1/60)/60)/24)+DATE(1970,1,1)+(-5/24) /code/pre  And it works! But the result I get on my column only shows the date and not the time. Does anyone know how to fix this? I attached an image to show what happens.  Thanks for your time.

I want the timecode too not just the date to appear in the rows.   <answer186539> Numbers '09 has a drop-down menu to specify the way that the time is shown in a Date and Time cell format.  The default in this situation seems to be None, but you can change it, as I show in the screenshot.

I don't know where this setting is in that version, sorry.  One more thing: I think the last part of your formula code+(-5/24)/code is perhaps correcting for a local timezone difference from UTC.  I'm not sure, but you may need to change this when daylight savings time stops or starts: worth making a note to check this on that date.  <answer189221> @Ashley is correct.  For Numbers 3, Use the cell format to display the date and time the way you wish.  I pasted in your formula in the cell B2 below: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/TY7zm.png" alt="Date formating in Numbers 3" I hope this helps!  <comment224497> If any of the answers below solved your problem please mark as such so that others who look for a similar solution get help too.
