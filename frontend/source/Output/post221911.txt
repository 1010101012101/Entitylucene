Working with attachments **to** a PDF file in Preview <body> I've got a PDF that has something else (actually, another PDF) as an attachment. Like most Mac users I use Preview by default to view PDFs, and Preview gives no indication that I can find that there is an attachment, nor can I figure out how to access the attachment now that I know it's there. I was pretty confused until I tried Adobe Reader which immediately makes it clear that there is an attachment. Am I missing something here or is Preview essentially ignoring attachments?  <answer221914> Unfortunately Preview does not support or indicate PDF attachments in a PDF, or any file Preview can open. I suggest you continue to use Adobe Reader for Mac.  You can send your feedback about this to Apple here.  <comment268764> Preview is pretty *dumb* and does not recognize any "extra" feature which is recognized by other tools like Adobe. <comment268766> @Rob - Other way round reallyâ€¦ Adobe can do what they like with PDF & Apple has no obligation to keep up with their proprietary format. Google "The demise of Flash" for parallels.
