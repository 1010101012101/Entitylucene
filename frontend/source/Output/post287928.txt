Can't turn off auto-dimming? <body> I went to display settings on my Macbook Pro and deselected "Automatically adjust brightness."  In spite of this, my brightness is going absolutely haywire, going up and down literally constantly-- it never sits still at any point, for even 1 sec. My screen is like a low frequency strobe light. It's infuriating.  What is going on?
