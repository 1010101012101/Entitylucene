Logitech Unifying Receiver prevents MacBook Pro Trackpad from working <body> I have just connected a Logitech USB Unifying receiver to my MacBoo Pro 15". I've installed the Logitech Control Center software, and the mouse is functioning.  However, when plugging in the USB receiver, the native MacBook Pro trackpad stops working. This happens regardless of whether the mouse is connected or not.  I would like to use both the mouse and the trackpad at the same time. But this seems to be impossible since the receiver disables the trackpad. Is there a solution to Logitech's apparent strange (inadvertent?) decision to disable my trackpad?
