In Excel, how do you delete line breaks? <body> In Excel, how do you delete line breaks globally? It's totally messing up my text-to-column I need to do.  <answer176435> Here's a simple, non-Excel way to get rid of all the line breaks in your text:  Paste the data into TextEdit, put your cursor at the end of any line, then hold codeshift/code and press the right arrow once. This will select the invisible new line character. Now hit codecommand + c/code to copy this invisible character, and then got to  precodeEdit &gt; Find &gt; Find and Replace... /code/pre  and search for your copied character and replace it everywhere with just a codespace/code.  Now you shouldn't have any more line breaks in your text. :)  (On a side note, you don't need to replace with a codespace/code you can replace it with another symbol if that may be more convenient for what you're doing in Excel.)  <answer176598> strongA more Excel way:/strong  As line-break is CHAR(13), you could try something like this (assuming your text is in A1 and you'll put edited text in B1)   precodeB1: =SUBSTITUTE(A1,CHAR(13),"") /code/pre      or  precodeB1: =SUBSTITUTE(A1,CHAR(13)," ") /code/pre   Source: answers.microsoft.com  <answer217035> If there are only a few of them, select the cell, then click in the formula box.  This makes the formula box act like a text field, so the arrow keys and delete and other editing functions will work.  If there are many, use the replace method other posted.
