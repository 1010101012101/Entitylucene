How do you clone a drive encrypted with Filevault2? <body> Say I have drive A that is already encrypted with Filevault2.  I want to make an exact clone of the drive to a different drive B.  Every way I've tried so far decrypts drive A first, then clones, resulting in drive B being decrypted when the clone completes.  Is there a better way to clone drive A bit for bit?  I'm thinking of using codedd/code but was wondering if there was a more Apple friendly way.  The best way I've been able to figure out how to do this so far:  ol liBoot to a Lion install USB drive./li liOpen Disk Utility &amp; unlock the encrypted drive/li liFormat the new drive/li liRestore the encrypted volume on your new drive.  It will be unencrypted./li liClose disk utility &amp; open Terminal./li liIn Terminal, type "diskutil cs convert /Volumes/Macintosh\ HD/"./li liBoot up to the new drive, open System Preferences, &amp; re-enable encryption.  All previous settings should still be there./li /ol  I have not fully tested this method, but in theory it should work.  It's too many steps for my liking though.  I'd prefer one clone &amp; be done with it, somehow.  <answer32511> You could use the recovery option of Disk Utility:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DtGZG.png" alt="enter image description here"  This of course requires source and target disk to be identical, but the same restriction applies to codedd/code and similar tools.  strongUsual warnings concerning picking the right disk as source etc. apply!/strong  <comment37208> "Every way I've tried" would be what exactly? There is no reason in having people here proposing solutions you've already tried... <comment37281> The standard battery of methods:  Disk Utility w/ it's default options enabled, Carbon Copy Cloner, SuperDuper. <comment37282> Assume the destination disk is smaller.  Is that a problem for this method? <comment37287> Yes, as with dd etc.
