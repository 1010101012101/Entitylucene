How to burn Windows compatible CD on Mac OS X Mountain Lion <body> I burned a CD with pictures and PDFs on my Mac Pro but my Windows machine cannot read the CD. Should I have burned the disc differently to make it Windows-readable?  <answer71798> From http://support.apple.com/kb/PH10699?viewlocale=en_US (it applies to OS X 10.8 "Mountain Lion"):     You can burn files to a CD or DVD and then use that disc as a backup,   send it to friends, or copy the files on it to another computer.   strongDiscs you burn on your Mac computer can also be used on Windows computers/strong and other types of computers.   You just have to follow the instructions in there. If you prefer, you can read more detailed instructions here: http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/burn-cds-and-dvds-on-the-fly-in-mountain-lion.html  Both guides come down to this:  ol liInsert a blank CD. /li liWhen the disc appears on your desktop, double click it and drag the files you want to burn into the window./li liThen press the "Burn" button in the top right corner of the window, change disc name to something that makes sense to you and press kbdOK/kbd./li /ol  strongMake sure you choose a CD type that can be read on your Mac and your Windows machine. For instance, check that CD speed and capacity are supported by both optical drives./strong  If you wish to reuse a disc (CD-RW/DVD-RW/DVD+RW) you have to erase it first using emDisk Utility/em. See http://support.apple.com/kb/PH5849 for more information.  <comment73444> How do you burn CDs then? Using the Finder should result in a CD which is readable by more or less every OS out there. <comment73445> That's what I thought. And I used to do so on Snow Leopard. But in Mountain Lion, there are no burn folder in finder, all I can do is right click and files and burn them onto the CD. <comment73446> You can either burn a folder via right-click or create a burn folder via the menu. Both should create standard CDs
