Can I extend the iPhone's maximum ringtone duration? <body> I'm wondering if there is a way to extend the maximum duration of a custom ringtone i make for my iPhone past 30 seconds.  <answer5401>    I'm wondering if there is a way to extend the maximum duration of ringtones for my iPhone past 30 seconds.   iPhone ringtones strongcannot/strong be longer than 40 seconds.  <answer9093> It's not a carrier setting it's a phone setting. Max I've seen is 30 seconds but there may be a way to get around that. I think that the file format .m4r has to be cut down to 30 seconds to work with the iphone. Even when I made custom ones they had to be edited down to 30 seconds.  <answer10966> A custom ringtone can be up to 40 seconds - my custom ones are 38 seconds, and are made with iTunes - like this: http://artoftheiphone.com/2009/01/19/how-to-create-an-iphone-ringtone-using-itunes/  <answer61098> strongiOS 7 update:/strong the below procedure requires that you first install the ToneEnabler tweak, as Apple changed the way ringtones are loaded.  If your device is jailbroken:  ol liCreate your ringtone file (codeneroAacEnc -if ringtone.wav -of ringtone.m4r/code)./li liEstablish an SSH tunnel to your device (codeiphone_tunnel --iport 22 --lport 22/code)./li liConnect to your device using WinSCP or similar tool./li liBrowse to code/Library/Ringtones//code (there should be a bunch of code.m4r/code files in there)./li liDrag and drop your ringtone file in with the others./li liRe-open "Sounds" in your device's settings./li /ol  Your ringtone (of arbitrary length) should now be available to you.  strongNote:/strong Tested on iOS 5.1.1  <answer68667> This is a way to trick the iPhone (iOS 6.0) into making ringtones longer than the ~40 second maximum:  Note: This may now be a moot point since you can select songs for the default alarm, but the one advantage is it allows the phone to vibrate when it is a ringtone and the vibrate alert is enabled.      strongSummary:/strong Add a short 15sec strong.m4r/strong song to iTunes. Replace the source file with the full length .m4r version, then drag it from the Library to your iPhone. iTunes will be expecting the short version but will copy the whole thing without error.    hr  emstrongPrerequisites:/strong Create two .mp3 versions of the song. One the full length, the other a short version &lt;30sec./em  strongDetailed instructions:/strong  1) Create two folders. One with the full length version of the song. The other with a 15s version.  2) Add the short version to the iTunes Library via strongFileAdd File to Library/strong  3) Convert the short version to AAC, then search for it in Music. Once you find it, right click to strongShow in Windows Explorer/strong. Rename the file extension of the short song to strong.m4r/strong. Keep the Window Open.   4) Move the .m4r version to the short folder in Step 1.   5) Remove the AAC listings in the Music Library.   6) Repeat the AAC conversion for the full version, following Steps 3-5 while working from the full length folder. This is to prevent confusion. Use file size to help separate if needed.   6) From the short folder in Step 1, strongdrag the .m4r into the Library section in iTunes./strong   7) Rename the short .m4r file extension to .m4r_short  8) Copy the full length .m4r into the short directory.   9) From within the iTunes Library, strongopen Tones and then drag the song to your iPhone/strong. The entire full length song will copy without any errors.   <answer147034> Method that semtex41 mentioned still works on iOS 8.   On Mac (OS X) you can do this:  ol liCreate two folders, one for short and one for long/li liCreate two .m4r (.m4a, renamed) ringtones, one to each folder  ul liShort one must be LESS than 40 seconds/li /ul/li liGive both files same name/li liOpen iTunes and drag the strongshort/strong tone to tone library/li liClose iTunes/li liOpen strong/Music/iTunes/iTunes Media/Tones/strong/li liRename the ringtone from eg. tone.m4r to tone.m4r_short/li liCopypaste long version to Tones folder mentioned in 6, and make sure it has same name as short one had/li liOpen iTunes, the Ringtones (or Tones) sections shows, that your tone's length is same as the short one's but content is from the long one./li liConnect your iDevice, select Tones, select tones to sync, and click sync/li liDone!/li /ol  <comment5522> seriously? that seems really weird to me. <comment5523> oh.  I meant for a custom ringtone... <comment5524> Do non-custom ringtones play longer than 30 seconds? <comment11490> It is not a carrier settings. <comment11502> Phones generally don't even ring for more than 30 seconds. Why do you want to do this? <comment270287> Still works in iOS 9.2.1 if anyone is wondering. <comment370321> still works in iOS 10.3 <comment370322> it worked in iOS 10.3
