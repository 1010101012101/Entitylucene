How to add hidden user <body> How do I add a hidden administrator user to my Mac if possible? I don't want it to show up on the login screen.  <answer174436> Try this hint from Apple Support. There are distinct differences between Yosemite and all earlier OS X versions.  I'll copy/paste the Yosemite commands here so as not to offend the 'no solitary links in answers' demigods.  strongemQuoth Apple Support:/em/strong  strongHide a user account in OS X Yosemite/strong  You can prevent a user account from appearing in the login window in OS X Yosemite by using these steps:  ol liLog in as an admin user./li liUse this Terminal command, substituting the short account name name of the user you wish to hide for “hiddenuser”:  precodesudo dscl . create /Users/hiddenuser IsHidden 1 /code/pre/li /ol  If you later want to show the hidden user, set the user’s codeIsHidden/code attribute to 0 like this:  precodesudo dscl . create /Users/hiddenuser IsHidden 0 /code/pre  strongAdditional Options/strong  You can also move the hidden user's home directory to a place not visible from the Finder, and remove the hidden user's Public Folder share point.  The following command moves the home directory of "hiddenuser" to /var, a hidden directory:  precodesudo mv /Users/hiddenuser /var/hiddenuser /code/pre  The following command updates the user record of "hiddenuser" with the new home directory path in /var:  precodesudo dscl . -create /Users/hiddenuser NFSHomeDirectory /var/hiddenuser /code/pre  The following command removes the Public Folder share point for the user with the long name "Hidden User”:  precodesudo dscl . -delete "/SharePoints/Hidden User's Public Folder" /code/pre  strongLogging in to this hidden account/strong  To access this hidden admin account from the login screen, press the down arrow to select any user (make sure the password entry box is not open), then press kbdOpt-Return/kbd.  This will bring up the blank name and password fields, allowing you to sign into to the hidden admin account.  strongDisplay all users (including hidden)/strong  Remember that a hidden user can still be found, do not use this as a security measure. To show a list of all possible users, use codedscacheutil/code  precodedscacheutil -q user /code/pre  or to display all users in the 'Users' group (5**)  precodedscacheutil -q user | grep -A 3 -B 2 -e uid:\ 5'[0-9][0-9]' /code/pre  <comment205529> This is the correct OS X way to do it. <comment207715> Thank you for your additions.
