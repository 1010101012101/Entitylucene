How do I determine where a process is being started from, and disable it? <body> When I start OS X (Mavericks) and run codeps aux | grep postgres/code from Terminal, I have a process that was automatically started:  precodepostgres          132   0.0  0.1  2526456   7936   ??  Ss   10:04PM   0:00.07 /Library/PostgreSQL/9.2/bin/postmaster -D/Library/PostgreSQL/9.2/data /code/pre  This is a problem because I recently installed HomeBrew's version of Postgres and want that to be the postgres that is always running.  However, I can't figure out how to disable the old one (above) and it is driving me crazy! I've looked for launch agents in:   precode~/Library/LaunchAgents /Library/LaunchAgents /Library/LaunchDaemons /Library/StartupItems /System/Library/LaunchAgents /System/Library/LaunchDaemons /code/pre  and can't seem to find one matching the above... any ideas?  <answer128078> The related launchd job ticket was found in code/Library/LaunchDaemons/code.  Answering to mark question as successfully resolved.  <comment150023> Nevermind, found it in /Library/LaunchDaemons on a careful second look... those really seem to be all the possible places that startup processes load from.
