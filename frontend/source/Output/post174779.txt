Unable to run 'display notification' using osascript in a tmux session <body> If I run the following command in Apple Script Editor directly,   precodedisplay notification "Hello, world" /code/pre  I can see a  notification as expected  However if I tried to invoke it via command line:  precode osascript  -e 'display notification "Hello, world"' /code/pre  It turns out I am running it in a tmux session. If I just ran the command in my default shell, it works as expected.   How can I get it to work with tmux?  <answer192065> As @kopischke said, install or upgrade codereattach-to-user-namespace/code may solve this problem.  If your codereattach-to-user-namespace/code is old, notification works well after codebrew upgrade reattach-to-user-namespace/code.  <answer192644> Building on @snomof's answer, you'll want to install reattach-to-user-namespace through Homebrew or MacPorts and wrap the call to codeosascript/code:  precodereattach-to-user-namespace osascript  -e 'display notification "Hello, world"' /code/pre  <comment205931> The `osascript` line works fine for meâ€¦ <comment205963> Are you doing it over ssh? What version of OS X? <comment205996> I ran it in a tmux session. Apparently it did not work if I call it in a tmux session, but works fine in my default shell. Strange <comment206297> This might be caused by the same issue complicating tmux access to the OS X pasteboard.  See [here](https://github.com/ChrisJohnsen/tmux-MacOSX-pasteboard/blob/master/README.md) for details, and check if installing *reattach-to-user-namespace* (`brew install reattach-to-user-namespace` if you are running Homebrew) helps. <comment359509> And add the line to ~/.tmux.conf  set-option -g default-command "reattach-to-user-namespace -l zsh" <comment359510> And add the line to ~/.tmux.conf  set-option -g default-command "reattach-to-user-namespace -l zsh"
