To install GNU Cut in OSX? <body> I did not find it in brew by codebrew search cut/code.  I wound if it exists in any other package systems.   How can you install GNU Cut in OSX?   <answer191668> codecut/code is part of CoreUtils.   To install it :  precodebrew install coreutils /code/pre  Then it's available in terminal as codegcut/code.  <comment227674> How is then GNU cut presented in my system? By gcut? I do not want replace BSD commands. <comment227680> It won't replace the BSD commands. As you guessed, it will be accessible with gcut (if you have set the `$path` to work with brew packages). <comment255375> What do we need to do to set the path correctly? Could you please add to your answer? I haven't found a beginner-friendly step-by-step for installing `coreutils` on OS X (and even more difficult to find, a guide with El Capitan in mind). Do you have any references for that?
