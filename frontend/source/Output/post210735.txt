Is it possible to use old Wacom tablet on 10.11? <body> I have Wacom Graphire 3 a.k.a CT-630. This model is old Wacom tablet. So, it has no driver for 10.11.  Can I use this tablet on my Mac? Any solution?  <answer210737> I believe that I have the same tablet. I gave it to my niece whose computer was running 10.10.x. I believe that I simply browsed for the most current legacy driver that they was made for it here: http://us.wacom.com/en/support/legacy-drivers  If that doesn't work, I would try the next model of tablet after the one you have and its most current driver and keep moving to newer ones util it works.  I was able to get it working without issue. I'll check which driver I ended up using the next time is visit.  <answer211733> To get your tablet running in X.11 go back to the latest system you had your tablet installed and functioning.  In my case it was Mavericks.    There,   ol liConfigure the tablet settings to your taste./li liOpen 'Wacom Tablet Utility' and do a 'Backup...'.  This will generate a file (Preferences.wacomprefs). You can change the name, if you wish, for example: photoshop01.wacomprefs (don't change the extension!)/li liGo to EL Capitan, install your tablet with the original driver that came with it, open 'Wacom Tablet Utility' and do a 'Restore' with the preferences file created./li liIn my case (Graphite ET, the first model) it works.  If I need to change the functionality of the middle mouse button, I have to go back to Mavericks, change the settings, and repeat the whole process, but at least I have my tablet running./li /ol  Hope this helps you,  R  <answer212409> I have a Wacom Graphire 3 and El Capitan. Out of frustration I went back to my Mac scroll wheel mouse, which I set up with the preference pane that had all the options, scroll wheel, etc. To my surprise, the settings then worked with the Wacom tablet/mouse.  When I disconnected the Mac mouse, the preference pane reverted to the basic one, but the settings remained and I can use the Graphire as I did with Snow Leopard.  To change the settings I just reconnect the Mac mouse.  <answer213461> Graphire 4 CTE-640 and El Capitan OSX 10.11 here. I have been trying various solutions online all day but always had one of two errors: either got the "could not load Wacom Tablet preference pane," or got a preference pane that said "a supported tablet was not found on the system." Tried a ton of different things for about the past 4 hours, but finally found a driver that worked for me (btw, i kept getting a 404 error when trying to access the legacy driver linked above, not sure if wacom actually just took it down, or because it's a US site and I'm trying to access it from Japan). Anyway:  ol liunplug ur tablet, go to your applications folder and find the Bamboo/Wacom/Tablet folder and run the Bamboo/Wacom/Tablet utility to "Remove" "Tablet Software."/li lireboot/li lidownload and install "Driver 5.2.6-5(RC) for OS X 10.8, 10.7, 10.6 &amp; 10.5" which is named "PenTablet_5.2.6-5.dmg"  https://www.wacom.asia/en/driver-526-5rc-for-os-x-107-106-105/li liplug in your tablet, open the preferences and enjoy!/li /ol  This should work for Bamboo, Bamboo Comic,Bamboo Craft Pen &amp; Touch, Bamboo Fun Pen &amp; Touch, Bamboo Manga, Bamboo One, Bamboo Pen, Bamboo Pen &amp; Touch, Cintiq 17SX, DTF-510, DTF-720 / PL-720, DTU-710, Graphire Bluetooth, Graphire3, and Graphire4. I hope this works for you so you can celebrate as I just did; and you can be sure that I'm saving the dmg to avoid this frustration in the future.   <answer213749> The only way I got my old Wacom working on Yosemite or el Capitan is to configure settings in snow leopard (good old) and then copy settings from library/launchagents to new system. Find no way to manage settings in the new system.  <answer216817> I have a Bamboo CTH470 and it suddenly didn't work anymore in EL Capitain. So I installed the latest driver available... it said my tablet was not supported. So I installed on top the lastest available version for my tablet... and it worked as far I can use it as a mouse again (my main use). I didn't test other functions but it might work.  <answer224503> I was having the same issues trying to get my Intuos 2 working (I love this thing have had it for at least 10 years) and when I installed a fresh copy of El Capitan the preferences didn't work.  I do have a backup hard drive with my previous OS on there in which the Wacom preferences do still work.  If anyone is in desperate needs and has a large Intous 2 (10x12 or whatever the large size was at the time) I might be able to send you a custom Intous 2 preference file that was loaded easily into the Wacom utility in El Capitan.  But if you do have a backup restore drive you can boot that and save the preferences in the Wacom utility (not the Wacom preferences, just search for Wacom utility that is the only option that works on El Capitan as well).  <answer230234> On 1/30/15 wacom wrote me ..."Unfortunately your tablet is not compatible with your current Operating System (El Capitan OS X10.11.3) because it is already a legacy model. However, it would still be compatible with Windows 7, Vista or XP and Mac OS X v. 10.6, 10.5, 10.4 &amp; 10.3. You can also try checking out the latest model of your tablet which is Intuos Pro." .... So ... I guess...get an older computer or a newer tablet? Well... I just kept installing &amp; un-installing drivers until I found one that worked. Here it is http://www.wacom.com/en-us/support/faqs/legacy-tablet-driver-pages/what-is-the-latest-driver-for-the-intuos-gd-tablets Good luck  Daniel PS... just found the preference pane doesn't work. Maybe this trick will work  http://www.trackpadmagic.com/unrelated/75-wacom-preferences-and-os-x For now I'm happy.. I'll try this preference thing only if I have to.   <answer230875> I just downloaded the latest legacy driver from http://www.wacom.com/en-us/support/faqs/legacy-tablet-driver-pages/what-is-the-latest-driver-for-the-intuos-gd-tablets and my Intuos 2 is working pretty well with El Capitan. True - I can't load the preference pane but can't say I need to.   <answer232954> There is a way to use the legacy preference pane in El Capitan.  I am using a Wacom Intuos 2 6x8 (Model XD–0608-U) tablet with Mac OS X El Capitan 10.11.4.  After finding this page on Wacom's web site: http://www.wacom.com/en-us/support/faqs/legacy-tablet-driver-pages/what-is-the-lates-driver-for-the-intuos-2-xd-tablets I downloaded and installed the legacy driver.  When I try to open the preference pane normally, I get the message: "Could not load Wacom Tablet preference pane."  In order to access the preference pane, System Preferences needs to be opened in 32-bit mode.  Find System Preferences in your Applications folder. Highlight it and press cmd-I (Get Info) to get the Information box. Tick ‘Open in 32-bit mode’ (and low resolution if you have a retina display). Now you can open the Wacom Tablet preference panel in System Preferences. Set up your tablet. Then cmd-I again on System Preferences and turn off 32 bit mode.  Anytime you need to adjust preferences for the tablet, remember to switch System Prefs into 32-bit mode.  <answer235152> I read the above and tried something else which worked! (intuos3 elecaptian 10.11.4 Mac (24-inch Mid 2007).  Just choose another usb port! I disconnected intuos from keyboard usb port and reinserted usb lead into back of Imac. I guess it might be about sharing power or not having two input devices on same usb port? Dont know, but it worked for me, good luck to you guys.  <answer237308> Just sum up all that been said here and in this thread: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/6035388?tstart=0  h21.

I did not need to reboot after installing.  <answer244393> I have very old Intuos GD-0192-U graphics tablet. It's huge, but I'm used to it and don't want to buy a new one.   I upgraded to El Capitan from Yosemite and this is the only driver that works for me: WacomTablet_615-2.dmg if you can find it. (It also got me from Maverick to Yosemite). The current one (615-3) did not work. Luckily I always archive any .dmg file that works just in case.   <answer247101> I have an ancient Intuos GD-0608-U and I got it to work with El Capitan by installing this driver from Wacom: http://cdn.wacom.com/U/drivers/mac/pro/WacomTablet_6.2.0w4.dmg As the previous user stated the preferences don't work but the pen/stylus does work with default settings...  <comment254373> I have an even older [I think] Intuos, It still works as a 'surface' using the last released drivers, but you cannot use the control panel to set up advanced functionality <comment257690> Okay, so I got a little bit too excited that the pen mode was working correctly and the tablet was not just working as a mouse. I still can't reassign button values, but everything else seems to work, so i can live with this for now. <comment257691> Definitely celebrated too early. I rebooted my system and I'm back to "could not load Bamboo preference pane." It's still in pen mode, so it's not awful, but its ridiculous that after all this its still messed up. <comment273626> This link doesn't work anymore, does someone know where else to find this driver? <comment273627> Unfortunately this link doesn't work anymore. Does someone know where else to find this driver version? <comment301185> Thank you! Finally get my CTE-630 (Sapphire) working on OS X 10.11.5 with this link (http://www.trackpadmagic.com/unrelated/75-wacom-preferences-and-os-x) <comment305999> I'm afraid I get the same error with 32-bit & low resolution checked... on OSX 10.10 (915) <comment306000> Nice! I'm trying to install a driver for the CTF-420/G, but unfortunately I have had no luck so far... <comment306010> Correction: I got the CTF-420/G to work in tablet mode (not mouse mode) using these instructions: http://www.trackpadmagic.com/unrelated/75-wacom-preferences-and-os-x — unfortunately, the preference pane does not work (it says 'tablet not found' or something similar), but Ink gets activated, and the tablet works perfectly with pressure & buttons under Photoshop. <comment333908> This driver is still available from Wacom's Asia support site as of Dec 2016 and works with Sierra.  I was put on to this site by Wacom support, but you can find it by Googling "wacom asia legacy drivers".  My thanks to David for pointing me in the right direction! <comment335784> The System Preferences technique doesn't seem to work in macOS Sierra 10.12.2 either. <comment343976> Doesn't work in 10.12 anymore. <comment343987> Can't find a way to open Preferences Pane in 10.12. 32 bit compatibility mode doesn't help. <comment367683> Been trying to get my Intuos 2 to work on Sierra, Wacom support could not help but the trackpadmagic link technique worked perfectly with the 6.3.23 and 6.2.0w4 drivers, thank you! <comment367868> http://www.wacom.com/en/support/product-support/drivers prehaps
