Outlook for Mac 2011 alerts when approching inbox limit <body> I realize Outlook for Mac 2011 doesn't display inbox sizes, but is there a plug in that I can download that would display this and maybe alert the user when they are approaching their limit on the email server?  <comment372971> This is normally handled by the server - Exchange has this functionality built in.  What are you connecting to? <comment373145> Hi Allan, my account isn't Microsoft Exchange, unfortunately. The account is run by Direct Admin, which doesn't have this functionality built in, by the looks of it. <comment373146> I doubt you will find a plug in because checking your "mailbox quota" is something that the server will do as part of a service. <comment373148> Okay, thanks, Allan. I'll look into that.
