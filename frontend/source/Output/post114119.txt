Disable zoom animation in Chrome when going to full screen video <body> When switching back and forth between full-screen mode for YouTube videos in MacOX Mavericks, I find the zoom effect very annoying and jerky.  Is there a way to turn this off, so such videos can just snap in and out of full-screen without animation?  <answer114556> Yes, you can use Safari, there are no annoying effects while switching)  <answer119647> codechrome://flags/#enable-simplified-fullscreen/code; Enable it and restart chrome  <answer121475> I Have finally found the answer to this question after several month of painful slow fullscreen animations.  The problem is that I don't know exactly how I did because now that it has switched back to normal, i can't do it again. When you read your youtube video on chrome, you need to right click then go to HTML5 option or something of the sort the click "disable HTML5 and switch back to regular". The button was green for me, I tried it and all my problems were finally resolved. If someone can try and explain it better than me. Hope that will help.  <answer125933> After months of research this is how to disable the annoying animation that occurs on some videos on Youtube.  Delete the file called codeffmpegsumo.so/code in: code/Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/Versions/[your current version]/Google Chrome Framework.framework/Libaries/code.  And voil√†! Enjoy!  <comment134640> "Yes, you can use Windows" is as valid a response. <comment147413> I would recommend renaming instead of deleting (in case it breaks something else). <comment147457> i deleted it and been using chrome for two weeks now. Everything seems fine so far <comment178167> That useful option has been removed now unfortunately. Version 39.0.2171.27 beta (64-bit)
