Installation of Adobe Creative Suite 6 hangs at AdobeHelp on Mac OS X El Capitan <body> I have been attempting to install Adobe Creative Suite 6 Production Premium after upgrading to Mac OS X El Capitan.  The installation seems to go along flawlessly until it attempts to install "AdobeHelp". Running codeps -aux/code shows the the following command remains executing:  precode/Volumes/CS6\ ProdPrm/Adobe\ CS6\ Production\ Premium/payloads/AdobeHelp/InstallAdobeHelp appVersion=4.0.244 appId=chc pubId=4875E02D9FB21EE389F73B8D1702B320485DF8CE.1 installerArg1=-silent installerArg2=-eulaAccepted installerArg3=AdobeHelp.air /code/pre  I tried killing the process, (As suggested for the same issue on Windows) however this had no effect.  I tried manually running the command, (With codesudo/code) which output the following on first attempt and then ceased execution:  precodeDVFreeThread - CFMachPortCreateWithPort hack = 0x29441d0, fPowerNotifyPort= 0x29437f0 DVFreeThread - CFMachPortCreateWithPort hack = 0x29497c0, fPowerNotifyPort= 0x2949090 2015-10-02 12:10:28.713 Adobe AIR Installer[564:9294] !!! BUG: The current event queue and the main event queue are not the same. Events will not be handled correctly. This is probably because _TSGetMainThread was called for the first time off the main thread. /code/pre  And then this on the second attempt and remained executing indefinitely:  precodeDVFreeThread - CFMachPortCreateWithPort hack = 0x282c2e0, fPowerNotifyPort= 0x281af40 DVFreeThread - CFMachPortCreateWithPort hack = 0x282e110, fPowerNotifyPort= 0x282d9e0 DVFreeThread - CFMachPortCreateWithPort hack = 0x422b90, fPowerNotifyPort= 0x421ee0 DVFreeThread - CFMachPortCreateWithPort hack = 0x423470, fPowerNotifyPort= 0x423450 /code/pre  <answer208735> Here is a workaround for this issue:  ol liRestart the system, as the installer had to be force quit, and could not be relaunched easily./li liMount the codeProductionPremium_CS6_LS7.dmg/code disk image. (Or I assume any of the other CS6 products)/li liIn Finder navigate to codeCS6 ProdPrm/code, then codeAdobe CS6 Production Premium/code, then codepayloads/code, then codeAdobeHelp/code, and execute codeAdobe Air Install.app/code./li liOnce the previous step is complete navigate to codeCS6 ProdPrm/code, then codeAdobe CS6 Production Premium/code, then codepayloads/code, then codeAdobeHelp/code, and execute codeAdobeHelp.air/code.  emNote: As Karl pointed out, the AIR installer bundled with certain CS6 products may not install on Mac OS X El Capitan. If this is the case, you will need to navigate to https://get.adobe.com/air/ and and download and install Adobe AIR./em/li liOnce the previous step is complete navigate to codeCS6 ProdPrm/code, then codeAdobe CS6 Production Premium/code, and run codeInstall.app/code./li /ol  <answer209289> The above answer almost worked fully for me. Basically I think the biggest problem is the Adobe Air. The one included with the CS6 installer just wouldn't install. I downloaded the most recent version of Adobe Air from Adobe.com and installed that and then followed step 4 of the instruction above:  ol start="4" liOnce the previous step is complete navigate to CS6 ProdPrm, then Adobe CS6 Production Premium, then payloads, then AdobeHelp, and execute AdobeHelp.air/li /ol  Once this was installed, I was able to install CS6 normally with no problems.  <answer209492> Here is another possible solution.. after multiple hangups and no progress, updated air and java which did not help.  After this, I discovered that when you open the installation process, if you select the individual apps you are installing and uncheck the processes in the photo below, it doesn't hang up and installs just fine and runs perfectly well.. at first I thought it was the extra system font package in those areas that was causing the hangup, but then when I installed dreamweaver, the first time it hung up when I left the two extras checked, then unchecked, the app installed and ran perfectly fine.. this may be a solid solution until Adobe addresses it..(if they do, regardless of those elitists who say the program is years old, it was still a big investment for me so I would like to get more use out of it).. also, I installed most of the suite using this method, everything is functional except After Effects, but, I had the same issue with it on the older system and oddly found the previous version of AE worked just fine, which is ok by me as I get most of what I need from Premiere  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/K8yYf.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer211293> I ran into a similar problem installing strongPhotoshop CS5/strong on strongMac OS 10.11 "El Capitan"/strong. The installer would hang at codeAdobeHelp/code. After completing the above steps mentioned by emAndrew/em and emKarl/em, I was finally able to get the install to proceed but only after making a few additional tweaks. Following is a brief summary of the entire procedure I followed:  ol liDownload the most recent version of codeAdobe Air/code from Adobe.com./li liMount the downloaded image and install codeAdobe Air/code by executing codeAdobe Air Installer.app/code./li liReboot./li liMount the codePhotoshop_12_LS1.dmg/code disk image./li liNavigate to the mounted volume codeAdobe Photoshop CS5/Adobe Photoshop CS5/payloads/AdobeHelp//code then execute codeAdobeHelp.air/code./li liAllow codeAdobeHelp/code to update when prompted./li /ol  h2This is the part I had to figure out for CS5:/h2  ol start="7" liCopy the contents of the installer image codeAdobe Photoshop CS5/code to your local disk by holding codeoption/code and dragging it to the desktop./li liOnce copying is complete, navigate to code~/Desktop/Adobe Photoshop CS5/Adobe Photoshop CS5/payloads/AdobeHelp//code and replace the codeAdobe AIR Installer.app/code with the version of the file downloaded from Adobe.com./li liProceed with the installation by executing codeInstall.app/code in the codeAdobe Photoshop CS5/code directory./li /ol  <answer213033> I think I may have found another and somewhat easier solution to this issue. I have been trying to install DesignStandard_CS6 and experienced the same issue, with the installer hanging at AdobeHelp. I tried navigating to the /Volumes/CS6 DesignStd/Adobe CS6 Design Standard/payloads/AdobeHelp and just running the Adobe AIR Installer. I found it was blocked by the Security &amp; Privacy setting "Allow apps downloaded from:" which was set to the default "Mac App Store and identified developers".  This gave me the idea to change this setting to "Anyway" and hey presto, the installer completed when I tried it again.   I have not tried and tested this beyond my case, but it seems to make sense that this is what was causing it to hang.  Hope this helps.   <comment263576> Note that Adobe Air will also auto-update itself when first launch as it detects a new version is available, so step 4 could be modified to be "allow adobe Air to update itself if requested"
