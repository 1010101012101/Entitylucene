How do I use iTunes' "Download Later" feature? <body> I redeemed a movie in iTunes on my Mac and choose download later. Later, I choose codeStore &gt; Check for Available Downloadsâ€¦/code and it reported that all of my stuff has already been downloaded. So where do I go to get my movie onto my Mac?  <answer96289> Ok, the problem here is that I have actually been looking for something in the iTunes application UI to do this. Rather, the solution seems to be in the web pages served by the iTunes Store.  ol liGo to the iTunes Store./li liScroll to the bottom of the page./li liUnder "Features", choose "Purchased"img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WQpKc.png" alt="Click on purchase"/li liChoose the media type you want (it may help to choose "Not on this computer").img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/J6pyk.png" alt="Choose media type"/li liClick the iCloud icon to (re-)download it.img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MMLaK.png" alt="Click here to download."/li /ol
