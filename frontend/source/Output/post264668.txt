I cannot log in due to changed keyboard layout <body> My (Danish) keyboard on my 2016 MacBook Pro has changed layout after crashing. My password contains a pipe charecter but this cannot be accessed via the normal way (alt + i) or the US Way (alt + 7).   How can I determine the keyboard layout or change it without logging in? It would also help if I could type in a non password input field to test. Is this possible?  <answer264672> strongMethod 1:/strong Go into the Guest User(if it is there) and change the language.  strongMethod 2:/strong See Mac os X - locked outside my account (language!).  strongMethod 3:/strong Try booting into recovey mode(holding kbdcmd/kbd+kbdR/kbd at boot). Then you should be able to change the keyboard layout(in the menu bar).  strongMethod 4:/strong See https://superuser.com/q/871277.
