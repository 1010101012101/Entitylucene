How can I add tags or groups in Apple Contacts? <body> I have people in my address book, but I want to organize them by topic.  Like Work or Office or Friends or well, you get it.  How can I do that on the desktop? I'm assuming its using the group feature, but I can't figure out how to add someone to a group.  How can I do that on my iPhone? Is that even possible?   <answer277708> In the strongmacOS Contacts/strong app, you can create a new Group by either going into strongFile/strong → strongNew Group/strong or pressing kbd⇧ shift/kbd kbd⌘ cmd/kbd kbdN/kbd.  To add a contact to that group, simply drag them from the main list to the group in the left side-pane. If that pane is hidden, you may make it visible by going into strongView/strong → strongShow Groups/strong or pressing kbd⌘ cmd/kbd kbd1/kbd.  As of iOS 10.3, it is not possible to manipulate groups in the strongiOS Contacts/strong app, only filter by groups.  You can perform these operations using the web apps at iCloud.com, although doing so using strongSafari for iOS/strong is very difficult.  <answer277709> strongiOS/strong  This is not presently possible on iOS, but you can do this via the use of third party apps such as Groups.  strongmacOS/strong  This strongis/strong possible on macOS.
