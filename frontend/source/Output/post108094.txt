How can I find what process is starting apps in the background? <body> I keep seeing CIJScannerRegister running. I'd like it to never run. Every time it appears I use codelaunchctl/code to remove its listing and that kills the app. But it reappears later. I know where CIJScannerRegister lives and could delete it, but I would rather get whatever is starting it to not start it. I've looked through code/System/Library/Launch{Agents,Daemons}/code and cannot find any matching entry in there. How can I find the process that is launching it and tell it to stop?  <answer108116> You can use the PPID to find out which process started another process :   codeps axo stat,ppid,pid,comm/code  PPID referes to the PID of the process who started it.   <answer108128> Run codeActivity Monitor/code (from code/Applications/Utilities/code), click on the CIJScannerRegister process, then press kbdCmd/kbd+kbdI/kbd (or use the strongInspect/strong button or go to strongView  Inspect Process/strong). You will see the emParent Process:/em field show the name and the process id of the process that launched it.  <answer111215> CIJScannerRegister is of no use if you don't have an old Canon Inkjet, but Mavericks really wants to have it running all the time.  It's in /Library/Image Capture/Support/LegacyDeviceDiscoveryHelpers, but if you remove it it will appear again in the form of a "Canon Inkjet Printer Software Update" in the App Store.  The only solution I found was to delete the executable inside the app bundle so the OS thinks it's still installed but it can't run.  In Terminal:  precodekillall CIJScannerRegister cd /Library/Image\ Capture/Support/LegacyDeviceDiscoveryHelpers/CIJScannerRegister.app/Contents/MacOS/ sudo rm CIJScannerRegister /code/pre  <comment126786> What user is it running as? <comment127000> @Mark it is running as myself <comment127001> The ppid turned out to be `launchd`'s, but that's what I guessed from it being listed in `launchctl`. What I want to know is what entry in what database tells `launchd` it should start this process -- removing it via `launchctl` doesn't appear to be permanent. <comment127003> Have you looked in ~/Library/LaunchAgents <comment127046> @Mark yes, there is nothing that seems to match in either FQDN or file content. <comment127084> Goodlesuggests it is here  /Library/Image Capture/Support/LegacyDeviceDiscoveryHelpers/CIJScannerRegister.app and is a Canon Printer driver https://discussions.apple.com/message/23197490#23197490 <comment127210> @Mark I knew where it was from the start. I want other applications to not start it. I don't particularly want to delete it if I don't have to. Did you read my question past the first line?
