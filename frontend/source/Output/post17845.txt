How do I change a disk partition map scheme from MBR to GUID Partitions Table? <body> I just finished the huge download of Mac OS X Lion, started the installer, and now I have a problem. The installer says that I strongmust/strong have the strongGUID-Partitions Table Scheme/strong.  The problem is that when I go into the disk utility, I can't change the format anymore, because I have strongMaster Boot Record/strong as type.  Can anyone help me, please?  <answer17852> search: http://www.google.ee/search?q=convert+mbr+to+guid&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a  http://www.insanelymac.com/forum/lofiversion/index.php/t183105.html claims that http://www.coriolis-systems.com/iPartition.php is able to do MBR - GPT conversion.  Then there's supposedly some not-for-faint-of-heart options mentioned in that thread, which IMHO judging from the tone of the original question, are not safe enough to use. At least make a whole disk backup first.  <answer17888> Ok thanks for your help, but I solved the problem on my way, here's what I've done:  ol liBackup everything important to an external Harddrive/li liInserted the Mac Installation Disc and ruined there the disc utility app./li liI removed everything from my HD and it was GUID-Partioned./li liNow I just installed Mac Os X 10.6.2 and updated to 10.6.8/li liNow I could run the installer of Mac Os X Lion without any problems and as a benefit of the whole thing, I started with a brand new Mac Os X Installation, without any trash in the file system./li /ol  <comment19505> Which OS are you upgrading from? <comment19507> I have heard of tools to change things on the fly but can't recommend them. Do you have a spare HD to hold the contents of the drive while it is erased and changed to the correct format? It's normally quite a trick to get Snow Leopard installed on MBR drives. Well done! <comment19508> Can one upgrade from anything other than Snow Leopard? <comment19597> @lkraav: No. Upgrading to Lion requires Snow Leopard. That is why I asked my question in the comments. <comment102050> I have used iPartition a few times to change partition schemes without destroying data partitions.
