Common shell / editor shortcuts for Mac OS X <body> is there a way to add universal shortcuts for input / text fields in OS X and/or chrome itself such as Control + U to delete everything to the left of a line, Control + W to delete the left word etc. or cursor positioning like Control + a to move to beginning of a line?  <answer228132> This is definitely possible, see https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/EventOverview/TextDefaultsBindings/TextDefaultsBindings.html for a good discussion of text system key bindings.  To accomplish what you're after save the following to code~/Library/KeyBindings/DefaultKeyBinding.dict/code:  precode{     "^u" = "deleteToBeginningOfLine:";     "^w" = "deleteWordBackward:"; } /code/pre  <comment278097> Awesome.
