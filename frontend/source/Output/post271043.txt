Can a 2012 Macbook Pro run a 4k display? <body> I was thinking about getting a 4k display for photo and video editing. I just edit 1080p video and that was never a problem on my mid 2012 mbp non-retina with i5 and 8gb ram. It also was never a problem when I had a external 1080p display hooked up to it with a thunderbolt to hdmi adapter. Can the macbook run a 4k display even for basic tasks like web browsing and some stuff in sketch and affinity designer?  <answer271045> According to Everymac that machine can only run an external screen up to 2560x1600.  <comment340690> okey thanks, is there a way to run a 4k display anyway? <comment340694> no. 2k maximum. You could run a 4k at 2k, but I don't really see the point.
