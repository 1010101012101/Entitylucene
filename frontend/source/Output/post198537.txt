How do I pass a password to hdiutil attach? <body> How do I pass a password to hdiutil attach?  I have an encrypted sparsebundle  (test.sparsebundle) and it's password is "test", with no quotes.  I'd like to automate opening that file.  I have tried   precodeecho "test" | hdiutil attach -stdinpass test.sparsebundle /code/pre  and  precodeecho test | hdiutil attach -stdinpass test.sparsebundle /code/pre  But it returns  hdiutil: attach failed - Authentication error  <answer198539> Ah! A little more digging, and careful reading of the man page. I need a null terminated string.  So   precodeprintf '%s\0' 'test' | hdiutil attach test.sparsebundle -stdinpass /code/pre  works.  <comment237587> If the password has no spaces or characters special to the shell it can be shortened to just: `printf test|hdiutil attach test.sparsebundle -stdinpass` <comment237592> The `\0` isn't actually needed, but using `%s` is a good idea -- there are a lot of "special characters" that can trip you up.
