External hard drive not indexed by Spolight on Mac OS X Mountain Lion <body> I recently bought a new hard drive and it is not indexed by Finder. I tried to get it re-indexed by following this tutorial: http://reviews.cnet.com/8301-13727_7-10330114-263.html and I even tried something with commands in the terminal, no luck to get it indexed.   My previous external hard drives (Western Digital SE Elements) that crashed were indexed, but I was using Leopard and Snow Leopard back then.   I am using a Macbook pro 13" mid-2009 edition and my external drive is a 500Gb Toshiba Stor.E Canvio.  Does it have to do that I uninstalled software I used back then on Leopard to be able to read NTFS drives?  <answer112394> Esmitex, kindly try the following steps:  ol liFrom the Apple () menu, choose System Preferences./li liClick Spotlight./li liClick the Privacy tab./li liDrag a folder or an entire volume (your hard drive) to the list./li liIf prompted for confirmation, click OK./li liRemove the item or volume you just added to the list by clicking it and then clicking the minus ("-") button./li liClose Spotlight preferences./li liSpotlight will re-index the contents of the folder or volume./li /ol  If the steps mentioned above does not work, try downloading this supplemental update for Mountain Lion and repeat the steps above.  http://support.apple.com/kb/DL1600  Hope this helps...  <answer122398> From the Terminal application type the following:  precodemdutil -s /Volumes/&lt;your_disk_name&gt;/ /code/pre  If indexing is disabled you will get something like that:  precode/Volumes/&lt;your_disk_name&gt;: Indexing disabled.  /code/pre  You can turn it on by typing (it will request your password):  precodesudo mdutil -i on /Volumes/&lt;your_disk_name&gt;/ /code/pre  Now erase all the existing entries in the index for that drive (if any):  precodemdutil -E /Volumes/&lt;your_disk_name&gt;/ /code/pre  Check that indexing has been enabled:  precodemdutil -s /Volumes/&lt;your_disk_name&gt;/ /code/pre  If indexing is enabled you will get something like that:  precode/Volumes/&lt;your_disk_name&gt;: Indexing enabled.  /code/pre  Now just reboot your system or wait some minutes until Finder begins the indexing.  <comment85454> What does `diskutil list` show for that drive? <comment85491> This is what it shows: `/dev/disk1    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:     FDisk_partition_scheme                        *500.1 GB   disk1    1:               Windows_NTFS TOSHIBA EXT            500.1 GB   disk1s1` <comment325558> Tried your solution and it didn't work on Mac OS X 10.10. But Georges solution worked like a charm. <comment349804> It works like a charm. <comment363977> I can't do this because I am not allowed to add a Time Machine–designated backup drive to the privacy list. Do you know how to mark a disk as not a backup disk so that Time Machine will free it?
