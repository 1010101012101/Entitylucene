Can I safely remove the QuarantineRoot folder? <body> in El Capitan there is a nice folder called QuarantineRoot (the Ars review on this matter) that contains stuff that was in code/usr/code in Yosemite but had to be moved (because code/usr/codeis now protected by SIP).    precode/Library/SystemMigration/History/Migration-(some UUID)/QuarantineRoot/ /code/pre  Can I safely delete it?  I sorted the symlinks to codetexbin/code that are there, reinstalled Prey etc... is there any risk of a snafu later on?  <answer209436> I see to have posted a duplicate of Can I delete /Library/SystemMigration, so I consider this question closed.  <comment252649> possible duplicate of [Can I delete /Library/SystemMigration](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/208381/can-i-delete-library-systemmigration)
