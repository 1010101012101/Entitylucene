Webcam not turning on, despite detecting and allowing <body> I have a Mid-2012 Macbook Pro 13", on which the webcam is not working.  I tried Photobooth as well as websites on Chrome that use it, and in both cases even though access is allowed and the camera is detected, it doesn't switch on, neither does the green light besides the lens.  Here's a screenshot:   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZFyHb.png" alt="Trying to record a video"  Further info:  It stopped working a couple of weeks back, after which I upgraded my OS from Yosemite to Sierra without any backup. It started working again for a few days, only stop working again.  Any suggestions?  <comment330710> Two things to try:  [Apple Hardware Test (AHT)](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201257).  Hold the D key while booting from a powered off state with the AC adapter connected.    Also, try an external webcam.  If it works there, it's a hardware issue.  Also, which OS? <comment330712> @Allan I updated to Sierra. I'll try the AHT. Thanks <comment330715> Minor confusion then...you upgraded to Sierra, or you re-installed Sierra?  Was it working in Yosemite or El Capitan? <comment330716> @Allan Sorry I didn't clear that up; I had Yosemite, stopped working on that. I was anyway going to reboot my system after replacing my hard drive, which I did. Then I upgraded to Sierra. Webcam worked for a few days. Stopped working indefinitely afterwards.
