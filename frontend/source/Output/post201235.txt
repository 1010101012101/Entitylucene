Windows File Sharing user checkbox uncheckable <body> I seem to be unable to complete the setup of sharing a folder via SMB.  I have turned on file sharing and have checked 'Share files and folders using SMB' but I cannot choose a user account under the section called Windows File Sharing:     Sharing files with some Windows computers requires storing the user's   account password on this computer is a less secure manner.  When you   enable Windows sharing for a user account, you must enter the password   of that account.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/iE1kp.png" alt="Windows File Sharing Mac"  I can see my computer on the network from another computer but I cannot access the file shares with this mac's username and password.  Any help would be appreciated.  Thanks!  <answer231389> This might help ... basically you need to create a "share-only" user on the Mac.  http://chriswrites.com/how-to-share-files-folders-between-the-mac-and-pc/
