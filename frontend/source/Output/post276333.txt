How to force xip files to use Archive Utility? <body> When I try and open a code.xip/code file macOS always opens it in TextEdit instead of Archive Utility even though the file is an archive.  The main file I'm having an issue with is the codexcode.xip/code which is from Apple's website.  <answer276336> In Finder:  ol liSelect the file/li liPress kbdcmd/kbdkbdalt/opt/kbdkbdI/kbd/li liThe file inspector opens. Press the triangle for 'Open with:' and select Archive Utility./li liSelect 'Always open with' and confirm the dialog box./li /ol  <comment347762> it's command + i. <comment347785> Yes, CMD + I does the same. Using CMD + OPT + I has the advantage that you  can use the same shortcut again to close/hide it. If you click off of it you need to press CMD + O a second time and then CMD + W to close it. :)
