My Press and hold accents have been disabled in Yosemite <body> I just got Yosemite and now my Press and hold accent capability seems to have disappeared with my old software.  I tried using code/System/Library/Input Methods/PressAndHold.app/code in Terminal to find Press And Hold but it comes up saying     -bash: System/Library/Input: No such file or directory   and I am not even able to use codedefaults write -g ApplePressAndHoldEnabled -bool true/code  to enable it. Please help!  <answer152232> I just realised you need to restart the device for it to take effect...  <answer157069> Your error in Terminal happened because you didn’t escape the space. It read code/System/Library/Input/code as one thing, and codeMethods/PressAndHold.app/code as another separate thing. And if you don’t tell it to codeopen/code the app, it’ll just complain that the app bundle is a directory.  What you needed to do was either type a backslash code\/code before the space (this is done automatically if you drag a file into the Terminal window or autocomplete a name by pressing kbdtab/kbd):  code$ open /System/Library/Input\ Methods/PressAndHold.app/code  or put quotes around the whole path:  code$ open "/System/Library/Input Methods/PressAndHold.app"/code  Or just navigate to the app in Finder and double-click it.  Doesn’t really answer the problem you asked about, but I hope this helps you in using Terminal.  <comment184678> As the answer shows you have two questions here please edit this one down and create another
