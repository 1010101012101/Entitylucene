Can the stripped down OSX save sheet be augmented with Finder functions? <body> In a normal finder window there is a rich set of functions, yet when the finder is opened in save mode a lot of those functions are locked.  Some examples:  ul lirename folder/li liright click and create folder/li linumerous other right click options/li lino red close button in the top left like there is on every other window/li lino move file option/li lidoesn't show the path along the bottom even though my Finder is configured to do so/li /ul  Is there a way to give fuller access to any or all these features from an application's save sheet?  <answer209240> Guessing emwhy/em Apple does things (technical or otherwise) is the job of quite a few Apple Pundits.  If you find that the open and save dialog boxes are incomplete or otherwise not to your liking you should investigate Finder enhancements such as Default Folder X. I don't use it myself and understand there may be an issue with it and OSX 10.11 El Capitan but I gather is is pretty popular and has been a part of the Mac since before OSX.  <comment363150> +1 Additional software is required like Default Folder to augment the save sheet. There's no built in functionality that anyone has described publicly on OS X 10.13 and lower for this. The save sheet is stripped down by design. <comment363151> Comments are not for extended discussion; this conversation has been [moved to chat](http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/60909/discussion-on-question-by-toni-leigh-can-the-stripped-down-osx-save-sheet-be-aug).
