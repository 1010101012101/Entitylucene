What can be done more with an old ipod touch(First generation) <body> Hi I had an I pod touch (first generation) with version : 1.1.5(4B1) which I bought from EBAy long time back in 2008  I had installed latest ITunes and browsing if  I can find any applications that can be run on this 1st gen iPod. But most of the apps are generally compatible with 3 and greater.  Are there really any  for 1st gen? If no, what else can be done apart from playing music and videos..  I had seen http://support.apple.com/kb/HT2052 which says can be updated to iOS3.1. Has anyone done ...any problems faced..  Any other suggestion you have apart from selling it :-)  <answer6570> You can Using your iPod as a storage drive:  From apple support:     ol   liConnect iPod to your computer./li   liOpen iTunes if it doesn't automatically open./li   liSelect the iPod icon in the Source pane./li   liClick the Summary tab./li   liSelect "Enable disk use" or "Manually manage music and videos."   Either one will allow you to use iPod   as a drive. If you select "Manually   manage music and videos," iTunes won't   automatically update iPod with the   iTunes library. If you want iTunes to   automatically update your iPod, select   "Enable disk use" instead./li   liThe iPod disk icon appears on the desktop and in Finder windows, and in   My Computer/Computer in Windows.   Double-click the icon and drag files   to or from iPod's window to copy them./li   liMake sure to eject iPod before disconnecting it from your computer.   Tip: The iPod display will say "Do Not   Disconnect" when disk use is enabled   (iPod shuffle's status light will   continue to blink orange until after   it is ejected). These are reminders   for you to eject iPod first./li   /ol   <answer6571> Maybe not the best iOS device nowadays but it still makes a nifty remote!br I have an Ipod Touch (2nd gen though) that I use to control my mac-mini media center. It's very intuitive to manage your playlist (iTunes DJ mode) with the Remote app.br And I use Mobile Mouse Pro to use my Ipod as a mouse. User experience  is not as sweet as Remote but still a great app which eliminates the need for keyboard.   <answer16235> I also have a 1st generation iPod Touch.  I have consistently upgradedthe operating system every time an upgrade was available, so I am now running iOS 3.1.  No problems whatsoever, running all sorts of apps, many of which required iOS 3+.  Don't confuse the operating system version with the iPod/iPhone generation (gen 1, 2, 3 or 4).  <answer16237> Yes, you can run apps on that. You've got to upgrade to 3.1.3. I think it costs $10.  Not all apps will run though, but most of them will run fine.  <answer87389> You could always jailbreak your device you can do loads of cool things like running android or loads of new settings its really good  <comment6859> Great idea!!.....sorry I couldn't up vote since i dont have 15+ votes <comment6860> ok!!!! Great answers.......but no one has talked about upgrading to 3.1 version..actually buying!! <comment6861> Cool idea.........I will follow thoroughly!! great... <comment6865> I don't think iOS devices allow disk use, I believe that was only for the original iPod line <comment7131> This doesn't work with iPhone/iPod Touch. <comment83661> Good to hear others using 3.1 in the wild. Thanks. <comment102117> Welcome to the site. Can you please explain in more details how this would work and which steps are needed to do it?
