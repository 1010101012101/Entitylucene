Where is the Thunderbolt Display's microphone located, and what are its specifications? <body> There is a mesh above the camera on top of the display. Is that it?  I wonder if it's omni-directional or listening towards the front of the display. I can't find any information about the location or specifications on apple.com or elsewhere.  <answer49017> According to the iFixit teardown (see step 19) the microphone is indeed located above the camera behind the mesh. No word on the specs.  <comment123759> Just a hint: the quality of the mic is good, but the angle it records speach from a person sitting in fron of it is really bad. But if you manage to get something above the mic in a 45 degrees angle, the quality of your voice will increase by a large amount.
