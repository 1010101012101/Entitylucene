Where are my iBooks stored in macOS Sierra? <body> I am looking here for my iBooks in macOS Sierra:  precode/Users/'USERNAME'/Library/Containers/com.apple.BKAgentService/Data/Documents/iBooks /code/pre  But the folder is empty. When I open iBooks (the App) in Sierra, then all my books are there.  So what is happening here? Is Apple just hiding my books now? Where can I display/find them?  <answer259844> If you’ve enabled iCloud, they’re stored in Mobile Documents folder.  Here’s the full path:  precode~/Library/Mobile Documents/iCloud~com~apple~iBooks/Documents/ /code/pre  The path is only accessible via Terminal. Going through Finder will only redirect you to the iCloud folder. So open up Terminal and type in:  precodeopen ~/Library/Mobile\ Documents/iCloud\~com\~apple\~iBooks/Documents /code/pre  This will open a Finder window with all your iBooks in it.  <answer272203> precode/Users/USERNAME/Library/Containers/com.apple.BKAgentService/Data/Documents/iBooks /code/pre  This worked for me in Sierra.  <answer282527> I switched to iCloud storage for iBooks and then iBooks immediately started acting funky and not responding. I searched "All My Files" for ePub files, then choose all of them (+500) and opened them all at once with iBooks and they all reloaded to iBooks.... and, importantly, before I did that, I turned off iCloud storage for iBooks. I resist using Terminal because I am a novice (at best) but this situation follows typical Apple nonsense: what seems like a good idea (storing all your books on iCloud) turns into a general threat to something pretty important. I choose rather a personal "cloud" via a 3TB hard drive (LaCie) with wi-fi.   <answer288161> In Sierra, I found some of my iBooks at the location listed above:  code/Users/'USERNAME'/Library/Containers/com.apple.BKAgentService/Data/Documents/iBooks/code  However, they were not all there, only a small handful. When I went to iBooks and downloaded them from the cloud, then they started to show up as ePub files there.  <answer289172> I simply dragged the books onto a folder of my choice in Finder and got the epub files that way.  <comment325152> Hm, I cannot see this folder in Finder, but over the command line it works... <comment327493>  for adding more details to the original answer. <comment342142> By ‘new OS’ I presume you mean Sierra. ‘new OS’ could refer to anything later on once Sierra is no longer the most recent OS. <comment349057> Believe it's changed you guys, here's the path that worked for me `~/Library/Mobile Documents/iCloud~com~apple~iBooks/Documents`
