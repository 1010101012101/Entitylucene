hostname returns another device's name <body> I realized that the hostname had changed while I was doing some work using terminal in OS X Yosemite. I thought there might be an codeIP/code address conflict so I reset it. However I still get another device's name (someone else's iPhone, to be exact) when I use the codehostname/code command:  precodeLast login: Fri May  1 15:52:42 on ttys000 SomeonesiPhone:~ irem$  SomeonesiPhone:~ irem$ hostname SomeonesiPhone.wireless.duke.local /code/pre  What's going on and how can I fix this?  It appears the codeIP/code address has not changed. But the address that I get by doing codeipconfig getifaddr en0/code is different from my public IP address.  I looked up my public IP address using Google, like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dANWq.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer183412> By default, your Mac will take the host name from the router when it received a DHCP reservation reply.  You can change this by not using DHCP or fixing the router or as a last resort over-writing the host name once you notice it's gone amok:  precodesudo scutil --set ComputerName whatever sudo scutil --set LocalHostName whatever /code/pre  <comment218633> @D.W. see the edit please <comment218638> It did not change anything. The hostname does not get changed. The computer name has been `Irems-MacBook-Pro` all the time, and it still is. <comment218641> @sodiumnitrate When you spawned that shell - the host name was SomeonesiPhone and the hostname command agrees. Perhaps you are referring to the other two possible names - HostName, ComputerName, LocalHostName - not changing? Either way, set it the way you want and then have your shell fix $PS1 (or quit the shell and start a new one once you've resolved the naming confusion) <comment218643> Ok, I got a little confused. So when I do `scutil --get ComputerName` or the other 2, I can see that it's been changed to whatever I want them to be. I guess `hostname` is something different, which is still someone's iPhone. The question is what can I do to get my `hostname` changed back to what it was. I understand that it's a screw-up with the network (although not sure about how), but I can't do anything there as it's the school's network. I've contacted support, but they didn't seem to have much idea. <comment218645> @sodiumnitrate After using --get to verify all three, set the ones that are wrong and then if needed, restart terminal. <comment218647> Alright, it did the trick. Thanks
