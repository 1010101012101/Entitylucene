Escape single quote in command in alias Terminal <body> I am working with SVN for version control, and whenever I'm ready to commit some changes, I have to stage them all with the following command:  codesvn status | grep -v "^.[ \t]*\..*" | grep "^?" | awk '{print $2}' | xargs svn add/code  As you can see, it's quite complicated and I therefore went looking into making an alias for this command.  When opening code~/.bash_profile/code, I added the following line:  codealias svn grab='svn status | grep -v "^.[ \t]*\..*" | grep "^?" | awk '{print $2}' | xargs svn add'/code  However, there are some single and double quotes in the original command, so the alias fails to be created (ok, it gets created partially, and I can't use it).  How do I escape the single quotes in the command, so the alias will work?  <answer163068> Double quotes and escaping all code"/code and code$/code correctly should work:  precode alias svngrab="'svn status | grep -v \"^.[ \t]*\..*\" | grep \"^?\" | awk '{print \$2}' | xargs svn add'" /code/pre  I also would avoid "svn grab" so maybe svngrab or svn_grab instead.  <comment190827> Try using a _ in the alias command.  Like svn_grab no space in between.  What error is it outputting? <comment190829> I want the alias to be "svn grab", wouldn't it have to be: `alias svn grab="'svn status | grep -v \"^.[ \t]*\..*\" | grep \"^?\" | awk '{print \$2}' | xargs svn add'"` <comment190832> With the alias I have tried to set up (see above) I get the following: `-bash: alias: svn: not found` and `-bash: alias: }^[ | xargs svn add: not found`. I have changed the name of the alias, so now it only outputs the second error. <comment190834> Yes, that one works, no more errors! Thanks! <comment190835> Yes, I have already changed the alias, because that was also outputting an error. <comment190865> Ok, no more errors, until I started using it just now. It runs the alias until `print:` and then outputs `command not found`. The whole line `-bash: svn status | grep -v "^.[ \t]*\..*" | grep "^?" | awk {print: command not found`. Any idea what's going wrong? <comment190867> @Rvervuurt remove the escape in front of the $ <comment190869> @Rvervuurt usually you have to escape $. Maybe it's counterproductive inside the curly brackets {} <comment190872> I get the same error after removing the escape character. Edit: But after opening a new tab in Terminal, it seems to work. <comment190873> @Rvervuurt wait: you may have forgotten a ; after $2 so correct: ... awk '{print \$2;}' ... <comment190874> Well, it did stage all the edited files and a commit worked without a problem, so escaping the $ wasn't necessary. Thanks for the help :)
