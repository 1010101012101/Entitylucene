Finder hiding "_original" extension, so appears like two identical files <body> We have a system so that when some actions are performed on a file, the file is first duplicated with "_original" appended to the extension. So, photo.jpg would become photo.jpg_original as the backup copy and then photo.jpg is used for whatever purposes. This duplication is an intended functionality.  In finder, though, on some machines, they are seeing two versions with the same name. They see two files, both with "photo.jpg". Other people do not have this problem despite same operating systems.  This is what almost all of us see, and what we want and expect to see: expected behavior http://www.mvtimes.com/images/misc/finder-good.png  But here is how it is displaying on one machine, with the same OS (10.8.4) unwanted behavior http://www.mvtimes.com/images/misc/finder-bad.png  You can see the other oddity is that it doesn't happen to all the files. Some do, indeed show the "_original" version alongside the other, while some do not.  Show extensions is enabled in finder, but other than that, I have no idea where to look to fix this issue. The fact that it is working fine on most machines makes it a bit more baffling.  Does anyone know of a way to ensure that the user sees both the "photo.jpg" and the "photo.jpg_original" files instead of what appears to them as two copies of "photo.jpg"?  Thanks.  <comment110792> Some Actions?? what actions. Please shows us what is doing the duplication. ta. <comment110862> The duplication is purposefully done by exiftool. This isn't the issue. The files created are what we want. They are created properly as seen on most of the machines and when viewing the directories in terminal. Finder, though, is displaying them incorrectly on one machine. I've added screen shots to the original post. Thanks. <comment110884> If you select the file, command-I for "get info", does the Info dialog show the full name? There is a "Name & Extension" panel there, and that is where you would turn on hiding filename extensions. I wouldn't consider "_original" a filename extension in the commonly used sense, but perhaps os-x can. <comment110891> Thanks the more information the better. Two things.  Is each machine viewing the same directory on a network volume ( if so what is the actual file system used) or are they all viewing their own folders. What happens if the duplication and naming is done manually.
