pbcopy exits code 1, no error message <body> I'm trying to use codepbcopy/code and codepbpaste/code to copy and paste to the clipboard from a shell. I read the man page to learn the syntax for these programs. However, no matter how I try to invoke codepbcopy/code or codepbpaste/code, they refuse to work, exiting code 1 with no error message. Command-C and Command-V work as normal.  precode[jay-mba-osx ~]% echo foo | pbcopy                                                                                                                                           [jay-mba-osx ~]% echo $?                                                                                                                                                     1 [jay-mba-osx ~]% pbcopy &lt; foo.txt                                                                                                                                         [jay-mba-osx ~]% echo $?                                                                                                                                                     1 [jay-mba-osx ~]% echo foo | pbcopy -pboard general                                                                                                                           [jay-mba-osx ~]% echo $?                                                                                                                                                     1 [jay-mba-osx ~]% pbcopy --help                                                [jay-mba-osx ~]% echo $? 1 [jay-mba-osx ~]% which pbcopy                                                                                                                                                /usr/bin/pbcopy [jay-mba-osx ~]% pbpaste                                                                                                                                                     [jay-mba-osx ~]% echo $?                                                                                                                                                     1 /code/pre  Any ideas why this is happening? It persists across reboots.  EDIT: OS X 10.9 Mavericks. Here is the result of codeuname -a/code:  precodeDarwin jay-mba-osx.local 13.0.0 Darwin Kernel Version 13.0.0: Thu Sep 19 22:22:27 PDT 2013; root:xnu-2422.1.72~6/RELEASE_X86_64 x86_64 /code/pre  EDIT2: I have isolated this to occur emonly/em in tmux sessions. I didn't even think about that at first... now to figure out the emactual/em problem...  <answer115733> It is a problem with tmux detaching itself from the GUI namespace.  Fixed with: https://github.com/ChrisJohnsen/tmux-MacOSX-pasteboard  <comment135388> Does `type pbcopy` also show it being in /usr/bin and is there any chance you have several OS installed / available or some off $PATH variable? Can we also presume you're in bash or have reproduced this with a stock shell (or something like `bash --rcfile /dev/null`) <comment135390> Yes, `pbcopy` is `/usr/bin/pbcopy`. This was noted in my original question. ;) Yes, I have Windows and Debian Linux installed on this machine, but I don't see how that would have any effect...? <comment135393> I've seen `which` fail people with oddball cases and `type` never has failed me under bash. You're probably in the clear with `which` but I wanted to rule some oddball edge case of a function or improperly hashed command out. I should have been more specific - older versions of OS X or darwin was all I was wondering in case you ran an incorrect version of `pbcopy` <comment135394> I see what you're getting at. :) `command -v pbcopy` and `type pbcopy` both return `/usr/bin/pbcopy`. <comment135395> Oh, no, OSX 10.9 (Mavericks). Sorry. I'll add that to my question. <comment135396> Didn't see your edit to your first comment, @bmike . I'm using `zsh`, but invoking `bash` without sourcing my rc file, as you suggested, results in identical behavior. <comment135413> ok, I have at least isolated the problem: This happens *only* in tmux sessions.
