Create a New Space in Mavericks using Applescript <body> In Mavericks, is it possible to use Applescript to create a new Space in Mission Control?  I also tried the following code to switch to another Space, but it does not seem to do anything...  precodetell application "System Events"     tell process "Finder"         keystroke "2" using control down --switches to space 2     end tell end tell /code/pre  <answer118722> precodedelay 0.5 -- time to release command if the script is run with command-R tell application "System Events"     key code 126 using control down -- control-up     delay 1     do shell script "MouseTools -x 1900 -y 60;sleep 1;MouseTools -leftClickNoRelease;MouseTools -releaseMouse"     key code 53 -- escape end tell /code/pre  You can download MouseTools from http://www.hamsoftengineering.com/codeSharing/MouseTools/MouseTools.html. See http://osxnotes.net/applescript.html for a list of key codes.  <answer153878> Use key code instead of keystroke. I don't see why MouseTools is needed. Assuming you have cntrl-2 bound to space to, this should switch you (at least in Yosemite):  precodetell application "System Events"     key code 19 using control down end tell  -- numkey code -- 1 18 -- 2 19 -- 3 20 -- 4 21 /code/pre
