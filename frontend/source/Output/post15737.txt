command line ps has stopped working correctly after an update <body> I use to be able to run this ps command from the terminal:  ps -u codewhoami/code -o pid,rss,command  But recently the RSS size returned are all 0!  precodeps -u `whoami` -o pid,rss,command 158      0 /System/Library/CoreServices/Dock.app/Contents/MacOS/Dock 159      0 /System/Library/CoreServices/SystemUIServer.app/Contents/MacOS/SystemUIServer 160      0 /System/Library/CoreServices/Finder.app/Contents/MacOS/Finder 165      0 /usr/sbin/pboard /code/pre  unless I run it with sudo  precodesudo ps -u `whoami` -o pid,rss,command 158  17556 /System/Library/CoreServices/Dock.app/Contents/MacOS/Dock 159  22488 /System/Library/CoreServices/SystemUIServer.app/Contents/MacOS/SystemUIServer 160  82176 /System/Library/CoreServices/Finder.app/Contents/MacOS/Finder 165    840 /usr/sbin/pboard /code/pre  Does anyone know how to fix this or how to get the original functionality back?  <answer15739> This looks on the face of it to be a permissions issue.  I would try and Repair Permissions as per http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1452  <answer15751> I have 10.6.7 and your  precodeps -u `whoami` -o pid,rss,command /code/pre  producing  precode  PID    RSS COMMAND   180    696 /sbin/launchd   185  19108 /System/Library/CoreServices/SystemUIServer.app/Contents/MacOS/SystemUIServer   189     32 /usr/sbin/pboard   .... etc .... /code/pre  so, the problem is in your system. So, what return this:  precodels -l /bin/ps /code/pre  should this  precode-r-sr-xr-x  1 root  wheel  134816 12 okt  2010 /bin/ps /code/pre  if your ps has other permissions, repair with:  precodesudo chown root /bin/ps sudo chgrp wheel /bin/ps sudo chmod 4555 /bin/ps /code/pre  <comment17128> What level of OS are you running? The ps -u does not work for me on 10.6.7 - ps -U works so either your OS is different or your path has an alternate ps binary or I'm missing something else obvious.  (FYI MD5 (/bin/ps) = 32a504d1010b2e40beebe8c30ff7bf6d ) <comment17129> I suppose if the set-user-ID-on-execution bit on /bin/ps (or whatever ps is in the path first) were gone this makes great sense... `$ ls -la /bin/ps -r-sr-xr-x  1 root  wheel  134816 May 18  2009 /bin/ps` <comment17217> The repair permissions might have worked, how ever I ran `sudo chmod 4555 /bin/ps` and the issue has been fixed.    The permissions were    -r-xr-xr-x@ 1 root  wheel   132K 18 May  2009 /bin/ps*  Now   -r-sr-xr-x@ 1 root  wheel   132K 18 May  2009 /bin/ps*
