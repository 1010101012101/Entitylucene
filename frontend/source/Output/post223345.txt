Best app for remembering email addresses <body> What is the simplest way to remember all my past email addresses. Had a head injury and memory loss.  <answer223348> It does take time an effort to setup but I would recommend 1Password. It can store your account logins, email addresses, and anything else you would like to store securely. It works on Mac, iOS, and Windows, and Android with syncing across all platforms.  If you are looking for a free less secure tool, I would use a text file shared via Dropbox, Google Drive, or Microsoft 365.  <comment270793> Can you clarify what you are looking for / asking here?     Are you looking for a method of making a list of email addresses?    You can use any text editing program, spreadsheet, etc etc to keep a list.    Or are you asking (which seems to be from your question) how to remember email addresses that you have forgotten?
