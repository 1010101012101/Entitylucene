Redirecting podcast on server versus using <itunes:new-feed-url> <body> The documentation says to use both. So I am using both. But I put in a 301 redirect for my old feed first, then I inserted the code&lt;itunes:new-feed-url&gt;/code tag into the old feed.  So does this mean that iTunes is now relying on my redirect? Or by encountering redirection initially, does iTunes adjust permanently to the new feed, allowing me to retire the redirect without breaking my iTunes podcast?  I feel like I should remove the redirect for a day, let iTunes emsee/em the code&lt;itunes:new-feed-url&gt;/code tag in the old feed and adjust, then launch my redirect again.  Thoughts?
