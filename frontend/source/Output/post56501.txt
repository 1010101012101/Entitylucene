Key Combination for Restart During Boot <body> My Mac gets stuck during bootup quite frequently recently (no entry sign and flashing folder). Every time it happens, I have to press the power button to shut it down and press the power button again to turn it on.  Is there a software reboot key combination like Window's kbdControl/kbd + kbdAlt/kbd + kbdDelete/kbd?   <answer56505> Although Apple publishes a list of OS X keyboard shortcuts for startup, there is not one for forcing a reboot.  However, your problem seems to be indicating a failing hard drive, so make sure that you create a full backup of your data (if you don't have one already) as soon as possible.  I would replace your drive manually (if your Mac has a user-serviceable hard drive) or take your Mac into an Apple Store for service.  In the long term, this should solve your issue.
