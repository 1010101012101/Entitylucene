White MacBook ca 2009/2010 slower and vibrating <body> I have scoured the net for some advice on a recent issue with my MacBook. It was for several years fast and silent but now the browser (fx 18.0.2) is perceptibly slower and there is a hum where I touch the keyboard which is not the fan - so I'm guessing hard-disk.  Core-2 duo 2GB ram  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/klzfv.png" alt="enter image description here"  I have repaired permissions (which btw broke iPhoto and Preview so I had to reinstall them) AND verified the hard-disk.  ol liIs it advisable to ignore the hum as a suspension issue from dried out rubber and add a folded napkin between the HD and the battery as some suggested?/li liis it worth it to add some RAM (I think I know the answer ;)/li listrongThe real question/strong: is it worth getting a new SSD and get rid of any moving parts? /li /ol  My biggest fear is getting a new mac for some 1500 usd to find that it is NOT as silent as this used to be  Thanks  <comment94387> Do you have an Apple Hardware Test disc? You could also try verifying the hard disk in Disk Utility. <comment94393> I do not have a hardware test disc but I DID verify (updated question)
