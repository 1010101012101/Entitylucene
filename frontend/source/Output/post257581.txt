Reinstall OS X for older MacBook Pro <body> I have an older MacBook Pro (Mid 2009) that cannot start and need to reinstall OS X from USB key or disc. With another MacBook I tried to download OS X El Capitan but is not available, only macOS Sierra, but my laptop is too old for macOS Sierra. How can download OS X El Capitan or older version of OS X?  <answer257586> You can download OS X El Capitan 10.11.6 (6.21 GB) via this link, which will open first in the Browser, then in the App Store.app.     OS X El Capitan      This version of OS X El Capitan is for users running OS X Snow Leopard   who would like to upgrade to macOS Sierra. If you are running Snow   Leopard and would like to upgrade to Sierra, you need to install El   Capitan first. This version of El Capitan can also be installed on Mac   computers that are not comparable with Sierra.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/XiHpb.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment321883> not work, same message...there is nothing left to do but throw it in the trash?
