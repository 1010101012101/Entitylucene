Numbers: Make numbers negative <body> In Numbers, how can I convert a number to negative.  E.g.   precode200 233 186 /code/pre  Becomes  precode-200  -233  -186 /code/pre  In Excel, you can use tools like Paste Special, but these don't exist in Numbers.   <answer226240> It would be awkward, might not be worth the time, but you would need to program this in automator using numbers hooks for automation / accessibility. That way you could make a service to swap the sign of whatever is selected.  Short term, you'd manually change each or set up a function to calculate the negative of the selection and then paste the values over the source.  This is one of the features that just isn't baked into Numbers (yet).  <answer226241> A workaround is to create a column with formulas like "=-1 * A1", then copy and "Paste Formula Results" (⇧⌘V).  But I'm sure there are better solutions.
