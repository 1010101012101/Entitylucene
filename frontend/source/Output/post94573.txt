Server certificates are not properly validated by subversion/openssl <body> I noticed that the svn cli fails to validate https certificates and always ask for manual validation using the certificate fingerprint:  precodembp:~ user$ svn co https://svn.mysite.com/svn/testrepo Error validating server certificate for 'https://svn.mysite.com:443':  - The certificate is not issued by a trusted authority. Use the    fingerprint to validate the certificate manually! Certificate information:  - Hostname: svn.mysite.com  - Valid: from Fri, 21 Jun 2013 00:00:00 GMT until Mon, 20 Jun 2016 23:59:59 GMT  - Issuer: ANISSUER, DE  - Fingerprint: 37:7d:6a:a7:e9:4c:30:57:fe:45:32:ab:bb:71:6c:79:08:4d:72:0d /code/pre  All the following clients were able to validate the certificate of my own svn server as well as that of an sf.net server:  ul lisvn cli on Linux/li liTortoiseSVN on Windows/li liSafari/Firefox/Chrome on OSX/li /ul  The two svn cli versions which I tried on OSX (Mountain Lion) and failed to validate the certificates are:  ul licode/usr/bin/svn/code: 1.6.18 (r1303927) - Mountain Lion/Xcode/li licode/opt/homebrew/bin/svn/code: 1.7.9 (r1462340) - Compiled using homebrew/li /ul  Is there any way around this problem?  <answer94957> A friend (who was too lazy to write the answer here) hinted me that the root certificates in Mac OSX are stored in the keychain and suggested two different ways around the problem.  In order to make openssl library (used by svn) to locate them, you need to manually export them and store them in code/System/Library/OpenSSL/cert.pm/code. The process is described step-by-step in the following blog post: http://jw35.blogspot.gr/2011/02/root-certificates-for-macos-openssl.html  If you are using homebrew, an alternative solution is to install codecurl-ca-bundle/code package and point openssl to the location of the certificates with the use of an environment variable.  precodebrew install curl-ca-bundle echo "export SSL_CERT_FILE=$(brew --prefix)/opt/curl-ca-bundle/share/ca-bundle.crt" &gt;&gt; ~/.bashrc /code/pre  <comment110868> My guess is that the cause of the problem is the svn cli not being able to pick-up the root certificates trusted by the operating system. These are stored in `/etc/ssl/certs` in Debian, but I have no idea of their whereabouts in OSX. <comment176988> This worked for me, but you have to not only drop the PEM file into `/System/Library/OpenSSL/cert.pm` but you also need to create a file called `[hash].0` that contains the same data (or, better yet, create a symlink). The `[hash]` is the hash of the certificate that you can get by running `openssl x509 -hash -noout -in /System/Library/OpenSSL/cert.pem`. This should give you an 8-character code that you can use for your symlinks's filename (e.g. `238dba32.0`, where the `.0` is appended to the hash to create the final filename).
