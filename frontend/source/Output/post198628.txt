Is it possible to open 2 different instances of Chrome with different tabs open? <body> I want to be able to open Chrome on my Mac, and have 2 instances open, each with different tabs.  Is this possible on OS X?  I know on Windows I could do this with Desktop shortcuts.  <answer198630> You do not need two separate instances of Chrome in order to have two windows. OS X works differently than Windows. To open new window in Chrome (or most of the other apps) press kbd⌘/kbd+kbdN/kbd. Chrome restores window states after relaunch if You have this option enabled in preferences.  <answer258758> From the Terminal, you can run:  precodeopen -na "Google Chrome" /code/pre  where code-n/code parameters opens a new instance of the application.  <comment237723> Why You need 2 instances? Can't You have 2 windows open (⌘+N)? <comment237724> But I want them separated. E.G When I start up, I want 5 tabs open on 1 instance, and 3 different ones on another. I.E For 2 different screens. <comment237725> That's exactly what separate windows are for. I have two windows open with different tabs. I close Chrome and reopen it and widnows are back to previous state. <comment237726> @MateuszSzlosek I guess that works. Thanks <comment237730> Likely not. You can probably create a copy of Chrome called say "FrenchiesChrome" and open that instead of Chrome, but once running, it will have the process name Chrome, and use the apple.com.chrome.plist preferences file. Those realities are bound to get you into trouble when you also try to open the original Chrome App. <comment356852> *"You do not need two separate instances of Chrome in order to have two windows.
