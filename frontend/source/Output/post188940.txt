What determines when my Apple Watch uses a haptic tap for a notification? <body> Some notifications on my Apple Watch (e.g. Viber) use a haptic tap when they appear on my Apple Watch. Others (e.g. Facebook) do not. What determines whether a haptic tap is used or not? Is this something I can change?  <comment355516> If it happens consistently on a per-app basis for multiple users, it could be a decision made by the app's developers.
