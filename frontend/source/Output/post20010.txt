Can I create a shortcut to open a specific application on OS X? <body> I want to create a keyboard shortcut to i.e. open Firefox emwhile/em I am working in another application. I know I can use kbdâŒ˜ CMD/kbd+kbdT/kbd when I am in Firefox to open a new tab.   I haven't found a way to create that kind of shortcuts in System Preferences.  Any ideas?  <answer20013> Get Quicksilver, http://www.blacktree.com/, it will allow you to set keyboard shortcuts to open apps. There are actually more many more apps that do this (Alfred, Keyboard Maestro etc etc.)  Mac OS X actually has a built-in way of doing that, but it doesn't work for Firefox, because it doesn't support services! http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20090903085255430  Update Jan 2012: Blacktree no longer updates Quicksilver--the developer went to Google and has released Google Quick Search Box. Quicksilver lives on, but it has a new home at qsapp.com.   <answer20116> h2Karabiner (previously known as KeyRemap4MacBook)/h2  Save a file like this as private.xml:  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt; &lt;root&gt;   &lt;vkopenurldef&gt;     &lt;name&gt;KeyCode::VK_OPEN_URL_Safari&lt;/name&gt;     &lt;url&gt;file:///Applications/Safari.app&lt;/url&gt;   &lt;/vkopenurldef&gt;   &lt;vkopenurldef&gt;     &lt;name&gt;KeyCode::VK_OPEN_URL_iTunes&lt;/name&gt;     &lt;url&gt;file:///Applications/iTunes.app&lt;/url&gt;   &lt;/vkopenurldef&gt;   &lt;vkopenurldef&gt;     &lt;name&gt;KeyCode::VK_OPEN_URL_EMACS&lt;/name&gt;     &lt;url&gt;file:///Applications/Emacs.app&lt;/url&gt;   &lt;/vkopenurldef&gt;   &lt;item&gt;     &lt;name&gt;custom&lt;/name&gt;     &lt;identifier&gt;custom&lt;/identifier&gt;     &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::F11, KeyCode::VK_OPEN_URL_Safari&lt;/autogen&gt;      &lt;!-- change the right option into an extra modifier key --&gt;     &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::OPTION_R, KeyCode::VK_MODIFIER_EXTRA1&lt;/autogen&gt;     &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::I, ModifierFlag::EXTRA1, KeyCode::VK_OPEN_URL_iTunes&lt;/autogen&gt;      &lt;!-- make a short press of the right command open Emacs --&gt;     &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyOverlaidModifier__ KeyCode::COMMAND_R, KeyCode::COMMAND_R, KeyCode::VK_OPEN_URL_EMACS&lt;/autogen&gt;   &lt;/item&gt; &lt;/root&gt; /code/pre  Note that the code&lt;url&gt;/code field uses file URI's so, for example, any spaces in the path or filename should be encoded with code%20/code.  h2Alfred 2/h2  If you have the Powerpack for Alfred 2, you can create a workflow like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HiuoH.jpg" alt=""  Hotkeys have a short delay by default, but you can reduce it by changing the trigger behavior:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/tPgSb.jpg" alt=""  h2Other applications that support assigning shortcuts to opening applications/h2  ul liApptivate/li liBetterTouchTool/li liController Mate/li liKeyboard Maestro/li liKeymando/li liLaunch it!/li liQuicksilver/li /ul  h2Automator services/h2  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/B6UCu.png" alt=""  There has been a bug since 10.7 where the keyboard shortcuts for Automator services don't always work until you hover over the services menu from the menu bar. There is also a relatively long delay before services are run, and the keyboard shortcuts for services don't work when the frontmost application doesn't have a services menu.  <answer20198> h3Alfred/h3  Alfred, in its Power Pack version, can map shortcuts to applications, among many other features.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ya8NF.png" alt=""  <answer38613> If you do not want to use third party apps.br Then you can use Automator (Services ), and the Built in keyboard shortcuts.  Here is how in an answer to a  similar question.  Very simple.  In Step strong3/strong, of creating the service. brSet it to 'any application' .   i.e,br emset Service receives to: 'no input' in 'any application' (Do this by using the drop downs at the top.)/em  <answer100324> I know strongAlfred/strong has already been mentioned, but I thought I'd say a little bit about choosing shortcut keys. It was not obvious to me at first what would be a good set of shortcuts that was (a) easy to remember, (b) easy to use, and (c) did not conflict with other system or application shortcut keys.  I ended up using the "alt" key as the basis, and generally relying on keys that can be triggered by the left hand, and choosing descriptive letters (e.g., x for Excel). this allows you to have the mouse in the right hand and the shortcut keys triggered with the left.  Another benefit of using Alfred Hotkeys to activate an application is that if an application is hidden, it will be unhidden.  Here's a screen shot of how I have it configured: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gVowY.png" alt="example alfred hotkey configuration"  <answer220952> There are plenty of good options here but I wanted to add my personal favorite which I've been using since 10.5 and still works on 10.11.2: strongSpark 3/strong.  http://www.shadowlab.org/Software/spark.php  It's freeware and extremely easy to set up.  Here's the developer's description:     Spark is a powerful, and easy Shortcuts manager. With Spark you can   create Hot Keys to launch applications and documents, execute   AppleScript, control iTunes, and more... You can also export and   import your Hot Keys library, or save it in HTML format to print it.   Spark is free, so use it without moderation!

Was very helpful to me. used Google but didn't find your link. <comment22123> Cool, so you came right? <comment22138> "Yes". Installed Quicksilver (very powerful, certainly better than having just a shortcut). Tried Keyboard Maestro. Now having a rest before learning all these shortcuts ;-) <comment22392> So you mean *keyboard* shortcuts? <comment99166> Look at the Services on the Application menu any reasonably written Cocoa app will have these and they can be assigned keys. Unfortunately I think Firefox is not written to use these. Safari can be used here <comment104162> Be nice to know why there is a down vote on this. Not commenting on down votes is not helpful to anyone <comment110132> http://meta.apple.stackexchange.com/questions/1693/downvoting-etiquette-with-or-without-making-a-comment <comment162411> private.xml WHERE? Anywhere? Does it already exist? I can't find it. Where does it go? <comment199671> Quicksilver is great. Thanks so much for the advice. I created a bash script to open gmail and another to open mysms in the browser. Then I used the appify script to make them OS X apps. From there I could use Quicksilver to have my keyboard shortcuts to launch those. Very nice to have. https://mathiasbynens.be/notes/shell-script-mac-apps <comment290447> This may not have been an option in 2011 when the question was first asked, but it's now pretty easy to do using Automator. See http://www.howtogeek.com/209725/how-to-customize-your-os-x-keyboard-and-add-shortcuts/ for a tutorial. <comment309075> @boulder_ruby, `/Library/Application Support/Karabiner/private.xml`. Or open Karabiner GUI  misc&uninstall tab  "Open private.xml" tab.  I had the exact same difficulty. <comment335482> It's fairly amazing to me that Apple, with its vaunted usability, has not seen it fit to build into MacOS a straightforward way of assigning a key shortcut for launching an application.
