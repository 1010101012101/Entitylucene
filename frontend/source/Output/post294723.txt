USB Stick not Showing Up in System Information <body> I'm trying to connect a 16GB USB Stick to a MBP 2017 version using the Apple USB-C to USB adapter.  The stick works on a Windows HP Laptop. I tried to reformat it to either ex-Fat or FAT 32, but it doesn't show up on the Mac.  It doesn't show up in either Disk Manager or System Information.img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9xwRW.png" alt="enter image description here"  I have another 1GB very old stick lying around that works properly on the MAC, with the adapter. So I would exclude adapter hardware issue or USB-C port issue on the laptop. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Az39d.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment372009> The formatting is not the problem. When the device does not show up on the USB bus, the disk cannot be read by the Mac, and thus the partitioning and formatting of the disk does not matter.
