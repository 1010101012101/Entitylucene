Are their drivers for the Apple Keyboard in Windows 7 64bit?(Bonus point: Where's Print Screen?) <body> I am using the official wired Apple Keyboard with my Windows 7 64bit Desktop, is there a source for official drivers anywhere?  I'm kinda fine with the default setup, but I'd really like the ability to printscreen! I am in the UK, but wouldn't mind switching language if that makes all the keys work in he right place.  <answer15925> I use a Apple Keyboard on W7 Daily.  The key thing is to use a utility that lets you remap the keys.  Personally, I use a little utility called KeyTweak (It's Free!), but there are lots of other alternatives.  This lets you set unused keys to whatever you want - I have F13 set as print-screen, and F14-F19 set as media playback keys (play, pause, etc). It can also let you fix the windows/alt keys so they are in the correct place, if that bothers you.  supThere are a couple of caveats, namely I have yet to find anything that lets you make use of the "fn" and eject keys. However, the additional (unused) F13-F19 keys compensate for that./sup  <answer15934> You can find the drivers in the Mac OS X Install DVD (if you have it) at code\Boot Camp\Drivers\Apple\x64\AppleKeyboardInstaller64.exe/code.  If you do not have the DVD, you will have to remap the keys, as mentioned in Fake Name's answer.  To take a print screen (with the drivers installed), press kbdF13/kbd or kbdFn/kbd+kbdF11/kbd.  <answer154236> This post help me to get the keyboard driver working: Apple Keyboard driver for Windows  <comment17354> Where can I download the Boot Camp drivers? <comment17356> You can't download it. <comment17358> Where there's a will there's a way... <comment17367> You can try to borrow the DVD from someone who owns a Mac.
