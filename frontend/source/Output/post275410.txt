Macbook Pro Kernel panic every x min <body> For a week now, I'm trying to find a solution for my macbook pro mid 2012 and i can't find out what's the reason of the spontaneous reboot every 10 or 30 min. Don't know if it's hardware or software.  I had 2 partition before : bootcamp and mac os x. Everything worked fine for 2 years and suddenly i could not even start on any of them. Blue screen on bootcamp and kernel panic on mac.  So I wiped the partition to start clean, cause even if i wanted to update mac sierra, it would reboot in the middle of installation.  After some tries, the installation assistant installed Mac os x lion but i still have the kernel panic.  I've already tried the pvram, verbose mode and safe mode. Reboots by itself. Does someone have a clue of what could be the problem ?  <comment346466> Please update your question with the kernel panic text.
