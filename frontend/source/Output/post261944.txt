How to open a read-only Excel 2011 Workbook with AppleScript? <body> I have a password protected .xlsx file that I share with a few colleagues via Dropbox. In order to not get constant prompts someone has opened the file with unsaved changes (we don't have to update the contents very often) we configured it to open as read-only by default. I personally open the file a lot, but got annoyed by constantly having to provide the password and to have to click the "Open as read-only?" prompt that follows.  So to improve my productivity I decided to automate this via AppleScript. However I'm now getting to the frustrating point that it is killing my productivity rather than it is helping it. So I turn to you.  I run OS X El Capitan (10.11.6) with Excel 2011 (14.7.0) and with the help of this question I managed to automate the opening of the file and pass it the password. However the "Open as read-only?" prompt is a mystery to me. I've already tried to find out with the Xcode Accessibility Inspector how to talk to the prompt and tell it to click the "yes" button, to no avail.  Furthermore, it won't focus on the Excel window, I don't know if that's due to the prompt or if that is another problem. I've read a lot while immersing myself in AppleScript that the commands and their behaviour can differ a lot between versions of OS X and different versions of applications.  Here's what I have now:   precode-- excel 14.7 set theResult to "" set passwd to "password" set theWbpath to "/path/file.xlsx" -- not sure why, but I do not need the full path in order to open the file set theWb to "file.xlsx" -- example file set theSheet to "Sheet1" -- also not needed for this example, maybe in the future tell application "Microsoft Excel"     set theResult to Â¬         open workbook workbook file name theWb password passwd     tell application "System Events" to tell process "Microsoft Excel" -- this is my attempt to restore the focus before I try to communicate with the prompt, also to no avail         activate     end tell end tell /code/pre  I would like to add that I have already tried doing what the person in this one did without success.  <comment328323> Thanks for the grammar update, do you have an answer for me aswell? <comment328944> Sorry, no I do not have an answer for you as I use LibreOffice Calc for my spreadsheets and do not have Microsoft Excel to test the code against. I switched to Mac over 10 years ago to get away from all things Microsoft and have no real need for Windows anymore.
