How to make Energy Saver Schedule to Shutdown when logged out <body> I have an iMac with the Energy Saver schedule to turn off at a specific time and then restart in the morning. It does not work if I am logged out. How do I make it work if no one is logged in?  <answer182106> You can use the codepmset repeat/code commands in Terminal to accomplish this:  codepmset repeat shutdown MTWRFSU 11:00:00/code will shutdown at 11AM.  codepmset repeat wakeorpoweron MTWRFSU 23:00:00/code will boot (or wake from sleep) at 11PM.
