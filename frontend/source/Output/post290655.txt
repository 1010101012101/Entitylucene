Every time I restart the computer the link for Atom stops working <body> I use the Atom editor and I like to open it from the command line. For that purpose I execute the following line:  precodeln -s /Applications/Atom.app/Contents/Resources/app/atom.sh /usr/local/bin/atom /code/pre  The problem is that if I restart the computer, the link stops working, so I have to delete the file  precoderm /usr/local/bin/atom /code/pre  and execute the first line to create the link again. I don't understand why this happens.  <answer290668> I tried it myself and it worked perfectly, even after a reboot. Do you have multiple disks/partitions in you set up?  Anyway, to settle things once and for all, I suggest you to follow the steps pointed out here. Below is a copy&amp;paste.  With the Atom editor open, in the menu bar:  Click Atom  Install Shell Commands  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rL5My.png" alt="enter image description here"  You should expect to see:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GOHQN.png" alt="enter image description here"  You do not need to restart the terminal.  If this solution didn't work, my last suggestion is to create an alias in your code~/.bash_profile/code. To do this, simply open code~/.bash_profile/code with a text editor and add somewhere the line:  codealias atom='open -a Atom'/code  This should do the trick.  strongEDIT/strong  I noticed that after a reboot, you must start Atom at least once before the codeatom/code command works - otherwise it won't be recognized as a command. I didn't notice it before because, while testing if the codeln -s .../code solution worked, I already opened Atom once. I honestly don't have a clue why this happens, but the last suggestion about adding an alias definitely solves this issue.  <comment366922> What does `less /usr/local/bin/atom` show after a reboot? And `ls -l /usr/local/bin/atom /Applications/Atom.app/Contents/Resources/app/atom.sh`? <comment367603> sorry, it did not really worked. When I restart the computer it does not work anymore and I have the same behaviour as before <comment367644> Did you try the "alias" solution? <comment367707> sorry I didn't realize the alias solution, it worked. However, I will try to understand why the ```ln -s``` is not working. Thank you very much
