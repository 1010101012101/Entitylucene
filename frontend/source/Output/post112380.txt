In Mavericks, is it possible to use Enhanced Dictation from the command line? <body> A use case is: I have a recording in AIFF or MP3 format, and I'd like a text version of it as Enhanced Dictation would have recognized it if I had spoken it myself.  <answer116395> Copy the MP3 file to an iPod &amp; play it into Dictation via line in source (or the mic?)... Not the answer to your question, but it might work for your task :)  <comment136141> Hackish! :-) I want to use it from the command line in order to automatise it.
