How to clear the settings of default app to the files with special file extension? <body> I set the default app to open the files with special file extension by mistake: the app could not open them at all for they're only file fragments (or, say, no app can until I combine them as one file).  brSo I want to clean the settings of default app (set no default app), but no solutions found. Any ideas? Hope for your answers!  <answer151706> It's free, and configurable per extension.  http://www.rubicode.com/Software/RCDefaultApp/  <answer151744> For changing default app (no option to clean the setting tho):  ol liIf you don't have a file with that specific extension - create one./li liRight click on it - get info./li liSet "Open with" and click "Change All" button right under it./li /ol  All files with that extension will now be opened by that app.  <comment178696> OMG. Then I could not clean the setting of default app? What sad story. <comment178697> I have a question: where is the setting stored? a plist file? or not? <comment178704> The app you mentioned sounds interesting. I tried it and set the default app to 'DoNothing', then uninstall it; then the default app is null, and no app will try to open the 'special' files. Nice solution, but not the best one. Thanks for your answer! <comment179070> I guess so, but couldn't find the correct file atm. Anyway, IIRC preferences are now cached and I've seen some people having problems figuring out proper plist files for their needs :/
