My Mac gives me a black screen after logging into one account, but not another <body> Whenever I start my MacBook (mid 2009, running OS X El Capitan 10.11.6), like any normal day, I click on my main account and log in.   Today, when I tried typing in my password, it let me in as usual but I get nothing but a black screen with the spinning beachball cursor. However, I can log in to my other account perfectly fine.   I've tried booting into safe mode and logging in but it just gives me the same result. I've also run First Aid on the disk, but that didn't resolve the issue either.  How can I troubleshoot this further?  <answer289132> You may have a login item on the account that is hanging for some reason. Try holding down the shift key when you log in to the account and seeing if you can get it. If so, go to the accounts preferences and take a look at the login items for that account and see if you see something you don't recognize or that's new and try removing it from the list.  <comment365211> Failing that I would move the contents of the "~/[USER]/Library/preferences" folder to the desktop and reboot. It may also be a damaged preference file. <comment365212> When logging in while holding shift it still brings me to blackscreen, cant do anything just a cursor. <comment365213> @Ineedhelp I would then follow the advice above from Steve Chambers and see if that helps, you should be able to do that from the terminal in the account you can log into, as long as that account is an administrator. <comment365306> Have you tried checking the logs from the other account? This is obviously something with the user account profile that's gone bad. Could be startup item, launchagent, launchdaemon or a preference for a finder function
