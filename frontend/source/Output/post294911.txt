Macbook Pro won't charge or turn on <body> My Macbook Pro battery was dying and would not hold a charge. Eventually it entirely stopped charging and the computer wouldn't turn on.  I assumed this meant that the battery was dead, so I bought a new battery and replaced it myself.  After replacing the battery, however, the computer still is not charging (no light on my mag charger) or turning on. I tried cleaning the charging port with a brush but that did not do anything.  I know it is not an issue with the charger since it works on my other laptop.  Any thoughts on next steps? Is it time to dump the computer?  Thanks, Ben  <comment372200> Hey Ben, could you provide us with the type of Macbook and the amount of Watts that the charger supplies? Is it possible to get your hands on another charger?
