Can't format new SSHD? <body> I just got a new SSHD, but when I tried to put it in my early 2011 13" MBP and format it from a bootable drive, Disk Utility kept giving me the error message:  codecould not mount disk0s2 with name (null) after erase/code  How can I fix this?  <comment251737> You need to erase and format it, before you can mount it. <comment251739> @IronCraftMan I know. I got that output as the result of telling it to erase and format, presumably as it was trying to mount itself after having been erased.
