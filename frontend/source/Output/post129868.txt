Mavericks: notifications no longer displaying <body> I recently upgraded to Mavericks (download from app store).  Before this upgrade, I could click on the the notifications UI element at the very top-right of the display; this would cause the whole screen to shift to the left and display a list of notifications:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LhpsO.png" alt="enter image description here"  Now, after the upgrade, this UI element simply turns blue during the mousedown, and nothing else happens.  Are there any known fixes or workarounds to this?  hr  I should add I am experiencing a similar but not identical issue with the spotlight UI element:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zDK38.png" alt="enter image description here"  When I click on this one, I just get a "bonk" sound and no spotlight search bar.  strongemHowever/em/strong I can use spotlight without problems from finder windows, etc.  hr  I don't know, but I'm guessing these two issues may be related simply because of their proximity on the screen.  Other taskbar UI elements appear to be working normally.  <answer129881>    First, check your settings in System Preferences  Notifications. You may have Do Not Disturb enabled.      For com.apple.notificationcenterui.plist. It's located in your user library, not root level where you may be looking.      Open the Finder. From the Finder menu bar click Go  Go to Folder      Type or copy paste the following:      ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.notificationcenterui.plist      Click Go then move the com.apple.notificationcenterui.plist file to the Trash.      Restart your Mac.      I can't locate the com.apple.soagent.plist in either user or root.      If deleting the com.apple.notificationui.plist file did not help, reinstall OS X   OS X Mavericks: Reinstall OS X      That will reinstall any missing system files required for the Notification center.   From https://discussions.apple.com/message/25351691#25351691  <comment152054> Launch /Applications/Utilities/Activity Monitor and search for "Notification Center." Select it and quit it using the Stop button in the upper left corner.  Any changes? <comment152056> @thankyour No changes <comment152057> If you launch /Applications/Utilities/Console, show the log list on the left side (click upper left "Show Log List" if you don't see it) and drop down both User and System Diagnostic Reports.  Any crashes in there? <comment152059> Ah, thanks for adding the Spotlight bit.  Try doing exactly what you did before in Activity Monitor, except do it with "SystemUIServer" instead of Notification Center.  Any luck? <comment152061> @thankyour Still no change after killing "SystemUIServer".  I do see crash logs in the console viewer, but for apparently unrelated apps: AgentService, bash, Cisco Jabber, Chrome, Outlook, powerstats and vmware vmx (fusion) <comment152062> Does this issue happen from every user logged in on the system?  Or just one user? <comment152066> @thankyour Apparently only for this user <comment152067> @thankyour Hmm.  After switching back I now see that spotlight ***is*** working, but notifications still is not :-/ <comment152078> let us [continue this discussion in chat](http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/14365/discussion-between-thankyour-and-digitaltrauma) <comment152079> @DigitalTrauma try typing this in terminal: `launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchAgents /com.apple.notificationcenterui.plist` from Applications  Utilities  Terminal <comment152081> @shub "launchctl: Couldn't stat("/com.apple.notificationcenterui.plist"): No such file or directory".  A quick google search found this https://discussions.apple.com/message/25351691#25351691.  I followed these instructions and now notifications seems to be working again!  Thanks! <comment152084> @DigitalTrauma. Great! I've added it as an answer now - the one without an error message :-)
