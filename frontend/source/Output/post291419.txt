Sprint iPhone SE on GSM Network (like AT&T) <body> I bought a discounted iPhone SE from Virgin Mobile (Sprint) which uses model A1723 which is supposed to be the "global" model at least based on the LTE bands.  I, however, cannot locate anywhere if the Sprint model contains both a CDMA and GSM chip or if it only contains a CDMA chip.  I've checked: https://www.apple.com/iphone/LTE/#iphone-se which seems to indicate that there are 2 editions of model A1723.  Specs lists both GSM and CDMA bands in the list: https://www.apple.com/iphone-se/specs/ But also says "Cellular technology support is based on iPhone model number and configuration for either CDMA or GSM networks."  It's further unclear to me if configured means unlockable or not available.  Is anyone in possession of a Sprint iPhone A1723 that can try to stick an AT&amp;T sim in it and make a call?  (Note: T-Mobile uses LTE for all voice calls now so working on T-Mobile for voice calls does not prove GSM compatibility.)
