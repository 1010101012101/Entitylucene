MacBook Pro 2014 not booting after El Capitan 10.11 update <body> I seem to be having this weird issue where my MacBook won't boot up after installing the OS X 10.11, El Capitan, update.   It goes to the login screen and once I login the bar freezes and I can't go further.   I have tried doing an over the top reinstall and that seems to have done nothing.   I have repaired permission (first aid) in disk utility and that seems to have done nothing.   I am more than happy to do a clean restore. But is there ANY WAY for me to get my data out?  Please. If anybody could help me id appreciate it.   <answer213383> Yes - you have many options to back up a Mac that won't start.  ul liyou can start the Mac in Target Disk mode and connect it to another Mac to do the backup. /li liyou can bring a USB drive and use internet recovery to install a working OS on to the new drive. Boot to that and then perform the backup./li liyou can get help at https//locate.apple.com/li liyou can even try reinstalling the OS on top of your current OS. That might fail and might make things worse if the problem is a hardware issue (failing hardware) so I've listed this last./li /ul  Which you choose depends on your expertise, amount of time you care to invest, speed of your network and whether you can isolate emwhy/em the Mac isn't starting. Knowing that might allow a more surgical repair instead of starting over. I'd say get a backup and then decide how to fix things as a follow on step.  <comment257625> If I was to install OS X on an external drive and boot from that drive, am I able to access the OSX hard drive or is that not possible because it's encrypted? <comment257633> @RandomMath You will be asked for a password to decrypt the drive. Booting from another OS won't lock you out if you know one admin password.
