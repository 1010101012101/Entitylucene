Preferences/General - How do I get it to save in Lion? <body> I don't want my apps to open previous windows.  When I go into Prefs/General and unclick "Restore windows when quitting...," and close preferences, it doesn't save it.  When I re-open Prefs/General, it's checked again.  I can't change the preferences in anything.  Safari keeps opening the same last two windows and when I go into Safari Preferences and change "New tabs open with:" to 'Home Page'; once I close and open up again, it's back to 'Top Sites.'  <answer104097> Need to reset permissions?

Can you open Console.app, reproduce this, and report any error messages that appear in Console? <comment26032> bneely...sorry that's out of my league.  I can open Console.app (why are there two?) but after that I'm staring at a box of rocks.  This is a new MacBook Air and I have been having some permissions problems that were caused when the Apple Store created a "test" account to transfer files. Might be time for another one-to-one visit. Thanks! <comment26090> I would check ~/Library/ and ~/Library/Preference's permissions so you can read and write, because that's where all the preferences are stored.
