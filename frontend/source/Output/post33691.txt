show or copy password instead of dots in application <body> In windows i had a program to inspect the password that i stored in filezilla. But I forgot my ftp password I can still see the dots but I want to see what the password was that I stored.  Is there anything like that for the mac?  I found a solution for filezilla.  In the filezilla menu use "file-Export". Save the file to a location  An XML file is generated with al the ftp sites entry's  Open the file with a browser and you should be able to see the passwords  <answer33692> Yes, of course. Try finding your "Keychain"-program,which is in the Utilities folder within the Applications folder.br After entering you admin pass, you can view all the passwords stored by your Mac. WiFi passwords, website-logins,...  <comment38442> hmm that's handy! I can find back my wifi pass :) but not able to find the passwords in my filezilla yet. any idea under which category i should look? <comment38443> Normally they are stored as "Internet Access Passwords". Try to search for the ftp or site you are trying to access from Filezilla. <comment38444> looked under all category's and keychains searched under username and ftp server name ( ftp.myserver.com ) there doesn't seams to be an entry of filezilla <comment38445> And are you sure the passwords are filled in automatically when you connect using Filezilla? <comment38447> Jep I have filled them in in my 'site manager' i can connect to my ftp servers just by clicking and passwords are set and needed for a ftp connection. I think they are not stored in the keychain
