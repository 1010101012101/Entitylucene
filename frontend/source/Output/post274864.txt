Icons disappearing from cmd+tab application switcher <body> When using my MacBook for a while (Sierra, 10.12.3) then using cmd+tab to switch applications, I sometimes lose application icons. In the screenshot below, it's limited to Chrome but multiple applications will disappear at a time.  I can get the icons back temporarily by restarting or running codekillall -KILL Dock/code but I'd like a more permanent solution.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/SwGFb.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <comment346786> Already tried [Reset icon cache](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/225024/reset-icon-cache-on-macbook)? <comment347128> I hadn't tried that but gave it a shot to no avail. <comment347466> See if you can isolate it to your account vs system wide issue by attempting to recreate the issue in another user account. I suppose the guest account suffices, but the best test would be to make another "test" account with admin privileged. What results?
