How can I view (not download) iPhone pictures on a Mac screen? <body> I have an iPhone 5 with various photos. I have a Mac desktop running OS X Yosemite.  Is there a way to view a fullscreen slideshow of the photos on the Mac display?  I don't want to download the photos, just flip through them for display on the big screen.  <answer170578> To view the pictures on the camera roll on your iPhone:   1. Plug in your iPhone to your Mac.   2. Open iPhoto.   3. Your iPhone appears in the Devices list on the iPhoto sidebar.   4. Browse your pictures.  iPhoto does not provide a slideshow of the pictures on your iPhone, though.  <answer170582> Apple's mandated solution would be to wait for the photos to upload to your Photo Stream or iCloud Photo Library, then start a slideshow in iPhoto or Aperture.  Alternatively, you could make your Mac into an AirPlay receiver using a 3rd party app such as AirSquirrel's Reflector. This one is paid, but I'm not aware of any free equivalent.  <comment200530> check this out http://www.airserver.com/
