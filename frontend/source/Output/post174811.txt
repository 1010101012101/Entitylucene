ss (netstat alternative) for OS X <body> How do I install ss on OS X? I couldn't find the iproute package in homebrew.     Red Hat recommends ss over netstat in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.    ss is provided by the iproute package.   Red Hat Docs  <answer174816> In order to get codess/code, you would need to get the source code for codeiproute/code. Since you mention Red Hat linux, go onto a linux machine running Red Hat, and run the following command:  precodesudo yum source iproute /code/pre  Now, copy over the source code to your Mac, and compile it.  You could also go on the Red Hat packages site and get the source tarball.  emNote: I have not tested this, but this is the normal way to get source code./em  <comment205944> To whoever downvoted this, why? <comment205945> If you don't get a good answer for your needs - please edit the question to describe the function you need ss to perform. There is likely a tool on OS X that ships natively to get you what you actually need. <comment205977> Is there a reason you can't use netstat for your purpose? It comes with OS X as far as I know. <comment370344> Most likely this won't work. `iproute2` relies on functionality in the Linux kernel. There is https://github.com/brona/iproute2mac but it's not clear if that will get you ss. <comment370345> Also see https://superuser.com/a/898971/457084 <comment370346> Given that `ifconfig` is deprecated and will be removed from most Linux distribution defaults, it makes sense that someone would want the `ip` commands to enforce good habits. `brew install iproute2mac` as suggested at https://superuser.com/a/898971/457084 gets you closer <comment372155> Makes sense -- thanks for adding that.
