Pages 4.3 crashes on iMac Late 2013 Mavericks <body> Pages 4.3 (latest update for iWork '09 afaik) constantly crashes (closes and shows "unexpectly quit" crash report) on a new iMac 27" (Late 2013) running 10.9 (.2) Mavericks The crashes seem to be comepletely intermittent. Sometimes when writing, pasting text, dragging images.  Here are some crash reports: http://pastebin.com/xTszDwNG (latest one, this one was when a image was dragged into pages) http://pastebin.com/k9NsMFpt http://pastebin.com/kYxh71np http://pastebin.com/TUMQctDL  The latest one: http://pastebin.com/g142aypG  This one happened after I completely reinstalled the machine (formatted the drive, installed mavericks over restore partition, created a new user, installed iwork from disc and installed 4.3 update and then dragged over my personal documents via a usb drive)  strongEDIT/strong I ended up updating to the new versions of pages since I couldn't get the bug to be fixed.  <answer124421> Slightly off topic, but with Mavericks installed, you can update to Pages 5.1 for no charge and maybe your problem will not occur.  http://www.macworld.com/article/2056159/what-you-need-to-know-about-apples-free-apps-policy.html  <comment145197> Is this happening with just 1 file or all old files? Also am I to understand that this wasn't an issue until after you reinstalled? Or did you have the issue and then reinstall? <comment145198> this happens on all kinds of files newly created empty ones, newly created from a template or even ones that other people sent <comment145214> To check if it was just a general Mavericks based bug, I opened Pages 4.3 (1048) and tried some of your actions. My version (on 10.9.2) does not crash. <comment145216> The crashes are very intermittent, sometimes i can work for a few hours without pages crashing. As an additional info: it can't be a hardware issue. The mac has been cloned onto a same-model iMac (except with a fusion drive). That one had the same issues. <comment145217> Ok, I only tested for like 10 minutes, I'll leave it running for a while. <comment145417> Leaving Pages4.3 open for hours and interacting with it from time to time did not cause it to crash on my machine. (Just trying to make sure there isn't a generic PagesMavericks interaction causing a crash) It can still be a software issue, e.g. some setting that is causing it. <comment145543> Since the imac was freshly reinstalled with only mail, pages and office in the use - everything is as default as it can possibly be <comment168007> Think very carefully before upgrading to 5.1 Pages. It is very greatly disliked by 9 out of 10 users (Wikipedia). It removes many useful features.
