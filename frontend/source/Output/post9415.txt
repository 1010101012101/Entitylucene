Count the number of open windows <body> Is there a tool to count the number of windows I have open, including on all Spaces?  I am curious and too lazy to do it manually. :)  <answer9416> I guess this AppleScript should do:  precodeset numberOfWindows to "0"  tell application "System Events"     set allProcesses to application processes     repeat with i from 1 to number of allProcesses         tell process i             set numberOfWindows to (numberOfWindows + (count windows))         end tell     end repeat end tell /code/pre  <comment9940> Lol: tell app "System Events" to count windows of processes <comment9953> @l-ri I made my statement deliberately more verbose, given that other users usually want to incorporate more than just a count of all processes´ windows and thus might learn more this way - but true, your version is shorter. Don´t get how your Lol is supposed to be helpful, though. <comment9980> OK, so I paste that into the AppleScript editor and I get: 'error "System Events got an error: Access for assistive devices is disabled."' How do I enable it? For applications that I've installed previously that needed this, the app itself prompts me. "Enable access for assistive devices" is enabled in my system preferences. <comment9984> You can check whether it´s enabled by running `tell application "System Events" to get UI elements enabled`. You can enable it by adding `tell application "System Events" to set UI elements enabled to true` in the beginning of the script; though it seems strange for me, that it seems to be already enabled in your case. <comment10223> OK, so `tell application "System Events" to get UI elements enabled` returns `true`, but the error above still happens, even with adding the enabler line you suggest to the beginning.
