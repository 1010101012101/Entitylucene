Default chart colors Keynote showroom <body> I want to find out what are the default colors of a 3D bar chart in emShowroom/em layout on keynote. When you add a new chart, you get this colors: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GKntW.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  But I was unable to find them in the colors palette.  <answer87214> I had a look at the internals of a fresh Showroom layout Keynote file (it's a zipped folder actually). Inside, there is a codeindex.apxl/code file which contains lots of data .. also color data. I wrote this short Ruby script to make a quick-and-dirty html file with all colors used in the Keynote document:  pre class="lang-rb prettyprint-override"code#!/usr/bin/env ruby  puts "&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;&lt;html lang=\"en-us\"&gt;&lt;body&gt;" file = IO.read("index.apxl") # slurp apxl file  # iterate through file and convert color info to 8-bit integer: file.scan(/sfa:[rgb]=\"(\d\.?\d*)\"\s+sfa:[rgb]=\"(\d\.?\d*)\"\s+sfa:[rgb]=\"(\d\.?\d*)\"/) do |w|    r = (w[0].to_f*255).to_i   g = (w[1].to_f*255).to_i   b = (w[2].to_f*255).to_i   puts "&lt;div style=\"width:100px;height:100px;float:left;background:rgb(#{r}, #{g}, #{b});\"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;" end  puts "&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;" # close html /code/pre  After pruning duplicate lines, this is the visual result of the process.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7RAH9.png" alt="color palette"  These colors are used in the default Showroom layout. You can now select (one click) the strongindividual/strong same-colored areas of a bar graph (here: grey or red).  In the graphics inspector (img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ocrXn.png" alt="graphics inspector") you can change the colors according to your wishes. Pick the colors from above graphic with the color picker like this:    img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5Bu8q.png" alt="color picker magnifying glass"  <comment101895> Wow, cool, but can you select this color for a chart? Because it standard chart color options I didn't see ones <comment101941> I have updated my answer. Hope this helps!
