iOS 8.4 shuffle plays the same song <body> Ever since I installed iOS 8.4 I've had a problem with my music app.  I have 4,123 songs and previously on shuffle mode the display would show as 1 of 4,123 and it was not possible to play a song again unless I refreshed the shuffle setting.  With the new shuffle feature there is nothing to prevent a song being played two or three times before I reset the shuffle mode.  This is very annoying! This is more noticeable when Im shuffling a playlist. Can anything be done or is this a bug?  <comment241801> If you skip a song half way through (or even in the last few seconds), it will be re-added to the upcoming song-list. This could be the case, or perhaps you have duplicates in your library.
