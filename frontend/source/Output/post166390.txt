How to check my iCloud text messages? <body> Can anyone tells me how to view my text messages on iCloud? I know that iCloud will back up my messages on my iPhone 5S, and I am very curious about checking the iCloud messages. Is there any solution?  <answer166396> You can only access your messages on an iOS device or on a Mac with the Messages app. You cannot access the messages through iCloud.com on the web.
