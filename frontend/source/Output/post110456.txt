Could I trust such a FlashPlayer update? <body> On the same track than this old question: How do I tell if the Flash Player Installer is a virus?  I see a new proposal regularly poping up during my web browsing:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/OPeg3.png" alt="FlashPlayer update proposal popup"  Nothing within this installer tells me which version is here proposed.  If I check within:  precodeAdobe Flash Player Player Install Manager &gt; About Adobe Flash Player Install Manager /code/pre  I can see that this is the version: code11.8.800.168/codebr img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GoRmP.png" alt="FlashPlayer Install Manager version"  At the same time, the actual version distributed on one of the official Adobe web servers:  precodehttp://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/ /code/pre  is announcing Version code11.9.900.152/code.  hr How may I verify the seriousness and origin of the popup window I got?  How may I check the version which is proposed to install on my system?  If I can't get a simple answer to these 2 fundamental security questions (which are more extreme since we know how Adobe consider security questions), how may I get rid of such unusable popups ?  <answer110457> Unfortunately, if you're going to trust Adobe and their distribution of the Flash plugins, this is what you're going to get.  Many users are now removing Flash and trusting Google to keep the plugins current in Chrome, but this has the same level of security through obscurity.  If you're serious about these updates, you could close the window and go directly to Adobe to check your version and manually download updates: http://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/find-version-flash-player.html.  Best of luck!   <answer110464> Verify the authenticity of the disk image using either MD5 or SHA1 checksum. Here are both for the latest Adobe Flash Player disk image at time of writing:  ul liMD5 codefaa46444c70d6b21fcad27472d1684c7/code/li liSHA1 code9a0af6e02e13fe00d2f4a72d6cc54797eadae20d/code/li /ul  To find the MD5/SHA1 of your download, run the following Terminal commands:  precodeopenssl md5 /path/to/dmg openssl sha1 /path/to/dmg /code/pre    precode$ openssl md5 /Users/NB/Downloads/AdobeFlashPlayerInstaller_11_ltrosxd_aaa_aih.dmg MD5 (/Users/NB/Downloads/AdobeFlashPlayerInstaller_11_ltrosxd_aaa_aih.dmg)= faa46444c70d6b21fcad27472d1684c7 $ openssl sha1 /Users/NB/Downloads/AdobeFlashPlayerInstaller_11_ltrosxd_aaa_aih.dmg SHA1(/Users/NB/Downloads/AdobeFlashPlayerInstaller_11_ltrosxd_aaa_aih.dmg)= 9a0af6e02e13fe00d2f4a72d6cc54797eadae20d /code/pre  <comment130119> This sort of begs the question: how can you trust _any_ update to a product that has had so many updates that are intended to fix security. At what point do we say "you've taken enough attempts at fixing security bugs, we don't trust you anymore"? (assuming you trust the binary came from where it should have in the first place). <comment130188> Where may one find the original checksums for a given version number? My hunt for them on http://www.adobe.com was a total failure. <comment135216> I wish I had a better answer than to avoid the software entirely. From the web page settings manager, to the difficulty to source a verifiable download from Adobe directly, to the amount of side-loading of threats, not to mention how flash itself has a long history of being a very insecure thing to have running itself make me hard pressed to give a good answer here.
