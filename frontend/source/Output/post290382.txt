Map network drive on Mac server from Windows with Open Directory user <body> We got an office with primarily Macs on the network, with a Mac server for file sharing using Open Directory network user accounts.  I wish to help one Windows user to access the Mac file server. I have created a user account for them, but Windows says invalid password when I try to map the network drive.  Do I need to include the domain in the username or something? I am sure the password is correct, I've just set it to a very simple one for testing.  ul limacOS: 10.11.6 El Capitan/li liServer: 5.2/li liWindows: 10/li /ul  <comment366547> Please add the version of macOS Server (e.g. 5.2) and the Windows version (e.g. Windows 10 Pro) <comment366683> @klanomath added version for macOS, Server and Windows.
