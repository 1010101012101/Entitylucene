Cydia wont let me restart springboard! (Stuck on loading) <body> I am an IOS 9.0.2 user on my iPod Touch 6g !  I recently jailbroke and am having great trouble with Cydia at the moment.  Every time I download and install a tweak Cydia gets stuck on the loading screen and won't let me allow to restart springboard! When I force restart my iPod touch the icons don't show up.  Any way I could get this loading screen to fix!  I don't have terminal or RAT ! I just can't download them. Cydia wont allow me to do it!  <comment256911> I don't know if this will work on iOS 9, but I was able to repsring without a jailbreak on iOS 8 using this method : http://www.iphonefaq.org/archives/972380 . If this method won't do the trick you may consider reinstalling iOS 9.0.2 and rejailbreaking your device
