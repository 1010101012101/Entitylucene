How to disable spotlight for Alfred <body> I use Alfred instead of spotlight but sometimes I accidentally press cmd + space( Spotlight Shortcut ) instead of double shift( Alfred Shortcut ). I want to disable Spotlight( shortcut + not run it in background as well )  so might not open it. Also, does Alfred use spotlight file indexing if codeyes/code then I might not want to disable that but if codeno/code I would like to disable that as well.   <answer177987> In the "System Preferences" app select "Spotlight" from the top row. Now, uncheck the box titled "Spotlight search keyboard shortcut:"  I set the Alfred keyboard shortcut to kbdCommand/kbd-kbdSpace/kbd, which works a bit like Alfred on stock Yosemite machines.  If you want to keep the ability to search Spotlight with a keyboard shortcut, you could also change the shortcut using the popup menu to the right of the checkbox.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/damvM.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment210752> what about fileIndexing does Alfred use spotlight's fileIndexing ? <comment210755> Yes it does. You are not turning off spotlight, just the keyboard shortcut. <comment251853> Disabling file indexing: http://osxdaily.com/2011/12/10/disable-or-enable-spotlight-in-mac-os-x-lion/
