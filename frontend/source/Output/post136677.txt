How to fix permissions with Repair Disk Permissions? <body> I just installed Xcode 5.1 and the latest round of updates. I followed that with a emRepair Disk Permissions/em. For some reason, Apple installs its software with broken permissions.  I then ran emRepair Disk Permissions/em (emApplications → Utilities → Disk Utility/em):  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/W2qjD.png" alt="enter image description here"  Now, XQuartz will not start:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9MT5h.png" alt="enter image description here"  In the above, Xquartz cannot write to code/tmp/code after the permission repair because emRepair Disk Permissions/em remove codew/code from the link.  It appears the permissions in emDisk Utility/em are broken out of the box, too. How does one modify the permission used by emDisk Utility/em so that the utility will not break an installation? Is there a plist somewhere that can be tweaked?  I've been suffering these types of problems for years. Its like a death from 10,000 cuts. Why does Apple emnot/em test their software before unleashing it on unsuspecting users?  <comment162211> Are you asking how to change permissions on tmp or how to change the expected permissions on tmp? <comment162212> I just checked the permissions of my /tmp and it is 733, same as your example. <comment162213> Thanks @Fyrefly - I'd like to know how to modify the permissions used/applied by Disk Utility. I expect its in a plist or data file somewhere. If they are hard coded into Disk Utility, then I'm probably out of luck. <comment162214> Its my understanding Disk Utility references    /Library/Receipts       for installed software, I don't know what it references for base system files. <comment162298> My Mac used to always mess up the /tmp write permissions by itself, causing copy/paste and dragging to stop working. It doesn't anymore, and I don't know why.
