Connect to Server as guest from command line <body> I have a SAMBA share I mount on my Mac from time to time. I do this in Finder with codeGo &gt; Connect to Server.../code, typing codesmb://192.168.1.1/code into the Server Address field and pressing Connect. On the authentication dialog I choose to Connect Guest, and finally my remote share is mounted in code/Volumes/&lt;share_name&gt;/code. This is great.  Can I achieve all of the above with a single command in Terminal? I tried some variations of the advice provided here, but there are two things missing:  ul lihow do I instruct codemount/code to connect as guest?/li lihow do I create the code/Volumes/&lt;share_name&gt;/code directory on the fly, (so it doesn't have to exist before hand)?/li /ul  Thanks!  <answer10843> In order to mount as "guest" you need to use another command: mount_smbfs  precodemount_smbfs -N //guest@server/share /some/existing/path /code/pre  The "-N" is "don't ask for password" (type man mount_smbfs for more info).  As for the second part of how to create it on the fly (the path) I believe that it's not possible. The emmount/em command doesn't create it on the fly and even the man pages mention the "correct" way is to mkdir first then mount.   See the man page for mount_smbfs.  <comment11324> I believe you meant "so it doesn't have to **exist** beforehand" ? <comment11325> Also, see http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/697/115 <comment11326> @Mart√≠n good catch, I fixed the typo. The question you link to doesn't address the "connect as guest" issue, though. <comment11331> Thanks for digging up the `-N` argument, that's what I was looking for. The creation/removal of the destination directory I can work around in a script. <comment11334> @Mike You're welcome.
