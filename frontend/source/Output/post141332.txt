Mount smb share as local directory <body> I want to use GIT and directory should be on a network drive (mounted with codesmb:///code). Because the software I'm using only supports the codefile:///code protocol I need some kind of mapping the network share as a local drive on Mac OS X 10.9. How can that be managed?  <answer141336> You need to understand how mounting works. In short what you want is to:  ol liMount your codesmb:///code drive on a certain location./li liUse your codefile:///code command as you always do./li /ol  When you use 'Connect to Server' - kbdâŒ˜/kbdkbdK/kbd, your drive should be mounted somewhere in code/Volumes//code. So now you can use codefile://Volumes/drive-name/code.  For normal use, like this, a mounted network filesystems can be treated just like a 'local' file system. There is no difference in use.  emHow to mount network drives automatically is another story and can be found on SO, for example https://superuser.com/a/367730/246895/em  <comment166533> Do you see the mounted Samba volume under `/Volumes/NAME-OF-DRIVE`? <comment166538> The `/Volumes/` helped me out here. Thanks for your detailed answer. <comment166539> If your are not afraid for the terminal, you can use the `mount` command to find mount pionts.
