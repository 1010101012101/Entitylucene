El Capitan: suddenly can't write to /tmp <body> I have a Macbook Pro with Mac OS X 10.11.6; after a reboot yesterday, suddenly I can't write on code/tmp/code (which is of course a symlink to code/private/tmp/code) anymore.  The Unix permissions are correct, but codels -l@ /private/tmp/code says codecom.apple.rootless/code. I have no idea how it was before.  Of course, codesudo xattr -d com.apple.rootless /private/tmp/code fails.  So, how can I fix this?  Also, if anyone can explain how this might have happened, I would be appreciative.  <comment322111> Welcome to ask different.
