No Adobe Program Installs on MacBook Pro Retina with El Capitan <body> I am having this very strange problem with Adobe programs.  I reinstalled OSX on my macbook and I tried to install adobe programs however I keep getting the error in the screen shot. I have researching and nothing seems to fix it  Would anyone be able to help?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/VUtRw.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment257798> Please add a screenshot or quote from the **error summary** <comment257801> @TheBro21 - Just now while trying to reinstall i get the error "A12E1" <comment257804> A12E1 means download error. Could this be of any help? https://forums.adobe.com/thread/1045283 <comment257806> I have also used Creative cloud to download and a manual download of different programs. And I get the same problem. Apparently my drive is case sensitive? I'm not sure what that means <comment257813> Case sensitive means that capitals make a difference. In non case sensitive devices, **Example** is the same as **example** or **eXaMpLe**
