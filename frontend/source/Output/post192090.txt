Is it possible to extend Quick Look to support h.265? <body> H.265 (or HEVC) is the official successor to H.264, with a significant reduction in bitrate for the same picture quality.  However it's not supported widely yet, including in Quicktime, iTunes or Quick Look in the Finder (cmd+space) and I haven't seen anyone talking about support in OSX 10.11 (El Capitan).  I can view files in, for example, VLC, but was wondering if there's any sort of plugin for Quick Look.  <answer192101> QuickLook's API is not all that great. It's meant for documents that can be displayed in a single frame, like text or photographs. There is no way that I know of (or apparently anyone else) to have QuickLook play movies. Apple obviously can, but they're clearly using APIs that the rest of us do not have access to.  <answer194028> QLVideo can display metadata, thumbnails and emstatic/em QuickLook previews of H.265 video (as long as the H.265 stream is packaged within a suitable container e.g. .mkv, .ts, etc).  Given the architecture of the QuickLook and QuickLookUI frameworks only Apple can add support for emplayable/em QuickLook previews. There's some discussion of this under QLVideo Issue#3.  <comment231499> I should add that if Apple **does** add support for H.265 in the future then [QLVideo](https://github.com/Marginal/QLVideo) won't get in the way - it only supplies static QuickLook previews for content that QuickLookUI / AVFoundation can't handle. <comment260292> related: [QuickLook support for non-native video files (AVI, MKV) on Mavericks](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/114578/quick-look-support-for-non-native-video-files-avi-mkv-on-mavericks)
