MacBook Air mid 2011 Latest MacOS latest, using all 4GB of ram, and 140 mb of swap? <body> this continues after quitting ALL processes with automator, any thing else I can try?   <comment337757> I'd suggest don't worry about it.  140MB of swap isn't significant and won't affect your performance. <comment337759> Did you check Activity Monitor to see what's using it all? <comment337763> I checked, and it doesn't add up to more then 4gb. <comment337764> Are you viewing all processes, or just yours? Really we need a lot more info. <comment337767> how do I go about viewing all processes? sorry.. <comment337811> In Activity Monitor - CPU, it should show a list of all processes. <comment337901> That is what I am doing, I am listing all the processes
