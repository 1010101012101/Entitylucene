Write a script that installs a package file automatically with limited interaction from user <body> I'm trying to run a package installer from terminal and have it complete with limited interaction from the user. This will need to be ran on any computer.  The bash script I have so far is:  precodesudo installer -store -pkg "/Users/username/Desktop/test.pkg" -target / /code/pre  It will not complete and I am getting the following error: installer: Can't load package "/Users/username/Desktop/test.pkg": The requested URL was not found on this server.  Not sure what this error means as I'm a newbie to scripting. Please advise what is needed to fix this.  <answer246500> It is not possible to run any command using codesudo/code without user interaction because the user will have to supply an administrative password.  <comment303974> OK, that is fine. Any Idea how this script would complete with limited interaction? <comment303975> @MacMania How is the script being run? Also, is the .pkg file necessary? <comment303976> Script is being run via bash script and yes, the package is necessary. <comment303978> The man page recommends against using `-store` together with `sudo`, you probably don't need that option anyway as it is primarily intend to test package installation before submitting them to the store. Also the error message indicates that `installer` can't access the package file, is it in a place where `root` can access it? Also, does the package itself work, i.e. can you install it by double-clicking it in Finder? <comment303981> See the link I commented on your question. You might be getting the error because that username doesn't exist. Try using the `~` to get to the user folder instead of the absolute path. <comment304258> @patrix Did you delete my comment? <comment304273> @jsejcksn Your comment got deleted automatically by the system when I put this on hold for being a duplicate of the question your comment linked to. It is now shown on top of the question. <comment304283> @patrix Thanks for explaining. If that was in the SE site use documentation, I missed that part. <comment304290> @jsejcksn You'll probably find it documented somewhere on meta.stackexchange.com.
