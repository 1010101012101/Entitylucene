Long text-drag delay <body> Dragging text used to be instant. Now, especially after an application’s been open a few minutes, it takes forever from the time I press the mouse button on text until I can drag it. (If I try to drag it before the cursor changes form the text-insertion icon to an arrow, the text is deselected.) I’ve timed the delay a few times, and the longest one was about 35 seconds from mouse-down to cursor-change.  I started noticing this about six months ago. The only change to the system that I can think of that coincided even slightly was Yosemite. I’ve noticed it mostly in Scrivener, which is almost always where I drag text. But it also occurs in Calendar and Mail.   Closing the app and reopening it fixes it for a minute.  I’ve tried the Terminal command to eliminate the delay, and it seems to have no effect. (codedefaults write -g NSDragAndDropTextDelay -int 100/code)  I’ve also tried the Tinderbox adjustment.  What could this be?  <answer189114> I had the same in Scrivener. Just don't use the 0.1 second. 0.2 and up solved my problem so far. I made the adjustments with TinkerTools http://www.bresink.com/osx/TinkerTool.html  <comment218341> Could be that the app is paging to disk. I'd check Activity Monitor & see what's going on.
