how to export all clips in an imovie folder as a single movie? <body> I'm using iMovie 10.1.6 and am importing digital video cassettes, each into its own folder within iMovie Library. For each cassette, it breaks it into a series of clips, sorted in reverse chronological order. I want to save the whole thing into a single movie file (e.g., MOV or MP4 format).  Problem is when I select all the clips and drag into a new project, it puts them in reverse chron order. I've tried setting the sort order (View  Sort Clips By...) but regardless of ascending/descending setting, the dates shown for the clip groups are always reverse chron.  How can I easily do this? I don't want to drag every clip out manually to get in the right order. This seems pretty basic.  Thanks for your help.
