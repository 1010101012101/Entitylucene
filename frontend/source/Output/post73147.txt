Can iCloud notes be synced with different accounts? <body> Is it possible to synchronize notes with different accounts? For example, if I write something in my notes - my friend will open his notes with his account and see the change.  Is this possible?  <answer73158> strongNo/strong, iCloud was not meant to work that way.   Some emthird party/em Apps, though, will do exactly what you're looking for. AppCrawlr has got an interesting list, which might be worth looking at.  <comment206688> Just that this domain doesn't exist anymore.... <comment206713> @sorin Fixed! Changed to a more useful one. :)
