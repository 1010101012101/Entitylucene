Trash doesn't ask for confirmation even though option is enabled. (Tiger) <body> Well, as the title says when I try to empty the Trash in Tiger (10.4.11) it doesn't ask for confirmation before emptying. The option is enabled under the Finder preferences, yet it still doesn't. I've tried disabling and then re-enabling the option to see if it wasn't registered as checked, no change. I also tried unchecking it, to see if it was an aesthetic problem, but it still refused to confirm empties. I have ownership over the preferences file, and other preferences are effective, so I have no idea why this is occurring, but I'd rather not accidentally delete something I don't have a backup of, so if anyone has any insight it would be much appreciated.
