iPhone can not boot properly <body> The question is problem like and I'm looking for possible solutions.  I'm running 10.2 on SE. I was in airplane mode for a couple of days and when I turned cellular on it has rebooted and now it is booting to a state where it is still on apple logo, a computer can read it, but since iphone has a passcode, it can not be backed up. When hooked up it makes that chime sound of charging every 3 sec. So I have a passcoded iPhone which I can't enter knowing the passcode and I need to recover data and erase it then from iCloud.     ol liThe first idea is more of a hope that there is a chance to "fix" iOS and boot normally, because I haven't found any software that can do so without updating or restoring.  /li liSecond idea is to somehow enter or disable a passcode from a trusted computer to backup. Probably SSH or 3d party software.  /li liThird option is the most tricky and unwanted. Update to 10.3.2 (still signed by Apple), make a backup and downgrade to 10.2 using Prometheus with shsh2 blobs which I have saved earlier. But I'm not sure if iTunes will allow to restore an older firmware from a newer firmware backup. Moreover, I have read that there is only a chance of success with such downgrade. /li /ol  I've searched but haven't found any significant tips on how to recover data in my situation or how to fix booting. Probably there are other options that I haven't thought of.   <comment371555> Have you tried force rebooting (holding down power and home buttons for 10 seconds, until Apple logo comes back up)? Force rebooting will sometimes clear weird problems that normal rebooting doesnâ€™t. Failing that, is there any reason NOT to be on iOS 10.3.2, especially considering it patched a number of important security flaws? <comment371566> @NoahL rebooted like a hundred times, also tried entering DFU and recovery. The reason is jailbreak.
