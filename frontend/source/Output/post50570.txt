Is there a way to capture part of a screen in full screen mode? <body> I am playing a game that's called Bookworm on the Mac, and it runs in full screen mode.  If I press kbd⇧ shift/kbd+kbd⌘ cmd/kbd+kbd4/kbd to capture part of the screen, it won't work.  Usually, I can press kbdspace/kbd and click to capture the whole window, but that doesn't work, either.  kbd⇧ shift/kbd+kbd⌘ cmd/kbd+kbd3/kbd works to capture the whole screen, but I'd like to find out how to take a partial screenshot.  <answer50584> Just use kbdcommand/kbdkbdshift/kbdkbd4/kbd as usual. It just won't display its color overlay for the selection frame. The crosshair cursor should still show up and the screenshot should still be of the selected area.  <answer173515> Check SnappyApp - is a very useful tool for screenshots for Mac OS, more powerful than the system screen capture functionality and it's free.  <comment57976> cmd-shift-4 appears to work fine for me.  Tried in both iterm and itunes.  Could captured the selected rectangle just fine.  What happens when you hit cmd-shift-4 <comment204217> Welcome to Ask Different!
