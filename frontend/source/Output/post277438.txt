Disable GPU acceleration, Protect S/L/E kext from Software Update <body> I have a friend with a 2011 MacBook Pro with an unusual issue: his integrated Intel GPU causes graphics corruption and system hangs partway through the boot process. New RAM didn't help.  It does work fine in Safe Mode (without accelerated drivers loaded), or with the AMD discrete GPU, using the following workaround: we renamed the AppleIntelHD* kexts in S/L/E to disable acceleration so it could complete the boot, and then used gfxCardStatus to force the system to use the discrete GPU. This works nearly perfectly.  The only problem is that this approach doesn't survive Software Update, and it's a hassle to re-do it every update, especially with FileVault and System Integrity Protection.  I'm looking for a way to lock or block changes made to the kexts under S/L/E, preventing Software Updates from "fixing" the modified or removed kext. I would be grateful for any suggestions, including a different workaround that might survive updates.  <comment349188> This is kind of a pain, but an option. Copy the kext to somewhere like the desktop before the software updated reinsert it after the update is complete. <comment349191> You can also have the computer open a graphics intense application like photoshop on boot, so it automatically switches to discreet graphics, then you can replace the default with the discreet-only kext. <comment349365> @NoahL Thanks for the suggestions, but the system won't even successfully boot, unless I find a way to get rid of the Intel HD acceleration kext, and make certain it isn't replaced by a software update!
