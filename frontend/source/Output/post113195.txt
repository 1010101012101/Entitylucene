Using 2 themes in Keynote'13 <body> Ok, so I've choose "white" theme while creating a presentation. Can I somehow add slides from black theme? Or can I change theme of my presentation?  <answer113197> It doesn't look like you can do it in Keynote 2013 as Apple has removed this feature with this version.  An idea that you could do is to make a new Keynote file with the secondary theme that you want, copy the slide, and then paste the slide into your presentation.  <answer113307> Yep, you emcan/em change the theme of your Keynote presentation in Keynote '13:  ol liGo to the strongPresentation Setup Inspector/strong (View → Inspector → Presentation Setup).  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2knnS.png" width="150"/li liClick the strongPresentation/strong tab.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YbJzn.png" width="280"/li liClick strongChange Theme/strong.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/IsFZo.png" width="300"/li liSelect your new theme and click strongChoose/strong.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/v7odV.png" width="600"/li /ol  <comment133003> Yes, and this changes all the slides I already have to black. Won't do. The solution is how @unior117 wrote: new presentation and copy slides <comment133037> @Uko I was more answering the second part to your question: "Or can I change theme of my presentation?" <comment133057> Yes, you are right. Sorry if I was to harsh. The thing is that I thought that changing of theme won't change anything anyway, so I didn't include that in question. Thank you for your effort <comment133064> @Uko No problem :) I know it wasn't the answer you were looking for, but I thought it would help those that might have searched for your second question.
