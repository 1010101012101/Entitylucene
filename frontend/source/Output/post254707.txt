Delete iCloud account for gmail, use same gmail to make new account <body> I need to use my gmail to make a new iCloud account, but it looks like the gmail is taken. Even though I deleted the account from the gmail, the email is taken. So how do I completely remove this gmail from iCloud and reuse it again (for the same purpose)? Thank you.  <comment317112> Just to clarify, you used your gmail account to sign up for an AppleID and now you want to delete the account and get a new AppleID... with the same gmail email address? <comment317113> I know it sounds funny, but it's a long story. I forgot the iCloud password. <comment317135> You cannot re-use an email address without first freeing it from the existing account, & you cannot *delete* an iCloud account - so you're gonna have to find that password.
