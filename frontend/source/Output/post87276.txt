How do I make a window move to the left half of my screen and another window move to the right half? <body> On Windows 8, I type kbdwin/kbd + kbdleft/kbd and the current window becomes full-height and half the screen width and moves to the left. If I type kbdwin/kbd + kbdright/kbd, the current window does the same except moves to the right.  This is so incredibly helpful. Is there a mechanism to do the same for Macs?  <answer87279> You can try Cinch and SizeUp apps to do that.  http://www.irradiatedsoftware.com/sizeup/  http://www.irradiatedsoftware.com/cinch/  <comment102080> This looks perfect. Is there a free alternative? <comment102187> I do not know any free apps, but the app DoublePane cost $4.99. It's same as Cinch or BetterSnapTool at just $1.99.                                                       https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bettersnaptool/id417375580?mt=12                                                       http://5amcode.com/ <comment102211> I ended up with Spectacle, seems to work perfect and is free.
