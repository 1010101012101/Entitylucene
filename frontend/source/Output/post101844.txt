MacBook Pro 2008 Aluminum - keyboard problems <body> I have a late 2008 Macbook Pro all aluminum.  The green caps lock light comes on intermittently: sometimes solid, sometimes flashing. When it comes on, the arrow pointer gets stuck and the screen freezes, or if I'm typing it will stick on a letter and keep repeating it.  Any ideas? â€¦or is it a keyboard replacement?  <answer101845> You could try blasting the dirt from under it (accumulated over Years) with a dust can available in computer stores.  If you feel like a DIY then look here for instructions how to replace keyboard.  <answer101852> Try an external usb or wireless keyboard.  If it works ok, then most likely you internal keyboard is damaged and needs repair or replacement.
