How do I share an existing album? <body> I took a bunch of photos on vacation and saved them into an album in the Photos app on iOS 9.  I'd like to now share that album.  Is there a way to do this other than creating a new shared album and manually adding the individual pictures?  I've looked at the instructions here and they don't describe any way to share an already created album.  The photos are backed up on iCloud, and I can access them via iCloud.com, but there doesn't appear to be a way to even create a new shared album on iCloud.com.  <answer249798> You do have to create a new shared album, but you can create the album from the contents of the existing album so you don't need to find the images again manually.  ol liOpen the album./li liChoose Select in the top right, then Select All in the top left./li liTap Share in the bottom left, then create a new iCloud Photo Sharing album as usual./li /ol  Once you've created the shared album, you can delete the old album.
