Can I use 2 different Apple IDs with a single install of iTunes? <body> I just got an iPhone 5 at work, and have discovered the only way to get a different ringtone on the device is via iTunes.  However, work will not allow iTunes to be downloaded to Corporate PCs.  I have iTunes at home, and wanted to know if I logged off iTunes with my personal Apple ID and logged in with my work Apple ID, could I add a ringtone to iTunes and then sync it to my work phone.  I have no interest in using any personal music or apps on the work phone, so I don't need/want to authorize media on another device.  I just want to get a darn non-standard ringtone on my iPhone.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.  <answer82862> Yes, you can log in with multiple iTunes accounts. Log out of one, log in with the other.   <answer82865> Yes, you can.

So simple lol. Never realized it. Good tip. <comment95543> Perhaps this could be improved a little? Could you explain a little more the process of changing accounts in iTunes and such. While this answers the question directly, I think a little more explanation for future visitors would be great.
