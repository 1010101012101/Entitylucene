Is it possible to restore songs from an iPod to iTunes? <body> I have a 160 GB iPod Classic and a Windows 7 desktop with iTunes containing roughly about 13,000 songs. My external hard drive containing all the songs crashed but I managed as long as all the songs' file names were in iTunes and when the iPod syncronised with iTunes, the songs remained on the iPod. Recently I had my computer reinstalled and iTunes was formatted and wiped clean, now if I sync my iPod I know my iPod will be wiped clean as well.  So is it possible to recover songs which are there — on the iPod — but not in iTunes or the desktop?  <answer113808> Yes it is possible to transfer you audio/video files from your iPod to your Desktop.

Here is a long list: https://discussions.apple.com/docs/DOC-3991  There should be several free ways to do this including this one: http://download.cnet.com/PhoneTrans/3000-18553_4-75736709.html  Many advertising free downloads but are crippled and will only allow a few songs at a time.  I don't use windows so I cannot recommend one or the other but I would not pay for something you can find for free if you just look a little bit.  Good Luck
