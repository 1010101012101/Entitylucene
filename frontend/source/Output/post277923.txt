AirPods choppy/unreliable when connected to Mac, but not iPhone <body> h1Problem/h1  In my apartment, when using the AirPods with my Mac, the audio is significantly choppy, fluttery and unreliable. There are frequently small "pops" when listening to music. The issue is not present when using the AirPods with my iPhone.  The Apple Stack Exchange question you are reading now, is actually an update to my question on the same topic that was posted and resolved here previously. I had this very same issue while on macOS Sierra 10.12.4. We found out that the culprit was a bug introduced in that particular macOS version, and the problem went away with 10.12.5.  I am now on 10.12.6 and having a quite identical problem. But I'm not confident that the OS is at fault this time.  The reason is that I recently swapped my AirPods for a new pair, via an unrelated Apple support ticket. The new ones arrived via mail and I was instructed to pair them with my original case.  The new pair of AirPods seem significantly more prone to skipping, stuttering and losing connection. I did not have this problem with my original AirPods, which I also used with 10.12.6 without problems (at least that I am cognizant of).  h1Possible explanation/h1  I think I have found what's causing the skipping (albeit not the root cause), and it seems to be my strongiPhone Bluetooth signalling with its environment/strong. Whenever that happens, there is a glitch/pop on the Mac ←→ AirPod connection. When I disable Bluetooth on the iPhone, the problems go away.  I haven't changed anything in my environment except swapping the AirPods. No microwave in the background etc.   I am quite confident that the reason is Bluetooth interaction from the iPhone. I am just not sure how to proceed, because the weird thing is that the problems started just when I replaced the AirPods for a new pair.  strongSome plausible root causes are:/strong  ul liThe new AirPods are in fact defect or come from a batch that are not as 'good' with Bluetooth./li limacOS 10.12.6 introduced a bug similar to the one in macOS 10.12.4, but I didn't realize it until much later (not that likely IMO, knowing how sensitive I am to audio quality)./li liThe pairing process whereby new AirPod buds were paired with an original case didn't go exactly right, and there is a firmware or software problem somewhere./li /ul  h1What I have tried/h1  ul li'Hard Reset' of the AirPods according to these instructions;/li liResetting the iPhone Network Settings after "Forgetting this device" (the AirPods) as part of the AirPod 'Hard Reset'./li liResetting the Mac Bluetooth Module according to these instructions./li /ul  hr  h1emEdit/em: Problem 'gone'/h1  The issue has suddenly gone away. I'm not that satisfied though, because I don't know emwhy/em.  I emthink/em the reason may be that I, unbeknownst to this issue, Bluetooth-unpaired my iPhone from a emthird/em computer (an iMac in my apartment). Since it seems the problem was that the iPhone's Bluetooth communication with other devices was causing the interference, it might make sense that unpairing the iPhone and the third computer made the issue go away. I still haven't re-paired the iPhone with that third computer, so I don't know if doing so will reintroduce the issue.  For now, I'm accepting the answer that resetting the Bluetooth interface emmay/em be the best solution to emtry/em. It might also be a good idea to Hard Reset the AirPods and perhaps reset the Network Settings of the iPhone.  <answer278017> If all else fails you can reset both the macOS Bluetooth Device List and Bluetooth Controller. However, this will reset strongall/strong connected Bluetooth devices, including a keyboard and mouse.  strongIn other words, this will remove all existing pairing information for Bluetooth devices, so each will need to be reconnected./strong  Before commencing, you will need to have the Bluetooth icon showing in the menu bar. If it is not there, open System Preferences  Bluetooth and enable the option emShow Bluetooth in Menu Bar/em.  strongResetting the macOS Bluetooth Device List and Bluetooth Controller/strong  Follow these steps:  ol liHold down both the kbdShift/kbd and kbdOption/kbd keys and at the same time click on the Bluetooth icon in the menu bar.

As per AppleInsider:     Monday's macOS 10.12.4 update is resulting in stuttering audio for   some users of USB headsets, according to multiple complaint threads on   Apple's support forums and reports from social media.      The glitch doesn't appear to be linked to a single Mac model or   headset brand, and many troubleshooting methods —like resetting   hardware or changing USB ports —don't seem to work. People reporting   the problem have noted that the issue isn't solved by a clean   reinstall of macOS 10.12.4, and only seems to vanish after restoring   to 10.12.3 or an earlier OS.   You may have to revert to 10.12.3, or wait for Apple to deploy a fix.  <comment349959> Thanks Monomeeth – I tried this but it didn't help. I've done some more research and updated the question. <comment350003> If you've upgraded to macOS Sierra 10.12.4, there appears to be Bluetooth audio issues that are only resolved by downgrading to 10.12.3 until Apple pushes a new driver update. <comment350307> That's probably it. I will accept your answer if a forthcoming OS update resolves the issue. <comment350310> Anecdote: My temporary solution is to use [Airfoil](https://rogueamoeba.com/airfoil/) to transmit audio from my Mac to my iPhone, to which my AirPods are paired. Works fine except for a slight latency, but good for playing music from the computer /w AirPods without choppyness. <comment357536> I had the same problem with 12.3 and also with 12.4 now. I can not get rid of it no matter what I do. <comment357537> Anyone had solve this ? <comment357538> macOS Sierra 10.12.5 isn't too far away, so hopefully it'll be resolved with that release. If you can't wait, or you're interested in getting involved with Apple's beta program, you can read more [here](https://beta.apple.com/sp/betaprogram/). <comment357733> Updating to macOS 12.5 solved this issue for me. <comment357984> @Winterflags You may recall I mentioned a couple of days back that _macOS Sierra 10.12.5 isn't too far away_. Well, it's now available, so I recommend you update to that and see whether your particular audio issues are resolved. Good luck! <comment370685> The issues are back. I swapped my AirPods for a new pair due to an unrelated Apple Support Ticket, and the new pair is extremely susceptible to Bluetooth interference from my iPhone. Turning Off Bluetooth on iPhone reduces the problems significantly, but that's not a long-term option. Nothing changed in my environment, except that I upgraded to macOS 10.12.6 recently, but that was before swapping the AirPods, and I didn't notice anything with the old pair under 10.12.6. Might be that the pair is faulty or 10.12.6 introduced a new bug? <comment370686> I saw your other Question. I got the impression it was a defective pair of AirPods that you got as replacements. This happens—I’ve had a refurbished iPad Air 2 completely die on me after 3 weeks; my first replacement WATCH had a dent in it; and a refurbished iPad 2 had a sticky Home button. I don’t think this is a knock on refurbished or replacement devices in general—brand new devices also have manufacturing defects. Certainly if you updated to 10.12.6 and it was fine until the replacements came in, I’d say it’s the replacement AirPods. <comment370700> @Phong I'm tempted to agree with you. I'm opening this question again just to make sure that we can rule out other problems. I feel that I need to be prepared before contacting Apple Support again, I'm sure they will not be happy with replacing my replacement AirPods... I've added a bounty to this question however so if no new solutions arise I will re-accept your answer later. <comment370702> Sure thing; I appreciate the heads up. Good luck!
